## Question

what effect can imuran have on CBC

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what effect Imuran (azathioprine) can have on the complete blood count (CBC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's mechanism and why it targets bone marrow. Then, I should detail which CBC parameters change and how often. Next, I will evaluate key risk modifiers, including dose, genetics, drug interactions, and comorbidities. After that, I should set out practical monitoring and management thresholds. Finally, I need to synthesize clinical significance, including early risk periods and long-term safety considerations, aligning with regulatory labeling and GI guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology because this underpins the hematologic effects. Azathioprine is a thiopurine immunosuppressant often described as being metabolized by TPMT to its active form, 6‑mercaptopurine (6‑MP); wait, let me verify and correct that because it is imprecise: azathioprine is nonenzymatically converted to 6‑MP, after which TPMT largely inactivates 6‑MP via methylation while hypoxanthine‑guanine phosphoribosyltransferase shunts it to active 6‑thioguanine nucleotides that impair DNA replication in rapidly dividing cells, including hematopoietic precursors, which explains bone marrow suppression on CBC [^114F1Ze9] [^116iiR8b].

> I will now examine the principal hematologic toxicity. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm that the dominant risk is myelosuppression across lineages. FDA labeling repeatedly emphasizes dose‑related bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia (including macrocytic anemia), and potential pancytopenia, with delayed suppression possible weeks after initiation or dose changes and higher incidence reported in transplant compared with rheumatology populations [^116iiR8b] [^1128MaQM] [^113mAYUQ].

> Next, I should review which CBC elements are most commonly affected and how. Leukopenia is the most frequent change, often via neutropenia, which elevates infection risk; rates vary by cohort, with dose‑dependent leukopenia up to roughly a quarter in some series and thrombocytopenia in a smaller fraction, consistent with marrow suppression dynamics and infection susceptibility emphasized in labeling and reviews [^1128MaQM] [^113Y2qwU]. Let me double‑check severity definitions so I use consistent cut points: severe leukopenia/neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are commonly defined with thresholds such as WBC less than 3.5 × 10⁹/L, ANC less than 1.5 × 10⁹/L, and platelets less than 100 × 10⁹/L, with neutropenia less than 1.0 × 10⁹/L typically prompting urgent action; I should confirm that these are WHO‑aligned criteria used in thiopurine safety studies, which they are [^113r7jJV]. Anemia can be macrocytic or normocytic and reflects lineage‑nonspecific marrow suppression documented in the product label [^1128MaQM].

> But wait, what about timing and the early hazard window? I should confirm when severe events cluster. Severe leukopenia and neutropenia are enriched in the first 8 weeks, with median transitions from normal counts to severe neutropenia in about two weeks in IBD cohorts, justifying very frequent early monitoring and vigilance for abrupt drops; beyond three months, severe events are less frequent but not absent, necessitating ongoing surveillance [^117PEgVS]. Delayed marrow suppression after dose escalations is also described, so I need to ensure counts are rechecked after any adjustment [^116iiR8b].

> Now, I need to assess dose and patient‑related risk factors. Hematologic toxicity is dose‑related, but hold on, I should verify any hard thresholds; while many clinicians regard doses above 2–2.5 mg/kg/day as higher risk, the FDA label emphasizes dose dependency without a strict cutoff, so I will avoid an artificial threshold and instead stress titration to tolerance with close CBCs [^1128MaQM]. I should confirm genetics next: TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency substantially increases risk for early, profound, and potentially life‑threatening myelosuppression; testing can guide initial dosing or avoidance, but cannot replace CBC monitoring because other factors contribute to toxicity; NUDT15 variants are particularly influential in East Asian populations and prospective testing reduces leukopenia there [^111XFRE5] [^114MffDY] [^113zLV41] [^112uVHdv].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions that amplify marrow toxicity. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease thiopurine inactivation; with allopurinol, azathioprine dose should generally be cut to about one‑third to one‑fourth, and concomitant febuxostat is not recommended owing to marked exposure increases; I should verify that both labeling and clinical guidance align, which they do [^114P9WiX]. Ribavirin inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, driving accumulation of myelotoxic thiopurine metabolites and has caused severe, reversible pancytopenia within 3–7 weeks when combined; weekly early CBCs are recommended if unavoidable, and combined re‑challenge is discouraged after pancytopenia [^111hTnn2] [^116x2xiU]. Additionally, mesalamine and other 5‑ASA products can add myelotoxic risk when co‑administered with thiopurines, mandating closer CBC monitoring, as reflected across multiple 5‑ASA labels [^113ReTUq] [^113hNYjR] [^116XRrMc] [^1146JTT8].

> I need to check clinical context modifiers. Renal dysfunction reduces thiopurine clearance; dose reductions of approximately 25% for eGFR 10–50 mL/min/1.73 m² and 50% for eGFR less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m² are recommended with intensified count monitoring, and oliguric post‑transplant states can heighten sensitivity, all of which necessitate conservative dosing and vigilant labs [^113h6HTc] [^116zrcEk] [^114MffDY]. I should confirm baseline cytopenias are a red flag; labeling advises against continuing therapy with persistently low counts and to reduce or hold for rapid falls, and many clinical trials excluded patients with WBC less than 3.0 × 10⁹/L at baseline, which is a practical caution even if not a labeled absolute threshold [^116iiR8b] [^117KPW9H].

> Next, I should review the monitoring cadence and what to do after dose changes. FDA labeling consistently recommends weekly CBCs, including platelets, during the first month, twice monthly during months two and three, then monthly thereafter, with more frequent checks if the dose changes or other therapies are added; GI guidelines also endorse early intensive monitoring at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, then at least every 12 weeks, reflecting that toxicity can occur at any time; co‑administration with ribavirin warrants the weekly–twice monthly–monthly sequence as well [^116iiR8b] [^113mAYUQ] [^113Bof4A] [^111hTnn2].

> Hold on, I should verify reversibility and concrete management steps. Most cytopenias improve after dose reduction or stopping azathioprine; in reported peg‑interferon/ribavirin co‑exposure pancytopenia, counts normalized over 4–6 weeks after stopping both agents, and did not recur when either was reintroduced alone, supporting reversibility once the offending combination or dose is removed; if severe myelosuppression occurs, evaluate for TPMT/NUDT15 deficiency to guide future dosing or avoidance [^116x2xiU] [^111XFRE5] [^114MffDY]. Let me consider practical thresholds, acknowledging variability by institution: many clinicians hold azathioprine and recheck within a week when WBC falls below about 3.5 × 10⁹/L or platelets below about 100 × 10⁹/L and discontinue promptly for ANC less than 1.0 × 10⁹/L, using supportive care per local protocols; I should note these thresholds mirror WHO‑aligned definitions used in thiopurine safety studies even though the label does not specify exact numbers, while the label clearly directs prompt reduction or withdrawal for rapid or persistent leukopenia [^113r7jJV] [^116iiR8b].

> I should confirm a frequent misconception next: does leukopenia correlate with therapeutic efficacy, and should we "treat to leukopenia"? The FDA label explicitly states leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect and clinicians should not increase the dose to lower WBC intentionally; observational data in IBD similarly show that relative leukopenia does not reliably predict response, so dose‑exposure optimization and metabolite monitoring, not intentional marrow suppression, should guide therapy [^116iiR8b] [^112CWjJu] [^114xPvwC].

> Finally, I need to consider the broader safety context. Early myelosuppression risk is front‑loaded in the first 8 weeks, justifying the intensive early CBC schedule; long‑term, chronic immunosuppression carries increased risks of infection and malignancy, including post‑transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and hepatosplenic T‑cell lymphoma emphasized in the boxed warning, and rare associations with therapy‑related MDS/AML have been reported with prolonged exposure and high cumulative doses; I should double‑check that these malignancy signals, while uncommon, are consistently flagged across regulatory and clinical literature, which they are [^117PEgVS] [^112gCqXv] [^115SXrUa]. One more nuance: concurrent systemic corticosteroids can confound lymphocyte counts and infection risk profiles during early thiopurine therapy, so I should interpret mild lymphopenia in that context and not miss clinically significant neutropenia or trends downward in total WBC [^116bweTa].

> Bottom line, azathioprine causes dose‑dependent, lineage‑nonspecific bone marrow suppression that can present as leukopenia/neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or pancytopenia, with the highest risk in the first 8 weeks and after dose changes; risk is amplified by TPMT/NUDT15 deficiency, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, ribavirin, 5‑ASA co‑therapy, and renal dysfunction; toxicity is usually reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation; genetic testing can inform dosing but never replaces systematic CBC monitoring per label and guidelines; and clinicians should not chase leukopenia as a surrogate for efficacy [^116iiR8b] [^113Bof4A] [^113zLV41] [^111hTnn2].

---

Imuran (azathioprine) can cause **dose-dependent bone marrow suppression** [^116iiR8b] with leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, and, rarely, pancytopenia [^1128MaQM]. Risk is higher [^111XFRE5] with TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and with concomitant allopurinol/febuxostat or ribavirin/interferon [^114P9WiX] [^111hTnn2] [^116x2xiU]. For **CBC monitoring**, perform weekly checks for the first month, then every 2–4 weeks, and monthly thereafter; reduce the dose or stop if counts fall [^116iiR8b] [^113mAYUQ].

---

## Hematologic effects on CBC

Azathioprine **suppresses hematopoiesis** [^116iiR8b], reducing leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet production; effects are dose-related and may be severe [^1128MaQM].

---

### Leukopenia and neutropenia

Leukopenia is common and dose-dependent; **severe leukopenia (< 1.0 × 10⁹/L)** [^117PEgVS] can occur, particularly early [^116iiR8b]. Neutropenia is also common and increases infection risk, and severe cases can be **life-threatening** [^117PEgVS] [^116iiR8b].

---

### Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia is dose-dependent [^116iiR8b] and may occur later; **severe thrombocytopenia (< 20 × 10⁹/L)** can cause bleeding [^117PEgVS].

---

### Anemia

Anemia may be macrocytic or bleeding-related [^1128MaQM]; rarely, **pancytopenia** occurs [^116iiR8b].

---

### Pancytopenia

Pancytopenia is rare [^116iiR8b] but severe and may be **life-threatening**, requiring immediate action [^1128MaQM].

---

## Risk factors for hematologic toxicity

Several factors **increase the risk** of azathioprine-induced cytopenias:

- **Genetic polymorphisms**: TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency [^111XFRE5] increases risk of severe myelosuppression [^114P9WiX] [^112uVHdv].
- **Drug interactions**: Allopurinol, febuxostat [^114P9WiX], ribavirin [^111hTnn2], and interferon increase myelotoxicity risk [^116x2xiU].
- **Renal impairment**: Reduced clearance increases toxicity risk [^114MffDY] [^116zrcEk].

---

## Recommended monitoring guidelines

Regular **CBC monitoring is critical** for early detection and management of cytopenias [^113Bof4A]:

| **Monitoring schedule** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Initial phase (first month) | Weekly [^116iiR8b] [^111XFRE5] |
| Second and third months | Every 2–4 weeks [^116iiR8b] [^111XFRE5] |
| Long-term maintenance | Monthly or more frequently if dose changes or abnormalities occur [^116iiR8b] [^111XFRE5] |

---

Dose adjustment entails **reducing the dose or stopping therapy** [^116iiR8b] if rapid or persistent leukopenia or other marrow depression occurs [^111XFRE5]. Genetic testing should be considered for **TPMT/NUDT15** [^111XFRE5] in severe myelosuppression; adjust the dose or use alternatives if deficient [^114P9WiX] [^112uVHdv].

---

## Clinical management of abnormal CBC results

- **Mild cytopenias**: Reduce dose and monitor closely [^116iiR8b].
- **Severe cytopenias**: Stop azathioprine immediately; consider supportive care (e.g. growth factors, transfusions) [^111XFRE5].
- **Persistent abnormalities**: Stop azathioprine and consider alternatives (e.g. methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, biologics) [^113Bof4A] [^116v2Dex].

---

## Long-term hematologic risks

Malignancy risk is increased with chronic immunosuppression [^112gCqXv], including **lymphoma** and other cancers. Therapy-related **MDS/AML** is rare but has been reported with prolonged use [^115SXrUa].

---

Imuran can cause **dose-dependent bone marrow suppression** [^116iiR8b] with leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and, rarely, pancytopenia. Risk is higher with TPMT/NUDT15 deficiency [^112uVHdv], interacting drugs [^114P9WiX], or renal impairment [^114MffDY]. CBC monitoring is essential to detect cytopenias early and guide **dose reduction or discontinuation** [^113Bof4A] [^111XFRE5].

### Azathioprine sodium [^116iiR8b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Cytopenias**: Severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemias including macrocytic anemia, and/or pancytopenia may occur in patients being treated with azathioprine. Severe bone marrow suppression may also occur. Hematologic toxicities are dose-related and may be more severe in renal transplant patients whose homograft is undergoing rejection. It is suggested that patients on azathioprine have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary. Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression. Leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect; therefore, the dose should not be increased intentionally to lower the white blood cell count.

- **TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency**: Patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency may be at an increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of azathioprine (see Clinical Pharmacology). Death associated with pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine. In patients with severe myelosuppression, consider evaluation for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency (see Precautions: Laboratory Tests). Consider alternative therapy in patients with homozygous TPMT deficiency.

### Azathioprine sodium [^1128MaQM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The principal and potentially serious toxic effects of azathioprine are hematologic and gastrointestinal. The risks of secondary infection and malignancy are also significant (see WARNINGS). The frequency and severity of adverse reactions depend on the dose and duration of azathioprine, as well as on the patient's underlying disease or concomitant therapies. The incidence of hematologic toxicities and neoplasia encountered in groups of renal homograft recipients is significantly higher than that in studies employing azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis. The relative incidences in clinical studies are summarized below:

- **Hematologic**: Leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia are dose-dependent and may occur late in the course of therapy with azathioprine. Dose reduction or temporary withdrawal may result in the reversal of these toxicities. Infection may occur as a secondary manifestation of bone marrow suppression or leukopenia, but the incidence of infection in renal homotransplantation is 30 to 60 times that in rheumatoid arthritis. Anemias, including macrocytic anemia and/or bleeding, have been reported.

	- Patients with low or absent TPMT or NUDT15 activity are at increased risk for severe, life-threatening myelosuppression from azathioprine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS: Cytopenias and PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea and vomiting may occur within the first few months of therapy with azathioprine and occurred in approximately 12% of 676 rheumatoid arthritis patients. The frequency of gastric disturbance is significant.

### Ribavirin [^111hTnn2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use of ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients receiving azathioprine has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine-related myelotoxicity. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to the accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate (6-MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

---

### Azasan [^114P9WiX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider genotyping or phenotyping patients for TPMT deficiency and genotyping for NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. TPMT and NUDT15 testing cannot substitute for complete blood count (CBC) monitoring in patients receiving Azasan. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions.

- **Drug interactions**: Use with xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors: One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by XO inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat). Patients receiving Azasan and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of Azasan to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose. Concomitant use of Azasan with febuxostat is not recommended. Inhibition of XO may cause increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or its metabolite, 6-MP, leading to toxicity. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving Azasan and xanthine oxidase inhibitors because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected.

### SPL drug information for azathioprine [^113mAYUQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (n.d.). High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of azathioprine IV (also known as Imuran, Azasan):

- **Hematologic disorders**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and/or pancytopenia may occur with azathioprine. Monitor CBC weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage changes occur. Use caution in patients with TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Consider obtaining genotyping or phenotyping for TPMT deficiency and genotyping for NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. Consider offering alternative therapy in patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with heterozygous deficiency because of the increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity.

- **Increased serum azathioprine levels**: Use caution in patients taking allopurinol. Reduce azathioprine dose by 66–75%. Also, use caution in patients taking aminosalicylates.

- **Opportunistic infections**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as immunosuppressants increase the risk of bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and opportunistic infections, including reactivation of latent infections.

- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as immunosuppressants, including azathioprine, have been associated with an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

### SPL drug information for azathioprine [^112gCqXv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warning regarding the use of azathioprine IV (also known as Imuran, Azasan) and malignancy: maintain a high level of suspicion, as chronic immunosuppression increases the risk of malignancy, and azathioprine has been associated with an increased risk of post-transplant and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113Bof4A]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

- **Thiopurine toxicity**: We recommend that IBD patients initiating thiopurine or methotrexate therapy should have baseline full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U&E), and liver function tests (LFT) measurement, with monitoring at least during weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Thereafter, monitoring should occur at least every 3 months for side effects (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence, Agreement: 100%).

TPMT testing will only predict a proportion of early hematological toxicity on thiopurines, and no pretreatment test will rule out future biochemical toxicity on a thiopurine. Hence, early intensive monitoring for hematological and biochemical toxicity is recommended in all patients, with blood tests for full blood count, renal, and liver biochemistry at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy, followed by ongoing 12-weekly blood monitoring as toxicity can occur at any stage. Blood tests should be repeated 2 weeks after all dose increases. In a Spanish nationwide database study of nearly 4000 patients, the cumulative incidence of thiopurine side effects was 26%. Nausea was seen in 8%, hepatotoxicity in 4%, myelotoxicity in 4%, and pancreatitis in 4% (pancreatitis occurring more often in Crohn's than ulcerative colitis, and more likely if also taking prednisolone). While a genetic predictor of thiopurine-induced pancreatitis has recently been discovered (the HLA-DQA1✱02:01-HLA-DRB1✱07:01 haplotype), routine screening is not considered cost-effective at present.

In patients with side effects to azathioprine, potential strategies include split dosing, a switch to mercaptopurine, and use of low-dose thiopurine/allopurinol.

### SPL drug information for azathioprine [^116zrcEk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of azathioprine PO (also known as Imuran, Azasan) in patients with eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m²:

- **Reduce dose**: Reduce the dose by 50%.
- **Monitor counts**: Monitor platelet counts and white cell counts.
- **Monitor 6-mercaptopurine levels**: Monitor 6-mercaptopurine levels in patients with low urate clearance.

### Azathioprine sodium [^114MffDY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe bone marrow toxicities. Early drug discontinuation may be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction.

- **Homozygous deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15**: Because of the risk of increased toxicity, consider alternative therapies for patients who are known to have TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency.

- **Heterozygous deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15**: Because of the risk of increased toxicity, dosage reduction is recommended in patients known to have a heterozygous deficiency of TPMT or NUDT15. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency may require more substantial dosage reductions.

- **Use in renal dysfunction**: Relatively oliguric patients, especially those with tubular necrosis in the immediate postcadaveric transplant period, may have delayed clearance of azathioprine or its metabolites. Such patients may be particularly sensitive to this drug and are usually given lower doses.

- **Parenteral administration**: Add 10 mL of sterile water for injection and swirl until a clear solution results. This solution, equivalent to 100 mg azathioprine, is for intravenous use only; it has a pH of approximately 9.6 and it should be used within 24 hours.

### Implementation of NUDT15 genotyping to prevent azathioprine-induced leukopenia for patients with autoimmune disorders in Chinese population [^112uVHdv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

- **Study highlights**:
	- **What is the knowledge on the topic?**:
		Azathioprine (AZA) may cause leukopenia, which hinders its clinical use. Genetic TPMT variants (e.g. TPMT*2, *3A, and *3C) are associated with AZA‐induced leukopenia in Western populations. However, the prevalence of these variants is exceptionally low (< 1%) in Asian populations. A strong association between NUDT15 variants and AZA‐induced leukopenia has been reported in Asian patients.

	- **What question did this study address?**:
		The strength of genetic NUDT15 and TPMT associations and which genetic variant would be appropriate for prospective screening before AZA treatment in the Chinese population remains unclear.

	- **What does this study add to our knowledge?**:
		The genetic NUDT15 R139C variant showed the strongest association and highest sensitivity for patients with AZA‐induced leukopenia in the Chinese population. Prospective genetic testing of the NUDT15 R139C variant before AZA use can significantly decrease the incidence of AZA‐induced leukopenia.

### Ribavirin [^116x2xiU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Concomitant administration of azathioprine**: Pancytopenia, characterized by marked decreases in red blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets, as well as bone marrow suppression, have been reported to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine. In this limited cohort of patients (n = 8), myelotoxicity was found to be reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine. Importantly, it did not recur upon the reintroduction of either treatment alone. It is recommended to discontinue PegIntron, ribavirin, and azathioprine for cases of pancytopenia and to avoid reintroducing pegylated interferon/ribavirin with concomitant azathioprine [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

- **Impact on growth in pediatric patients**: Data on the effects of PegIntron and ribavirin on growth is derived from an open-label study involving subjects aged 3 through 17 years, where changes in weight and height were compared to U.S. normative population data. Generally, the weight and height gains in pediatric subjects treated with PegIntron and ribavirin lagged behind those predicted by normative population data throughout the treatment duration. Severely inhibited growth velocity (less than the 3rd percentile) was observed in 70% of the subjects during treatment. Post-treatment, most subjects experienced rebound growth and weight gain. However, long-term follow-up data indicate that PegIntron in combination therapy with ribavirin may result in growth inhibition, potentially leading to reduced adult height in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Imuran [^111XFRE5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and administration:

TPMT testing cannot substitute for complete blood count (CBC) monitoring in patients receiving Imuran. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can be used to identify patients with absent or reduced TPMT activity. Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life-threatening myelotoxicity from Imuran if conventional doses are given. Physicians may consider alternative therapies for patients who have low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for non-functional alleles). Imuran should be administered with caution to patients having one non-functional allele (heterozygous), who are at risk for reduced TPMT activity that may lead to toxicity if conventional doses are given. Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with reduced TPMT activity. Early drug discontinuation may be considered for patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction.

- **Renal homotransplantation**: The dose of Imuran required to prevent rejection and minimize toxicity will vary with individual patients; this necessitates careful management. The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg/kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant. Imuran is usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation. Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg/kg daily is usually possible. The dose of Imuran should not be increased to toxic levels because of threatened rejection. Discontinuation may be necessary for severe hematologic or other toxicity, even if rejection of the homograft.

### ACG clinical guideline: Management of Crohn's disease in adults [^116v2Dex]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Crohn's disease, specifically with respect to maintenance therapy and medically induced remission, the ACG 2025 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of azathioprine (1.5–2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6-mercaptopurine (0.75–1.5 mg/kg/day) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderate-to-severely active Crohn's disease who achieved remission with corticosteroids.

### Azathioprine: Association with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia [^115SXrUa]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Azathioprine is widely used in patients with autoimmune diseases and after organ allografting. A recognized carcinogen, azathioprine is also associated with the development of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML).

- **Methods**: In 56 reported cases, azathioprine had been administered for a median of 65 months (range 6–192) to a median cumulative dose of 146 g (range 19–750) before t-MDS/AML developed.

- **Results**: In 11 patients, repeated episodes of cytopenias developed during azathioprine therapy, ante-dating the development of t-MDS/AML. In 33 cases with successful karyotypic analysis, 26 cases (79%) showed monosomy 7, deletion of the long arm of chromosomes 7 and 5, and rearrangement of chromosome 11q23. These changes were cytogenetic hallmarks of MDS/AML secondary to known leukemogenic agents and radiotherapy.

- **Conclusion**: The observations implicate azathioprine as a leukemogenic agent. It will be prudent to review the need for azathioprine therapy when unexpected cytopenias occur and prescription has been prolonged.

### Timing of myelosuppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease: Implications for monitoring recommendations [^117PEgVS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Thiopurines, such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, can induce life-threatening myelosuppression. This study determined the frequency, timing, and outcomes of mild and severe myelosuppression after the initiation of thiopurine therapy.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study included patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were new users of thiopurines. Those tested for thiopurine methyltransferase levels before therapy were excluded. Patients were followed from their first thiopurine prescription until the earliest of severe leukopenia (a white blood cell count < 1.0 × 10⁹/L), severe thrombocytopenia (platelet level < 20 × 10⁹/L), end of therapy, first gap in therapy, disenrollment, or December 31, 2006.

- **Results**: Among 1997 new users, the incidence of severe leukopenia per 100 person-months was 0.16 (95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.29; n = 6) in weeks 0 to 8, 0.00 in weeks 9 to 24, and 0.01 (95% CI, 0–0.03; n = 3) after week 26 of therapy. The incidence of severe neutropenia and severe thrombocytopenia per 100 person-months during the first 8 weeks of therapy was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31–0.80; n = 19) and 0.08 (95% CI, 0.02–0.23; n = 3), respectively. During the first 8 weeks, the median duration from a normal white blood cell count to severe leukopenia was 13 days (range, 8–26 days) and to severe neutropenia was 14 days (range, 7–23 days).

- **Conclusions**: The high incidence of severe myelosuppression justifies frequent monitoring during the first 8 weeks of therapy. Subsequently, the rate of severe myelosuppression and the proportion of patients who pr

### The adverse effect profile of oral azathioprine in pediatric atopic dermatitis, and recommendations for monitoring [^113r6PSo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

It is interesting that in our subset of children, for whom detailed records were available, twice as many boys as girls received azathioprine for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). In a recent epidemiologic study of pediatric AD in the United Kingdom, girls were more commonly affected than boys, but boys were less likely to apply emollients. It may be that the sex difference observed in our study is not a true difference in severity, but related to difficulty implementing first- and second-line therapies. There were no differences in adverse effects between the sexes.

Our practice for monitoring azathioprine therapy is as follows:

- **Pretreatment**: Blood tests are conducted, and advice on sun avoidance and protection is provided. The presence of any cutaneous viral infections is recorded. If the TPMT level is undetectable, azathioprine is not prescribed. If a polymorphism carrier level is detected, an appropriate reduction in dosage is implemented, commencing at 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/d. Local guidelines for varicella exposure are followed.

- **Standard blood monitoring**: CBC and hepatic transaminases are monitored at weeks 1, 3, and 7 after commencing azathioprine, and every 3 months thereafter, unless there is a breach of blood parameters.

- **Definition of a breach of blood parameters**: A breach is defined as a neutrophil count less than 1.0, lymphocyte count less than or equal to 0.5, or alanine aminotransferase greater than twice the upper limit of the normal range for age. The latter is considered more appropriate than an absolute value.

- **Protocol for breaches**: For either a first breach in blood parameters, or a new breach after regular blood tests every 3 months, specific interventions are implemented.

### Azathioprine dosing and metabolite measurement in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: Does one size fit all [^1128PxZz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Although the use of thiopurine in the management of pediatric IBD is increasing and the measurement of the thiopurine metabolites 6-TGN and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6-MMP) can be helpful in determining compliance and optimizing therapy, these metabolites are not routinely monitored. The cost and availability of the tests have been cited as reasons for this.

Thiopurine metabolite measurement is available at Evelina London Children's Hospital and is currently routinely used as a tool for monitoring children receiving thiopurine therapy. In this paper, we describe a proactive approach, combining clinical data and thiopurine metabolite measurement, to guide azathioprine dosing in children with IBD.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: Towards a personalized medicine [^114nMRC8]. Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Azathioprine is capable of inducing and maintaining mucosal healing in Crohn's disease (CD), unlike corticosteroids. However, this effect may take months to achieve and appears to be modest, with only 16.5% of patients reaching mucosal healing at week 26 in the SONIC trial. Interestingly, D'Haens and colleagues demonstrated that successful azathioprine therapy, defined by clinical remission, was often accompanied by complete mucosal healing in 70% of patients in the colon and 54% in the ileum. Methotrexate seems to have less efficacy in inducing mucosal healing compared to azathioprine or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in CD patients.

In randomized clinical trials, the effect of TNF antagonists on mucosal healing has mostly been studied as a secondary endpoint, except for the EXTEND study on CD, which used complete mucosal healing as a primary endpoint. In the EXTEND study and an ACCENT 1 substudy, mucosal healing was achieved in 24% of patients at 52 weeks who received adalimumab and in 50% of patients at 54 weeks who received scheduled infliximab (IFX), respectively. Interestingly, Schnitzler and colleagues demonstrated that mucosal healing induced by IFX treatment, even when partial, was associated with improved long-term outcomes of the disease. Thus, achieving at least endoscopic improvement with induction therapy seems essential.

### Azathioprine for people with multiple sclerosis [^113Y2qwU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Dose-dependent, reversible leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may be a consequence of bone marrow suppression in 27% and 5% of people treated with azathioprine (AZA), respectively. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections associated with immunosuppression occur in about 9% of people treated with azathioprine. Long-term adverse events may include the risk of malignancy, such as lymphoma and skin cancer, although data on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are inconsistent. Evidence from transplant recipients treated with AZA suggests that cancer risk may be dose-related, although such a possibility is still debated.

### Effect of NUDT15 polymorphisms on early hematological safety of low-dose azathioprine in Chinese patients with pemphigus vulgaris: A prospective cohort study [^113r7jJV]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

In the present study, bone marrow suppression, especially leukopenia, was considered the principal adverse event (AE). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and studies related to azathioprine (AZA)-induced hematological AE, bone marrow suppression was defined as follows: blood white blood cell (WBC) count less than 3.5 × 10⁹/L, neutrophil (NEU) count less than 1.5 × 10⁹/L, platelet (PLT) count less than 100 × 10⁹/L, or hemoglobin (Hb) less than 100 g/L, with leukopenia defined as a WBC count less than 3.5 × 10⁹/L.

Secondary AE included hepatotoxicity, defined as alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels that are ≥ 2 times the normal upper limit, and pancreatitis, which were assessed by biochemical tests performed at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Other secondary AE included influenza-like symptoms (dizziness, fever, chills, and general malaise), gastrointestinal AE (nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, diarrhea, and stomachache), hair loss, skin rash, myalgia, and arthralgia, which were collected by clinicians during the follow-up period.

Furthermore, evaluation of the pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) score and anti-Dsg1/Dsg3 IgG autoantibodies by ELISA was performed at weeks 0, 4, and 8 to determine treatment response.

### Azathioprine-induced Sweet's syndrome and published work review [^113wTRao]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity to azathioprine can manifest with a wide clinical spectrum. Azathioprine-induced Sweet's syndrome (SS) is rare and usually overlooked because it can mimic disease exacerbation and sepsis. This study aims to characterize the clinical findings of azathioprine-induced SS. A retrospective analysis of the records of three patients diagnosed with azathioprine-induced SS and a review of the relevant English-language published work was performed. Twelve (71%) of the 17 patients were male, ranging from 9 to 89 years in age (mean, 47.2). The time of onset after starting azathioprine was 5 to 28 days (mean, 13.3). The most common associated disease was inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (76%). The clinical features typically consisted of fever and the classic rash of SS with pustules and vesicles. The lesions occurred most commonly on the face and trunk. Systemic involvement was rare, and no hypotension or shock was reported, as seen in azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome. Thiopurine methyltransferase activity is not predictive of this type of adverse effect. Most patients dramatically responded to systemic corticosteroids. Azathioprine-induced SS may be underdiagnosed because it can easily be misinterpreted as an inflammatory bowel disease-associated skin eruption. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease may be at higher risk of this condition. Early recognition and drug withdrawal can decrease the morbidity of the patients.

### Azathioprine for people with multiple sclerosis [^114F1Ze9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Azathioprine is a purine analogue that affects DNA replication through the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. It is metabolized by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Some individuals possess very low or absent TPMT levels due to a homozygous mutation in the gene coding for this enzyme, making them unsuitable for treatment with azathioprine (AZA) as the drug is not metabolized, exposing them to the risk of severe bone marrow suppression. Genetic screening for TPMT deficiency is therefore warranted prior to commencing treatment.

Azathioprine was developed in the mid-1950s and began being used in clinical practice by 1960. Due to its favorable therapeutic index over other traditional immunosuppressants, AZA is frequently employed as a corticosteroid-sparing agent and as monotherapy in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, malignancies, and other autoimmune conditions.

Azathioprine is administered orally in the form of 25 mg or 50 mg tablets. For multiple sclerosis (MS), the starting dose is 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day), given as a single dose once or twice daily. This dose is gradually increased over a period of four to six weeks to a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day (100 mg/day to 150 mg/day) and is adjusted based on regular monitoring (every two to three months) of the white blood cell count. In the event of a decrease in white blood cell or lymphocyte count, a dose reduction is necessary.

### Azathioprine for people with multiple sclerosis [^115SL8nZ]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

We widened the evidence base on harms in the long term by adding the results of non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) to the review. Most of the evidence is of poor quality, and our certainty in the estimates is very low. One case-control study reported a dose-response relationship between treatment with azathioprine and occurrence of cancer over almost 12 years of follow-up. However, this finding is based on few events in a small sample and therefore should be interpreted with caution.

- **Reasons for including NRSIs**:
	- **Patent status of azathioprine**: Azathioprine is a treatment whose patent has expired; therefore, new registered clinical trials for azathioprine in the context of treating multiple sclerosis (MS) are unlikely. Non-randomized controlled studies can be valuable for assessing the benefits and harms of azathioprine in MS.
	- **Follow-up duration in RCTs**: The duration of follow-up in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is usually no longer than three years. This duration is a limitation in assessing benefits and harms, considering that MS is a chronic condition evolving over decades.
	- **Concerns about long-term use**: One of the main concerns about long-term use of azathioprine in clinical practice is the potentially increased risk of malignancy associated with cumulative doses of azathioprine above 600 g, as highlighted in our previous review (Casetta 2007). Such an outcome is relatively rare and, if causally related to azathioprine treatment, would require long-term follow-up to be assessed.

- **Settings**: When considering the geographic context in which studies were conducted, the applicability of the evidence appears limited.

### Initiating azathioprine for Crohn's disease [^112NnBry]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine are therapeutic options for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory Crohn's disease. AZA has both a complex metabolism and a potential for adverse events that can be clinically challenging. It has been shown to maintain remission and reduce corticosteroid use in patients with Crohn's disease. There is heterogeneous thiopurine methyltransferase metabolism among patients, which has implications for clinical dosing and risk for adverse events.

Routine thiopurine methyltransferase testing before the initiation of AZA will reduce early leukopenia and is mandatory to avoid potentially life-threatening myelotoxicity. Thiopurine metabolite assays may aid in the assessment of adherence and adverse events. Patients who do not respond to AZA therapy may benefit from the addition of biologic therapy or methotrexate.

### Effect of NUDT15 polymorphisms on early hematological safety of low-dose azathioprine in Chinese patients with pemphigus vulgaris: A prospective cohort study [^112CTJAm]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

We enumerated the number of patients who developed bone marrow suppression or leukopenia during the study period. One patient with heterozygous NUDT15 and four patients with wild homozygous NUDT15 developed bone marrow suppression, predominantly attributed to the reduced PLT and Hb levels. The lowest PLT and Hb values were 74 × 10⁹/L and 96 g/L, respectively, and the results did not show symptoms and positive signs in practice. However, the patient with heterozygous NUDT15 developed leukopenia (WBC 0.99 × 10⁹/L) in week 3. AZA was immediately discontinued, and the WBC count significantly improved after one week, implicating the possibility of other risk genes or influencing factors related to the hematological adverse effects (AE) of AZA.

Moreover, the incidence of leukopenia was quite lower in our study (1.6%) compared to other studies. We considered the possible reasons as follows: the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for thiopurine dosing based on TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes recommended that for non-malignant patients with a homozygous mutation of TPMT/NUDT15, who have a high risk of AZA-related bone marrow suppression, AZA should be avoided. For patients with heterozygous TPMT/NUDT15, AZA is used with reduced doses. The CPIC also mentioned that clinicians should adjust doses of AZA based on monitoring of clinical myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. According to the guideline, all patients in our study initially underwent TPMT*3C and NUDT15 tests and were filtered by our inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^113h2vda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The results from controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease were conflicting and controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs for the induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.

- **Search strategy**: Studies were selected using the MEDLINE database (1966 to July 2009), abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings, and references from published articles and reviews. The Cochrane Trials Register and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Trials Register were also searched. This search strategy was updated using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases, as well as the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine involving adult patients (> 18 years) with active Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by three independent observers based on the intention-to-treat principle. Each study was given a quality score based on predetermined criteria. Extracted data were converted to 2×2 tables (response versus no response and antimetabolite versus placebo) and then synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence.

### The adverse effect profile of oral azathioprine in pediatric atopic dermatitis, and recommendations for monitoring [^111k8oAS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

In this cohort of pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), azathioprine treatment was associated with frequent mild adverse effects and infrequent pronounced adverse effects in blood indices. The majority required little or no treatment alteration, although they were monitored closely. The high number of self-resolving abnormal results was likely a result of unrelated infections. Physician assessment is important. Irreversible or fatal adverse effects were not encountered in 186 children prescribed azathioprine for AD in our department in the last eight years. However, such events have rarely been reported. The overall pattern of adverse effects is comparable with other studies of azathioprine treatment of AD.

In a recent randomized controlled trial comparing azathioprine with methotrexate, 36% and 77% of 22 adult patients receiving azathioprine had abnormal liver transaminase levels and complete blood counts (CBCs), respectively, but only 9% required withdrawal of treatment and 9% necessitated a dose adjustment. Detailed comparison of hepatic transaminase levels with other studies is hampered by varying definitions of abnormality, but the numbers reported are of a similar order. We found pronounced hepatic transaminase abnormalities (defined as > 50 IU/L) in 13% of 82 prospectively collected patients, which is similar to other pediatric AD studies (8%-21%); adult AD studies report 10% to 36%. It has been suggested that adults with a normal to high TPMT activity are at greater risk of azathioprine-induced liver injury because of increased production of toxic methylated thiopurine metabolites.

If concomitant use of Canasa and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.

- **Interference with urinary normetanephrine measurements**: Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. This is due to the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^115XRYGf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance of remission is a major issue in inflammatory bowel disease. In ulcerative colitis, the evidence for the effectiveness of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the maintenance of remission is still controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to July 30, 2015. Both full randomized controlled trials and associated abstracts were included.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of at least 12 months duration that compared azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with placebo or standard maintenance therapy (e.g. mesalazine) were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data using standard forms, resolving disagreements by consensus, including input from a third author. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. Analyses were performed separately by type of control (placebo or active comparator). Pooled risk ratios were calculated based on the fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was shown. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence for pooled outcomes.

- **Main results**: Seven studies, including 302 patients with ulcerative colitis, were included in the review. The risk of bias was high in three of the studies due to lack of full reporting or potential issues in study design and implementation.

### Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity and adverse effects of azathioprine in inflammatory bowel disease: long-term follow-up study of 394 patients [^112dVrf6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

To prospectively evaluate whether a relationship between thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity and the incidence of adverse effects (especially myelotoxicity) exists, a long-term follow-up study involving a large group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine was conducted. TPMT activity in red blood cells (RBC) was measured using a radiochemical method in 394 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease (238) or ulcerative colitis (156) starting treatment with azathioprine. The relationship among several variables and TPMT values was assessed, and the correlation between such levels and the incidence of adverse effects was evaluated.

The mean TPMT value was 18.6 ± 4 U/mL RBCs (range 9.4–33.7). No patient exhibited low levels (< 9). Differences (P < 0.001) in TPMT activity were demonstrated based on the type of inflammatory bowel disease but not on the remaining variables, including treatment with 5-aminosalicylates. Adverse effects were reported in 74 patients (18.8%), with the most frequent being gastrointestinal intolerance (9.1%) and myelotoxicity (4.3%). No patient experiencing adverse effects had low TPMT levels. However, mean TPMT activity was lower in those with adverse effects (16.6 ± 3 vs. 19.1 ± 4 U/mL, P < 0.001). Moreover, the probability of suffering myelotoxicity in the high TPMT group was only 3.5%, compared with 14.3% in the TPMT intermediate group (95% CI = 1.37–14.9; OR = 4.5).

### Tpmt in the treatment of Crohn's disease with azathioprine [^116bqKY6]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Azathioprine-induced profound myelosuppression linked to TPMT deficiency has now been documented in many patient groups, including those with Crohn's disease. At the start of azathioprine or mercaptopurine therapy, measurement of TPMT activity plays a role in identifying the 1 in 300 patients who are at risk of severe myelosuppression when treated with standard thiopurine dosages. During the initial months of azathioprine therapy, knowledge of TPMT status warns of early bone marrow toxicity. In patients established on azathioprine, there is no clear evidence to suggest that TPMT is predictive of clinical response or drug toxicity, indicating a role for TPMT in the prediction of early events rather than long-term control. In patients with Crohn's disease on long-term azathioprine therapy, it is clear that myelosuppression, particularly leucopenia, is caused by other factors in addition to variable TPMT activity. Therefore, monitoring of blood cell counts throughout treatment is essential.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113zLV41]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

We recommend that thiopurines should be avoided in patients with low TPMT activity. The dose of thiopurine should be reduced to 50% in those with intermediate thiopurine activity. Daily dosage should also be reduced in patients with significant renal impairment [GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%].

The usual dose of azathioprine is 2–2.5 mg/kg daily and for mercaptopurine 1–1.25 mg/kg daily for patients with normal TPMT activity. There is a very high risk of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression in patients with absent TPMT activity (homozygous or compound heterozygous TPMT deficiency). While a very low dose (5% of the usual target) has been proposed, a thiopurine should generally be avoided in this group. In those with heterozygous TPMT deficiency, however, 50% of the standard thiopurine dose is associated with improved tolerance.

Genetic variation in NUDT15 has now also been described in association with myelosuppression. This was originally described in East Asians but has now also been observed in IBD patients of European ancestry. Recent CPIC guidelines recommend NUDT15 testing, particularly for Asian patients, with consideration of dose reduction or thiopurine avoidance.

- **Starting dose for thiopurines**: Azathioprine and mercaptopurine should be started at the full dose. There is no evidence that starting at low doses and then gradually increasing up to the target improves safety or tolerance, and low-dose initiation may cause a significant delay in achieving the correct target dose.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^1149gwEg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Maintenance of remission is a major issue in inflammatory bowel disease, and in ulcerative colitis, the evidence for the effectiveness of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintaining remission is still controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to June 2012. A manual search was also performed using references from these articles, as well as review articles and proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings. Authors of maintenance trials were asked about unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of at least 12 months duration that compared azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with placebo or standard maintenance therapy (e.g. mesalazine) were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data using standard forms. Disagreements were resolved by consensus including a third author. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. Analyses were performed separately by type of control (placebo or active comparator). Pooled risk ratios were calculated based on the fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was shown. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence for pooled outcomes.

- **Main results**: Six studies were included in the analysis, [further details not provided in the excerpt].

### Azathioprine dosing and metabolite measurement in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: Does one size fit all [^113LwCxm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, immune-regulated inflammatory condition of the digestive system. It is thought to have a complex etiology involving genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. The worldwide incidence and prevalence of IBD in children is increasing; the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in children ranges between 2.5 and 11.4 per 100,000. Pediatric IBD is associated with more extensive and aggressive disease, leading to higher rates of surgical management. The main treatment goals in IBD management include timely and effective induction of remission followed by maintenance. A crucial focus lies on optimizing nutrition, monitoring growth and quality of life, and limiting drug-related side effects.

IBD disease activity may be assessed using the activity indexes (AI) Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), which convert clinical symptoms, physical signs, and biochemical markers into an activity score. These indexes are reliable indicators of disease severity and remission status and are helpful in evaluating the response to treatment changes. An AI score of less than 10 accurately reflects clinical remission.

Thiopurines, such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, are immunomodulatory agents recommended for maintaining steroid-free remission in children with IBD. They are initiated soon after diagnosis and can take up to 14 weeks to be fully effective. The recommended starting doses are currently 2–2.5 mg/kg for azathioprine and 1–1.5 mg/kg for mercaptopurine.

### Neutropenia is not required for clinical remission during azathioprine therapy in inflammatory bowel disease [^114xPvwC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory process of the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology remains unknown but probably involves a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and abnormal immune regulation. Immunomodulators are effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) are the most frequently used immunomodulator agents.

These agents are probably underused by many clinicians because of concerns about myelosuppression, pancreatitis, allergic reactions, and hepatotoxicity, which can occur in a fraction of patients taking these drugs. Therefore, clinicians have sought ways to optimize therapeutic response and limit toxic side effects. Neutropenia, although uncommon, can occur in patients taking azathioprine or 6MP. The question of neutropenia affecting clinical response has been raised as a possible indicator of therapeutic response. In the study from Campbell and Ghosh [7] in this issue of the European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, no difference in relapse rates was noted between neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. In fact, severe life-threatening neutropenia was seen in four patients.

### The adverse effect profile of oral azathioprine in pediatric atopic dermatitis, and recommendations for monitoring [^114LfSS3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

There are no published guidelines for monitoring adverse effects of azathioprine treatment in pediatric atopic dermatitis. Azathioprine was associated with frequent mild and infrequent pronounced adverse effects in this cohort of 82 children with severe atopic dermatitis. Recommendations for laboratory monitoring of azathioprine therapy are offered based on our experience.

Benefit from systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) with azathioprine (AZT) has been demonstrated with randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults showing a 17% to 23% improvement in the Six Area Six Sign AD score. A randomized comparison with methotrexate showed comparable efficacy. Nonrandomized studies of 48 and 24 pediatric patients reported significant improvement in 88% and 61% of cases, respectively. A series of 12 children treated with azathioprine for recalcitrant AD reported improvement in 92% of cases.

Prospective studies in adults have found a low incidence of adverse effects requiring cessation of AD treatment, all of which were reversible after reduction or cessation of therapy. Similar findings are reported in pediatric AD studies.

Azathioprine is metabolized by the enzyme thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and causes immunosuppression via inhibition of the lymphocyte cell cycle. Serum levels of TPMT activity vary due to DNA sequence polymorphisms, with normal levels in 80%, low in 10%, high in 9%, and undetectable in 0.5% of the population. Patients with lower TPMT levels are routinely commenced on a lower dose of azathioprine to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

### Life-threatening course of pemphigus vulgaris complicated by sepsis caused by azathioprine-induced bone marrow suppression, successfully managed with combination therapy [^116rHZkF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Severe forms of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) that are resistant to standard treatment present a life-threatening disease with a mortality of 5–10%. The treatment is usually individualized. The most popular procedures used today include intravenous applications of immunoglobulins and rituximab. Currently, the common use of pulse corticosteroids, often in first-line treatment, is being neglected. This particular case documented the severity of the disease and also the need for combined and comprehensive care, in which corticosteroid pulse therapy still plays an important role.

### Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^116tfnpU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The results from controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease were conflicting and controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs for the induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.

- **Search strategy**: Studies were selected using the MEDLINE database (1966 to July 2009), abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings, and references from published articles and reviews. The Cochrane Trials Register and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Trials Register were also searched. This search strategy was updated using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases, as well as the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine involving adult patients (> 18 years) with active Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by three independent observers based on the intention-to-treat principle. Each study was given a quality score based on predetermined criteria. Extracted data were converted to 2×2 tables (response versus no response and antimetabolite versus placebo) and then synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

### Apriso [^1146JTT8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Nephrotoxic agents, including NSAIDs, increase the risk of nephrotoxicity; monitor for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine increases the risk for blood disorders; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.

- **Antacids**: Because the dissolution of the coating of the granules in Apriso capsules depends on pH, avoid co-administration of Apriso capsules with antacids [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs**: Use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including NSAIDs may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine**: Use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk of blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of Apriso and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.

- **Interference with urinary normetanephrine measurements**: Use of Apriso may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Consider an alternative, selective method.

### Relevance of thiopurine methyltransferase status in rheumatology patients receiving azathioprine [^114vnkhr]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Azathioprine (AZA) is widely used in the management of rheumatological diseases. Despite its efficacy, AZA can often cause bone marrow suppression, notably leucopenia, which has been recorded in up to 17% of patients taking AZA for rheumatoid arthritis, though this can be considered clinically significant in about 3% overall. Severe myelosuppression, associated with abnormal AZA metabolism, is linked to the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic polymorphism. TPMT status can be assessed prior to AZA treatment by measuring enzyme activity or using genotyping techniques.

Analysis of recent data suggests that by optimizing the AZA dose based on TPMT status testing (with a substantial reduction in dose for patients homozygous for mutant TPMT alleles), a reduction in drug-induced morbidity and cost savings can be made by avoiding hospitalization and rescue therapy for leucopenic events. In this article, we review the pharmacogenetic and clinical implications of the TPMT polymorphism, emphasizing its relevance to rheumatologists managing diseases with AZA.

### Effect of NUDT15 polymorphisms on early hematological safety of low-dose azathioprine in Chinese patients with pemphigus vulgaris: A prospective cohort study [^112qfRj3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

To describe baseline characteristics of the two groups, we employed the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed variables and percentages for categorical variables. Additionally, an independent‐sample t-test was used to compare baseline quantitative variables between the two groups and the χ²-test for qualitative variables.

To assess changes in bone marrow suppression and treatment response over the 8 weeks, line charts were used to visually express changes in WBC, NEU, PLT, Hb, anti‐Dsg1/Dsg3 autoantibodies, and PDAI. The outcome of these indicators was longitudinally measured at different time points to determine if they were affected by other confounding factors between the two groups. Therefore, multilevel linear regression analysis (MLRA) was adopted. In the model, bone marrow suppression and treatment response indicators were set as dependent variables, with a categorical variable of the group as an independent variable. Other variables such as age, sex, corticosteroid dose, and time were adjusted for possible confounding effects.

Finally, we compared the incidence of bone marrow suppression/leukopenia between the two groups using the χ²-test or Fisher's exact test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.3; Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### More dose-dependent side effects with mercaptopurine over azathioprine in IBD treatment due to relatively higher dosing [^117KPW9H]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The study design, patient data, and results of the TOPIC trial have been published previously. Briefly, thiopurine-naive patients with IBD, who had an indication for thiopurine treatment, were randomized 1:1 for thiopurine dosing based on their thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype versus the standard AZA (2.0–2.5 mg/kg) or MP dose (1.0–1.5 mg/kg). Patients assigned to the TPMT genotyping arm received a 50% dose reduction when they carried a heterozygote variant in TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, or TPMT*3C, whereas carriers of a homozygote variant received 10% of the original dose or were advised to start an alternative treatment. Patients in the standard-of-care arm were genotyped for variants in TPMT afterward. TPMT activity was assessed in all patients following the execution of the clinical trial.

Indication for thiopurine treatment was determined by the treating physician, although it was not reported on the case report form. Physicians were free to choose whether to start AZA or MP and were advised to start the full regular dose immediately. The main exclusion criteria of the TOPIC trial included previous use of thiopurines, cotreatment with allopurinol, a baseline white blood cell count < 3.0 × 10⁹/L, and baseline liver test abnormalities (ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase) ≥ 2 times the normal upper limit. Biochemical and hematological safety parameters were assessed at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 20. Patients were followed for a total of 20 weeks.

### The adverse effect profile of oral azathioprine in pediatric atopic dermatitis, and recommendations for monitoring [^1142SiDH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Azathioprine is efficacious in the treatment of severe childhood atopic dermatitis; however, robust data on adverse effects in this population are lacking.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess adverse effects of azathioprine treatment in a pediatric atopic dermatitis cohort and make recommendations for monitoring based on these data.

- **Methods**: Blood test results for all 82 children prescribed oral azathioprine for atopic dermatitis in our department between 2010 and 2012 were collated prospectively, and clinical notes were reviewed retrospectively.

- **Results**: Mean age at commencing azathioprine was 8.3 years (SEM 0.4). Mean maximum doses were 2.4 mg/kg (SEM 0.1) and 1.5 mg/kg (SEM 0.1) for normal and reduced serum thiopurine-S-methyltransferase levels, respectively. Adverse effects on blood indices occurred in 34 of 82 patients (41%), with pronounced effects in 18 of 82 (22%) following a median time of 0.4 years. Two patients stopped therapy as a result of abnormal blood indices. Clinical adverse effects occurred in 16 of 82 (20%), two resulting in cessation of therapy. Incidence of adverse effects was unaffected by age, sex, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase level, and drug dose on multivariate regression.

- **Limitations**: Comparison with other studies is limited by varying definitions of adverse effects.

- **Conclusion**: Oral azathioprine was associated with few pronounced adverse effects for the duration of use and dosage in this cohort. Recommendations for monitoring are made.

### Indicators of clinical response to treatment with six-mercaptopurine or azathioprine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^112CWjJu]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

There is some uncertainty regarding how to best dose and therapeutically monitor 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between clinical response, 6-mercaptopurine metabolite levels, relative leukopenia, and drug dose.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were on stable doses of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine for three months or more and who had measurements of 6-mercaptopurine metabolite levels were evaluated. Patients were classified as complete responders (N = 24), partial responders (N = 7), or non-responders (N = 29).

- **Results**: Drug dose was associated with clinical response when we analyzed adjusted doses based on molecular drug weight (P = 0.002). 6-Thioguanine levels also were associated with clinical response (P = 0.003), and the maximal difference between responders and non-responders was seen at 6-thioguanine levels greater than 260 pmol/8 × 10⁸ RBC. Relative leukopenia, defined as a white blood cell count less than either 5.0 or 4.0 K/uL, was not associated with clinical response (P = 0.13 and 0.77, respectively).

- **Conclusions**:
	1. Drug dose and 6-thioguanine levels are related to clinical response in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine.
	2. For 6-thioguanine levels, there is a fair amount of overlap, but maximal differentiation between responders and non-responders is seen at levels above 260 pmol/8 × 10⁸ RBC.
	3. Relative leukopenia does not correlate well with clinical response.

To evaluate the benefits and harms of azathioprine (AZA) for relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), compared to other disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), placebo, or no treatment, we will assess the following comparisons:

- **AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first-choice treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis**: This comparison aims to determine the efficacy of AZA as an initial treatment option.

- **AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for relapsing forms of MS when switching from another DMT**: This assessment focuses on AZA's effectiveness when it is used after transitioning from a different DMT.

- **AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first-choice treatment for progressive forms of MS**: This analysis evaluates AZA's role as an initial therapeutic option for progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.

- **AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for progressive forms of MS when switching from another DMT**: This comparison examines the benefits and risks of using AZA after switching from another disease-modifying treatment.

### More dose-dependent side effects with mercaptopurine over azathioprine in IBD treatment due to relatively higher dosing [^113PQBH3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Leukopenia was observed in 58 patients (7.6%), defined as a white blood cell count ≤ 3.0 × 10⁹/L. Eight of these patients (4 patients on azathioprine [AZA] and 4 on mercaptopurine [MP]) had a variant in TPMT and were randomized to the standard-of-care group, subsequently receiving the standard thiopurine dose. Leukopenia was observed in 24 patients (4.9%) treated with AZA and in 34 patients (12.5%) treated with MP, with a hazard ratio of 2.55 (95% CI, 1.51–4.30; P < 0.001). A secondary analysis adjusted for dosage in mg/kg and week 1 6-MMPR and 6-TGN metabolite levels showed a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.28–3.05; P = 0.89). The time to development of leukopenia was not significantly different between AZA and MP (P = 0.62).

Gastrointestinal side effects were reported by 345 patients (45.0%), with 216 patients (43.7%) treated with AZA and 129 patients (47.3%) with MP, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87–1.3; P = 0.46). The median time to the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects was 14 days (range, 7–34 days). No difference was observed in the Kaplan–Meier curve between AZA and MP (P = 0.52). In the secondary analysis, the hazard ratio for AZA or MP on gastrointestinal side effects was 1.38 (95% CI, 0.90–2.10; P = 0.17).

### The adverse effect profile of oral azathioprine in pediatric atopic dermatitis, and recommendations for monitoring [^116bweTa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Neutropenia and lymphopenia were relatively common. In pediatric AD studies, the rates of lymphopenia vary from 1% to 43%, and neutropenia 5%; a recent systematic review recorded an abnormal CBC in 77% of patients. In a study of 52 adults with inflammatory bowel disease, lymphopenia was significantly associated with concurrent steroid treatment at the start of azathioprine use. As our patients were on systemic steroid treatment for the initial weeks of azathioprine therapy, this potentially contributed to the rate of mild lymphopenia.

Clinical adverse effects were cutaneous viral infections (12%), nausea, lethargy, indigestion, deterioration in asthma, unconfirmed possible myopathy, headache, and recurrent chest infections. Migraines and headaches have occurred in 4% to 12% of adult patients with AD on azathioprine. Respiratory tract infections have been reported in 10% to 13% of cases. Dermatologic manifestations have included folliculitis in 5% and impetigo in 3%. In one pediatric population, the rate of cutaneous infections was significantly higher (57%). Nausea is a well-recognized adverse effect in adult populations, occurring in 51% of patients in one study. We encountered only a single case of nausea (1%) after one year of treatment, and this was successfully managed with a small reduction in dose.

### The efficacy of azathioprine for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: a 30 year review [^113vHkn3]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

There are limited data on factors predicting response to azathioprine and uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of treatment.

- **Patients and methods**: The notes of patients attending the Oxford IBD clinic from 1968 to 1999 were reviewed. Remission was defined as no need for oral steroids for at least three months, and relapse was defined as active disease requiring steroids.

- **Results**: A total of 622 out of 2205 patients were treated with azathioprine (272 with Crohn's disease, 346 with ulcerative colitis, and four with indeterminate colitis). The mean duration of the initial course of treatment was 634 days. The overall remission rates were 45% for Crohn's disease and 58% for ulcerative colitis. For the 424 patients who received more than six months of treatment, remission rates were 64% and 87%, respectively. Factors favoring remission were ulcerative colitis (p = 0.0001), lower white blood cell (WBC) or neutrophil count (p = 0.0001), higher mean cell volume (p = 0.0001), and older age (p = 0.05). For Crohn's disease, colonic disease favored remission (p = 0.03). Factors that were not significant included age, sex, lymphocyte count, and dose (mg/kg). The proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0.95, 0.69, and 0.55, respectively. The chance of remaining in remission was higher if WBC was less than 5 × 10⁹ (p = 0.03) and in male patients (p = 0.01; Crohn's disease only). There was no difference in relapse rates between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. After stopping azathioprine, the proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was not provided.

### Use of pharmacogenetics, enzymatic phenotyping, and metabolite monitoring to guide treatment with azathioprine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^115K3UWr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Individualized therapy based on genetic background and monitoring of metabolites can optimize drug safety and efficacy. Such an approach is available for azathioprine (AZA), the thiopurine antimetabolite. AZA exerts therapeutic effects when metabolized to the active thiopurine nucleotide 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 6-TGN levels in the target range of 235–400 pmol/8 × 10⁸ red blood cells (RBC) are associated with a high likelihood of response. Our objective was to evaluate whether drug escalation based on metabolite levels improves efficacy and maintains safety in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

- **Methods**: We conducted a 6-month open-label dose-escalation clinical study of patients with active SLE treated with azathioprine dosed by body weight and metabolite levels. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50% improvement in any one parameter of disease activity, or a 50% decrease in glucocorticoid dose.

- **Results**: Of 50 patients enrolled in the study, 21 achieved clinical responses. Thirteen of these patients had 6-TGN levels of 235 pmol/8 × 10⁸ RBC (n = 4) or received a maximum AZA dose of ≥ 3.5 mg/kg (n = 6). In 19 patients, the drug was discontinued prematurely due to side effects or SLE activity. For those patients in whom either liver function test or white blood cell count abnormalities were encountered, metabolites guided attribution to drug or disease activity.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical responses in SLE can occur at levels of 6-TGN lower than the target.
