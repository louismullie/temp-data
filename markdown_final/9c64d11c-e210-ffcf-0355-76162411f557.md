## Question

Are there data to support accupuncture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is data to support acupuncture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and volume of the evidence base. Then, I should verify the certainty or quality of evidence across conditions. Next, I will examine specific clinical domains where benefits are most consistent, including pain, headache, and supportive oncology care. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety. Finally, I will consider methodological limitations, placebo effects, and translate this into a practical, condition-specific recommendation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the scope of evidence. There are thousands of randomized controlled trials and over 2,000 systematic reviews of acupuncture, covering dozens of adult health conditions, which establishes a vast but heterogeneous evidence base that spans musculoskeletal pain, headache disorders, cancer-related symptoms, mental health, and more [^62f7c8f8] [^e9f66024] [^c182c0f4].

> Wait, let me verify the certainty of evidence rather than just the quantity. High-quality evidence mapping shows that among hundreds of recent systematic reviews, only a minority conclude with high or moderate certainty, and most conclusions remain low or very low certainty, largely due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision; importantly, many of the higher-certainty findings come from comparisons with sham or no treatment rather than active therapies, which complicates inference about specific effects [^c182c0f4] [^a4d4aae1] [^cb2f47d8].

> I will now examine pain conditions, where signals are strongest. For chronic low back pain, multiple systematic reviews and guidelines suggest acupuncture provides clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function when added to usual care, though effects versus sham are small and sometimes indistinguishable; the VA/DoD guideline suggests acupuncture for chronic low back pain, and cost-effectiveness data support its use in some settings [^87cecb41] [^db7bb0a4] [^c3254eca] [^6fcc2c35]. For migraine prophylaxis, Cochrane and subsequent reviews indicate moderate-certainty evidence that acupuncture reduces headache frequency versus no prophylaxis and shows a small but statistically significant benefit over sham, with favorable safety compared with drugs; VA/DoD headache guidelines also acknowledge potential benefit despite low-quality evidence [^9ac86138] [^7266b783] [^f6106d08]. For tension-type headache, Cochrane reviews report moderate-quality evidence of benefit over routine care and a small benefit over sham, supporting its consideration as a nonpharmacologic option [^c6e1bc7a] [^8ca0921c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all pain. I should double-check osteoarthritis of the knee. The AAOS guideline gives a limited-strength recommendation, noting that while some trials show pain and function benefits, effects are inconsistent and appear smaller when blinding is effective, so patient selection and shared decision-making are key [^02fdf793]. For acute pain and perioperative settings, emerging systematic reviews and white papers suggest acupuncture can reduce pain and opioid requirements, but the evidence quality varies and access barriers remain substantial, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralization [^9affa53b] [^77923ec4].

> Next, I should review supportive oncology care. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates acupuncture and acupressure reduce cancer pain intensity and may reduce opioid consumption, and acupuncture is recommended by ASCO and NCCN as a nonpharmacologic option for cancer pain; additionally, acupuncture has consistent evidence for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, which is reflected in oncology guidelines and represents one of the more robust indications [^af6d08e1] [^54c9f718] [^0f8bd8a2] [^3fc09f49].

> Let me consider mental health and other conditions. For depression, Cochrane and subsequent reviews conclude that evidence is low to very low quality overall, with small average effects versus no treatment and uncertain effects versus sham or medication; thus, acupuncture should not be considered first-line for depression outside of research or carefully selected cases [^39085f62] [^e346e705]. For insomnia, evidence remains limited by heterogeneity and risk of bias, so routine use cannot be endorsed pending higher-quality trials [^852c948a] [^2078903b]. For allergic rhinitis, some guidelines suggest acupuncture as a nonpharmacologic option given symptom improvements in RCTs, but confidence is low and patient preferences should guide use [^4eaa653f] [^2933c3ee].

> I need to ensure I address safety and implementation. Serious adverse events from acupuncture are rare in large datasets, and nonserious events such as bruising or transient soreness occur in roughly 7–11% of patients; however, proper training, sterile technique, and screening for contraindications are essential to minimize risk [^d5fb10da] [^02fdf793]. Access remains a major barrier in many systems, with limited insurance coverage and workforce constraints, which affects real-world uptake despite favorable safety profiles [^1e6f75a5] [^55be0681].

> But wait, what about placebo and sham controls. I should confirm the magnitude of nonspecific effects. Meta-analyses of three-arm trials show a small, often clinically modest difference between true and sham acupuncture, alongside a larger difference between sham and no treatment, indicating substantial contextual and placebo components; this does not negate benefit but does complicate attribution to specific needle effects and argues for pragmatic, comparative effectiveness studies versus active treatments rather than more sham-controlled trials [^6d3ad4f9] [^7625f268] [^cb2f47d8].

> Let me synthesize and translate this into practical guidance. Yes, there are data to support acupuncture for several conditions, with the most consistent, clinically meaningful benefits in chronic low back pain, migraine and tension-type headache prophylaxis, cancer-related pain and CINV, and select other pain syndromes; benefits are typically modest on average, safety is favorable when delivered by trained providers, and shared decision-making is crucial given heterogeneity and access issues [^87cecb41] [^9ac86138] [^c6e1bc7a] [^af6d08e1] [^db7bb0a4]. For many other conditions, evidence remains low certainty or insufficient, so acupuncture may be considered case-by-case or within research contexts, and patients should be counseled about expected effect sizes, costs, and alternatives [^c182c0f4] [^a4d4aae1].

> Finally, I should confirm the research gaps and future directions. The field needs fewer systematic reviews and more high-quality, adequately powered RCTs comparing acupuncture with active treatments, improved standardization and reporting of acupuncture protocols, and better integration of patient-centered outcomes and implementation science to close the evidence-practice gap [^cb2f47d8] [^19e84eb9] [^fdbfb4ce].

There is **moderate-certainty evidence** that acupuncture is effective for chronic low back pain [^87cecb41], migraine prevention [^9ac86138], and tension-type headache [^c6e1bc7a], with benefits over sham or usual care in these conditions. For other conditions, evidence is **limited or low certainty** [^c182c0f4], and acupuncture is generally safe when performed by trained practitioners [^af03566a]. Guidelines suggest acupuncture as an option for chronic pain, migraine, and tension-type headache, but **more high-quality trials are needed** to clarify its role across conditions [^db7bb0a4] [^cb2f47d8].

## Conditions with moderate-to-high certainty evidence

| **Condition** | **Evidence summary** | **Certainty of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic low back pain | Acupuncture improves pain and function vs sham or usual care; moderate-certainty evidence supports clinical use [^87cecb41] [^db7bb0a4] | Moderate |
| Migraine prevention | Reduces migraine frequency vs sham or no prophylaxis; comparable to drugs with fewer adverse effects [^9ac86138] [^7266b783] | Moderate |
| Tension-type headache | Reduces headache frequency vs sham or routine care; moderate-certainty evidence supports use [^c6e1bc7a] [^8ca0921c] | Moderate |

---

## Conditions with low or very low certainty evidence

- **Osteoarthritis**: Small, inconsistent benefits vs sham; evidence is low certainty [^02fdf793].
- **Depression**: Small effects vs no treatment or sham; high risk of bias limits conclusions [^39085f62] [^e346e705].
- **Insomnia**: Mixed results; heterogeneity and bias limit certainty [^852c948a] [^2078903b].
- **Cancer pain**: Some reviews suggest benefit, but evidence remains limited and heterogeneous [^af6d08e1] [^405df66c].

---

## Safety profile

Acupuncture is **generally safe** when performed by trained practitioners; serious adverse events are rare, and non-serious events (e.g. bruising, soreness) occur in 7–11% of patients [^d5fb10da] [^af03566a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Chronic low back pain**: VA/DoD recommends acupuncture as an option [^db7bb0a4].
- **Migraine**: Guidelines suggest acupuncture as a preventive option, especially for patients who prefer non-pharmacologic care [^notfound].
- **Tension-type headache**: Recommended as a non-pharmacologic option in some guidelines [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Sham controls**: Difficulty blinding and variability in sham methods complicate interpretation [^c953a945] [^a014a80c].
- **Heterogeneity**: Differences in populations, protocols, and outcomes limit comparability [^87cecb41] [^c6e1bc7a].
- **Publication bias**: Positive results may be overrepresented, especially in non-English literature [^852c948a] [^c953a945].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

There is **moderate-certainty evidence** supporting acupuncture for chronic low back pain, migraine prevention, and tension-type headache, with favorable safety profiles. For other conditions, evidence is limited or low certainty, so acupuncture may be considered case-by-case. Clinicians should discuss benefits, risks, and patient preferences, and refer to trained practitioners when appropriate [^87cecb41] [^9ac86138] [^c6e1bc7a].

### Evidence on acupuncture therapies is underused in clinical practice and health policy [^93373b20]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

With the wide use of acupuncture therapies in clinical practice and rapid increase in research interest, it is vital to use the large body of evidence that exists to inform clinical and policy decision making and establish funding and research agendas globally. Creating a climate of evidence informed decision making on acupuncture, building a multistakeholder coordinated effort to facilitate the generation and implementation of evidence, and using digitised repositories to facilitate knowledge users' access to information will enable a more evidence based approach to inform practice, policy, research agenda, and funding priorities for acupuncture therapies.

Key messages

A large number of systematic reviews of acupuncture exist which are overall methodologically rigorous
Clinical practice and health policy underuse beneficial acupuncture therapies for which rigorous systematic reviews have documented high or moderate certainty evidence
Acupuncture funding and research need to focus on conditions for which acupuncture therapies have had substantial beneficial effects but for which evidence is of low certainty
A coordinated multistakeholder effort to generate acupuncture evidence and support its implementation will enable a more evidence based approach to practice and research

Choosing the research question

Consideration 1: Is the question important?

Published acupuncture randomised trials rarely cite previous systematic reviews in describing the rationale for conducting a trial, suggesting a high risk of wasteful use of research resources(web appendix 2, 2.1.1). Deciding on a trial's objective requires an understanding of the available body of evidence on related questions, which requires the availability or conduct of systematic reviews. Are there already sufficient trials exploring the specific effect of acupuncture therapies? Is there already moderate or high certainty evidence establishing treatment effects in particular settings to inform decision making? If existing systematic reviews show little or no evidence on acupuncture therapies for a target condition, investigators can conclude that an optimal randomised trial will provide proof-of-concept information. If sufficient evidence establishes a therapeutic effect on a surrogate outcome or patient important outcome under narrowly defined circumstances, moving to a pragmatic trial is likely to be appropriate (box 1, consideration 1).

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^6e9f90e3]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Increase use of existing extensive acupuncture evidence to inform recommendations

Much evidence in many clinical areas, including acupuncture, is of low certainty. When guideline developers identify relevant clinical questions, they should use the best available evidence to formulate recommendations even if it is low certainty. Evidence matrices can help guideline developers to identify relevant evidence. A 2021 evidence mapping identified systematic reviews of 1402 randomised controlled trials in acupuncture for 77 diseases, across 12 therapeutic areas, including 138 995 patients.

Improve reporting standards

Acupuncture recommendations should improve reporting of patients' condition, disease state and severity, intervention, comparator(s), and outcomes. The International Standard for Reporting Items for Practice Guideline in Healthcare (RIGHT) includes an extension that covers reporting of acupuncture guidelines and recommendations. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) and TIDieR-Placebo checklists help achieve optimal reporting of interventions and comparators.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^81a5a954]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Do guidelines make recommendations for all questions of clinical interest?

Patients and clinicians often encounter situations in which limited evidence is available to support the use of an intervention. Even when there is uncertainty, clinicians still prefer to have guidelines rather than relying on systematic reviews, as it saves time and effort. In a randomised controlled trial that presented 500 clinicians with a clinical scenario for which sparse evidence was available, 80% of participants preferred receiving a recommendation. However, 22% of the guidelines from conventional medicine organisations that included evidence on acupuncture with low or very low certainty refrained from making recommendations. For example, the 2021 US Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines on primary care management of headache mentioned acupuncture but did not make any relevant recommendation. By contrast, the UK guidelines (rightly in our view) made a conditional recommendation suggesting up to 10 sessions of acupuncture over 5–8 weeks for prevention of chronic tension type headache despite low certainty of evidence compared with no treatment.

A recent overview of reviewsfound low or very low certainty of evidence for moderate to large benefits from acupuncture in 50 diseases or conditions. Despite the substantial potential benefits documented, clinical guidelines disregarded acupuncture as an alternative in 15 of these diseases or conditions (table 1).

### Acupuncture – a critical analysis [^d5fb10da]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Even though widely used in today's clinical practice, acupuncture has remained a controversial subject. Many reviews are currently available but most lack a critical stance and some are overtly promotional. The aim of this overview is to provide a balanced, critical analysis of the existing evidence. Some of the original concepts of traditional acupuncture are not supported by good scientific evidence. Several plausible theories attempt to explain how acupuncture works but none are proved beyond doubt. The clinical effectiveness of acupuncture continues to attract controversy. Many controlled clinical trials and numerous systematic reviews of these studies have been published. Considerable problems are encountered when interpreting these data. Heterogeneity is a significant drawback of both clinical trials and systematic reviews. Some of the controversies may be resolved through the use of the new 'placebo needles' which enable researchers to adequately control for placebo effects of acupuncture. The majority of studies using such devices fails to show effects beyond a placebo response. Acupuncture has been associated with serious adverse events but most large-scale studies suggest that these are probably rare. Nonserious adverse effects occur in 7–11% of all patients. In conclusion, acupuncture remains steeped in controversy. Some findings are encouraging but others suggest that its clinical effects mainly depend on a placebo response.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^a4d4aae1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the certainty or quality of evidence in recent systematic reviews for use of acupuncture in adult health conditions?

Findings

This systematic review identified 434 systematic reviews published since 2013; of these, 127 assessed the certainty or quality of evidence of their conclusions. Overall, 82 systematic reviews regarding 56 health conditions were mapped, and most reviews concluded the certainty of evidence was low or very low.

Meaning

Despite acupuncture having been the subject of hundreds of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews for dozens of adult health conditions, there were few conclusions that had greater than low certainty of evidence.

Better use of systematic reviews is needed in decision making

With the widespread use of acupuncture therapies in clinical practice and rapid increase in research interest, it is vital to make use of the large existing body of evidence to inform clinical and policy decision making and establish funding and research agendas globally. We therefore propose the following recommendations to encourage the use of systematic reviews of acupuncture in research and healthcare decision making, which are summarised in box 1.

Box 1
Summary recommendations to increase use of acupuncture systematic reviews

Incorporate acupuncture evidence into decision making within health systems

Many consider acupuncture part of complementary and alternative medicine, which is an area about which many knowledge users have doubts about the potential value in clinical practice and health policy. In other areas of complementary and alternative medicine, however, evidence of effectiveness is limited, while in acupuncture, it is extensive.

The BMJ acupuncture collection is one of the global efforts to encourage the use of evidence to inform healthcare decision making at all levels. The collection has shown the large number of randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, and health economic evidence on acupuncture in the medical literature, which reflects the change in the integration of acupuncture in mainstream medicine. Knowledge users traditionally perceive acupuncture as an intervention supported by low quality evidence. However, this impression inconsistent with the large body of evidence on acupuncture, a substantial portion of which provides moderate or high certainty evidence of net benefit, as mentioned earlier on post-stroke aphasia. In light of the findings from the collection, international, regional, and national organisations and health systems should initiate, support, and develop more evidence informed decision making on acupuncture.

Build a joint research production effort

Knowledge users, funding agencies, and researchers should set joint research agendas to accelerate the generation, updating, evaluation, and release of evidence to provide a basis for the application of acupuncture. For example, national policy makers can communicate with funding agencies and establish research funding based on policy needs and country priorities. Research organisations can then produce evidence that matches the decision needs of healthcare systems, obtain specific research findings, and directly disseminate these findings to policy makers.

Such a system can streamline the need-production-use process and bridge the gap between emerging evidence and decision making.

### Evidence on acupuncture therapies is underused in clinical practice and health policy [^d3e670f8]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Align knowledge gaps and research with funding priorities

Areas where acupuncture therapies have shown large effects supported with low or very low certainty evidence are potentially fruitful targets for future clinical trials. Primary research needs to consider these areas when conducting future research.

Granting agencies should consider establishing targeted funding opportunities in high potential areas and avoid providing additional funding in areas where moderate or high certainty evidence has already proven interventions to be effective. As well as considering the prevalence and burden of disease, public and private research foundations can support the most promising acupuncture research areas (such as depressive disorders, migraine, opioid use disorders, and insomnia disorders) which can produce high quality evidence and support clinical and health system decision making.

### Acupuncture not supported by strong scientific evidence… [^f0c6177e]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: I am writing in regard to this article and its accompanying editorial. Both advocate for the use of acupuncture in family practice and training of physicians based on weak evidence. The authors of the editorial anecdotally report they have seen skeptical physicians change their minds about acupuncture during training. 4–6 Acupuncture is therefore based on weak scientific evidence; claims of ancient knowledge; unproven, invisible forces; and anecdotes, and only works when sold to the patient with reassuring words and hand-holding. What our patients are actually looking for is someone who will take the time to listen to them, establish trust, and show empathy. When we fall back on smoke and mirrors just to "do something, " we betray that trust. In Reply: Rather than cherry-picking positive studies and ignoring negative ones, we restricted our evidence review to meta-analyses and systematic reviews of multiple randomized controlled trials.

Our quantitative outcome comparisons and Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy table provided the reader with information on the size of treatment effects and the strength of the evidence for clinical recommendations. Although considerable effort has been expended to create placebo acupuncture devices, savvy patients are still able to tell the difference; therefore, expecting double-blind placebo in acupuncture research is typically unreasonable. Researchers should attempt to blind the evaluator because neither patients nor treating physicians can be blinded to the treatment. 3–5 Rather than anecdotes, which are stories that stand alone to make a point, these findings are based on empiric, qualitative research. Specifically, our research draws from semistructured interviews that capture both patients' and physicians' experiences. "Within the context of a qualitative research project, an anecdote does not exist.

". 6 Quotes presented in the study are data and provide exemplar representations of phenomena identified across participants, thereby indicating a pattern of experience, as opposed to a single case, as one might see in a news article portraying one person's story. The scientific articles presenting this research included patients describing benefits of receiving acupuncture, as well as patients not experiencing benefits. We agree that listening and creating trust are key elements of being a physician. Not only was the role of communication a key finding in our work, but patients and physicians reported that acupuncture helped cultivate a more open, trusting clinical relationship. 4 The authors thank Carla Fisher, PhD, our qualitative research expert, who reviewed an early draft of this letter reply and recommended content changes and improvements.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^fdbfb4ce]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Conventional medical communities increasingly consider acupuncture, contributing two thirds of all guidelines addressing acupuncture interventions. These recommendations are, however, still limited in their usefulness because of poor reporting of target populations, incomplete description of acupuncture intervention, failure to specify alternative care options, lack of comprehensive consideration of all patient important outcomes, failure to elucidate and apply patients' values and preferences, and disregard of a large portion of the available body of acupuncture evidence. While limited available evidence suggests that existing barriers to implementation of acupuncture recommendations have commonality across cultures, few research efforts have focused on implementing acupuncture guidelines.

Guideline developers should establish joint efforts to set research priorities between conventional and complementary medicine communities and follow the relevant reporting standards and checklists to produce clear, actionable, trustworthy, patient centred guidelines. A global approach to guideline implementation research is needed to increase the uptake and adherence of evidence based acupuncture guidelines in practice.

Key messages

Local, regional, or international medical organisations producing conventional guidelines, including western interventions, contributed two thirds of acupuncture related guidelines
Failure to adequately characterise patient, intervention, and comparator undermines the usefulness of acupuncture recommendations
Clinical practice guidelines often fail to consider acupuncture interventions despite evidence of benefit
Establishing collaboration between conventional and traditional complementary medicine communities may help remedy the neglect of acupuncture
Key necessary improvements in acupuncture guidelines include explicit consideration of patients' values and preferences, using entire body evidence in acupuncture, and a clearer description of interventions, comparators, and the patients to whom recommendations apply.

### Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis [^7266b783]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for migraine prophylaxis but its effectiveness is still controversial. This review (along with a companion review on 'Acupuncture for tension-type headache') represents an updated version of a Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2001, of The Cochrane Library.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in patients with migraine.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register were searched to January 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials with a post-randomization observation period of at least 8 weeks that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham acupuncture intervention or another intervention in patients with migraine.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods and results; and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. Outcomes extracted included response (outcome of primary interest), migraine attacks, migraine days, headache days and analgesic use. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated using a random-effects model.

Main Results

Twenty-two trials with 4419 participants (mean 201, median 42, range 27 to 1715) met the inclusion criteria. Six trials (including two large trials with 401 and 1715 patients) compared acupuncture to no prophylactic treatment or routine care only. After 3 to 4 months patients receiving acupuncture had higher response rates and fewer headaches. The only study with long-term follow up saw no evidence that effects dissipated up to 9 months after cessation of treatment. Fourteen trials compared a 'true' acupuncture intervention with a variety of sham interventions. Pooled analyses did not show a statistically significant superiority for true acupuncture for any outcome in any of the time windows, but the results of single trials varied considerably. Four trials compared acupuncture to proven prophylactic drug treatment. Overall in these trials acupuncture was associated with slightly better outcomes and fewer adverse effects than prophylactic drug treatment. Two small low-quality trials comparing acupuncture with relaxation (alone or in combination with massage) could not be interpreted reliably.

Authors' Conclusions

In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis was considered promising but insufficient. Now, with 12 additional trials, there is consistent evidence that acupuncture provides additional benefit to treatment of acute migraine attacks only or to routine care. There is no evidence for an effect of 'true' acupuncture over sham interventions, though this is difficult to interpret, as exact point location could be of limited importance. Available studies suggest that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, prophylactic drug treatment, and has fewer adverse effects. Acupuncture should be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^fa3e398f]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Are acupuncture guidelines evidence based?

Trustworthy guidelines are informed by systematic reviews of the best available evidence, including an assessment of the certainty of evidence and a rating of the strength of recommendations. Nearly half (49%) of the guidelines that included acupuncture interventions relied on systematic reviews, which is a higher proportion than for guidelines in general medicine (31% used systematic reviews). Roughly half of the guidelines used the GRADE approach to assessing evidence certainty and strength of recommendations, with other methods such as those of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, National Health and Medical Research Council, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, and Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine used in less than 5% of guidelines.

### Using economic evaluations to support acupuncture reimbursement decisions: current evidence and gaps [^1e6f75a5]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The process of making decisions about healthcare reimbursement is inherently complex. In addition to effectiveness and safety, social, economic, political, geographical, and institutional non-medical factors often are important in decision making.

In past decades, the process of making decisions about reimbursement has evolved, increasingly incorporating economic evaluation. In China, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, it has become one of the most critical factors determining whether a drug or a health technology can enter the reimbursement list.

Clinicians in over 183 countries, motivated by increasing evidence of effectiveness, use acupuncture, a non-pharmaceutical intervention, predominantly for pain relief but also in a wide variety of other conditions. Although private health insurance often covers acupuncture, public health insurance rarely does. Given the high prevalence of chronic pain, extensive use of acupuncture can use considerable health resources. Thus like other interventions, decisions about reimbursement for acupuncture should ideally include economic evaluation.

We summarise the current status of evidence for the economic evaluation of acupuncture, provide examples of the extent to which evidence of its cost effectiveness is used in decision making about reimbursement, raise challenges of applying the evidence to decisions about reimbursement, and provide corresponding suggestions.

### Acupuncture for the prevention of tension-type headache [^c6e1bc7a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for prevention of tension-type headache but its effectiveness is still controversial. This is an update of our Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2009 of The Cochrane Library.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED to 19 January 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 10 February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials with a post-randomisation observation period of at least eight weeks, which compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care), a sham acupuncture intervention or another prophylactic intervention in adults with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results; and assessed study risk of bias and the quality of the acupuncture intervention. The main efficacy outcome measure was response (at least 50% reduction of headache frequency) after completion of treatment (three to four months after randomisation). To assess safety/acceptability we extracted the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of participants reporting adverse effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Main Results

Twelve trials (11 included in the previous version and one newly identified) with 2349 participants (median 56, range 10 to 1265) met the inclusion criteria. Acupuncture was compared with routine care or treatment of acute headaches only in two large trials (1265 and 207 participants), but they had quite different baseline headache frequency and management in the control groups. Neither trial was blinded but trial quality was otherwise high (low risk of bias). While effect size estimates of the two trials differed considerably, the proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% reduction of headache frequency was much higher in groups receiving acupuncture than in control groups (moderate quality evidence; trial 1: 302/629 (48%) versus 121/636 (19%); risk ratio (RR) 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 3.0; trial 2: 60/132 (45%) versus 3/75 (4%); RR 11; 95% CI 3.7 to 35). Long-term effects (beyond four months) were not investigated. Acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture in seven trials of moderate to high quality (low risk of bias); five large studies provided data for one or more meta-analyses. Among participants receiving acupuncture, 205 of 391 (51%) had at least 50% reduction of headache frequency compared to 133 of 312 (43%) in the sham group after treatment (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.5; four trials; moderate quality evidence). Results six months after randomisation were similar. Withdrawals were low: 1 of 420 participants receiving acupuncture dropped out due to adverse effects and 0 of 343 receiving sham (six trials; low quality evidence). Three trials reported the number of participants reporting adverse effects: 29 of 174 (17%) with acupuncture versus 12 of 103 with sham (12%; odds ratio (OR) 1.3; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.7; low quality evidence). Acupuncture was compared with physiotherapy, massage or exercise in four trials of low to moderate quality (high risk of bias); study findings were inadequately reported. No trial found a significant superiority of acupuncture and for some outcomes the results slightly favoured the comparison therapy. None of these trials reported the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects or the number of participants reporting adverse effects. Overall, the quality of the evidence assessed using GRADE was moderate or low, downgraded mainly due to a lack of blinding and variable effect sizes.

Authors' Conclusions

The available results suggest that acupuncture is effective for treating frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches, but further trials - particularly comparing acupuncture with other treatment options - are needed.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^e872f4f6]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Acupuncture is the most widely used traditional and complementary medicine, used in 113 of 120 countries according to a 2019 World Health Organization report. In addition to registered acupuncturists, medical doctors, nurse practitioners, and chiropractors occasionally deliver acupuncture treatment. Despite its widespread use and considerable available evidence, until recently, clinical practice guidelines from conventional medical organisations rarely included recommendations on acupuncture. Clinical practice guidelines aim to optimise patient care, and must meet standards of trustworthiness to avoid misleading clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders. We begin by summarising the progress made then address deficiencies that limit the clinical usefulness of acupuncture guidelines, examine the barriers to inclusion of acupuncture in guidelines, and suggest how to overcome them.

### How to design high quality acupuncture trials-a consensus informed by evidence [^e9ebda9c]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

We have produced guidance to consider before and during the design of acupuncture trials to deal with the unique challenges and the most prevalent concerns in current acupuncture trials (box 1). With the rapid growth of published acupuncture trials and upcoming funding opportunities worldwide in integrative medicine, failure to enhance the rigour of acupuncture trials will result in additional research waste. This guidance highlights the importance of granting agencies and researchers carefully considering the need for research in the trial planning and funding processes. Our guidance will help both researchers and granting agencies consider the critical decisions linking trial design and its inferences and application to produce trials that facilitate healthcare decision making.

### Acupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine [^9ac86138]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for migraine prevention but its effectiveness is still controversial. We present an update of our Cochrane review from 2009.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January 2016); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications to April 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no-acupuncture control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham-acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with episodic migraine.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache days if migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50% frequency reduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our updated selection criteria. We excluded five previously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and included five new trials. Five trials had a no-acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non-regulated routine care), 15 a sham-acupuncture control group, and five a comparator group receiving prophylactic drug treatment. In comparisons with no-acupuncture control groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as blinding was not possible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate. Comparison with no acupunctureAcupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.56; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I² = 57%; moderate quality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no acupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 7%; moderate quality evidence). The only trial with post-treatment follow-up found a small but significant benefit 12 months after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence). Comparison with sham acupunctureBoth after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a small but statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was -0.18 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.08; I² = 47%) after treatment and -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.09; I² = 59%) at follow-up. After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 50% of participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; I² = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow-up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; I² = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants; moderate quality evidence). The corresponding NNTBs are 11 (95% CI 7.00 to 20.00) and 10 (95% CI 6.00 to 18.00), respectively. The number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality evidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate quality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture and sham groups. Comparison with prophylactic drug treatmentAcupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment (SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.10; 3 trials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; 3 trials, 744 participants; moderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving acupuncture and 46% receiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I² being 0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving acupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse effects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that adding acupuncture to symptomatic treatment of attacks reduces the frequency of headaches. Contrary to the previous findings, the updated evidence also suggests that there is an effect over sham, but this effect is small. The available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long-term studies, more than one year in duration, are lacking.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^cb2f47d8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Despite the large literature on acupuncture, most reviews concluded that their confidence in the effect was limited. Thus, the most important research need is for better evidence to move these certainty-of-evidence assessments upward, such that clinicians, patients, and policy makers can have more confidence that acupuncture does, or does not, have benefit for a certain health condition. Studies comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham are probably not the priority for reasons stated in the Limitations section; rather, the priority should be studies comparing acupuncture with other recommended, accepted, or active therapies for the condition. Facilitating new studies of adequate rigor that mitigate the limitations of existing studies sufficient to raise the certainty of evidence would be the best way to try and expand the access of acupuncture to the patients most likely to benefit from it. In the 9 years covered by this update, we identified 434 new systematic reviews of acupuncture. This compares to an approximately equal number of new randomized clinical trials of acupuncture published in the same time period and included in the systematic reviews on our map. Thus, researchers interested in acupuncture are producing about as many systematic reviews (that generally conclude the certainty of evidence is low or very low) as new randomized clinical trials needed to raise the certainty of evidence. This seems to be a mismatch between resources and need. The field of acupuncture would be best moved forward with resources devoted to producing more high quality randomized clinical trials and producing fewer new systematic reviews.

### Is acupuncture an effective postherpetic neuralgia treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^dee6aec4]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This review has several limitations. Although we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, we found few English language studies of acupuncture for PHN. Furthermore, there have been persistent discrepancies in the definition of PHN. Some have reported that pain persisting 30 days or more after rash onset can be defined as PHN, while others have used persistent pain for 120 days as their definition. Although similar reviews have published evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PHN, we sought more information, focusing on the advantages of acupuncture therapy over pharmacologic therapy. Through our review, there is a need for more studies to conduct subgroup analyses on pain persistence.

Clinical implications

This review finds that acupuncture is beneficial for PHN, especially for associated pain relief. It can provide a treatment option for clinicians worried about adverse effects of drugs, and evidence-based evidence for acupuncturist. The findings of this review support the view that acupuncture is an effective PHN treatment.

### Acupuncture: what does the most reliable evidence tell us? [^3fc09f49]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Many trials of acupuncture and numerous systematic reviews have recently become available. Their conclusions are far from uniform. In an attempt to find the most reliable type of evidence, this article provides an overview of Cochrane reviews of acupuncture. Such reviews were studied, their details extracted, and they were categorized as: reviews with a negative conclusion (no evidence that acupuncture is effective); reviews that were inconclusive; and reviews with a positive or tentatively positive conclusion. Thirty-two reviews were found, covering a wide range of conditions. Twenty-five of them failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of acupuncture. Five reviews arrived at positive or tentatively positive conclusions and two were inconclusive. The conditions that are most solidly backed up by evidence are chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and idiopathic headache. It is concluded that Cochrane reviews of acupuncture do not suggest that this treatment is effective for a wide range of conditions.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^b4982286]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain — Acupuncture recommendations state that in patients with low back pain, there is conflicting evidence that acupuncture provides improvements in pain and function as compared to sham acupuncture (Grade of Recommendation: I). In patients with chronic low back pain, addition of acupuncture to usual care is recommended for short-term improvement of pain and function compared to usual care alone (Grade of Recommendation: A). There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of acupuncture techniques (Grade of Recommendation: I).

### Acupuncture analgesia during surgery: a systematic review [^5e2fd962]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjunctive analgesic method to standard anaesthetic procedures for surgery and to determine whether acupuncture has any analgesic-sparing effect. Electronic literature searches for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture during surgery were performed in seven electronic databases. No language restrictions were imposed. All included studies were rated according to their methodological quality and validity. As the studies were clinically heterogeneous, no meta-analyses were performed. The evidence was classified according to four levels: strong, moderate, limited, or inconclusive. Nineteen RCTs were identified. Seven of them suggested that acupuncture is efficacious. Of nine high-quality RCTs, two studies had positive outcomes. There was no significant association between study quality and direction of outcome. One of eight high-validity trials reported a positive outcome and there was a significant relationship between validity and direction of outcome. The evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no acupuncture as an adjunct to standard anaesthetic procedures is therefore inconclusive. Strong evidence exists that real acupuncture is not significantly different from placebo acupuncture. For an analgesic-sparing effect of acupuncture, evidence remains inconclusive. In conclusion, this review does not support the use of acupuncture as an adjunct to standard anaesthetic procedures during surgery.

### Evidence on acupuncture therapies is underused in clinical practice and health policy [^ce73bb20]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Identified research opportunities are underfunded

Promising acupuncture therapies (large effect supported by low certainty evidence) represent potentially fruitful future clinical research targets, and thus require further investigation and research funding support. The overview of systematic reviews found that in 33 outcomes for 22 conditions, acupuncture showed a promising effect. Existing funding and research endeavours in these areas have, however, increased little in the past decade.

Take three diseases or conditions in which acupuncture showed promising effects as an example. Depressive disorders, migraine, and opioid use disorders are prevalent and associated with a high disease burden globally. Depressive disorders affect more than 120 million people worldwide and cause functional impairment and social dysfunction, reduce the productivity of people who suffer from these conditions, and increase the risk of suicide and long term mortality. Migraine affects about 1.04 billion people and causes $5.6bn to $17.2bn (£4.2bn to £12.9bn) annual lost labour costs. Opioid use disorders affect 40.5 million people globally and lead to 109 500 deaths annually. A 2018 burden of disease study in the US reported that according to the ranking of years lived with disability, depressive disorders, migraine, and opioid use disorders ranked the second, fifth, and eighth most prevalent disease nationally.

In the US — one of the most science and technology focused countries — we looked at the underuse of existing systematic reviews for funding opportunities. In the past decade, among all acupuncture projects funded by the National Institutes of Health, four targeted opioid use disorders, with $1.09m of funding, which accounted for only 3.1% of the National Institutes of Health acupuncture funding. Depressive disorders and migraine received no funding. Even though acupuncture therapies have shown large effects supported by low certainty evidence for all three of these prevalent and high burden diseases, they received limited funding for further investigation.

Clinical studies on acupuncture seldom cite evidence from existing systematic reviews in their rationale for conducting the study. Randomised controlled trials are a popular design in acupuncture research. A systematic survey identified that only 31 out of 584 randomised controlled trials on acupuncture published between 2015 and 2019 cited previous systematic reviews when describing the rationale for conducting the trial. This situation suggests low use of systematic reviews in primary research.

### Evidence on acupuncture therapies is underused in clinical practice and health policy [^7e747e43]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Digitise and disseminate evidence on acupuncture to facilitate access

Online digitised evidence matrices, created by a team of acupuncture researchers in collaboration with the Epistemonikos Foundation, is a good start for digitisation. The team produced evidence matrices mapping systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials on acupuncture for 77 diseases, across 12 therapeutic areas, including 1402 trials and 138 995 patients. (For an example of the digitised matrices on acupuncture for non-specific lower back pain, see:.) Patients, clinicians, and policy makers can easily access the body of evidence supporting healthcare decisions. Researchers can quickly identify systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials and determine knowledge gaps and the need for new systematic reviews.

Setting up additional dissemination efforts can also be helpful. For example, research institutions and medical organisations can identify clinical or policy audiences and create tailored messages derived from the systematic reviews, using social media, websites, subscription emails, newsletters, and conferences to distribute the latest research findings.

Enable the use of existing evidence in health system decision making

In areas where acupuncture therapy has shown moderate or large effects supported by moderate or high certainty evidence, it validates its widespread use. Patients, clinicians, health policy makers, and health insurance companies should use the latest body of evidence to assist clinical or health system decisions-making.

For knowledge users, creating opportunities and encouraging the links and exchanges between researchers, clinicians, and policy makers will facilitate the use of existing acupuncture research evidence. Key stakeholders can engage in dialogue with researchers to discuss their views and experiences related to the evidence. Furthermore, researchers can provide a summary of findings or develop specific messages for policy makers to facilitate the use and application of the evidence on acupuncture.

Healthcare decision making is complex, with stakeholders often taking into account many factors (eg, treatment effects, economic implications of an intervention, importance of the problem, and feasibility of application). When clear selection criteria are absent, decision-makers might overlook essential factors, assign more importance to less critical factors, or not use the best available evidence to inform their judgement. The health system and public health GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Evidence to Decision framework provides a transparent and structured framework to support evidence informed policies. The Evidence to Decision framework ensures consideration of the best available evidence and all important factors. When making coverage decisions or producing clinical practice guidelines, decision makers should consider using the Evidence to Decision framework to integrate acupuncture evidence for health system decision making.

### Acupuncture therapy as an evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategy for comprehensive acute pain care: the academic consortium pain task force white paper update [^9affa53b]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Our narrative review includes 22 SRs, of which 17 have meta-analyses, and it supports the feasibility and benefit of acupuncture therapy as an effective standalone or adjunct intervention in acute perioperative pain and acute pain in the ED or urgent care setting. The evidence supporting effectiveness, safety, reduced need for opioids and NSAIDs, and improved patient satisfaction is a compelling reason for acupuncture therapy to be covered for acute pain by public and private insurance. Policy barriers preventing licensed acupuncturists from being Medicare-billing providers need to be addressed. Health care practitioners and administrators need training in the evidence base for acupuncture therapy, and they need to advocate for policy initiatives that remedy systemic reimbursement barriers to evidence-based comprehensive pain care strategies. The support, promotion, and dissemination of ongoing research into the expanding role of effective nonpharmacologic treatments for pain will need to continue to address both the short- and long-term therapeutic and economic impact of comprehensive pain care practices. Multimodal pain care is now recognized as the optimal, inclusive, and responsive approach to patients experiencing pain: incorporating all evidence-based therapies, including effective nonpharmacologic strategies is responsive to patients' diverse and evolving needs.

### Acupuncture for idiopathic headache [^215c7c97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is widely used for the treatment of headache, but its effectiveness is controversial.

Objectives

To determine whether acupuncture is: - more effective than no treatment - more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture - as effective as other interventions used to treat idiopathic (primary) headaches.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the database of the Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine. We also contacted researchers in the field and checked the bibliographies of all articles obtained.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing acupuncture with any type of control intervention for the treatment of idiopathic (primary) headaches were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, methods, and results was extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a pre-tested standard form. Results on headache frequency and intensity were summarized descriptively. Responder rate ratios (responder rate in treatment group/responder rate in control group) were calculated as a crude indicator of results for sham-acupuncture-controlled trials. Quantitative meta-analysis was not possible due to trial heterogeneity and insufficient reporting.

Main Results

Twenty-six trials including a total of 1151 patients (median, 37; range, 10–150) met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen trials were conducted among patients with migraine, six among patients with tension-type headache, and four among patients with various types of headaches. The majority of trials had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings. In eight of the 16 trials comparing true and sham (placebo) acupuncture in migraine and tension-type headache patients, true acupuncture was reported to be significantly superior; in four trials there was a trend in favor of true acupuncture; and in two trials there was no difference between the two interventions. (Two trials were uninterpretable.) The 10 trials comparing acupuncture with other forms of treatment yielded contradictory results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Overall, the existing evidence supports the value of acupuncture for the treatment of idiopathic headaches. However, the quality and amount of evidence are not fully convincing. There is an urgent need for well-planned, large-scale studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture under real-life conditions.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^8c5b30ce]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Which guidelines include acupuncture recommendations?

More than 1300 consensus and evidence based clinical practice guidelines were published between 1991 and 2007, and these included 2189 recommendations on the use of acupuncture. Two thirds of these recommendations focused on pain related conditions. Guidelines that include acupuncture fall into three types: those including acupuncture with conventional interventions, those restricted to traditional and complementary medicine, and those covering acupuncture only.

Although researchers have criticised the exclusion of acupuncture interventions from clinical guidelines, conventional medicine is increasingly including acupuncture as one more relevant intervention. For example, between 2010 and 2020, 133 guidelines included more than 430 acupuncture recommendations worldwide (fig 1). Over 70% of these guidelines were produced by conventional medical organisations, with the remainder published by organisations focused on traditional and complementary medicine in China, South Korea, and Australia. Acupuncture was most commonly recommended for musculoskeletal and connective tissue disease; neurological disorders; obstetrics, gynaecology, and women's health; oncology; and gastrointestinal disorders.

### Is acupuncture beneficial in depression: a meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials? [^d9add4ed]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders. Acupuncture is a popular complementary and alternative medicine intervention suggested in the treatment of depression, but its effectiveness is uncertain. This updated meta-analysis was conducted to more precisely assess the beneficial effect of acupuncture in depression therapy.

Methods

The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database. The following terms were used: acupuncture, acupressure, depression, depressive disorder, clinical trial, and randomized controlled trial.

Results

Eight small-randomized controlled trials comparing 477 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. Our results confirmed that acupuncture could significantly reduce the severity of depression, which was indicated by decreased scores of Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) or Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The pooled standardized mean difference of the 'Improvement of depression' was -0.65 (95% CI -1.18, -0.11; P = 0.02) by random effect model. However, no significant effect of active acupuncture was found on the response rate (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.10; P = 0.25) and remission rate (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.95; P = 0.53).

Conclusion

Although this meta-analysis might be discounted due to the low quality of individual trials, it supported that acupuncture was an effective treatment that could significantly reduce the severity of disease in the patients with depression. More full-scale randomized clinical trials with reliable designs are recommended to further warrant the effectiveness of acupuncture.

### Acupuncture for depression [^e346e705]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There is interest from the community in the use of self help and complementary therapies for depression. This review examined the currently available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture to treat depression.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of acupuncture in the treatment for depression.

Search Strategy

The following databases were searched: CCDAN-CTR, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2008), PSYCINFO (1874 to Dec 2008), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), CINAHL (1980 to Dec 2008), Wan Fang database (to Dec 2008). The following terms were used: depression, depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and acupuncture.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, no treatment, pharmacological treatment, other structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy or counselling), or standard care. The following modes of treatment were included: acupuncture, electro acupuncture or laser acupuncture. The participants included adult men and women with depression defined by clinical state description, or diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), International Classification of Disease (ICD) or the Criteria for Classification and Diagnosis of Mental Diseases CCMD-3-R.

Data Collection and Analysis

Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk for dichotomous outcomes and standard mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were reduction in the severity of depression, measured by self rating scales, or by clinician rated scales and an improvement in depression defined as remission versus no remission.

Main Results

This review is an update and now contains data from 30 studies. Following recent searches, 23 new studies have been added and a further 11 trials were excluded (due to suboptimal doses of medication, no clinical outcomes, insufficient reporting). Thirty trials with 2,812 participants are included in the meta-analysis. There was a high risk of bias in the majority of trials. There was insufficient evidence of a consistent beneficial effect from acupuncture compared with a wait list control or sham acupuncture control. Two trials found acupuncture may have an additive benefit when combined with medication compared with medication alone. A subgroup of participants with depression as a co-morbidity experienced a reduction in depression with manual acupuncture compared with SSRIs (RR 1.66, 95%CI 1.03, 2.68) (three trials, 94 participants). The majority of trials compared manual and electro acupuncture with medication and found no effect between groups.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of acupuncture for people with depression. The results are limited by the high risk of bias in the majority of trials meeting inclusion criteria.

### Acupuncture therapy as an evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategy for comprehensive acute pain care: the academic consortium pain task force white paper update [^5a932178]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The need for evidence-based comprehensive pain care strategies is based on insufficient management of acute pain, continued reliance on opioids for acute pain, the risk associated with opioids, and the ongoing rise in opioid deaths. This review of reviews and meta-analyses supports acupuncture therapy as a viable strategy for acute pain care.

### Acupuncture: is it effective for treatment of insulin resistance? [^fa4e075f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), non-alcohol fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome and is also a risk factor for serious diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacological treatments available for IR are limited by drug adverse effects. Because acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China, it has been increasingly used worldwide for IR-related diseases. This review analyses 234 English publications listed on the PubMed database between 1979 and 2009 on the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for IR. These publications provide clinical evidence, although limited, in support of the effectiveness of acupuncture in IR. At this stage, well-designed, evidence-based clinical randomized controlled trial studies are therefore needed to confirm the effects of acupuncture on IR. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can correct various metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia, overweight, hyperphagia, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, altered activity of the sympathetic nervous system and insulin signal defect, all of which contribute to the development of IR. In addition, acupuncture has the potential to improve insulin sensitivity. The evidence has revealed the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of acupuncture, though further investigations are warranted.

### Acupuncture: a treatment for breakthrough pain in cancer? [^af61ece2]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Context

Patients with chronic cancer pain frequently suffer severe exacerbations of pain intensity which are difficult to control adequately via pharmaceutical management. Management of these episodes of breakthrough pain (BTP) presents a challenge both to the physician and the patient, and supplemental 'rescue' doses of opioids required to control BTP can produce intolerable side-effects and often do not act rapidly enough to provide adequate analgesia. There is very little evidence to support the use of acupuncture for BTP in cancer and few studies have considered the rapidity of the analgesic response to acupuncture for any type of pain. However, the available physiological evidence provides a convincing rationale and one which warrants research.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to debate the available physiological evidence for a rapid analgesic response to acupuncture in the context of the needs of the patient with cancer BTP, current interventions, acupuncture technique and the practical considerations involved in administering treatment rapidly and safely.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests that acupuncture has the potential to produce rapid and effective analgesia when needles are inserted deeply enough and manipulated sufficiently. For cancer BTP this represents a possible adjunctive treatment, and consideration should be given to administering acupuncture alongside 'rescue' doses of medication to 'kick-start' the analgesic response before the medication takes effect. However, research is needed to provide evidence that acupuncture is effective for BTP in cancer, and the feasibility, practicality and safety of patients administering acupuncture themselves must also be taken into account.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^54c9f718]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pain is a distressing symptom experienced by more than 70% of patients with cancer but inadequately controlled in nearly 50% of these patients. Although the World Health Organization analgesic ladder provides effectual approaches to relieve cancer pain, addiction to analgesics and the adverse effects of pharmacological interventions pose critical challenges to pain management. Because pain is multidimensional, a multidisciplinary, comprehensive approach is needed to control pain successfully.

The ongoing opioid crisis in the United States exacerbates the challenges surrounding cancer pain management, with government organizations calling for the use of nonpharmacological interventionson the basis of increasing clinical evidence. Leading organizations in the field, such as the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, recommend nonpharmacological interventions, such as acupuncture, for managing cancer pain.

Research on acupuncture for cancer pain has been growing, but the findings have been inconsistent. Although more than 20 systematic reviews were conducted to establish the association of acupuncture with cancer pain, none arrived at a definitive conclusion. In addition, more rigorous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and related therapies published in recent years were not included in previous systematic reviews. For example, a multicenter RCT of acupuncture published in 2018 found that patients with early-stage breast cancer who received aromatase inhibitor therapy experienced significant pain relief. The reduction in pain reported in this 2018 study was clinically relevant.

In light of the growing number of RCTs of acupuncture or acupressure use for cancer pain and the ensuing need for critical evaluation, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence to inform clinical practice. The specific research questions were as follows: (1) Are acupuncture and acupressure associated with reduction in cancer pain compared with sham control or usual care control? (2) Is the combination of acupuncture and acupressure associated with reduction in analgesic use in patients with cancer?

### Acupuncture for tension-type headache [^8ca0921c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for tension-type headache prophylaxis but its effectiveness is still controversial. This review (along with a companion review on 'Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis') represents an updated version of a Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2001, of The Cochrane Library.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register were searched to January 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials with a post-randomization observation period of at least 8 weeks that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care), a sham acupuncture intervention or another intervention in patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods and results; and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. Outcomes extracted included response (at least 50% reduction of headache frequency; outcome of primary interest), headache days, pain intensity and analgesic use.

Main Results

Eleven trials with 2317 participants (median 62, range 10 to 1265) met the inclusion criteria. Two large trials compared acupuncture to treatment of acute headaches or routine care only. Both found statistically significant and clinically relevant short-term (up to 3 months) benefits of acupuncture over control for response, number of headache days and pain intensity. Long-term effects (beyond 3 months) were not investigated. Six trials compared acupuncture with a sham acupuncture intervention, and five of the six provided data for meta-analyses. Small but statistically significant benefits of acupuncture over sham were found for response as well as for several other outcomes. Three of the four trials comparing acupuncture with physiotherapy, massage or relaxation had important methodological or reporting shortcomings. Their findings are difficult to interpret, but collectively suggest slightly better results for some outcomes in the control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for tension-type headache was considered insufficient. Now, with six additional trials, the authors conclude that acupuncture could be a valuable non-pharmacological tool in patients with frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches.

### What is the acupoint? A preliminary review of acupoints [^c384db2d]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, acupoints are specifically chosen sites of acupuncture manipulation, and also the basis for studying the mechanism of acupuncture. Stimulating different acupoints on the body surface could provide various therapeutic benefits. However, what is the acupoint? This question is not clear.

Review Summary

We focuse on examining the function of acupoints from different perspectives, including the local and the systemic effects of stimulating acupoints. For example, acupoints may release certain substances or incur some changes, which could adjust the function of organs, maintain homeostasis. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of verum acupoints versus sham acupoints were discussed. However, due to insufficience in evidence and in current methodologies, research into mechanisms of acupuncture is still incomplete.

Conclusion

This review might explain, to some extent, what an acupoint is. Further research into the identity of acupoints is warranted, and multidisciplinary methods using novel technologies may yield significant advances over existing knowledge.

### Acupuncture for insomnia [^2078903b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with insomnia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), TCMLARS (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to 2006, and the sleep bibliography, which is available at www.websciences.org/bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving participants of any age with any type of insomnia were included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo or sham or no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were excluded, since they did not yield the net effect of acupuncture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality according to a set of criteria for risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Data were combined in meta-analyses (on an intention-to-treat basis), where more than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity presented the same outcome.

Main Results

Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 590 participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped out. Participant age ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia varied from 6 months to 19 years. Co-existing medical conditions contributing to insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart from conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture such as acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) were evaluated. Meta-analysis was limited because of considerable heterogeneity between comparison groups and between outcome measures. Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores when compared to placebo (SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31, p = 0.006) or no treatment (SMD -0.55, 95% CI = -0.89 to -0.21, p = 0.002). TEAS also resulted in better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD = -0.74, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.26, p = 0.003). However, the efficacy of acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent between studies for many sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total sleep duration and wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or its variants was not more significantly effective than control (RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study reported an adverse event, with one out of 16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from acupuncture because of pain.

Authors' Conclusions

The small number of randomised controlled trials, together with the poor methodological quality and significant clinical heterogeneity, means that the current evidence is not sufficiently extensive or rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate randomisation concealment and blinding with longer follow-up are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

### Acupuncture versus standard medical care in the prophylactic treatment of migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^40d08d2f]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The synthesis of available evidence suggests that acupuncture can be added to the therapeutic toolkit for patients with migraine. However, it should be emphasized that acupuncture should not be proposed as a replacement for other pharmacological preventive therapies, which are considered effective and often decisive for patients. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety profile of acupuncture should still be highlighted, and it can be offered as an adjunctive therapy for patients or as an alternative treatment when conventional therapies cannot be used.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis, as compared to others, includes only studies comparing acupuncture and drugs in the prophylactic management of migraine, without considering the role of acupuncture as an acute treatment for migraine. Given the extreme heterogeneity of the studies in this field, with outcomes that are highly variable and difficult to compare, separating the treatment of the acute phase from the preventive phase is essential to provide clarity. Furthermore, we used a search string that included all pharmacological therapies currently used for prevention and authorized by the guidelines, including CGRP‐targeting pharmacological therapies, which have not been considered as comparators so far. Findings suggest that the effects of acupuncture and its tolerability are sustained over time, indicating that it can be used long‐term by patients for both episodic and chronic forms.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^1a322640]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Acupuncture is a technique that is part of a larger system of care originating in China and other Asian countries dating back to the 12th century. Acupuncture has been practiced in China for more than 3000 years and was spread to Europe and the United States from the 16th to the 19th century. The history of acupuncture research was initiated in the 18th century and developed rapidly since then. Trained practitioners stimulate specific points on the body by inserting thin needles into the skin with the intention of restoring and balancing the qi or energy of the mind and body and promoting health. Acupuncture has been the subject of a vast number of randomized trials and of systematic reviews of randomized trials. In an effort to categorize this evidence base for use in decision-making by policy makers and practitioners, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) produced an evidence map in 2014 that included systematic reviews published through 2012. An evidence map is a form of systemic review that assesses a broad field to identify the state of the evidence, gaps in knowledge, and future research needs and that presents the results in a user-friendly format, often a visual figure or graph. As all the reviews published in 2012 or earlier can be assumed to be out of dateand as new evidence continues to accumulate, VA policy makers requested a new evidence map of reviews published since 2012 to answer the question, "What is the certainty of evidence in systematic reviews of acupuncture for adult health conditions?"

### Acupuncture for insomnia [^852c948a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate.

Main Results

Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure. Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^2a18d031]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations

Joint guideline development and definitive integration into patient care

When deciding on treatment, patients should have access to evidence supporting all reasonable care options regardless of whether they belong to conventional, traditional, or complementary medicine. When existing guidelines have compared acupuncture with other interventions, acupuncture specific guidelines can provide more specificity by considering different forms of acupuncture.

Conventional medical societies should collaborate with specialised acupuncture medical associations to increase the consideration of acupuncture treatments in recommendations. Collaboration can occur at two levels — firstly, in establishing joint priorities on critical clinical questions to consider in clinical guidelines, including acupuncture. For instance, collaboration would facilitate comprehensive guidelines focusing on whether acupuncture for headache prevention should be recommended versus no intervention or usual care, while acupuncture specific guidelines can concentrate on the optimal type of acupuncture, point selection, and duration of acupuncture treatment. Secondly, collaboration could facilitate recruiting a broad range of clinical experts to guideline panels.

An example of such a type of collaboration is reflected in the production of the first global acupuncture guideline, a joint effort between conventional medicine, traditional and complementary medicine, and acupuncture specific societies. The World Federation of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Society recently developed the first international acupuncture guideline for treating depression. This effort included 21 expert panels from Australia, South Korea, Germany, Norway, the USA, and China. Several international medical societies have endorsed the guideline. Such joint efforts could improve efficiency, reduce research waste, facilitate guidelines dissemination, and encourage the uptake of recommendations in clinical practice.

Produce more patient centric guidelines and recommendations

When making acupuncture recommendations, guidelines should summarise all patient important benefits, harms, and burdens of the competing interventions and specify the values and preferences underlying their recommendations, including how they arrived at those values. To ensure a consistent understanding of outcomes when discussing evidence, guideline developers should create standard health outcome descriptors (or marker states) — presentations in lay terms that describe the symptoms, time horizon (when and how long the outcome will persist), testing and treatment required, and consequences.

Estimates of the relative importance patients place on different outcomes can come from systematic reviews of primary studies, surveys, or focus groups. Including patient partners in the panel may provide additional insights about patients' perspectives.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^6d0cbdb2]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acupuncture for tinnitus management — The Work Group categorized this as a Reviewed, New-added recommendation with low confidence in the quality of evidence; evidence comparing different types of acupuncture was mixed, benefits for critical outcomes slightly outweighed small potential harms, and patient values varied because some patients dislike needles; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against acupuncture for tinnitus management.

### Acupuncture versus standard medical care in the prophylactic treatment of migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f12cf83a]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Regardless of these considerations, acupuncture could be highly beneficial for some subgroups of patients, including adolescents, pregnant women, and individuals with a long history of chronic migraine. The former can benefit from acupuncture due to its excellent tolerability and the low incidence of side effects, while the latter may benefit from the acupuncture‐related reversal of central sensitization processes.

In conclusion, the use of acupuncture can help expand our therapeutic toolkit available for patient care, especially for the more vulnerable individuals and those with more complex conditions. Future evidence will show how acupuncture treatment may be integrated with the latest and most selective treatments.

### Acupuncture versus standard medical care in the prophylactic treatment of migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^268d054b]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although innovative pharmacological therapies for migraine prevention are now available, they may not be suitable or effective for all patients due to concerns about tolerability and the varying complexity of the underlying condition. This study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed acupuncture's effects on migraine prophylaxis compared to standard medical care, focusing on study heterogeneity and issues related to sham interventions.

Methods

Following the PRISMA guidelines and using the PICO model, the study searched PubMed, Scopus, CNKI, and VIP database from December 1965 to September 2024. Studies evaluating acupuncture's clinical efficacy for migraine prophylaxis, including clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports, were considered. An additional search was conducted on the clinicaltrials.gov database from the beginning of indexing up to September 2024 to include ongoing studies. Quality control and bias assessment were performed. Primary outcomes focused on acupuncture's efficacy and safety versus pharmacological treatments in reducing migraine frequency and intensity. The impact on patients' quality of life was also evaluated.

Results

At the end of the selection process, 15 studies were eligible. Acupuncture showed no statistically significant difference as a prophylactic treatment for migraine in reducing the frequency of migraine days or pain intensity but did reduce the use of analgesics while improving patients' quality of life.

Conclusion

Current evidence supports acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in migraine prophylaxis, but challenges such as protocol heterogeneity, dropout biases, the complexities of sham-controlled trials, and the lack of comparison data with newer innovative treatments not yet considered warrant further research.

### Evidence on acupuncture therapies is underused in clinical practice and health policy [^62f7c8f8]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

13 Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada

Many doctors and patients worldwide now use acupuncture, a technique of traditional Chinese medicine that originated 2000 years ago. While traditional Chinese medicin e theory attributes the effect of acupuncture to the stimulation at specific body regions (acupoints) on the meridian channels (that is, paths through which the vital energy known as "qi" flows) to modulate body physiology, modern science has increasingly provided evidence on the biology of the effect of acupuncture. This evidence shows that acupuncture works to stimulate reflexes that activate peripheral nerves, transmit sensory information from the spinal cord to the brain, then activate peripheral autonomic pathways, and eventually modulate physiology.

Along with research into the underlying biology and increasingly wide clinical use of acupuncture, clinical research on acupuncture has also grown. Since 1975, more than 10 000 randomised controlled trials on acupuncture have been published. Given the rapid increase in the literature on acupuncture, evidence based practice and policy making require systematic reviews of the available randomised controlled trials.

In this analysis, we assess the number and quality of systematic reviews of acupuncture, explore the possible underuse of proven beneficial acupuncture therapies in clinical practice and health policy, identify the promising and under-researched areas, and propose strategies to implement effective acupuncture treatments and establish funding opportunities and research agendas for acupuncture therapies.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^c182c0f4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Acupuncture is a popular treatment that has been advocated for dozens of adult health conditions and has a vast evidence base.

Objective

To map the systematic reviews, conclusions, and certainty or quality of evidence for outcomes of acupuncture as a treatment for adult health conditions.

Evidence Review

Computerized search of PubMed and 4 other databases from 2013 to 2021. Systematic reviews of acupuncture (whole body, auricular, or electroacupuncture) for adult health conditions that formally rated the certainty, quality, or strength of evidence for conclusions. Studies of acupressure, fire acupuncture, laser acupuncture, or traditional Chinese medicine without mention of acupuncture were excluded. Health condition, number of included studies, type of acupuncture, type of comparison group, conclusions, and certainty or quality of evidence. Reviews with at least 1 conclusion rated as high-certainty evidence, reviews with at least 1 conclusion rated as moderate-certainty evidence, and reviews with all conclusions rated as low- or very low-certainty evidence; full list of all conclusions and certainty of evidence.

Findings

A total of 434 systematic reviews of acupuncture for adult health conditions were found; of these, 127 reviews used a formal method to rate certainty or quality of evidence of their conclusions, and 82 reviews were mapped, covering 56 health conditions. Across these, there were 4 conclusions that were rated as high-certainty evidence, and 31 conclusions that were rated as moderate-certainty evidence. All remaining conclusions (> 60) were rated as low- or very low-certainty evidence. Approximately 10% of conclusions rated as high or moderate-certainty were that acupuncture was no better than the comparator treatment, and approximately 75% of high- or moderate-certainty evidence conclusions were about acupuncture compared with a sham or no treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite a vast number of randomized trials, systematic reviews of acupuncture for adult health conditions have rated only a minority of conclusions as high- or moderate-certainty evidence, and most of these were about comparisons with sham treatment or had conclusions of no benefit of acupuncture. Conclusions with moderate or high-certainty evidence that acupuncture is superior to other active therapies were rare.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^c3254eca]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain (LBP) acupuncture added to routine medical care — patients with LBP for more than 6 months were randomized to receive up to 15 sessions of acupuncture in addition to routine medical care (n = 1,549) or routine medical care alone (n = 1,544), with back function, back pain and quality of life improving significantly more in the acupuncture group compared to the control group at a 3-month follow-up; the cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that acupuncture was relatively cost-effective, and Level I therapeutic evidence indicates that, at 3 months, acupuncture shows improvement in pain and function compared to routine care (routine care not defined), though these results were not sustained at 6 months.

### The efficacy and safety of acupuncture for depression-related insomnia: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^81969749]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a bidirectional relationship between depression and insomnia. Depression-related insomnia is common and remains a challenging medical condition. Although acupuncture might be a potential treatment option and increasing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have emerged, currently available evidence regarding the effect and safety of acupuncture on depression-related insomnia remains inconclusive. Thus, this protocol aims to systematically synthesize the evidence about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for depression-related insomnia.

Methods and Analysis

Eligible RCTs will be searched in nine representative databases and pooled in meta-analyses using RevMan 5.3. The methodological quality of included studies will be rated by Cochrane's risk of bias 2.0 tool. The quality of evidence will be appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias will also be conducted.

Discussion

This protocol outlines the planned scope and methodology for an upcoming systematic review meta-analysis, which will critically synthesize the evidence about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on depression-related insomnia. Findings will shed light on fulfilling evidence gaps and influence evidence-based treatment decisions for clinicians in the treatment of depression-related insomnia.

### Acupuncture for patients with Alzheimer's disease: an evidence map of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis [^fcddb4b5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Acupuncture is an effective complementary treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aims to summarize the available evidence provided by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) or meta-analyses (MAs) on the effect of acupuncture on AD. Objective: To systematically summarize and combine clinical research evidence on AD distribution. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of various databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Data, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) and Chonqing VIP (CQVIP), from their inception to September 2023. Relevant literature about acupuncture for AD was included, and the characteristics of the evidence map were presented through charts and textual analyses. Results: In total, 117 RCTs and 17 SRs or MAs were included. The results were divided into three categories: basic characteristics of the included literature, clinical characteristics and quality assessment of the included RCTs, and clinical characteristics and quality assessment of the included SRs and MAs. Conclusions: Acupuncture as a therapeutic measure for AD has some advantages in improving cognition and quality of life; thus, it is imperative to conduct multi-center, large-scale RCTs to enhance the evidence supporting the use of acupuncture in AD. This is the first evidence map exploring acupuncture treatment for AD, providing insights into the current clinical research landscape on acupuncture treatment for AD. Furthermore, the findings of this study highlight research gaps in this field and serve as a valuable reference for guiding the planning and selection of topics for future research.

### Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for pain relief: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3966f7e9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of traditional acupuncture for pain relief based on rigorously designed RCTs with double-blind. The findings seek to provide valuable insights for clinical practice and inform future research.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials on traditional acupuncture for pain management using a double-blind design, published from database inception to November 22, 2023. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool was used to assess potential biases in the included studies, followed by a comprehensive analysis to evaluate efficacy and safety.

Results

The findings show a significant positive effect on pain improvement, evidenced by changes in visual analog scale scores (mean difference 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–1.27]). Safety analysis showed no significant differences in adverse reactions between the acupuncture and control groups (relative risk 1.40 [95% CI 0.52–3.74]), with no serious adverse effects reported.

Conclusion

Traditional acupuncture is effective and safe in pain management. This suggests that acupuncture can be a valuable approach in clinical practice. Future studies should explore optimal treatment durations and frequency, using larger sample sizes for more comprehensive insights.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^af03566a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

There is a vast literature of original randomized trials and systematic reviews of randomized trials of acupuncture as a treatment for dozens of health conditions. Despite this, the number of conditions for which authors of systematic reviews have concluded that there is at least moderate-certainty evidence regarding health outcomes associated with acupuncture was modest, and most of these involved comparisons of acupuncture with sham or control acupuncture and mostly for painful conditions. The evidence that acupuncture causes adverse health effects was rare, and reviews that compared acupuncture with usual care and included conclusions about adverse effects all concluded that acupuncture was at least as safe or safer than usual care.

Since our review was completed there has been another published study by Lu and colleaguesthat assessed existing systematic reviews of acupuncture across many health conditions. That effort and ours shared some characteristics, such as including only 1 review per clinical topic, in general selected because it was the largest or most recent, but it also differed in some important characteristics. Lu and colleaguesconsidered a number of interventions that we excluded from our study, including acupressure, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and laser acupuncture; in the study by Lu and colleagues, it was a requirement that an included review have performed a quantitative meta-analysis, whereas in ours it was not; our study required a review to have performed a formal assessment of the certainty of evidence whereas in Lu and colleagues' studythis was not required; our study included data on adverse events, whereas Lu and colleaguesdid not; and our study included reviews with high- or moderate-certainty evidence that acupuncture did not have a beneficial effect, whereas the review by Lu and colleaguesdid not list any health conditions for which the conclusions were that acupuncture was not associated with improved outcomes. Nevertheless, both the study by Lu and colleaguesand our study concluded that the number of clinical conditions for which there is high- or moderate-certainty of evidence is small compared with the number of conditions with low- or very low-certainty evidence.

### Methodological challenges in design and conduct of randomised controlled trials in acupuncture [^a014a80c]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Acupuncture is one of the most commonly used complementary and integrative therapies worldwide. During the past five years, results of over 4000 acupuncture trials have been published. As with other non-pharmacological interventions, challenges exist when designing and conducting randomised controlled trials in acupuncture. We discuss the most important challenges specific to acupuncture, some of which may apply to other non-pharmacological therapies. Detailed solutions to these challenges are discussed in another article in this series.

### Acupuncture for chronic nonspecific low back pain [^87cecb41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is very common; it is defined as pain without a recognizable etiology that lasts for more than three months. Some clinical practice guidelines suggest that acupuncture can offer an effective alternative therapy. This review is a split from an earlier Cochrane review and it focuses on chronic LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of acupuncture compared to sham intervention, no treatment, or usual care for chronic nonspecific LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, two Chinese databases, and two trial registers to 29 August 2019 without restrictions on language or publication status. We also screened reference lists and LBP guidelines to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for chronic nonspecific LBP in adults. We excluded RCTs that investigated LBP with a specific etiology. We included trials comparing acupuncture with sham intervention, no treatment, and usual care. The primary outcomes were pain, back-specific functional status, and quality of life; the secondary outcomes were pain-related disability, global assessment, or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. We meta-analyzed data that were clinically homogeneous using a random-effects model in Review Manager 5.3. Otherwise, we reported the data qualitatively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 33 studies (37 articles) with 8270 participants. The majority of studies were carried out in Europe, Asia, North and South America. Seven studies (5572 participants) conducted in Germany accounted for 67% of the participants. Sixteen trials compared acupuncture with sham intervention, usual care, or no treatment. Most studies had high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of the acupuncturist. A few studies were found to have high risk of detection, attrition, reporting or selection bias. We found low-certainty evidence (seven trials, 1403 participants) that acupuncture may relieve pain in the immediate term (up to seven days) compared to sham intervention (mean difference (MD) -9.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.82 to -4.61, visual analogue scale (VAS) 0–100). The difference did not meet the clinically important threshold of 15 points or 30% relative change. Very low-certainty evidence from five trials (1481 participants) showed that acupuncture was not more effective than sham in improving back-specific function in the immediate term (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.06; corresponding to the Hannover Function Ability Questionnaire (HFAQ, 0 to 100, higher values better) change (MD 3.33 points; 95% CI -1.25 to 7.90)). Three trials (1068 participants) yielded low-certainty evidence that acupuncture seemed not to be more effective clinically in the short term for quality of life (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.45; corresponding to the physical 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12, 0–100, higher values better) change (MD 2.33 points; 95% CI 0.29 to 4.37)). The reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence to either low to very low were risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. We found moderate-certainty evidence that acupuncture produced greater and clinically important pain relief (MD -20.32, 95% CI -24.50 to -16.14; four trials, 366 participants; (VAS, 0 to 100), and improved back function (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.34; five trials, 2960 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change (MD 11.50 points; 95% CI 7.38 to 15.84)) in the immediate term compared to no treatment. The evidence was downgraded to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. No studies reported on quality of life in the short term or adverse events. Low-certainty evidence (five trials, 1054 participants) suggested that acupuncture may reduce pain (MD -10.26, 95% CI -17.11 to -3.40; not clinically important on 0 to 100 VAS), and improve back-specific function immediately after treatment (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: -0.77 to -0.17; five trials, 1381 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change (MD 9.78 points, 95% CI 3.54 to 16.02)) compared to usual care. Moderate-certainty evidence from one trial (731 participants) found that acupuncture was more effective in improving physical quality of life (MD 4.20, 95% CI 2.82 to 5.58) but not mental quality of life in the short term (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.55). The certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate to low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Low-certainty evidence suggested a similar incidence of adverse events immediately after treatment in the acupuncture and sham intervention groups (four trials, 465 participants) (RR 0.68 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01), and the acupuncture and usual care groups (one trial, 74 participants) (RR 3.34, 95% CI 0.36 to 30.68). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trial reported adverse events for acupuncture when compared to no treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events in the acupuncture groups were insertion point pain, bruising, hematoma, bleeding, worsening of LBP, and pain other than LBP (pain in leg and shoulder).

Authors' Conclusions

We found that acupuncture may not play a more clinically meaningful role than sham in relieving pain immediately after treatment or in improving quality of life in the short term, and acupuncture possibly did not improve back function compared to sham in the immediate term. However, acupuncture was more effective than no treatment in improving pain and function in the immediate term. Trials with usual care as the control showed acupuncture may not reduce pain clinically, but the therapy may improve function immediately after sessions as well as physical but not mental quality of life in the short term. The evidence was downgraded to moderate to very low-certainty considering most of studies had high risk of bias, inconsistency, and small sample size introducing imprecision. The decision to use acupuncture to treat chronic low back pain might depend on the availability, cost and patient's preferences.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^83b8c49d]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

From this large collection of systematic reviews that included acupuncture as a treatment, we next restricted eligibility to reviews that used formal methods to assess the certainty (sometimes called strength or quality) of the evidence for conclusions. In general, this meant using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE). However, other formal methods were also included, such as the approach used by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center program. To count, an included review had to both (1) state or cite the method used and (2) report the certainty (or strength or quality) of evidence for each conclusion. After applying this restriction, there were many health conditions for which there was only 1 systematic review meeting the eligibility criteria, and we used this review for the map. For some conditions, we identified more than 1 review meeting the eligibility criteria. For these conditions, we first assessed whether the reviews differed in some other feature used to classify reviews on our map (eg, a systematic review on a certain condition included only studies comparing acupuncture with sham, while another systematic review on the same condition only included studies comparing acupuncture with other active therapies). In such cases, we included both reviews on the map, with the appropriate designations (ie, vs sham and vs active therapy). If there were multiple reviews on the same condition, and they did not differ in some other feature, then we selected the systematic review that we judged as being most informative for readers. In general, this was the most recent review or the review with the greatest number of included studies. Systematic reviews otherwise meeting eligibility criteria that were not included on the map for this reason are listed in eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1. Data on study condition; number of articles in a review; intervention characteristics; comparators; conclusions; and certainty, quality, or strength of evidence were all extracted by one reviewer and then checked by a second reviewer.

Risk of Bias and Certainty of Evidence

Risk of bias is not part of the method of an evidence map. Certainty of evidence (as determined by the original authors of the systematic review) was abstracted for each conclusion in each systematic review and tabulated.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^02fdf793]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS knee osteoarthritis — acupuncture may improve pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis, with Strength of Recommendation: Limited (downgrade). The overall findings were in favor of acupuncture for reducing pain in subjects with knee osteoarthritis, with no effect in two studies where blinding was effective and greater effects favoring acupuncture when there was no blinding or blinding was unclear; for function, the overall findings were in favor of acupuncture for improving measures of function in subjects with knee osteoarthritis and the effects of blinding were similar to those described for pain. Delivery variations show mixed results: high intensity vs low intensity electro-acupuncture found no difference between these approaches for pain but possibly better improvements in function favoring the high intensity group, while others found no meaningful differences between using 2-point, 4-point, or 6-point acupuncture approaches. The Acupuncture recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistent evidence and a lack of internal consistency with recommendations of equal supporting evidence. Many patients receive benefit such as reduced pain and improved function but not all patients respond favorably to treatment; the treatment should be administered by a certified acupuncture practitioner; common side effects can include soreness and minor bleeding or bruising where needles are inserted; risk of infection is low if proper procedures are followed; and patients who have a bleeding disorder, pacemaker, or could be pregnant may not be safe candidates for acupuncture and should consult with their physician before having the treatment.

### Acupuncture for menstrual migraine: a systematic review [^97d751a7]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Background and Objective

In clinical practice, the evidence of acupuncture used as a treatment for migraine without aura is employed interchangeably to guide treatment for menstrual migraine. However, its effect and safety are not substantiated. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture on the frequency and pain intensity of menstrual migraine.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and other two Chinese databases from their inception to 1 May 2019. This study included randomised controlled trials of women with menstrual migraine receiving acupuncture or a valid control. Two reviewers independently completed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We combined data with a fixed-effect model in RevMan. Clinical outcomes included migraine frequency and duration, headache intensity, and adverse events.

Results

Thirteen studies with 826 subjects were included, 9 of which had data suitable for meta-analyses. Current evidence showed that acupuncture was not superior to sham acupuncture in reducing monthly migraine frequency and duration, average headache intensity, and analgesic use at completion of treatment or follow-up. Pooled data demonstrated a significant improvement in mean headache intensity in the acupuncture group compared with drugs. However, all studies were underpowered and associated with moderate to high risk of bias. No serious adverse event was related to acupuncture treatment.

Conclusions

There is no convincing evidence to support the use of acupuncture in treating menstrual migraine. Acupuncture cannot yet be recommended to patients with menstrual migraine until more solid evidence is produced.

Trial Registration Number

CRD42019119337.

### Evidence on acupuncture therapies is underused in clinical practice and health policy [^e9f66024]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Systematic reviews of acupuncture

We identified 2471 systematic reviews of acupuncture therapies in the Web of Science between 2000 and 2020, with the number of systematic reviews increasing annually (fig 1). Published systematic reviews of randomised trials (1578, 63.9%) and observational studies (893, 36.1%) mainly focused on the following therapeutic areas: musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases (865, 35.0%), neurological conditions (304, 12.3%), cancer (287, 11.6%), and cardiovascular diseases (235, 9.5%). The country of the first author listed in acupuncture systematic reviews was China (996, 40.3%), US (358, 14.5%), UK (316, 12.8%), South Korea (259, 10.5%), Australia (178, 7.2%), Canada (117, 4.7%), Germany (106, 4.3%), and elsewhere (141, 5.7%).

Fig 1
Number of systematic reviews of acupuncture published between 2000 and 2020

An overview of systematic reviews of acupuncture therapy compared acupuncture with no intervention, sham acupuncture (similar to placebo control for pharmacological interventions), and other conventional medical interventions (such as standard of care, psychotherapy, and rehabilitation) and found the main limitations of these systematic reviews included an absence of a list of excluded studies and no explanation of protocol modifications. Medical evidence users including clinicians, patients, and policy makers often regard Cochrane systematic reviews to be the most reliable. When using AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) to assess the methodological rigour of Cochrane systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials on acupuncture, important problems include failure to specify study design as an eligibility criterion (94%) and failure to adequately investigate and interpret publication bias (52%).

Although earlier studies have used AMSTAR 2 to assess the methodological rigour of acupuncture systematic reviews and concluded that the quality was low, the criteria they used do not reflect the most serious problems in systematic reviews. Comprehensive searches, assessment of risk of bias, independent and duplicate screening and data extraction, and assessment of certainty of evidence are some of the most important methodological considerations in systematic reviews. The limitations identified in systematic reviews of acupuncture therefore have little effect on the overall quality. For instance, the systematic reviews did not provide the list of primary studies excluded. Despite minor limitations, systematic reviews of acupuncture therapies are generally methodologically rigorous.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^c953a945]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. The first, common to all systematic reviews, is that we may have not identified all the potentially eligible evidence. If a systematic review was published in a journal not indexed in any of the 5 databases we searched and we did not identify it as part of our search of references of included studies, then we would have missed it. The recent review by Lu and colleaguesidentified some Chinese-language articles that we did not identify because they are not indexed in any of the 5 databases we searched. The second limitation of evidence maps is that we did not independently evaluate the source evidence; in other words, we took the conclusions of the authors of the systematic review at face value. Third, one limitation to assessing the outcomes of acupuncture is the variation (and controversy) with which sham acupuncture is designed. Some studies defined sham as standard needling technique at nonactive points; some included shallow needling in both active and nonactive points; and more contemporarily, nonpenetrating needles used at both active and nonactive points. One of the major controversies of the use of sham as an inert comparator was that the unintended physiologic effects beyond placebo were not considered; thus, the exact mechanism by which acupuncture is effective is unclear when compared with sham acupuncture. The uncertainty around what is considered sham acupuncture and the lack of clear understanding of the exact mechanism by which acupuncture is effective compared with sham makes conclusions about the outcomes associated with acupuncture compared with sham more challenging to interpret than, eg, the comparison of a pharmaceutical intervention with placebo, in which case the placebo is assumed with confidence to be inert.

### Acupuncture for palliative cancer pain management: systematic review [^405df66c]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Background

Pain is one of the most common and problematic symptoms encountered by patients with cancer. Due to the multifactorial aetiology, pain management of these patients frequently requires multidisciplinary interventions including conventional support and specialty palliative care. Acupuncture has been identified as a possible adjunctive therapy for symptom management in cancer pain, and there is currently no systematic review focused solely on the evidence of acupuncture on cancer pain in palliative care.

Objective

To critically analyse currently available publications regarding the use of acupuncture for pain management among patients with cancer in palliative care settings.

Methods

Multiple academic databases were searched from inception to 29 October 2020. Randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture in palliative care for treatment of cancer-related pain were synthesised. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, and methodological quality of each included study was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 Levels of Evidence.

Results

Five studies (n = 189) were included in this systematic review. Results indicated a favourable effect of acupuncture on pain relief in palliative care for patients with cancer. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence, they were level 2 in one case (20%), level 3 in two cases (40%) and level 4 in the remaining (40%). Low-level evidence adversely affects the reliability of findings.

Conclusions

Acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment associated with pain reduction in the palliative care of patients with cancer. Further high-quality, adequately powered studies are needed in the future.

### Invasive or noninvasive? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of acupuncture and acupressure to treat cancer pain [^977aa2b1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Both acupressure and acupuncture effectively alleviate pain in cancer patients. Acupuncture requires specialized practitioners and is invasive, while acupressure is noninvasive and can be self-administered. Current comparative evidence remains insufficient for clear clinical recommendations.

Aims

To investigate the relative efficacy of acupuncture versus acupressure in alleviating pain among cancer patients.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis employed a Bayesian framework. Eight major Chinese and English databases were searched from inception to March 1, 2025. Two independent reviewers screened literature, extracted data, and assessed bias in selected studies using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. Network meta-analysis was conducted using R software version 4.4.1.

Results

Thirty-seven RCTs including 3066 patients were analyzed to compare eight treatments: manual acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation, auricular acupressure, electro-acupuncture, acupoint massage, auricular acupuncture, moxibustion, and placebo. Network meta-analysis revealed auricular acupuncture provided the greatest pain score improvement compared to placebo, followed by auricular acupressure and acupoint massage.

Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we recommend auricular acupuncture, auricular acupressure, and acupoint massage for managing cancer pain. While current studies demonstrate potential benefits, limitations include concurrent pain medication use and methodological inconsistencies. Future research should include more robust, single-intervention clinical trials to definitively evaluate efficacy for oncology patients.

### Using economic evaluations to support acupuncture reimbursement decisions: current evidence and gaps [^55be0681]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Limited use of economic evaluations in reimbursement decisions

Health systems and their process for making decisions about reimbursement vary widely across countries. In countries in which public health insurance reimburses acupuncture treatment, the types of evidence (eg, on effectiveness, safety, and cost) considered in decision making differ. To explore the extent of the use of economic evaluation in reimbursement decision making, we will comment on the situation in five countries.

In China, the Beijing Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau, based on expert opinion and a list of interventions prohibited from being reimbursed, decided in around 2000 to reimburse acupuncture for all conditions. This decision process did not use economic evaluation evidence. China's decision making process for access to basic medical insurance has, however, undergone immense changes in recent years. In negotiations about access to the national reimbursement drug list, China National Healthcare Security Administration requires a cost effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis. We expect that, in the future, economic evaluation will also inform reimbursement decisions for non-pharmaceutical interventions, including acupuncture.

In Switzerland, after a public vote in 2009, complementary medicine is now mentioned in the Swiss constitution Article 118a — "Within the scope of their responsibilities, the confederation and the cantons shall ensure that complementary medicine is comprehensively taken into account." Given that Switzerland has little local economic evaluation evidence, the reimbursement of acupuncture in the basic health insurance system is based on evidence of effectiveness and political considerations, which covers all conditions.

The UK's NHS provides free public healthcare to all British residents. NICE, the primary role of which is to improve outcomes for people using NHS services, has a long history of using Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to support evidence based decision making. A full HTA usually assesses efficacy, safety, cost effectiveness, and ethics.

NICE has conducted an HTA of acupuncture for chronic pain, comparing the cost effectiveness of acupuncture with usual care from the NHS perspective. Using a systematic review of clinical evidence, the review group constructed a lifetime economic evaluation model. Based on the HTA results (including that acupuncture is cost effective for chronic pain), a NICE clinical practice guideline recommends acupuncture for chronic pain in a community setting. However, access to free acupuncture services depends on the policy of the local clinical commissioning group, and patients can get limited courses of treatment only if recommended by their general practitioner. Only a few NHS services (eg, Royal London Hospital for Integrative Medicine) provide free acupuncture.

### Acupuncture for palliative cancer pain management: systematic review [^0f8bd8a2]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom among patients with cancer referred to palliative care. Safe and effective management for patients with cancer requires interdisciplinary care, including conventional support and specialty palliative care. Palliative care refers both to the active total care of patients with advanced, incurable disease, including preventing and relieving symptoms as well as improving the quality of life alongside curative treatment. The involvement of specialty palliative care services for patients with cancer can improve advanced care planning, quality of life (QOL), as well as patient and family satisfaction. There is an increasing number of symptom management techniques that are being offered to patients with cancer, with a lack of strong evidence about best modalities, including consideration for cost-effectiveness and sustainability.

As pharmacological agents often are associated with side effects or potential concerns for drug interactions, other non-pharmacological interventions are especially important in the population with cancer. Ideally, these interventions would be effective, feasible and inexpensive. Acupuncture is one of the major modalities in integrative medicine. Having been practised for thousands of years, acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical intervention involving the insertion of fine, metallic sterile needles into anatomical locations based on a system of meridians and channels theory. It has been considered an effective adjunct to conventional pharmacological treatments for many cancer-related symptoms, as well as medical conditions.

Acupuncture has long been used for the treatment of pain, and substantial evidence supports acupuncture is effective in pain management. Although the exact analgesic mechanism is uncertain, it is speculated that the analgesic effect of acupuncture may be mediated by the release of opioid peptides and serotonin. In the past decade, acupuncture has been actively used for relieving cancer pain, as well as decreasing analgesic medication doses and side effects. Acupuncture offers a promising yet understudied approach to control the pain experienced by many patients with cancer. Acupuncture may be a safer approach to cancer-related pain, and could have synergy with conventional interventions by reducing pain, improving fatigue and improving QOL of patients receiving palliative care. There is additional evidence suggesting that acupuncture has a role in the supportive care of patients with cancer by relieving chemotherapy-induced or radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, xerostomia and leucopenia. This has already been recommended in Clinical Practice Guideline through expert groups in oncology.

### Meta-analysis: acupuncture for low back pain [^a35e5a3d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain limits activity and is the second most frequent reason for physician visits. Previous research shows widespread use of acupuncture for low back pain.

Purpose

To assess acupuncture's effectiveness for treating low back pain.

Data Sources

Randomized, controlled trials were identified through searches of MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, CISCOM, and GERA databases through August 2004. Additional data sources included previous reviews and personal contacts with colleagues.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture, other sham treatments, no additional treatment, or another active treatment for patients with low back pain.

Data Extraction

Data were dually extracted for the outcomes of pain, functional status, overall improvement, return to work, and analgesic consumption. In addition, study quality was assessed.

Data Synthesis

The 33 randomized, controlled trials that met inclusion criteria were subgrouped according to acute or chronic pain, style of acupuncture, and type of control group used. The principal [correction] measure of effect size was the standardized mean difference, since the trials assessed the same outcome but measured it in various ways. For the primary outcome of short-term relief of chronic pain, the meta-analyses showed that acupuncture is significantly more effective than sham treatment (standardized mean difference, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.73]; 7 trials) and no additional treatment (standardized mean difference, 0.69 [CI, 0.40 to 0.98]; 8 trials). For patients with acute low back pain, data are sparse and inconclusive. Data are also insufficient for drawing conclusions about acupuncture's short-term effectiveness compared with most other therapies.

Limitations

The quantity and quality of the included trials varied.

Conclusions

Acupuncture effectively relieves chronic low back pain. No evidence suggests that acupuncture is more effective than other active therapies.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^4eaa653f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Acupuncture for allergic rhinitis (AR) is offered as an Option: clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer it, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy; this is based on randomized controlled trials with limitations and observational studies with consistent effects, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade B and the level of confidence is Low; benefits include an effective alternative to medical therapies with reduction of symptoms and avoidance of medication use and potential side effects, while risks, harms, and costs include logistics of multiple treatments, multiple needle sticks, treatment cost, and rare infections, and the policy level is Option. Supporting context defines acupuncture per NCCAM as stimulation of points on the body, commonly via thin metallic needles manipulated by hand or electrical stimulation, and reports lifetime acupuncture use was 17% for those with AR in a German adult allergic disease study.

### Acupuncture for depression [^39085f62]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is recognised as a major public health problem that has a substantial impact on individuals and on society. People with depression may consider using complementary therapies such as acupuncture, and an increasing body of research has been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of individuals with depression. This is the second update of this review.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of acupuncture for treatment of individuals with depression. To determine:• Whether acupuncture is more effective than treatment as usual/no treatment/wait list control for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression.• Whether acupuncture is more effective than control acupuncture for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression.• Whether acupuncture is more effective than pharmacological therapies for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression.• Whether acupuncture plus pharmacological therapy is more effective than pharmacological therapy alone for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression.• Whether acupuncture is more effective than psychological therapies for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression.• Adverse effects of acupuncture compared with treatment as usual/no treatment/wait list control, control acupuncture, pharmacological therapies, and psychological therapies for treatment of individuals with depression.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to June 2016: Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR), Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), DBPIA (Korean article database website), Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Service System (RISS), Korea Med, Korean Medical Database (KM base), and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), as well as several Korean medical journals.

Selection Criteria

Review criteria called for inclusion of all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture versus control acupuncture, no treatment, medication, other structured psychotherapies (cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, or counselling), or standard care. Modes of treatment included acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, and laser acupuncture. Participants included adult men and women with depression diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), or Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders Third Edition Revised (CCMD-3-R). If necessary, we used trial authors' definitions of depressive disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed meta-analyses using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcomes were reduction in the severity of depression, measured by self-rating scales or by clinician-rated scales, and improvement in depression, defined as remission versus no remission. We assessed evidence quality using the GRADE method.

Main Results

This review is an update of previous versions and includes 64 studies (7104 participants). Most studies were at high risk of performance bias, at high or unclear risk of detection bias, and at low or unclear risk of selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Acupuncture versus no treatment/wait list/treatment as usualWe found low-quality evidence suggesting that acupuncture (manual and electro-) may moderately reduce the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -1.06 to -0.25, five trials, 488 participants). It is unclear whether data show differences between groups in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.24, one trial, 302 participants; low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus control acupuncture (invasive, non-invasive sham controls)Acupuncture may be associated with a small reduction in the severity of depression of 1.69 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) by end of treatment (95% CI -3.33 to -0.05, 14 trials, 841 participants; low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether data show differences between groups in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.86, five trials, 300 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus medicationWe found very low-quality evidence suggesting that acupuncture may confer small benefit in reducing the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.05, 31 trials, 3127 participants). Studies show substantial variation resulting from use of different classes of medications and different modes of acupuncture stimulation. Very low-quality evidence suggests lower ratings of adverse events following acupuncture compared with medication alone, as measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (mean difference (MD) -4.32, 95% CI -7.41 to -1.23, three trials, 481 participants). Acupuncture plus medication versus medication aloneWe found very low-quality evidence suggesting that acupuncture is highly beneficial in reducing the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -1.15, 95% CI -1.63 to -0.66, 11 trials, 775 participants). Studies show substantial variation resulting from use of different modes of acupuncture stimulation. It is unclear whether differences in adverse events are associated with different modes of acupuncture (SMD -1.32, 95% CI -2.86 to 0.23, three trials, 200 participants; very low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus psychological therapyIt is unclear whether data show differences between acupuncture and psychological therapy in the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -0.5, 95% CI -1.33 to 0.33, two trials, 497 participants; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence suggests no differences between groups in rates of adverse events (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.33, one trial, 452 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

The reduction in severity of depression was less when acupuncture was compared with control acupuncture than when acupuncture was compared with no treatment control, although in both cases, results were rated as providing low-quality evidence. The reduction in severity of depression with acupuncture given alone or in conjunction with medication versus medication alone is uncertain owing to the very low quality of evidence. The effect of acupuncture compared with psychological therapy is unclear. The risk of adverse events with acupuncture is also unclear, as most trials did not report adverse events adequately. Few studies included follow-up periods or assessed important outcomes such as quality of life. High-quality randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to examine the clinical efficacy and acceptability of acupuncture, as well as its effectiveness, compared with acupuncture controls, medication, or psychological therapies.

### Determining the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the preventive treatment of menstrual migraine: a protocol for a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis [^585e9dfd]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Menstrual migraine (MM), as a common type of headache related to women's menstrual cycle, currently available treatments do not produce sufficient effectiveness, making it remains difficult to manage. Although acupuncture may be an effective treatment for MM, there is a lack of convincing evidence to recommend acupuncture to patients with MM until more solid evidence is produced. Therefore, the purpose of our systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis protocol is to synthesize up-to-date evidence regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture on MM.

Methods

To find qualifying RCTs, nine databases will be searched. RevMan 5.3 will be used to combine the retrieved data for meta-analyses. The Cochrane risk of bias instrument will be used to assess the methodological quality of each included trial. The strength and certainty of the evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Additionally, we will undertake sensitivity analyses, publication bias, and subgroup analyses if available.

Discussion

Our SR and meta-analysis protocol will contribute to determining acupuncture's therapeutic effect and safety in the preventive treatment of MM. Based on the up-to-date evidence produced by the subsequent SR and meta-analysis, informed treatment decisions will be made by patients, physicians and policy makers.

### Acupuncture treatment for pain: systematic review of randomised clinical trials with acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, and no acupuncture groups [^6d3ad4f9]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To study the analgesic effect of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture and to explore whether the type of the placebo acupuncture is associated with the estimated effect of acupuncture.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of three armed randomised clinical trials.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Biological Abstracts, and PsycLIT. Data extraction and analysis Standardised mean differences from each trial were used to estimate the effect of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture. The different types of placebo acupuncture were ranked from 1 to 5 according to assessment of the possibility of a physiological effect, and this ranking was meta-regressed with the effect of acupuncture.

Data Synthesis

Thirteen trials (3025 patients) involving a variety of pain conditions were eligible. The allocation of patients was adequately concealed in eight trials. The clinicians managing the acupuncture and placebo acupuncture treatments were not blinded in any of the trials. One clearly outlying trial (70 patients) was excluded. A small difference was found between acupuncture and placebo acupuncture: standardised mean difference -0.17 (95% confidence interval -0.26 to -0.08), corresponding to 4 mm (2 mm to 6 mm) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. No statistically significant heterogeneity was present (P = 0.10, I(2) = 36%). A moderate difference was found between placebo acupuncture and no acupuncture: standardised mean difference -0.42 (-0.60 to -0.23). However, considerable heterogeneity (P < 0.001, I(2) = 66%) was also found, as large trials reported both small and large effects of placebo. No association was detected between the type of placebo acupuncture and the effect of acupuncture (P = 0.60).

Conclusions

A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias. Whether needling at acupuncture points, or at any site, reduces pain independently of the psychological impact of the treatment ritual is unclear.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^f6106d08]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acupuncture for migraine — evidence summary: Three SRs and four RCTs focused on reducing migraine days per month, and two SRs and one RCT also examined disability and QoL; very low–quality evidence suggests that acupuncture decreased the number of migraine days per month, but one RCT found no difference between intervention and control groups; low- to very low–quality evidence suggests that acupuncture improved disability or QoL scores compared with control groups.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^2933c3ee]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — acupuncture randomized evidence indicates symptom and quality-of-life improvements and supports offering acupuncture as an option in selected patients. In adults, one trial randomized 981 patients to acupuncture versus no treatment, with Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) scores at 3 months improved by a mean of 1.48 in the acupuncture group and 0.5 in the control group (P < .001), and changes of 0.5 considered clinically relevant. Another multicenter trial reported better RQLQ and reduced rescue medication at 7 to 8 weeks (P < .001 for both), with treatment response at 7 to 8 weeks of 71% for acupuncture; 56% for sham acupuncture; and 44% for rescue medication. A second multicenter RCT of 191 adults with perennial AR showed significant improvement in Total Nasal Symptom Score at the end of treatment (P = 0.029) and 4 weeks after treatment (P = 0.04), with 3.68 and 3.77 standard deviation, respectively, and improved Total Non-Nasal Symptom Score versus waitlist (P = 0.0002). Placebo effects can be greater than 50% for symptom improvement, no evidence of significant harms was reported, and for patients interested in nonpharmacologic management, acupuncture may be offered as an option.

### Acupuncture therapy as an evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategy for comprehensive acute pain care: the academic consortium pain task force white paper update [^77923ec4]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A crisis in pain management persists, as does the epidemic of opioid overdose deaths, addiction, and diversion. Pain medicine is meeting these challenges by returning to its origins: the Bonica model of multidisciplinary pain care. The 2018 Academic Consortium White Paper detailed the historical context and magnitude of the pain crisis and the evidence base for nonpharmacologic strategies. More than 50% of chronic opioid use begins in the acute pain care setting. Acupuncture may be able to reduce this risk.

Objective

This article updates the evidence base for acupuncture therapy for acute pain with a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on postsurgical/perioperative pain with opioid sparing and acute nonsurgical/trauma pain, including acute pain in the emergency department.

Methods

To update reviews cited in the 2018 White Paper, electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for "acupuncture" and "acupuncture therapy" and "acute pain", "surgery", "peri-operative", "trauma", "emergency department", "urgent care", "review(s) ", "systematic review", "meta-analysis", with additional manual review of titles, links, and reference lists.

Results

There are 22 systematic reviews, 17 with meta-analyses of acupuncture in acute pain settings, and a review for acute pain in the intensive care unit. There are additional studies of acupuncture in acute pain settings.

Conclusion

The majority of reviews found acupuncture therapy to be an efficacious strategy for acute pain, with potential to avoid or reduce opioid reliance. Future multicenter trials are needed to clarify the dosage and generalizability of acupuncture for acute pain in the emergency department. With an extremely low risk profile, acupuncture therapy is an important strategy in comprehensive acute pain care.

### Complementary and alternative medical therapies [^890382fb]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Complementary and alternative medical therapies include herbs, acupuncture, and mind-body therapies. This review highlights the findings of recently published studies of complementary and alternative medical therapies and epilepsy, and provides an update of the US Food and Drug Administration's role in regulating herbal products.

Recent Findings

Complementary and alternative medical therapies are often tried by patients with epilepsy, frequently without physician knowledge. Many modalities have been evaluated in patients with epilepsy, though methodological issues preclude any firm conclusions of efficacy or safety. Some herbal medicines have been shown experimentally to have mechanisms of action relevant to epilepsy and promising actions in animal models.

Summary

There is currently a paucity of credible evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative medical therapies in patients with epilepsy. Herbal medicines traditionally used for epilepsy and compounds isolated from them, as well as other herbal medicines and their constituent compounds that have been shown experimentally to have mechanisms of action relevant to epilepsy, should undergo further preclinical evaluation with a view towards clinical development under the new US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Additional studies of other, nonherbal complementary and alternative medical therapies are also warranted based on anecdotal observations or pilot studies that suggest a favorable risk-benefit ratio.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^6eb33be4]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain — acupuncture vs placebo transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Kerr et al) — Patients with low back pain for more than 6 months were randomized to acupuncture therapy (n = 30) or placebo transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (n = 30) for 6 weeks, with outcomes recorded at baseline, after completion of the 6-week treatment and 6 months after treatment; both groups improved, the authors concluded there were no significant differences between acupuncture therapy and placebo, less than 80% of patients completed follow-up, and this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that there were no differences in pain and function between acupuncture and placebo at 6 months.
