## Question

Narcotic bowel syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about narcotic bowel syndrome, including its definition, pathophysiology, prevalence, diagnosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining narcotic bowel syndrome and distinguishing it from opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Next, I will review prevalence estimates and reconcile discrepancies. After that, I need to outline diagnostic criteria and the differential. Finally, I will examine management principles, including detoxification, non-opioid strategies, and special populations, and close with prognosis and a practical clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate entities. Narcotic bowel syndrome is characterized by chronic or frequently recurring abdominal pain that worsens with continued or escalating opioid therapy, reflecting a paradoxical increase in pain despite higher doses, and it is distinct from opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, which is primarily a motility and secretion disorder causing constipation and related symptoms without the paradoxical pain amplification seen in NBS [^114V9KfZ] [^115F1M8C] [^112cF87d].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump ahead. The leading mechanism is opioid-induced hyperalgesia, mediated by central sensitization, bimodal opioid regulation with excitatory pathways, descending facilitation, neuroinflammation, and NMDA receptor interactions; glial activation also contributes to tolerance and hyperalgesia, which explains why pain can intensify as doses rise [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs] [^112cF87d].

> I should double-check prevalence estimates because they vary. Population-based data suggest NBS is uncommon, around 0.17% in community samples of chronic opioid users, whereas clinic-based cohorts of high-dose opioid users report higher rates, approximately 4.2–6.4%, and an IBD cohort showed 6.4% meeting NBS criteria; reconciling this, NBS appears rare in the general population but more prevalent in selected clinical populations on high-dose or prolonged opioids [^111BmFJ7] [^113Y8YDs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without criteria. Clinically, NBS is suspected when there is chronic abdominal pain persisting beyond 3 months, on more than 100 mg morphine-equivalent per day, with pain that escalates despite increasing doses and often improves with dose reduction; patients frequently have high psychiatric comorbidity, catastrophizing, and disability, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion after structural disease is ruled out [^113Y8YDs] [^115F1M8C] [^114ddyJb].

> I need to ensure the differential is explicit. NBS must be distinguished from opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, which presents with constipation and related symptoms without paradoxical pain amplification; it also overlaps with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome, but the key discriminator is the temporal relationship to ongoing or escalating opioid therapy and the paradoxical pain response [^113Y8YDs] [^114nxzhQ].

> Next, I should review management principles and verify the strength of evidence. The cornerstone is opioid detoxification with a structured taper or substitution, typically coordinated by pain specialists, alongside education about hyperalgesia and a therapeutic alliance; adjuncts include clonidine for withdrawal, neuromodulators such as TCAs or SNRIs, and psychological therapies, with recidivism around 45–50% at 3 months but substantially better pain outcomes in those who remain off opioids [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb] [^114MLuYE].

> Let me consider non-opioid strategies and make sure I'm aligned with guidelines. For chronic gastrointestinal pain, especially in disorders of gut–brain interaction, guidelines recommend avoiding opioids and favoring neuromodulators such as TCAs, SNRIs, or mirtazapine, and brain–gut psychotherapies like CBT or gut-directed hypnotherapy; pregabalin has emerging but limited evidence in centrally mediated abdominal pain and may be considered selectively [^116yDR9X] [^112Azf1Q] [^114TX6p7].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population like IBD or gastroparesis. I should confirm that both IBD and gastroparesis guidelines discourage chronic opioids due to poor outcomes, higher risks of infections, and the potential for NBS; in IBD, opioid use correlates with worse quality of life and higher mortality, and in gastroparesis, opioids can worsen delayed emptying and perpetuate a vicious cycle, so detoxification and alternatives are prioritized [^114kXqqN] [^115rcyni] [^113c5dV7].

> I will now examine prognosis and make sure I cite the best available data. Despite severe baseline pain and disability, most patients can complete detoxification with meaningful pain reduction, but relapse is common within 3 months; those who remain off opioids experience about a 75% reduction in abdominal pain compared with about 24% in those who resume opioids, and lower abuse potential scores predict better outcomes, underscoring the need for integrated addiction and psychiatric care [^114ddyJb].

> Let me reconsider the practical clinical takeaway to ensure it's actionable. Suspect NBS in patients with chronic abdominal pain on escalating opioids whose pain paradoxically worsens; confirm the diagnosis by excluding structural disease, educate the patient about hyperalgesia, and implement a supervised detoxification plan with non-opioid neuromodulators and psychological therapies; avoid starting or escalating opioids for chronic gastrointestinal pain whenever possible, and coordinate with pain specialists and mental health clinicians to reduce recidivism and improve long-term outcomes [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs] [^116yDR9X].

Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) is a **paradoxical worsening of abdominal pain** with continued or escalating opioid use, driven by opioid-induced hyperalgesia and central sensitization [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs]. It is distinct from opioid-induced constipation and is characterized by chronic, severe abdominal pain that intensifies despite increasing opioid doses, often with nausea, vomiting, and bloating [^113Y8YDs] [^112cF87d]. Prevalence is estimated at 4–6% among chronic opioid users, with higher risk in those on high doses or with psychiatric comorbidity [^113Y8YDs] [^115F1M8C]. Diagnosis is clinical, based on pain that escalates with opioids and improves with dose reduction, after excluding other causes [^113Y8YDs]. Management centers on **opioid tapering or cessation**, with substitution of non-opioid therapies (TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids) and psychological support; recidivism is common, so close follow-up and multidisciplinary care are essential [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb].

---

## Pathophysiology

NBS arises from **opioid-induced hyperalgesia**, whereby chronic opioid exposure paradoxically lowers pain thresholds via central sensitization and neuroplastic changes [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Central sensitization**: Opioids activate excitatory pathways and glial cells, amplifying pain signaling [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs].
- **Descending facilitation**: Rostral ventromedial pathways enhance pain transmission [^114V9KfZ] [^112cF87d].
- **Neuroinflammation**: Glial activation promotes hyperalgesia and tolerance [^114V9KfZ] [^112cF87d].

---

## Clinical features

NBS presents with the following **characteristics**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Pain | Chronic, severe, diffuse abdominal pain worsening with opioid escalation [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs] |
| Associated symptoms | Nausea, vomiting, bloating, constipation, early satiety [^113Y8YDs] [^113HyW5c] |
| Behavioral features | High healthcare use, psychiatric comorbidity, catastrophizing [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb] |
| Paradoxical response | Pain improves with opioid dose reduction or cessation [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb] |

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Prevalence is **4–6% among chronic opioid users**, with higher risk in those on high doses, with psychiatric comorbidity, or with functional GI disorders [^113Y8YDs] [^115F1M8C]. Risk increases with dose escalation and prolonged use [^113Y8YDs] [^115F1M8C].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical**, requiring:

- **Chronic abdominal pain**: Worsening with continued or escalating opioids [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Structural or functional GI disease [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb].
- **Improvement with opioid reduction**: Pain lessens with dose tapering [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb].

---

## Differential diagnosis

NBS must be distinguished from:

- **Opioid-induced constipation**: Constipation-predominant symptoms without paradoxical pain [^113Y8YDs] [^112vFYEg].
- **Functional abdominal pain syndromes**: Centrally mediated pain without opioid exposure [^114nxzhQ] [^114TX6p7].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Active inflammation or strictures [^notfound].
- **Irritable bowel syndrome**: Altered bowel habits and visceral hypersensitivity [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management focuses on **opioid cessation** and **multidisciplinary care**:

- **Opioid tapering**: Gradual dose reduction with close monitoring [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs].
- **Alternative analgesics**: TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, or pregabalin [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs] [^114TX6p7].
- **Psychological support**: CBT, mindfulness, and addiction services [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs].
- **Peripheral opioid antagonists**: Methylnaltrexone or naloxegol for constipation; not for NBS pain [^111jjE5b] [^115VpmB9].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies: **about 50% relapse within 3 months**, but those who remain opioid-free have substantial pain reduction (up to 75%) [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb]. Recidivism is common, necessitating ongoing support and monitoring [^113Y8YDs] [^114ddyJb].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **limiting opioid exposure**, using the lowest effective dose, and monitoring for hyperalgesia; consider non-opioid strategies for chronic pain, especially in functional GI disorders [^116yDR9X] [^112Azf1Q].

---

Narcotic bowel syndrome is a **iatrogenic pain syndrome** from chronic opioids, with pain that escalates despite dose increases; **opioid tapering and multidisciplinary care** are the cornerstones of management, though relapse is common and long-term support is critical [^114V9KfZ] [^113Y8YDs].

### Narcotic bowel syndrome [^1146uAKX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Narcotic bowel syndrome is characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with escalating doses of narcotic pain medications. It may occur in as many as 4% of all patients taking opiates, and yet few physicians are aware that the syndrome exists.

Objectives

The objectives of this case report are to raise awareness of narcotic bowel syndrome among emergency physicians, as well as review the clinical features, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and emergency department (ED) management of the syndrome.

Case Report

We report a case of narcotic bowel syndrome diagnosed in a 24-year-old woman after > 1 year of ED visits for recurrent abdominal pain of unknown origin.

Conclusions

It is particularly important for emergency physicians to be familiar with this syndrome, as many patients with narcotic bowel syndrome seek evaluation and treatment in the ED. Although the diagnosis is unlikely to be made in the ED, timely referral for evaluation of this syndrome may help patients to receive definitive treatment for their recurrent and chronic pain.

### Narcotic bowel syndrome [^114V9KfZ]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Narcotic bowel syndrome is characterised by worsening abdominal pain in the context of escalating or continuous opioid therapy. Although narcotic bowel syndrome is rarely diagnosed, given the current epidemic of opioid use, it is likely to be under-recognised. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of narcotic bowel syndrome are incompletely understood; however, opioid-induced hyperalgesia is likely to be a central facet. The putative mechanisms of hyperalgesia include activation of bimodal opioid regulatory systems, counter-regulatory mechanisms, neuroinflammation, opioid facilitation, and interactions of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor with opioids at the level of the spinal cord. The cornerstone of management is the development of a therapeutic alliance with the patient, education of the patient as to the mechanisms by which opioids might paradoxically worsen pain, and implementation of an opioid detoxification programme. Opioid detoxification regimens vary between centres, but frequently include tapering or substitution of opioids and concomitant co-administration of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and psychological therapies. Despite these interventions, recidivism rates remain high. Further prospective research is warranted to determine the epidemiology of narcotic bowel syndrome and delineate the most efficacious detoxification programmes.

### The narcotic bowel syndrome: clinical features, pathophysiology, and management [^112cF87d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) is a subset of opioid bowel dysfunction that is characterized by chronic or frequently recurring abdominal pain that worsens with continued or escalating dosages of narcotics. This syndrome is underrecognized and may be becoming more prevalent. In the United States this may be the result of increases in using narcotics for chronic nonmalignant painful disorders, and the development of maladaptive therapeutic interactions around its use. NBS can occur in patients with no prior gastrointestinal disorder who receive high dosages of narcotics after surgery or acute painful problems, and among patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders or other chronic gastrointestinal diseases who are managed by physicians who are unaware of the hyperalgesic effects of chronic opioids. The evidence for the enhanced pain perception is based on the following: (1) activation of excitatory antianalgesic pathways within a bimodal opioid regulation system, (2) descending facilitation of pain at the rostral ventral medulla and pain facilitation via dynorphin and cholecystokinin activation, and (3) glial cell activation that produces morphine tolerance and enhances opioid-induced pain. Treatment involves early recognition of the syndrome, an effective physician-patient relationship, graded withdrawal of the narcotic according to a specified withdrawal program, and the institution of medications to reduce withdrawal effects.

### Diagnosis and treatment of narcotic bowel syndrome [^113Y8YDs]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

With increased prescription of opioids has come increased recognition of adverse consequences, including narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS). Characterized by incompletely controlled abdominal pain despite continued or increasing doses of opioids, NBS is estimated to occur in 4.2–6.4% of patients chronically taking opioids. Patients with NBS have a high degree of comorbid psychiatric illness, catastrophizing and disability; comorbid substance abuse must also be considered among this population. NBS should be distinguished from opioid-induced bowel disorder, which results from the effects of opioids on gastrointestinal motility and secretion. By contrast, the mechanisms of NBS are probably centrally mediated and include glial cell activation, bimodal opioid modulation in the dorsal horn, descending facilitation of pain and the glutaminergic system. Few treatments have been rigorously studied. A trial of opioid detoxification resulted in complete detoxification for the vast majority of patients with reduction in pain symptoms; however, despite improvement in pain, approximately half of patients returned to opioid use within 3 months. Improved strategies are needed to identify patients who will respond to detoxification and remain off opioids. Comorbid psychiatric and substance abuse disorders are barriers to durable response after detoxification and should be actively sought out and treated accordingly. An effective patient-physician relationship is essential.

Regarding medical management for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to general principles, BSG 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering a gradual supervised opioid withdrawal in patients with narcotic bowel syndrome because of long-term opioid use. Involve a pain specialist if available.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^114kGpbC]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate timely evidence-based guidelines for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Setting

Constipation is a major untoward effect of opioids. Increasing prescription of opioids has correlated to increased incidence of opioid-induced constipation. However, the inhibitory effects of opioids are not confined to the colon, but also affect higher segments of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the coining of the term "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction".

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Predefined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to identify and categorize relevant papers. A series of statements were formulated and justified by a comment, then labeled with the degree of agreement and their level of evidence as judged by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) system.

Results

From a list of 10,832 potentially relevant studies, 33 citations were identified for review. Screening the reference lists of the pertinent papers identified additional publications. Current definitions, prevalence, and mechanism of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction were reviewed, and a treatment algorithm and statements regarding patient management were developed to provide guidance on clinical best practice in the management of patients with opioid-induced constipation and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Conclusions

In recent years, more insight has been gained in the pathophysiology of this "entity"; new treatment approaches have been developed, but guidelines on clinical best practice are still lacking. Current knowledge is insufficient regarding management of the opioid side effects on the upper gastrointestinal tract, but recommendations can be derived from what we know at present.

### Opioid bowel dysfunction and narcotic bowel syndrome: a population-based study [^111BmFJ7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Opioid prescription use is increasing. Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) refers to chronic abdominal pain aggravated by narcotic use. Despite increasing narcotic use, NBS may be under-recognized. The aim of this study was to assess whether gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the community are associated with chronic narcotic use and estimate the likely prevalence of NBS.

Methods

Validated self-report GI symptom questionnaires were mailed to 4,898 randomly selected people in the community. The medical charts of all respondents were reviewed to identify participants who had used narcotics and to determine whether they were taking an opioid for > 5 weeks for the treatment of chronic pain (malignant or nonmalignant). NBS was defined as abdominal pain developing in those taking chronic narcotics. The associations between GI symptoms and chronic narcotics use were assessed using logistic regression analysis.

Results

A total of 2,913 respondents returned a completed questionnaire (overall response rate 59%, mean age 62, 52% female); 117 participants (4.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3, 4.5) were taking narcotics. Five participants (0.17%; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.40%) met the criteria for NBS. Participants using narcotics had an increased use of laxatives (17 vs. 8% in those not using narcotics, P < 0.05). GI symptom reporting was more common in participants on narcotics, although the adjusted (for age, gender, somatic symptom complaints, and use of laxatives) odds ratios (ORs) were significantly increased only for frequent abdominal pain and stool frequency.

Conclusions

NBS may be relatively uncommon. Those on narcotics report additional GI symptoms (abdominal pain and stool frequency) and use more laxatives.

### Patients with short bowel on narcotics during 2 randomized trials have abdominal complaints independent of teduglutide [^113K4NbS]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Relevancy Statement

Adverse gastrointestinal effects are a common complaint among patients with short bowel syndrome receiving narcotic agents as well as those receiving teduglutide, making it unclear the extent to which these complaints are attributable to narcotic agents or teduglutide. This post hoc analysis of pooled data from 2 randomized, double-blind, phase III studies suggests that patients with short bowel syndrome receiving narcotics have chronic complaints independent of teduglutide treatment. These findings are clinically relevant and suggest the importance of careful monitoring and possible dose adjustment of coadministered oral agents during teduglutide therapy.

### Opioid-induced bowel disorders and narcotic bowel syndrome in patients with chronic non-cancer pain [^115F1M8C]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Opioids are used increasingly in the management of moderate-to-severe chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Opioid-induced bowel disorders (OBD) markedly impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and frequently limit medically indicated opioid pharmacotherapy. We assessed the risk factors, and effect of OBD on HRQoL in CNCP patients. We also estimated the likely prevalence of narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS). These effects have been reported in cancer patients but not in CNCP previously.

Methods

Ambulatory CNCP patients (n = 146) taking regularly scheduled opioids were invited to complete the Bowel-Disease-Questionnaire and a pain-sensitive HRQoL instrument. The Rome-II criteria were used to define bowel disorders. Narcotic bowel syndrome was defined as presence of daily severe to very-severe abdominal pain of more than 3 months duration requiring more than 100 mg of morphine equivalent per day.

Key Results

Ninety-eight patients (69%) returned the survey. Respondents had taken opioids for 10 days to 10 years (median 365 days) at a median daily dose of 127.5 mg morphine-equivalent (range 7.5–600 mg). Constipation prevalence was 46.9% (95% CI 36.8–57.3), nausea 27% (95% CI 17.2–35.3), vomiting 9% (95% CI 17.2–35.3), and gastro-esophageal reflux disease 33% (95% CI 23.5–42.9). Chronic abdominal pain was reported by 58.2% (95% CI 53.2–73.9) and 6.4%, (95% CI 2.4–13.5) fulfilled the criteria of NBS. Prevalence of constipation increased with duration of treatment. Health-related quality of life was low in patients with chronic abdominal pain.

Conclusion & Inferences

Bowel disorders including chronic abdominal pain and NBS are common in patients taking opioids for CNCP. Decreased HRQoL in patients with CNCP is driven by chronic abdominal pain.

### Patients with short bowel on narcotics during 2 randomized trials have abdominal complaints independent of teduglutide [^111k3u1q]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Narcotic agents are frequently administered to manage increased intestinal motility in patients with short bowel syndrome, but long-term use is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. This analysis evaluated the incidence of narcotic use and abdominal adverse events among patients with short bowel syndrome receiving teduglutide. Materials and Methods: Pooled data from patients who received ≥ 1 dose of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/d (n = 77) or placebo (n = 59) in either of 2 randomized, double-blind, phase III studies were analyzed. Results: Of 136 patients, 52 (38%) received narcotics. GI adverse events occurred more often among patients who received narcotics than among those who did not (abdominal pain, 51% vs 21%; nausea, 42% vs 11%; abdominal distension, 17% vs 8%; vomiting, 19% vs 6%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the probability of GI adverse events was significantly increased in patients with narcotic use (P = 0.0009). In contrast, teduglutide treatment, as well as the interaction between teduglutide and narcotic use, did not affect the probability of GI adverse events. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with short bowel syndrome receiving narcotics have chronic GI complaints independent of teduglutide treatment. Data included in this analysis were derived from ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00081458 and NCT00798967 (EudraCT 2004-000438-35 and 2008-006193-15).

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^113U2zLE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) — a pain syndrome in patients using opiates — is described as persistent moderate to severe daily abdominal pain of more than 3 months' duration occurring in patients requiring more than 100 mg morphine equivalent per day; the abdominal pain does not respond and may actually increase in response to escalating doses of narcotics. There are at least 5 postulated mechanisms or hypotheses to explain this paradoxical increase in pain, and in a study of 39 patients with NBS, Drossman et al demonstrated a high prevalence of psychological traits and traumatic exposures that have been linked to altered brain processing of pain signals. It is likely a more common syndrome than realized, but a 2009 epidemiologic study in Olmsted County estimated the prevalence at 4%, and NBS is suggested by the personal experience of a patient on chronic opiates with chronic generalized, colicky abdominal pain, despite escalating doses of opiates, and worsening of pain with tapering of the dose.

### Opioid misuse in gastroenterology and non-opioid management of abdominal pain [^114mFyW5]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Opioids were one of the earliest classes of medications used for pain across a variety of conditions, but morbidity and mortality have been increasingly associated with their chronic use. Despite these negative consequences, chronic opioid use is increasing worldwide, with the USA and Canada having the highest rates. Chronic opioid use for noncancer pain can have particularly negative effects in the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, including opioid-induced constipation, narcotic bowel syndrome, worsening psychopathology and addiction. This Review summarizes the evidence of opioid misuse in gastroenterology, including the lack of evidence of a benefit from these drugs, as well as the risk of harm and negative consequences of opioid use relative to the brain-gut axis. Guidelines for opioid management and alternative pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies for pain management in patients with gastrointestinal disorders are also discussed. As chronic pain is complex and involves emotional and social factors, a multimodal approach targeting both pain intensity and quality of life is best.

### Patients with short bowel on narcotics during 2 randomized trials have abdominal complaints independent of teduglutide [^112i2nWL]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Narcotic agents are frequently administered to manage increased intestinal motility in patients with short bowel syndrome, but long-term use is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. This analysis evaluated the incidence of narcotic use and abdominal adverse events among patients with short bowel syndrome receiving teduglutide.

Materials and Methods

Pooled data from patients who received ≥ 1 dose of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/d (n = 77) or placebo (n = 59) in either of 2 randomized, double-blind, phase III studies were analyzed.

Results

Of 136 patients, 52 (38%) received narcotics. GI adverse events occurred more often among patients who received narcotics than among those who did not (abdominal pain, 51% vs 21%; nausea, 42% vs 11%; abdominal distension, 17% vs 8%; vomiting, 19% vs 6%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the probability of GI adverse events was significantly increased in patients with narcotic use (P = 0.0009). In contrast, teduglutide treatment, as well as the interaction between teduglutide and narcotic use, did not affect the probability of GI adverse events.

Conclusions

These results suggest that patients with short bowel syndrome receiving narcotics have chronic GI complaints independent of teduglutide treatment. Data included in this analysis were derived from ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00081458 and NCT00798967 (EudraCT 2004-000438-35 and 2008-006193-15).

### Centrally mediated disorders of gastrointestinal pain [^114nxzhQ]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Centrally Mediated Abdominal Pain Syndrome (CAPS), formerly known as Functional Abdominal Pain Syndrome, can be distinguished from other functional GI disorders by its strong central component and relative independence from motility disturbances. CAPS is a result of central sensitization with disinhibition of pain signals rather than increased peripheral afferent excitability. A newly described condition, Narcotic Bowel Syndrome (NBS)/Opioid-Induced GI Hyperalgesia, is characterized by the paradoxical development of or increases in abdominal pain associated with continuous or increasing dosages of opioids. Patients only have relief when opioids are withdrawn. We define both conditions in the context of epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation and treatment, emphasizing the importance of a physician-patient relationship in all aspects of care.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of chronic gastrointestinal pain in disorders of gut-brain interaction: expert review [^116yDR9X]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 3 — opioids in chronic gastrointestinal pain due to a disorder of gut–brain interaction (DGBI) states that opioids should not be prescribed for chronic gastrointestinal pain because of a disorder of gut–brain interaction; if patients are referred on opioids, these medications should be prescribed responsibly, via multidisciplinary collaboration, until they can be discontinued; use of opioid medications for management of non–cancer-related pain is under heavy scrutiny owing to risks of opioid use disorders and overdose-related deaths; long-term opioid use risks narcotic bowel syndrome, which occurs in approximately 6% of this population and is characterized by chronic or frequently recurring narcotic-induced increases in abdominal pain despite continued or escalating dosages; tramadol is considered an opioid and has the potential for addiction and other opioid-associated adverse events; the primary treatment is cessation of opioids, if possible.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction [^113rQFk8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a distressing condition that may persist indefinitely in the clinical setting. As we understand more about normal gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, we are also beginning to understand more fully how opioids cause bowel dysfunction. Current therapeutic interventions for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can be burdensome and sometimes lack efficacy. Systemic opioid antagonists administered orally can induce laxation, but can unpredictably induce systemic or local GI tract withdrawal symptoms. Two new investigational agents, alvimopan and methylnaltrexone, are peripherally acting opioid antagonists that do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Studies to date show promise that these agents may relieve opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in a well-tolerated manner without reversing central analgesia.

Introduction

Pain, when not effectively treated and relieved, has detrimental effects on all aspects of a patient's quality of life (QoL). Opioids represent the cornerstone of pain treatment, being the most commonly prescribed medication to treat severe pain in the Western world. Opioids are increasingly used for the treatment also of noncancer pain. However, opioids are associated with side effects, which include sedation, physical dependence, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal (GI)-related side effects. These side effects can directly reduce patient QoL and increase medical service use, but may also be dose limiting, thus affecting pain control. While tolerance develops to most side effects, GI side effects remain an ongoing problem for the majority of patients.

GI-related side effects are mediated through the binding of opioid agonists to μ-receptors located in the enteric nervous system, which causes increased nonpropulsive contractions and inhibition of water and electrolyte excretion, leading to delayed GI transit and hard, infrequent stools. A less common side effect of opioids is narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS), characterized by a paradoxical increase in abdominal pain associated with continuous or increasing doses of opioids.

GI-related side effects, which include constipation, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, gastro-oesophageal reflux, abdominal cramping, spasms, and bloating, are collectively known as opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD). Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most frequently reported and persistent side effect in patients receiving opioids for analgesia. This review aims to evaluate the current understanding of OIBD and provide timely evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients affected by this condition.

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^113HyW5c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The use of opioid medications on both an acute and chronic basis is ubiquitous in the United States. As opioid receptors densely populate the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms and side effects can be expected in these patients. In the esophagus, dysmotility may result, manifesting with dysphagia and a syndrome indistinguishable from primary achalasia. In the stomach, a marked delay in gastric emptying may occur with postprandial nausea and early satiety. Postoperatively, particularly with abdominal surgery, opioid-induced ileus may ensue. In the colon, opioid-induced constipation is common. A unique syndrome termed narcotic bowel syndrome is characterized by chronic abdominal pain often accompanied by nausea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable causes. With the recognition of the important role of opioids on gastrointestinal function, novel drugs have been developed that use this physiology. These medications include peripheral acting opioid agonists to treat opioid-induced constipation and combination agonist and antagonists used for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. This review summarizes the most recent data in these areas.

### Diagnosis, characterization, and 3-month outcome after detoxification of 39 patients with narcotic bowel syndrome [^114ddyJb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBFECTIVES: Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) is characterized by a paradoxical increase in abdominal pain associated with continued or escalating dosages of narcotics. This study evaluated the clinical and psychosocial features of patients with NBS and the response to detoxification treatment.

Methods

For 2 years, 39 patients seen by the GI consult service at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) with presumed NBS were placed on a detoxification program. Clinical, psychosocial, health status, and outcome data were obtained before and after detoxification. Our aims were to: (i) clinically characterize patients with presumed NBS, (ii) assess the clinical response and adverse effects to detoxification, (iii) identify clinical and psychosocial predictors of treatment response, and (iv) determine the clinical outcome at 3 months after detoxification and the time frame for patients who revert back to narcotics.

Results

Of the 39 patients detoxified, 89.7% met predefined criteria. Patients were mostly well educated (14.5 ± 2.3 years of school), female (92.3%), and with a variety of diagnoses (21% irritable bowel syndrome IBS/functional, 37% inflammatory bowel disease and other structural, 29% fibromyalgia and other functional somatic, or orthopedic, and 13% postoperative or other). They reported high health-care use (15.3 ± 10.1 MD visits/6 months; 6.5 ± 6.1 hospitalizations/2 years, 6.4 ± 2.0 surgeries/lifetime), and 82.1% were jobless. Despite high dosages of narcotics (total intravenous (IV) morphine equivalent 75.3 ± 78.0 mg/day), pain scores were rated severe (52.9 ± 28.8 visual analog scale (VAS); 257.1 ± 139.6 functional bowel disorder severity index (FBDSI); 17.2 ± 10.2 (McGill Pain and greater than labor or postoperative pain). Multiple symptoms were reported (n = 17.8 ± 9.2) and rated as moderate to severe. Psychosocial scores showed high catastrophizing (19.9 ± 8.6); poor daily function (Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical 28.3 ± 7.7, mental 34.3 ± 11.0; worse than tetraplegia); 28.2% were clinically depressed and 33.3% anxious (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)). Detoxification was successfully completed by 89.7%; after detoxification, abdominal pain was reduced by 35% (P < 0.03) and nonabdominal pain by 42% (P < 0.01) on VAS, and catastrophizing significantly improved (P < 0.01). Responder status was met in 56.4% with 48.7% achieving a ≥ 30% reduction in pain. By 3 months after detoxification, 45.8% had returned to using narcotics. For those who remained off narcotics at 3 months, the VAS abdominal pain score was 75% lower than pretreatment when compared with those who went back on narcotics (24% lower). Successful detoxification and a good clinical response was associated with low abuse potential (Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) score < 9).

Conclusions

Despite severe pain, poor coping, and poor health status, almost all patients with NBS undergoing detoxification were able to stop using narcotics and have significant improvement in pain and coping. However, almost ½ reverted to narcotic use at 3 months. Those who stayed off narcotics showed greater improvement in pain scores. This study provides a rationale for treating patients with NBS by detoxification in order to improve their clinical status. Further work is needed to understand the reasons for the high recidivism rate.

### Opioid-induced constipation [^116bgKc5]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is common in people treated with opioids and poses risks for physical sequelae, analgesic discontinuation, and decreased quality of life.

Methods

Targeted literature review of evidence- and consensus-based data on appropriate diagnosis, concise definition, and conventional and newer management strategies for OIC.

Results

OIC may develop early and need early treatment. To address gaps in consistent definitions and treatment recommendations, a consensus panel organized through the American Academy of Pain Medicine Foundation set diagnostic criteria and endorsed the Bowel Function Index for OIC assessment. The panel further proposed management strategies for OIC, including a proposed threshold for prescriptive therapies.

Discussion

OIC results from action exerted on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, a mechanism distinct from idiopathic constipation. Lifestyle changes and over-the-counter drugs are first-line treatments but leave refractory constipation in many opioid-treated patients. Newer therapeutic modalities that are available and in development are highlighted.

Summary

Physicians need a better understanding of the negative impacts of OIC for patients and better OIC-specific methods to assess, treat, and monitor it.

### Alcohol and narcotics use in inflammatory bowel disease [^112KhY7z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common and debilitating symptom among IBD patients. In the past, narcotics were often contraindicated in patients with IBD for fear of precipitating toxic megacolon, but nowadays narcotics are commonly used in the IBD population. Development of chronic abdominal pain is an under-recognized side effect of opioid use. Narcotic bowel syndrome, which occurs in a small proportion of chronic opioid users, consists of chronic or intermittent abdominal pain.

Narcotics use appears to be a significant factor that can complicate IBD, as a significant portion of IBD patients using narcotics meet the criteria for drug dependence, while it has also been reported that treatment with narcotics can significantly predict death among IBD patients. It is estimated that approximately 5–13% of patients with IBD are on chronic narcotics in the outpatient setting. Patients may also turn to narcotics, either as an alternative to normal therapy, because of concerns about the risks of medications, or as a supplement to standard treatment protocols. Some studies suggest that patients with IBD who use marijuana can derive symptomatic benefits. Cannabis use also provides symptom relief in patients with IBD, but is associated with a worse disease prognosis in patients with CD, while exogenous cannabinoids can also reduce colitis. Furthermore, through mechanisms such as stimulating antikinetic neurotransmitters, promoting dysmotility and injuring enteric neurons narcotics are associated with colonic pseudo-obstruction.

From the available studies it was evident that the use of narcotics for analgesia is prevalent among adult and young IBD patients and is associated with more active disease and impaired quality of life Furthermore, it is reported that psychological dysfunction is one of the factors contributing to pain perception by IBD patients. Notably, all the included studies in the present review reported that, among IBD patients, those with a longer duration of disease and those with comorbid mental health illnesses were more likely to be narcotics users.

Interestingly, the majority of the studies examining alcohol consumption and also narcotic use among IBD patients adjusted their results according to the patients' age and sex — without, however, taking ethnic or cultural differences into account. It is reported that the prevalence of alcohol and drugs use varies between different ethnic populations. Therefore, future studies acknowledging this factor are needed.

### Narcotic use for inflammatory bowel disease and risk factors during hospitalization [^114dMb2k]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Growing evidence demonstrates the adverse effects of narcotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We sought to study the relationship between narcotic use, objective measures of disease activity, and other associated factors in hospitalized patients with IBD.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult IBD patients admitted to a general medical or surgical ward service at a United States tertiary care center over a 1-year period. We collected demographic and disease-specific information, inpatient narcotic use, and disease activity measurements from endoscopic and radiologic reports. Bivariate comparisons were made between characteristics and narcotic use. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent effects of characteristics on narcotic use.

Results

A total of 117 IBD patients were included. Narcotics were given to 70.1% of hospitalized patients. Factors significantly associated with any inpatient narcotic use: Crohn's disease (CD); P ≤ 0.01, duration of IBD, P = 0.02, prior psychiatric diagnosis, P = 0.02, outpatient narcotic use, P ≤ 0.01, current smoking, P ≤ 0.01, prior IBD-specific surgery, P < 0.02, and prior IBD / irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis, P = 0.02. Narcotic use was not significantly associated with disease severity on computed tomography (CT) scan or endoscopy. On multivariate analysis, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 4.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–15.6) and prior outpatient narcotic use (OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.54–19.0) were independently associated with inpatient narcotic use.

Conclusions

A majority of patients with IBD are prescribed narcotics during hospitalization in spite of data on increased complications. Risk factors for narcotic use include CD and associated factors (disease duration, surgeries), substance abuse (outpatient narcotics and smoking), psychiatric diagnoses, and IBD-IBS.

### Chronic pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115rcyni]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

5.1 Opioids

Opioids are problematic. Immediate pain relief with short-term opioid use does not translate into improved functioning with long-term use. Opioids can cause gastrointestinal-related adverse effects, collectively called opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and including constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating, and gastric reflux. Patients with IBD are at high risk for this condition because they suffer from chronic relapsing-remitting pain. Chronic high-dose opioid use can also induce visceral hyperalgesia (narcotic bowel syndrome) in a small subset of patients with IBD. This is highly intractable to treatment and a cause of prolonged hospital admission.

Despite these problems, prescription opioid use is higher among patients with IBD compared with non-IBD patientsand, in England, for example, increased significantly from 1990 through 2013. An estimated 5% of patients with IBD become heavy users of opioids within 10 years of diagnosis. IBD is an independent risk factor for becoming a heavy opioid user, and risk increases with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety.

Research continues into whether currently available opioids can be delivered, or new opioids developed, with radically less potential for addiction and serious side effects, and into strategies for limiting, reducing, and tightly monitoring opioid use in patients with IBD. The specificity of visceral pain-signalling neurons provides potential for developing peripherally restricted analgesics specific for visceral pain, devoid of CNS effects.

Meanwhile, chronic use of currently licensed prescription opioids is associated with poorer control of pain, increased healthcare use, and higher mortality in patients with IBD. Long-term use of opioids therefore should, as far as possible, be avoided for pain management in these patients, and alternatives offered. National guidelines on opioid use for long-term pain concur in recommending education for informed consent and monitoring, commensurate with risk assessments. If continual or repeated opioid-based analgesics are necessary, for example in patients with major abdominal fistulae, they should preferably be prescribed in settings with access to nonpharmacological interventions and resources for managing acute and long-term consequences of dose reduction or discontinuation.

### AGA clinical practice update on pain management in inflammatory bowel disease: commentary [^112Ckcvi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease–related chronic abdominal pain — opioids and alternatives are addressed: "Narcotics are not advised for any chronic abdominal pain due to the risk of addiction and paradoxical amplification of pain sensitivity in the spinal cord and development of narcotic bowel syndrome". To limit exposure, "opioid reduction is implemented as patients receive behavioral support", and "Opioid detoxification protocols have shown that withdrawing opioids improves narcotic bowel syndrome and were also associated with lower abdominal pain scores". As potential adjuncts, "N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists, such as ketamine, have been found to reduce hyperalgesia in the context of gut inflammation", but "have not been studied extensively in clinical trials in patients with IBD". Regarding cannabis, "there are no quantitative studies supporting its use, and the safety of long-term use is unknown".

### Evolving paradigms in the treatment of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction [^116iWMUM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

In recent years prescription of opioids has increased significantly. Although effective in pain management, bothersome gastrointestinal adverse effects are experienced by a substantial proportion of opioid-treated patients. This can lead to difficulties with therapy and subsequently inadequate pain relief. Collectively referred to as opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, these adverse effects are the result of binding of exogenous opioids to opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to disturbance of three important gastrointestinal functions: motility, coordination of sphincter function and secretion. In the clinic this manifests in a wide range of symptoms such as reflux, bloating, abdominal cramping, hard, dry stools, and incomplete evacuation, although the most known adverse effect is opioid-induced constipation. Traditional treatment with laxatives is often insufficient, but in recent years a number of novel pharmacological approaches have been introduced. In this review the pathophysiology, symptomatology and prevalence of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is presented along with the benefits and caveats of a suggested consensus definition for opioid-induced constipation. Finally, traditional treatment is appraised and compared with the latest pharmacological developments. In conclusion, opioid antagonists restricted to the periphery show promising results, but use of different definitions and outcome measures complicate comparison. However, an international working group has recently suggested a consensus definition for opioid-induced constipation and relevant outcome measures have also been proposed. If investigators within this field adapt the suggested consensus and include symptoms related to dysfunction of the upper gut, it will ease comparison and be a step forward in future research.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of opioid-induced constipation [^113pRm7m]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Opioids are potent analgesics used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Side-effects are common and among the most bothersome are those associated with opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, which includes opioid-induced constipation. In this Review, we provide a summary of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of opioid-induced constipation, which can be defined as a change in baseline bowel habit or defecatory patterns following initiation, alteration, or increase of opioid therapy. Opioid-induced constipation is a consequence of the action of opioids on their receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. A comprehensive clinical assessment is beneficial, including evaluation of the patient's understanding of their constipation and underlying condition for which opioids are used. Clinical assessment should also aim to differentiate opioid-induced constipation from pre-existing constipation exacerbated by the opioids. Preventive strategies need to be considered when patients start treatment with opioids, such as lifestyle changes. First-line management includes simple over-the-counter laxatives. The bowel function index can be useful to objectively identify patients who are refractory to these initial measures. In this context, alternative over-the-counter laxatives (or combinations of laxatives), secretogogues, or peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists might also be considered. Educational strategies need to be developed to improve the knowledge base of health-care providers on the identification and management of opioid-induced constipation.

### Pain management in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: translational approaches from bench to bedside [^114QrX1P]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that negatively affects quality of life and can lead to increased health-seeking behavior. Although abdominal pain has been traditionally attributed to inflammation, there is growing literature demonstrating the existence of functional abdominal pain in patients with IBD, of which there are a variety of potential causes. Thus, when approaching a patient with IBD who has abdominal pain, in addition to IBD-related complications (e.g., inflammation/stricture), it is important to screen for related contributors, including peripheral factors (visceral hypersensitivity, bacterial overgrowth, and bowel dysmotility) and centrally mediated neurobiological and psychosocial underpinnings. These central factors include psychological symptoms/diagnoses, sleep disturbance, and stress. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (e.g., narcotic bowel syndrome) is also growing in recognition as a potential central source of abdominal pain. This review draws from clinical studies and animal models of colitis and abdominal pain to consider how knowledge of these potential etiologies can be used to individualize treatment of abdominal pain in patients with IBD, including consideration of potential novel treatment modalities for the future. Accurate assessment of the source(s) of pain in patients with IBD can help guide appropriate diagnostic workup and use of disease-modifying therapy.

Nonpharmacological Prevention and Treatment of OIC

Nonpharmacological Treatments of OIC Include Dietary Recommendations and Lifestyle Modifications

Comment: In patients with OIC, no study in the current literature has tested the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments. In subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation, there is no evidence that increasing fluid intake, unless there is co-existent dehydration, is an effective treatment.

In nonopioid-induced constipation (i.e. chronic idiopathic constipation), increasing soluble dietary fiber, psyllium, or ispaghula may improve symptoms. Finally, moderate-to-intense physical activity may improve moderate chronic idiopathic constipation. With regard to OIC, standard daily fluid and fiber intakes should be recommended, although this is not evidence based. However, increases in physical activity might be difficult to obtain in patients with chronic pain requiring treatment with opioids.

If narcotic bowel syndrome is suspected to contribute to the symptoms, tapering or withdrawal of opioids should be tried and pain should be treated by alternative measures.

### Patients with short bowel on narcotics during 2 randomized trials have abdominal complaints independent of teduglutide [^114GuxVc]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Narcotic agents, which are often used to manage increased intestinal motility in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS), may be associated with gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, including abdominal pain, constipation, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. GI complaints also have been recorded as common adverse events (AEs) during phase III clinical trials of teduglutide in patients with SBS who were dependent on parenteral support (PS; parenteral nutrition [PN] and/or intravenous [IV] fluids). –

These treatment-emergent GI AEs were not unexpected; they are consistent with both the underlying condition of SBSand with the known intestinotrophic mechanism of action of teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) analogue that promotes intestinal adaptation and intestinal growth and increases absorptive capacity in patients with intestinal failure associated with SBS. However, because GI complaints were recorded in patients randomized to active drug and those who received matching placebo, it is not clear to what extent they were attributable to teduglutide or narcotic agents, especially considering that a large number of patients in both treatment groups were receiving narcotic agents. This post hoc analysis was undertaken to explore the correlations between the incidence of narcotic use and abdominal complaints reported by patients with SBS during the phase III clinical studies of teduglutide, with the aim of understanding better the possible origins of these GI symptoms.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^114MLuYE]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

5.2 Opioid and other drug effects on the bowel

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can result from both opioid withdrawal and chronic opioid usage and manifests with features of dysmotility (especially constipation) when pain is not the dominant issue. The narcotic bowel syndrome may result from chronic usage and is defined as chronic, worsening or frequently occurring abdominal pain despite continued or escalating doses of narcotics in addition to dysmotility. The opioid usage induces a hyperalgesic effect. It may be becoming more prevalent but it is often not recognised by clinicians. In addition to being acknowledged to occur in patients with gastrointestinal disease (functional or organic), it also occurs in patients with no pre-existing gastrointestinal problems who take high doses of the opioids for other painful conditions (eg, joint problems or following surgery).

The components of therapy for narcotic bowel syndrome are recognition of the disorder, a trusting therapeutic relationship with the patient, replacement using neuropathic type pain drugs and controlled reduction in the opioid dose. Specific drug treatments have been tried for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and narcotic bowel syndrome and include clonidine (to reduce withdrawal symptoms) and peripheral mu opioid antagonists (naloxone, methylnaltrexone, alvimopan).

Opioids inhibit intestinal motility and so invalidate the tests of small bowel motility. They may also increase the risk of line infections in patients on long-term PN.

Survivors of cancer treatment may have bowel dysmotility which may be due to chemotherapy or opioid medication. Their management may require a wider MDT input.

Cyclizine is both an antihistamine and anticholinergic drug which acts as a centrally acting anti-emetic. There are many reports of it being taken for its euphoric effect, which is most marked when taken intravenously. In addition to causing addictive behaviour, it is of a low pH and so damages veins. It is not recommended for long-term use, especially in patients receiving PN.

Other drugs such as anticholinergics, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, chronic laxative abuse or some chemotherapeutic drugs (eg, vincristine) may also cause reduced gut propulsion.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^114fJvCJ]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) — initial assessment and conservative measures emphasize that one of the first steps is to ensure the opioid indication is appropriate, participation in a pain management program, and use of the minimum necessary opioid dose; a suggested general approach includes careful history of bowel patterns, stool consistency, dysynergic symptoms, and alarm features, with other causes considered and excluded. Lifestyle modifications are an appropriate first step, including increasing fluid intake, moderate exercise as tolerated, and toileting promptly when urged. There may also be benefit in "opioid switching" to an equianalgesic dose of a less-constipating opioid; oral or parenteral morphine may induce more constipation than transdermal opioids, such as fentanyl. Combination opioid agonist/antagonist agents (eg, oxycodone + naloxone) are also associated with lower risk of constipation. Once OIC is confirmed and other causes excluded, the recommendations can guide appropriate evidence-based management.

### Emerging treatments in neurogastroenterology: a multidisciplinary working group consensus statement on opioid-induced constipation [^114mffVR]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Opioids are effective for acute and chronic pain conditions, but their use is associated with often difficult-to-manage constipation and other gastrointestinal (GI) effects due to effects on peripheral μ-opioid receptors in the gut. The mechanism of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) differs from that of functional constipation (FC), and OIC may not respond as well to most first-line treatments for FC. The impact of OIC on quality of life (QoL) induces some patients to decrease or stop their opioid therapy to relieve or avoid constipation.

Purpose

At a roundtable meeting on OIC, a working group developed a consensus definition for OIC diagnosis across disciplines and reviewed current OIC treatments and the potential of treatments in development. By consensus, OIC is defined as follows: 'A change when initiating opioid therapy from baseline bowel habits that is characterized by any of the following: reduced bowel movement frequency, development or worsening of straining to pass bowel movements, a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation, or harder stool consistency'. The working group noted the prior validation of a patient response outcome and end point for clinical trials and recommended future efforts to create treatment guidelines and QoL measures specific for OIC. Details from the working group's discussion and consensus recommendations for patient care and research are presented in this article.

To better understand what causes the irritable bowel syndrome, we are studying drugs used to treat pain, dextromethorphan, naloxone, fentanyl, and lidocaine. We will study the effects these drugs have on experimental pain. Dextromethorphan is used in non-prescription cough syrups. Naloxone is used for reversing the effects of narcotic pain relievers. Fentanyl is a narcotic used to treat pain and to make a person relaxed before anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to see what kinds of pain are affected by these drugs in persons who have irritable bowel syndrome and persons who do not have this problem.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel function that effects up to 20% of the United States population.

### Management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in cancer patients [^111kdGeG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal (GI) effects of morphine and other opioids may result in opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD) and the need for treatment. Although OBD is very common in morphine-treated patients, it is usually under-diagnosed. Opioids deliver their GI effect through central and peripheral mechanisms. Laxatives are the pharmaceuticals prescribed most in this area. Prokinetics as well as cholinergic agonists have been used satisfactorily. One-third of patients with OBD have to be treated rectally. The use of opioid antagonists has been favored, but the bioavailability of oral forms is poor. Opioid antagonists with a quaternary structure have a high affinity for peripheral opioid receptors and therefore do not interfere with the analgesia, nor do they generate alkaloid withdrawal syndrome. Opioid rotation is another strategy for maintaining or improving analgesic quality directed toward decreasing the effects of previous opiates on the GI tract.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^112vFYEg]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline — opioid-induced constipation (OIC) epidemiology, mechanism, and definitions are summarized as follows: Approximately 9–12 million Americans suffer from chronic pain annually, and it is estimated that 4%–5% of the US population use prescription opioids regularly; constipation is near universal in patients taking opioid medications and OIC is estimated to affect 40%–80% of patients taking opioids. OIC occurs primarily via activation of enteric μ-receptors, and the term opioid-induced constipation refers simply to constipation that is a result of opioid therapy. The Rome IV definition for OIC describes new or worsening symptoms of constipation when initiating, changing, or increasing opioid therapy that includes 2 or more of the following: straining during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, lumpy or hard stools more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, sensation of incomplete evacuation more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, manual maneuvers to facilitate more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, or fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week, and these definitions include not only a change in stool frequency, but also changes in stool consistency and/or difficulty with defecation. A consensus definition also states OIC is "a change when initiating opioid therapy from baseline bowel habits" with features including reduced bowel movement frequency, development or worsening of straining to pass bowel movements, a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation, or harder stool frequency.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^117DVFSv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is frequently encountered in the general population. It may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID; also known as a disorder of gut-brain interaction), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, and biliary pain. Although national and international guidelines exist for managing the symptoms of IBS, including the abdominal pain,–recommendations for the general diagnosis and symptomatic management of FACP are lacking.

The lack of guidance on how to diagnose and manage FACP reflects the absence of a standard, accepted definition, and limited focused literature on this complaint. The Rome Foundation has developed and updated its own criteria, currently up to Rome IV, to diagnose FGIDs, including those associated with FACP, such as IBS, functional dyspepsia, biliary pain, postprandial distress syndrome, epigastric pain syndrome, and narcotic bowel syndrome (also referred to as opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia). However, although the Rome criteria are a useful tool for gastroenterologists and researchers, they do not fully capture the presentation of FACP seen in everyday practice, nor are they practical enough to be used routinely by primary care physicians (PCPs)/general practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, or patients, whose primary objective — once structural, organic causation has been ruled out — is symptom alleviation. The present expert guidance attempts to address these issues by providing a consensus definition for FACP and by presenting recommendations for its diagnosis and clinical management, with a focus on primary care and self-management. To complement these recommendations, practical, easy-to-use algorithms have been constructed to aid physicians, pharmacists, and patients themselves in identifying and managing FACP.

### Chronic opioid induced constipation in patients with nonmalignant pain: challenges and opportunities [^113yRfRW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

With the recent introduction and approval of medications directed at the treatment of opioid induced constipation (OIC) in patients with nonmalignant pain, there is increased interest and understanding of the unmet need and opportunities to enhance patient management. The high incidence of OIC is associated with rapid increase of narcotic analgesic prescriptions for nonmalignant chronic pain. This review addresses briefly the mechanisms of action of opioids that lead to OIC, the differential tolerance of gastrointestinal organs to the effects of opioids, the size and scope of the problem, the definition and outcome measures for OIC, current differential diagnosis and management algorithms, and the pharmacology and efficacy of treatments for OIC in patients with nonmalignant pain.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of chronic gastrointestinal pain in disorders of gut-brain interaction: expert review [^116kt1gT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Chronic gastrointestinal pain in disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBI) — evidence and practice advisories — Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were no more efficacious than placebo, while tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) ranked first for efficacy for pain. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been less well studied, with a venlafaxine trial in functional dyspepsia (FD) not showing any benefit, and in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) the evidence for duloxetine is limited to case series, although there is high-quality evidence that duloxetine is efficacious in other chronic painful disorders. Mirtazapine seemed to have greater effects on early satiety than epigastric pain and, in IBS with diarrhea, a recent trial showed significant improvements in abdominal pain; an open-label trial of low-dose naltrexone in IBS showed a significant improvement in pain-free days. Avoiding opioid medications is critical to prevent development of opioid use disorders and narcotic bowel syndrome; in patients who do not respond to the measures outlined here, involvement of a pain management specialist may be required, and overall management requires a multipronged approach to optimize patient outcomes.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^112wnrbM]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Aims of this consensus panel were to determine (1) an optimal symptom-based method for assessing opioid-induced constipation in clinical practice and (2) a threshold of symptom severity to prompt consideration of prescription therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 10 experts with extensive knowledge/experience with opioid-associated adverse events convened to discuss the literature on assessment methods used for opioid-induced constipation and reach consensus on each objective using the nominal group technique.

Results

Five validated assessment tools were evaluated: the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM), Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL), Stool Symptom Screener (SSS), Bowel Function Index (BFI), and Bowel Function Diary (BF-Diary). The 3-item BFI and 4-item SSS, both clinician administered, are the shortest tools. In published trials, the BFI and 12-item PAC-SYM are most commonly used. The 11-item BF-Diary is highly relevant in opioid-induced constipation and was developed and validated in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. However, the panel believes that the complex scoring for this tool and the SSS, PAC-SYM, and 28-item PAC-QOL may be unfeasible for clinical practice. The BFI is psychometrically validated and responsive to changes in symptom severity; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity and scores > 28.8 points indicating constipation.

Conclusions

The BFI is a simple assessment tool with a validated threshold of clinically significant constipation. Prescription treatments for opioid-induced constipation should be considered for patients who have a BFI score of ≥ 30 points and an inadequate response to first-line interventions.

5.10.2 Opioid medication use in IBD

Good Practice Recommendation 23. Long-term opioid use is associated with poor outcomes in IBD and should be discouraged. Investigation for causes of pain, use of alternative non-opioid drugs and psychological support should be considered (Agreement: 100%).

Opioid medications have analgesic and anti-motility properties. They are more likely to be prescribed to IBD patients than to matched controls. Risk factors for use include female gender, multiple surgeries, severity of pain, higher clinical disease activity, a history of depression or anxiety and polypharmacy, particularly with neuropsychiatric drugs. Patients with sustained poor quality of life have a higher risk of subsequent opioid use and a decreased time to first opioid prescription. Use of narcotics correlates with corticosteroid use in IBD. A Canadian point prevalence study showed that opioid prescribing was highest in the first month following IBD diagnosis where 11% of patients received this class of drug. Prescription was more common in females and in Crohn's disease relative to UC. Patients with IBD were more likely to become heavy opioid users (defined as a dose exceeding 50 mg of morphine or equivalent per day for at least 30 consecutive days) than age-matched controls. Use of narcotics in both Crohn's disease and UC is associated with increased prevalence of depressive symptoms, a higher risk of serious infection in IBDand increased mortality. Historical studies show an association of opioid prescription with development of toxic megacolon in fulminant colitis.

Abstract

Objective

Aims of this consensus panel were to determine (1) an optimal symptom‐based method for assessing opioid‐induced constipation in clinical practice and (2) a threshold of symptom severity to prompt consideration of prescription therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 10 experts with extensive knowledge/experience with opioid‐associated adverse events convened to discuss the literature on assessment methods used for opioid‐induced constipation and reach consensus on each objective using the nominal group technique.

Results

Five validated assessment tools were evaluated: the Patient Assessment of Constipation–Symptoms (PAC‐SYM), Patient Assessment of Constipation–Quality of Life (PAC‐QOL), Stool Symptom Screener (SSS), Bowel Function Index (BFI), and Bowel Function Diary (BF‐Diary). The 3‐item BFI and 4‐item SSS, both clinician administered, are the shortest tools. In published trials, the BFI and 12‐item PAC‐SYM are most commonly used. The 11‐item BF‐Diary is highly relevant in opioid‐induced constipation and was developed and validated in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. However, the panel believes that the complex scoring for this tool and the SSS, PAC‐SYM, and 28‐item PAC‐QOL may be unfeasible for clinical practice. The BFI is psychometrically validated and responsive to changes in symptom severity; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity and scores > 28.8 points indicating constipation.

Conclusions

The BFI is a simple assessment tool with a validated threshold of clinically significant constipation. Prescription treatments for opioid‐induced constipation should be considered for patients who have a BFI score of ≥ 30 points and an inadequate response to first‐line interventions.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^112VxvYy]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

A search of the medical literature was conducted using Medline (1946–September 2014), EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947–September 2014), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Potentially relevant studies were identified using the terms listed in the Appendix. Using further search terms (also listed in the Appendix), the identified studies were categorized as relating to prevalence, epidemiology, mechanisms, nonpharmacological treatment, pharmacological treatment, and treatment with opioid antagonists.

In total, the search yielded 10,832 unique citations (Figure 1). For inclusion, all studies were required to be performed in a population of adults who were receiving opioids and who had a confirmed diagnosis of OIBD based on clinical symptoms, physician's opinion, or diagnostic criteria specified by study investigators. Studies identified within the treatment categories were also required to be randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing pharmacological or nonpharmacological therapies with a control measure. There was no minimum duration of therapy, but quantitative assessment of response to therapy was required. Results had to be supplemented by negative investigations (e.g. colonoscopy) where deemed necessary by the trial. Only publications in English were included in the analysis. Using the above inclusion and exclusion criteria, the identified citations were screened independently by two investigators for relevance by title and then abstract, which resulted in 124 and 52 citations, respectively. Full publications of the 52 citations were assessed, and, following discussion to resolve any disagreement, a final list of 33 citations was generated. Screening the reference lists of the pertinent papers identified additional publications.

Figure 1
Flow diagram showing review of literature to identify clinical research papers relating to OIBD.

Statements were then formulated and justified by a comment. The statements were labeled with the degree of agreement (usually unanimous) and their level of evidence by the strength of recommendation taxonomy (SORT) system (level 1 = high; level 2 = moderate; level 3 = low). This corresponds to the classification by the GRADE system where the levels of evidence "low" and "very low" are pooled. The strength of recommendation is given as "strong" or "weak" when applicable. Independent electronic voting was carried out after a joint meeting where all authors had the possibility to discuss the different sections and comment on each statement. The table showing the results can be found in the Appendix.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^116DPbEU]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP guidelines — Side effect management and safety counseling: During dosage titration of opioid therapy, advise patients to avoid dangerous activities (e.g., driving or using heavy machinery) until a stable dosage is established and it is certain the opioid dose does not cause sedation. Warn about the greatly increased risks for sedation and respiratory depression when opioids are combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedating drugs. For bowel dysfunction, consider initiation of a prophylactic bowel regimen despite mostly anecdotal evidence, using increased fluid and fiber intake, stool softeners, and laxatives, and note that evidence is insufficient to recommend opioid antagonists to prevent bowel dysfunction. When assessing driving safety on long‑term therapy, consider factors that impair cognition and psychomotor ability such as a consistently severe pain rating, disordered sleep, and sedating concomitant medications.

### Management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction [^115qxQYK]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a major complication in oncology practice and must be approached aggressively. Every patient starting opioids should be thoroughly instructed in the management of this side effect. Prevention is the key and use of agents such as senna and a stool softener with the initiation of therapy is mandatory, with rapid titration if the initial dose is not effective. At the first sign of constipation, agents such as bisacodyl should be added rapidly. Other agents then can be added as necessary. Fecal impaction must always be considered and it should be recognized that it may lead to other symptoms such as increased pain, urinary difficulties, or nausea and vomiting. In summary, the words of Dame Cicely Saunders, founder of the hospice movement, must be kept in mind: "Remember the bowels".

Opioid-induced constipation — guideline scope, exclusions, and methodology specify that this guideline focuses on the medical management of OIC and does not address psychological therapy, alternative medicine approaches, surgery, or devices, and the guideline and technical review are not able to directly address questions regarding the diagnostic evaluation of OIC. Additionally, combination opioid agonists/antagonists are not specifically addressed by the technical review or guideline recommendation statements, though these agents may result in less constipation than pure opioid agonists when used for management of chronic pain. The AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates GRADE methodology and best practices as outlined by the Institute of Medicine, and optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^1163J2zK]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Strategies for the management of pain commonly involve the use of opioid analgesics coupled with appropriate vigilance in patient selection and monitoring 1. The analgesic efficacy of many opioids is attributable to actions exerted by these agents via µ‐opioid receptors in the central nervous system 2. Because µ‐opioid receptors are also expressed throughout body tissues including the gastrointestinal tract 2, opioid analgesics are often associated with various types of opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD) 3, 4. Opioid‐induced constipation (OIC) is the most prevalent OBD and is caused by opioid‐mediated reductions in small intestinal and colonic transit, increased fluid absorption, inhibition of gastrointestinal chloride secretion, and stimulation or decreased relaxation of the pyloric and internal anal sphincters 4, 5, 6, 7. The condition has been reported in up to 47% of opioid‐treated patients and may occur at a higher incidence in women and with increasing age; the greatest risk factor is a longer duration of opioid therapy 8. Furthermore, OIC imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QOL), reduces work productivity, impairs effectiveness of pain management, and can lead to clinically significant physical sequelae such as those related to bowel obstruction and fecal impaction 9, 10.

Although the current Rome III diagnostic criteria provide a multifaceted definition of functional constipation 11, this condition is not opioid related, and a standardized OIC‐focused definition is needed 12. In 2014, a multidisciplinary consensus group proposed defining OIC as a change from baseline bowel habits upon initiation of opioids that is characterized by any of the following symptoms: (1) reduced bowel movement (BM) frequency; (2) development or worsening of straining to pass stool; (3) a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation; or (4) harder stool consistency 3. In a 2015 systematic review, outcomes including BM frequency, stool consistency, straining, and QOL were suggested for use in OIC clinical trials 12. However, the appropriateness of using these or other outcomes for assessing OIC in clinical practice has not been determined.

### Prevalence and impact of inflammatory bowel disease-irritable bowel syndrome on patient-reported outcomes in CCFA partners [^113PpRho]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with persistent symptoms despite no or minimal inflammation are frequently described as having an overlap of IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBD-IBS). Limited data are available on how IBS impacts the individual patient with IBD. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of IBD-IBS and investigate its impact on patient-reported outcomes.

Method

We performed a cross-sectional analysis within the CCFA Partners Study. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to investigate associations between IBD-IBS and various demographic, disease factors, and patient-reported outcomes including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, pain interference, and social satisfaction.

Results

Of the 6309 participants included, a total of 1279 (20%) reported a coexisting IBS diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD-IBS in this cohort was similar within disease subtypes. A diagnosis of IBD-IBS was associated with higher narcotic use compared with those with no IBS diagnosis for both Crohn's disease, 17% versus 11% (P < 0.001) and ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis, 9% versus 5% (P < 0.001). Quality of life, as measured by Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was lower in patients with IBD-IBS compared with those without. IBD-IBS diagnosis was associated with anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances, pain interference, and decreased social satisfaction.

Conclusions

In this sample of patients with IBD, high prevalence of concomitant IBS diagnosis was observed. IBD-IBS diagnosis was associated with increased narcotic use and adverse patient-reported outcome. Appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and counseling may help improve the functional status of IBD-IBS patients and decrease narcotic use.

### The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European patient survey (PROBE 1) [^113GgWRd]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This multinational, Internet-based survey was designed to assess the prevalence, frequency, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD) in patients receiving opioid therapy for chronic pain and taking laxatives.

Design

In total, 322 patients taking daily oral opioids and laxatives completed the 45-item questionnaire. At the time of the survey, 45% of patients reported < 3 bowel movements per week. The most prevalent opioid-induced side effects were constipation (81%) and straining to pass a bowel movement (58%). Those side effects considered most bothersome by patients were (in order of rank) constipation, straining, fatigue, small or hard bowel movements, and insomnia.

Results

Most of the OBD symptoms specified in the questionnaire were experienced by the majority of patients ≥ 4 times a week. Constipation was the OBD symptom that was most often reported as severe. Most patients reported that their OBD symptoms had at least a moderate negative impact on their overall quality of life and activities of daily living. A third of patients had missed, decreased or stopped using opioids in order to make it easier to have a bowel movement.

Conclusion

The survey findings confirm that OBD occurs frequently, despite the use of laxatives, in individuals taking daily oral opioids for chronic pain. These gastrointestinal symptoms add to the burden already experienced by chronic pain patients, negatively impacting quality of life and, in some cases, affecting opioid treatment itself.

### Opioids and the gut: pharmacology and current clinical experience [^114CYCWS]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

This article reviews the pharmacology and physiology of opiate receptors and the current and potential uses of opioid agonists and antagonists in clinical gastroenterology. Mu-receptors are involved in motor and sensory functions, and their modulation is established for treatment of diarrhea. Mu-antagonists have potential to reverse endogenous (e.g., postoperative ileus) or iatrogenic dysmotility (e.g., opioid bowel dysfunction). Modulation of the function of kappa-receptors may be a novel approach to control visceral pain in functional gut disorders. Results of formal testing of novel opioid modulators are keenly awaited.

### Associations between medication use and functional gastrointestinal disorders: a population-based study [^115fKeQc]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Functional GI syndromes are known to be very prevalent, but this may be linked to unrecognized medications use. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of PPI, antidepressant, and narcotic use in the general population, and to evaluate the association between each medication and functional GI syndromes adjusting for potential confounders.

Methods

In 2008 and 2009, newly revised versions of a validated bowel disease questionnaire were mailed to a community-based cohort (total mailed = 8006) of Olmsted County, MN residents; 3831 returned the questionnaire (response rate = 48.0%). Medication usage, specifically PPIs, narcotics, and antidepressants in the last year, was elicited via three separate questions on the questionnaire. The association between each medication and GI symptom complexes was assessed using multiple variable logistic regression models.

Key Results

A total of 3515 of the respondents (92%) had complete data (mean age: 61 ± 15; 54% female). The overall proportion reporting PPI use was 20% (95% CI: 19, 22), narcotic use 12% (95% CI: 11, 13), and antidepressant use 15% (95% CI: 14, 16). PPI use was significantly associated with IBS status (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1, 1.7) as well as with GERD (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 2.7, 4.4) and dyspepsia (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.5, 2.7). The association of PPI use with IBS was not explained by coexistent GERD or dyspepsia. Antidepressant use was significantly associated only with bloating (OR = 1.6, 1.1, 2.2).

Conclusions & Inferences

Some medications that may alter intestinal transit or bowel flora are commonly utilized by the general population, and PPI use appears to be linked to IBS.

### Naldemedine: a new option for OIBD [^112pgaTP]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioid-Induced Bowel Dysfunction (OIBD)

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) is a common complication in long-term opioid users and abusers. It is a burdensome condition, which significantly limits quality of lifeand it is associated with increasing health costs, due not only to pharmacological therapies but also to the management of possible complications. Given the persistent use of opioids for appropriate chronic pain management, OIBD is likely to be more commonly seen in clinical practice in the coming years and requires in-depth knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and appropriate management.

Symptoms of OIBD involve the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth to the anus, including xerostomia, gastro-oesophageal reflux, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, associated with bloating, abdominal distension and pain, hard dry stools, and incomplete bowel evacuation.

Among all the signs and symptoms of OIBD, opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common, affecting up to 60% of patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP)and over 80% of patients suffering from cancer pain.OIC is also one of the most common symptoms associated with opioid maintenance treatment, where high doses of buprenorphine and methadone are used as substitution treatment.

According to the Rome IV criteria for colorectal disorders, OIC has been classified among the "functional bowel disorders", based on the frequent symptomatic overlap and shared underlying mechanisms. Diagnostic criteria include new or worsening symptoms of "functional constipation" when initiating, changing, or increasing opioid therapy (Table 1). However, these criteria are useful only for identifying patients with more severe OIC; hence they may underdiagnose patients with fewer or milder symptoms. Unlike other opioid-induced adverse effects, OIC may persist throughout the whole duration of the opioid treatment, since tolerance generally does not develop to this opioid adverse effect, potentially leading to opioid dosage reduction or withdrawal.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^116Jaf7n]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct relaxants of intestinal smooth muscle (alverine citrate, mebeverine and peppermint oil) which may relieve pain in irritable bowel syndrome are commonly tried and have no serious adverse effects.

Persistent abdominal pain may be a major problem and its mechanism may include central nervous system sensitisation making it very difficult to treat. Features of neuropathic pain should be sought and managed with neuropathic agents. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia as part of the narcotic bowel syndrome can also develop and needs appropriate management (see section 5.2). If other analgesics prove ineffective, opioids and their derivatives may be tried though they themselves have pro-absorptive/antisecretory effects and cause slowing of intestinal transit. Some opioids, such as tapentadol, may have a better dysmotility side effect profile. Targinact (oxycodone and naloxone combined) is marketed as a way of giving analgesia without causing constipation. A small amount of naloxone crosses the blood–brain barrier to block the dependence action of oxycodone, although when first used it may precipitate some withdrawal symptoms from the previous opioid-like drug. Naloxegol is a PEGylated naloxone formulation not combined with opioid and therefore should not cross the blood–brain barrier, owing to the PEGylation, to minimise withdrawal side effects.

A literature search using the MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration databases for articles published between 1966 and March 2007 was performed. Additional data sources were obtained from manual searches of recent journal articles, book chapters, and monographs. An updated literature search showed no additional publications.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Abstracts and original preclinical and clinical research reports published in the English language were identified for review. Review articles, commentaries, and news reports of this compound were excluded. Literature related to opioids, opioid receptors, opioid antagonists, methylnaltrexone, opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, constipation, nausea, and vomiting was evaluated and selected based on consideration of the support shown for the proof of concept, mechanistic findings, and timeliness. Fifty-eight original articles from preclinical studies and clinical trials using methylnaltrexone were identified. Pharmacologic action, benefits, and ADEs of methylnaltrexone were reviewed, with a focus on its effects on bowel dysfunction after opioids. Emphases were placed on its receptor binding activities and therapeutically relevant sites of action (peripheral vs central), in which peripheral opioid receptors in the body contribute to physiological and drug-induced effects.

Data Synthesis

Morphine and related opioids are associated with a number of limiting ADEs, including opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone, a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, blocks peripheral effects of opioids while sparing central analgesic effects. It is currently under late-stage clinical investigation for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness. Reported results showed the drug to be generally well-tolerated. The rapid reversal of constipation is very encouraging. Hastening postoperative discharge may also be possible.

Conclusions

Methylnaltrexone has the potential to prevent or treat opioid-induced peripherally mediated ADEs on bowel dysfunction without interfering with central analgesia. The study of methylnaltrexone leads to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of opioid pharmacology.

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^1114FYCM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) — the µ opioids increase fluid absorption and inhibit colonic motility; OIC is generally defined as a change from baseline in bowel habits after initiating, changing, or increasing opioid therapy and is characterized by reduced frequency of bowel movements (< 3 bowel movements/week), worsening of straining, sense of incomplete evacuation, and harder stool consistency; these features have been adopted in Rome IV criteria; OIC can occur even at low dosages and at any time after initiation of opioid therapy, and nausea, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux are commonly associated; the bowel function index (BFI) is a clinician assessment tool that includes ease of defecation, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and personal judgment about constipation severity.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^113c5dV7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Refractory gastroparesis — management algorithm by predominant symptom and severity categorizes patients and lists options. Patients can be phenotyped into 2 categories on the basis of presenting symptoms: nausea/vomiting predominant, and abdominal pain/discomfort predominant symptoms, and this pathway assumes that anatomic/organic causes for symptoms have been ruled out with upper endoscopy and selective imaging, if clinically indicated. Consider mimics of gastroparesis and alternate mechanisms for symptom generation including functional dyspepsia, celiac artery compression syndrome, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, cyclic vomiting syndrome, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, narcotic bowel syndrome, rumination syndrome, and medications. Management options depend on the degree of patient-reported symptoms and/or the degree of gastric emptying delay (mild, moderate, and severe) on a 4-hour gastric emptying scan. For nausea and/or vomiting: mild includes dietary adjustments, symptomatic OTC therapy, anti-emetic agents, treat as functional dyspepsia, and prevent complications; moderate includes anti-emetic and prokinetic agents, augmentation therapy, and CBT/psychotherapy; severe includes liquid diet, enteral feeding (J tube), gastric electrical stimulation, and G-POEM. For abdominal pain and/or discomfort: mild includes dietary adjustments, treat as functional dyspepsia, and avoid opiate medications; moderate includes neuromodulator therapy and augmentation therapy; severe includes CBT/psychotherapy and address comorbid affective disorders. Abbreviations are defined on-page: OTC is over the counter, CBT is cognitive and behavioral therapy, and G-POEM is gastric per oral endoscopic myotomy, and in particular cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome need to be differentiated from nausea/vomiting predominant gastroparesis.

How to manage opioid therapy?

Alongside naloxegol therapy, a patient with OIBD should have already undergone opioid switching. The selection of the opioid is based on the clinician's judgement and not on therapeutic protocols, which have never been definitely established. Early or preventive opioid switching is probably unnecessary and should only be considered for refractory or resistant patients.

The Board highlight the feasibility of using naloxegol in case of opioid switching to oxycodone plus naloxone (Targin®, Mundipharma Pharmaceuticals), or in case the patient experiences OIBD while already under this opioid. The association of naloxegol with oxycodone plus naloxone is generally not contraindicated. An increase of the dose of naloxegol to 50 mg is not supported. Alternatively, in the absence of data, the Board suggest discontinuing naloxegol whenever oxycodone plus naloxone is prescribed in the opioid switch. It must be considered that the effects of equivalent doses of oxycodone and oxycodone plus naloxone do not always overlap, and cases of overdose or insufficient analgesia resulting from switches from one formulation to the other have been reported.

In summary:
in case of oxycodone plus naloxone, naloxegol should be discontinued or not prescribed;
in case of a switch from oxycodone plus naloxone to only oxycodone, naloxegol should be associated if OIBD occurs.

### Long-term use of naldemedine in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^1149dxYy]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Long-term opioid therapy is a common component of chronic noncancer pain management. Use of opioid analgesics has been associated with the serious risks of abuse, addiction, and overdose, as well as the less serious but debilitating side effect of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Approximately 40% to 60% of patients receiving opioids for chronic noncancer pain are affected by OIC, and its symptoms do not attenuate with duration of opioid therapy. One-third of patients with OIC report skipping, reducing, or stopping use of opioids — despite experiencing an increase in pain — in an effort to have a bowel movement. Opioid-induced constipation may also lead to complications such as obstipation, colonic distention, ileus, and bowel perforation. Unsurprisingly, the quality of life of patients with OIC is significantly poorer than those unaffected by it.

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^1133kRAm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we compared the constituent ratio of different severity degrees between the two groups and within each group according to the NRS and VRS methods. Local analgesic lidocaine and opioid analgesic sufentanil showed negative efficacy in a short-term observation.

As patients with CAPS usually have continuous abdominal pain with wide differential, and there is a paucity of definitive tests, colonoscopy is necessary to confirm that no alternative pathology is missed. Therefore, colonoscopy under general anesthesia is a better option for CAPS patients who need repeated or regular colonoscopy examinations, as they can receive a comparably comfortable experience and an increased possibility of careful examination. Sufentanil is commonly used and combined with propofol in colonoscopy under general anesthesia to suppress corresponding central receptors to achieve painlessness, and it is also a kind of μ-opioid receptors blocker. In the management of CAPS, narcotic analgesics are not recommended because of the likelihood of addiction and the possibility of narcotic bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. In our study, no adverse events occurred in any patient. There were no significant differences in the changes in constituent ratio according to the NRS and VRS methods before and after endoscopy, which meant that the patients' symptoms did not worsen. This indicated that in the short-term observation, the μ-opioid receptor sufentanil did not worsen CAPS after colonoscopy under general anesthesia in a short-term observation.

Cancer versus non-cancer chronic pain

The issue of OIBD cannot be solely associated with the underlying disease, since opioids are used by a wide variety of patients, not only for cancer pain treatment. It is understandable that its psychophysical impact is greater in cancer patients, especially in those receiving palliative care, but the condition of patients under chronic opioid therapy for musculoskeletal pain or neuralgias should not be ignored.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^116Rvvqh]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Subjective Reports of OIC Are Based on Validated Questionnaires, Whereas There Is No Consensus About Assessment of OIBD

Comment: In many studies, symptom assessments were based on self-made questionnaires. Questionnaires developed and validated to assess "normal" constipation, such as the Bristol Stool Form Scale, Patient Assessment of Constipation Scale, and the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott symptom scoring system, have also been used, although the sensitivity of these questionnaires when used by opioid users has not been assessed. Alongside the introduction of slow-release oxycodone/naloxone combinations designed to reduce OIC, a new and specific questionnaire was developed. This is termed the Bowel Function Index (BFI) and is a clinician-administered questionnaire to evaluate and assess OIC. The BFI has been validated against the Patient Assessment of Constipation Scale, bowel movements, and laxative use, with excellent correlation being found.

For OIBD, there is no valid assessment tool specifically designed to measure the burden of these symptoms. Instruments such as the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale are well validated for general GI symptoms and are available in many languages. However, sensitivity to opioid-induced adverse events will require further investigation. The questionnaire will also require supplementary questions to increase its specificity for OIBD. Recently the use of several outcome variables based on objective measures (e.g. bowel movements), patient-reported assessment with questionnaires, and a global measure of burden such as life quality were suggested. Future studies are, however, needed to explore the reliability and validity of these tools.

### Mu-opioid antagonists for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction [^1161Y5hU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD) is characterized by constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating, and increased gastric reflux. OBD occurs both acutely and chronically, in multiple disease states, resulting in increased morbidity and reduced quality of life.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of traditional and peripherally active opioid antagonists versus conventional interventions for OBD.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE in January 2007. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of mu-opioid antagonists for OBD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent review authors and included demographic variables, diagnoses, interventions, efficacy, and adverse events.

Main Results

Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria and provided data on 2871 opioid antagonist-treated patients. The opioid antagonists investigated were alvimopan (nine studies), methylnaltrexone (six), naloxone (seven), and nalbuphine (one). Meta-analysis demonstrated that methylnaltrexone and alvimopan were better than placebo in reversing opioid-induced increased gastrointestinal transit time and constipation, and that alvimopan appears to be safe and efficacious in treating postoperative ileus. The incidence of adverse events with opioid antagonists was similar to placebo and generally reported as mild-to-moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Insufficient evidence exists for the safety or efficacy of naloxone or nalbuphine in the treatment of OBD. Long-term efficacy and safety of any of the opioid antagonists is unknown, as is the incidence or nature of rare adverse events. Alvimopan and methylnaltrexone both show promise in treating OBD, but further data will be required to fully assess their place in therapy.

### Opioid use disorder is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with gastroparesis [^114GZ43x]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroparesis is a complex neuromuscular disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying. The condition can cause a wide variety of symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and chronic abdominal pain. Chronic abdominal pain is often challenging to manage and hence opioid use is becoming common among patients with diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis. Previous studies have reported that 30–43% of gastroparesis patients are on chronic opioids. Opioids provide immediate pain relief but can lead to other gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and worsening of gastric emptying. This in turn leads to worsening of gastroparesis thereby turning it into a vicious cycle. However, these adverse effects are often overlooked when opioids are prescribed to these patients. Many patients with chronic opioid use develop chronic abdominal pain and narcotic bowel syndrome. In view of the increasing use of opioids and resulting opioid-induced gastroparesis, several studies are currently investigating alternative therapeutic options.

The United States is currently in the midst of an opioid crisis and the opioid epidemic has been declared a public health emergency. The continuing rise in the prevalence of OUD has led to a concurrent increase in opioid-related complications, associated deaths and the burden on healthcare resources. According to a report from the US Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016 about 11.5 million Americans were misusing prescription opioids, while 2.1 million had OUD and more than 42,000 died from an opioid overdose. Up to one third of the patients in whom opioids were prescribed reported misusing them and approx. 12% transition to developing OUD. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated the total economic burden of prescription opioid misuse in the United States to be 78.5 billion dollars a year. In April 2018, to address this national crisis, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched an initiative with the National Institute of Health called "Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL)", to improve the treatment of opioid misuse and for exploration of alternative therapies in chronic pain management.

Even though the use of opioids in gastroparesis is increasing, there continues to be a paucity of literature regarding the impact of OUD on outcomes in patients with gastroparesis. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the impact of OUD on the outcomes of patients hospitalized with gastroparesis and to delineate the trends associated with OUD and gastroparesis using a nationally representative sample.

2.2. Patients

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with chronic noncancer pain for ≥ 3 months requiring treatment with an opioid analgesic for ≥ 4 days per week for ≥ 8 weeks before the screening visit. Participants self-administered a stable dose of a full opioid agonist (minimum total daily dose equianalgesic to oral morphine 30 mg) with the expectation that they would continue this regimen for the study duration. In addition, bowel symptom criteria based on the Rome III definition for CIC required that patients have < 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week for ≥ 4 weeks before screening, with > 25% of those BMs accompanied by ≥ 1 other constipation symptom (straining, lumpy or hard stools, and/or sensation of incomplete evacuation).

Key exclusion criteria included: use of opioids for abdominal pain or for a condition that had GI manifestations that could confound the interpretation of the study results; loose or watery stools (Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS] score of 6 or 7) in the absence of any laxative, suppository, or enema for > 25% of BMs during the 3 months before the study; and a history or diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy or other overlapping GI conditions (IBS, chronic constipation before initiation of opioid treatment, diverticulitis, narcotic bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, active peptic ulcer disease, bowel obstruction, pseudo-obstruction, colonic inertia, megacolon, megarectum, descending perineum syndrome, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, fecal impaction that required hospitalization, cathartic colon, laxative or enema abuse, or pelvic floor dysfunction). All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the trial.

Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence. The technical review identified 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs); only 3 examined an outcome of ≥ 3 rescue-free bowel movements per week. The pooled effect estimate for rescue-free bowel movement outcome was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.21–1.68), corresponding to a 43% improvement or an absolute improvement of 16 more patients per 100. Methylnaltrexone was also associated with improvement in "laxation response", defined generally as a bowel movement within 4 hours of taking the medication (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.18–4.58). There was no statistically significant increase in adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.

### Randomized clinical trial: the effects of pregabalin for centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome [^114TX6p7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), formerly known as functional abdominal pain syndrome, is characterized by continuous, nearly continuous, or frequently recurrent abdominal pain that is often severe and only rarely related to gut function. It has a reported population prevalence of between 0.5% and 1.7%, with a female preponderance. The germane hypothesis for the genesis and maintenance of chronic abdominal pain is the concept of visceral hypersensitivity. Unlike other painful functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), CAPS is distinguished by poor relationship of pain with food intake or defecation, and it seems cognitive and emotional features play a larger role in the pain experienced. Prospectively followed up, patients with higher anxiety scores more frequently developed FGID. Antispasmodics and antidepressants are utilized for CAPS, but these therapies are not effective for all patients. Patients are often prescribed opiates as they are desperate for relief, and clinicians struggle to control their symptoms. Unfortunately, opiates are considered to be contraindicated due to a risk of opiate-related bowel disruption, painful constipation, or even narcotic bowel syndrome.

Pregabalin, an alkylated analog of γ-aminobutyric acid, binding to the α2δ type 1 protein of the P/Q voltage-dependent calcium channel and reducing the central release of excitatory molecules, acts like an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Pregabalin has been worldwidely licensed for a variety of indications, including the treatment of pain syndromes such as neuralgia, fibromyalgia; as adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures; and for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It has been evaluated to alleviate some chronic abdominal pain syndrome, such as IBS or chronic pancreatitis, but has not been studied for CAPS. Based on the reported experiences, we hypothesized that pregabalin may play an important role in the therapy of CAPS and undertook a randomized trial to evaluate its efficacy in pain and emotion modulation. We selected an antispasmodic, pinaverium bromide as the control drug.

### Laxatives Do not improve symptoms of opioid-induced constipation: results of a patient survey [^115KT8ag]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioids have been important in pain management for a number of years. According to the World Health Organization's three-step analgesic ladder, weak opioids (e.g. codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol) should be used for moderate pain (at Step 2) and strong opioids (e.g. oxycodone, morphine) for severe pain (at Step 3). Despite being originally developed for cancer pain, this stepwise approach has been extended for use in chronic noncancer pain.

Opioids are known to cause a number of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that are collectively termed opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD). OIBD is characterized by hard, dry stools, straining, incomplete evacuation, bloating, abdominal distension, and increased gastric reflux. The most common symptom of OIBD is opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Opioids cause constipation by binding to µ-opioid receptors in the GI tract, which reduces GI secretions and peristaltic activity and increases fluid reabsorption. The result is hard, dry stools that pass slowly through the gut. OIC is dose-dependent, and, unlike other GI symptoms, patients rarely develop tolerance to the constipating effects of opioids, so OIC does not resolve over time.

### Update on the role of naldemedine in opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain [^116EwcGP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Subjects with any renal impairment or mild or moderate hepatic impairment had pharmacokinetics and adverse events consistent with those in healthy volunteers, and therefore, dose adjustment is unnecessary in such patients.

Phase II trials. Webster et al. conducted a phase IIa ascending dose trial in 72 patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of naldemedine in patients with CNCP and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (≤ 5 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per 2-week period). Nine patients were randomized to each naldemedine dose (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg) and 18 to placebo. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported more frequently with naldemedine (81.5%) compared to placebo (50.0%). Abdominal pain was the most frequently reported adverse event, and prevalence increased with increased dose (placebo, 16.7%; any naldemedine dose, 46.3%: 0.01 mg, 22.2%; 0.03 mg, 11.1%; 0.3 mg, 66.7%; and 3.0 mg, 100.0%). Severe TEAEs included one drug withdrawal syndrome in a patient on 1.0 mg of naldemedine and six patients on 3.0 mg of naldemedine reporting abdominal pain, severe diarrhea in three, nausea/vomiting in two, and chills in one. Significant increase in number of SBMs from baseline to 24 h was seen with the naldemedine 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg doses compared to placebo. The study showed that a single dose of naldemedine was well tolerated and the 0.3 mg dose had the best benefit-risk profile.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^114huBcf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Constipation, one of the adverse effects of opioid therapy with a major impact on quality of life, is still an unmet need for cancer patients, particularly those with an advanced and progressive disease, and for non-cancer patients chronically treated with opioids. The awareness of this condition is poor among healthcare providers, despite the recent publication of guidelines and consensus conferences. An early multidisciplinary approach of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD), based on available therapies of proven effectiveness, could support clinicians in managing this condition, thus increasing patients' adherence to pain therapy. Several Italian experts involved in the management of patients suffering from pain (anaesthesia pain therapy, oncology, haematology, palliative care, gastroenterology) joined in a Board in order to draw up an expert opinion on OIBD. The most frequent and still unsolved issues in this field were examined, including a more comprehensive definition of OIBD, the benefits of early intervention to prevent its occurrence and the most appropriate use of peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). The use of the recently introduced PAMORA naloxegol was analysed, in light of the current literature. The Board proposed a solution for each open issue in the form of recommendations, integrated with the contribution of representatives from different disciplines and often accompanied by procedural algorithms immediately usable and applicable in daily clinical practice. Safety and quality of life of the patient suffering from pain and from the adverse effects of pain therapies have been the mainstays of this expert opinion, in cooperation with general practitioners and caregivers.

### Efficacy and safety of linaclotide for opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes from a phase 2 randomized study [^1162eea5]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Opioids are important for the management of various cancer- and non–cancer-related acute and chronic pain conditions. In 2017, over 190 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed by retail pharmacies, with a prescribing rate of 58.5 per 100 people. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common side effect associated with chronic opioid use, with a prevalence rate of 41% to 81% in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes.

Although opioids reduce pain by binding to and activating μ-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, they also activate μ-opioid receptors in neurons in the peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract epithelium, leading to opioid-related GI side effects including nausea, constipation, and bowel dysfunction. Through binding to μ-opioid receptors, opioids inhibit release of various neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, which prevents water and electrolyte movement into the GI tract, resulting in slower intestinal transit. Opioid-induced constipation symptoms include sensation of incomplete evacuation, lumpy/hard stools, excessive straining, and decreased defecation frequency. Importantly, although tolerance develops for many non-GI opioid-related side effects, it does not develop for OIC, resulting in persistent bothersome symptoms.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113cycHe]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid guideline — gastrointestinal effects describe that opioids are associated with gastrointestinal discomfort, malfunction, and intolerance, exemplified by opioid-induced constipation; δ-, κ-, and μ-opioid receptors are present throughout the central and enteric nervous system; constipation is the most reported opioid-induced side effect and affects 50–80% of patients, increased fiber intake and physical activity are encouraged while laxatives are often co-administered as first-line therapy; an alternative approach is Tapentadol, which has a dual mode of action as an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor and as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, with similar analgesic effects as oxycodone in equipotent doses and potential for fewer gastrointestinal side effects; growing evidence shows opioids impact gut microbiota and "opioid-induced dysbiosis" may provide opioid-sparing strategies.
