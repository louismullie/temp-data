## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) across indications, including which type, energy, and protocol to choose, and how to reconcile conflicting evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and indications where ESWT is most evidence-based. Then, I should verify the comparative effectiveness of focused versus radial ESWT and the role of energy dosing. Next, I will review condition-specific outcomes and guideline positions. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and practical implementation. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic recommendation and highlight uncertainties that could change practice as new data emerge.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications with the strongest evidence. ESWT has been most consistently studied and recommended for plantar fasciitis, calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy, and certain lower-limb tendinopathies, while evidence remains mixed or negative for lateral epicondylitis and noncalcific rotator cuff disease, and investigational for erectile dysfunction and chronic pelvic pain syndromes, so I should anchor recommendations to these strata of evidence quality [^116TpLhr] [^116FEoHW] [^112tGneD] [^113oQtCq] [^112iRm6y] [^1179QvVo].

> Wait, let me verify the focused versus radial question because this is often misunderstood. Focused ESWT delivers higher energy density to a precise focal zone and is generally preferred for deep targets like calcific deposits and plantar fascia origin, whereas radial ESWT disperses energy more superficially and may be better tolerated but can be less potent for deep pathology; importantly, high-quality guidelines for calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy recommend high-energy focused ESWT over low-energy, and focused ESWT has shown clinically relevant benefit in FDA-level trials for plantar fasciitis, while radial ESWT has also shown benefit in some trials but with more variable protocols and blinding concerns [^116FEoHW] [^114EqeUC] [^113q1Jvy] [^116j2ZNw].

> I need to check the energy dosing issue carefully. For calcific tendinopathy, high-energy focused ESWT (typically > 0.20 mJ/mm²) yields superior pain and function outcomes and higher rates of deposit resorption compared with low-energy, and this is reflected in multiple RCTs and meta-analyses as well as contemporary guidelines; conversely, for plantar fasciitis, both moderate- and high-energy protocols have shown benefit, but the balance of evidence and guideline synthesis support focused, higher-energy approaches when using ESWT after failed conservative care, with the caveat that local anesthesia may blunt efficacy and should be avoided when possible [^116jg9b3] [^116FEoHW] [^116TpLhr] [^1165XhHP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about lateral epicondylitis. Multiple high-quality RCTs and systematic reviews consistently show no clinically meaningful benefit of ESWT over sham for pain or function, and some analyses suggest any observed effects are small and likely attributable to placebo or natural history; therefore, ESWT should not be considered a first-line or routine therapy for lateral epicondylitis, and clinicians should prioritize eccentric loading and other established conservative measures [^113oQtCq] [^1115eYqW] [^112kYFEe].

> Next, I should review lower-limb tendinopathies. Evidence suggests ESWT can be effective for insertional Achilles tendinopathy and patellar tendinopathy, with some studies indicating superiority to wait-and-see or even comparable outcomes to surgery in selected cases; however, a recent RCT in insertional Achilles disease found no added benefit of radial ESWT over sham when combined with exercise, reminding me that exercise-first strategies remain foundational and that ESWT is best positioned as an adjunct after 3–6 months of progressive loading fails [^112tGneD] [^113BsuFG] [^111eCCDs].

> I will now examine erectile dysfunction, where the signal is promising but not definitive. Meta-analyses show improvements in IIEF and EHS with low-intensity ESWT, particularly in mild-to-moderate vasculogenic ED, but major guidelines still label this as investigational or offer it only in well-informed patients or research settings due to heterogeneity, short follow-up, and lack of standardized protocols; thus, I should frame LI-ESWT as a conditional option after shared decision-making and failure of first-line therapies [^111UWHwG] [^1179QvVo] [^112roE28].

> Let me consider chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men. Emerging RCTs and a recent AUA guideline meta-analysis suggest clinically meaningful reductions in NIH-CPSI total scores with low-intensity ESWT, leading to a moderate recommendation to discuss ESWT as a treatment option; typical protocols use 2000–5000 shocks per session, often 3000, delivered weekly for about 4 weeks, with low adverse event rates in trials [^1146F8oG] [^113tuL7W].

> I should double-check safety and contraindications before recommending any protocol. ESWT is generally safe with transient pain, petechiae, or mild swelling as common adverse effects; however, malignancy in the treatment field, bleeding disorders, pregnancy, and certain neurologic conditions are contraindications, and local anesthesia may reduce efficacy in some tendinopathies, so I need to screen carefully and tailor energy and coupling to tolerance while avoiding anesthesia when possible [^114rPiHg] [^1165XhHP].

> Now, I need to ensure the practical protocol aligns with evidence. For calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy, I would use high-energy focused ESWT, typically 0.20–0.28 mJ/mm², 2000–3000 shocks per session, 1–2 sessions per week for 3–4 weeks, without local anesthesia, and counsel on expected soreness and activity modification; for plantar fasciitis after 3–6 months of conservative care, focused ESWT at similar energy densities with 2000–3000 shocks and 1–3 sessions is reasonable; for lower-limb tendinopathy, radial ESWT can be considered as an adjunct after failed loading, recognizing the mixed evidence and the need to individualize based on insertional versus midportion disease and symptom chronicity [^116FEoHW] [^116TpLhr] [^112tGneD].

> But wait, what if the patient has noncalcific rotator cuff tendinopathy or lateral epicondylitis. I should confirm that routine ESWT is not recommended in these scenarios; contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews indicate no consistent benefit over placebo for noncalcific rotator cuff disease and lateral epicondylitis, so ESWT should not be first-line there, and I should redirect to exercise-based rehabilitation and other evidence-supported modalities [^112iRm6y] [^115jdVCK] [^113oQtCq].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle so I don't overgeneralize. The best ESWT is indication-specific, energy-appropriate, and protocol-standardized within the constraints of current evidence: focused, higher-energy ESWT for calcific tendinopathy and selected plantar fasciitis cases after conservative failure, cautious, adjunctive use in certain lower-limb tendinopathies, and investigational or shared decision-making use in vasculogenic ED and chronic pelvic pain, all while avoiding treatment in the presence of local malignancy or other contraindications and minimizing anesthesia that could blunt efficacy [^116FEoHW] [^116TpLhr] [^1179QvVo] [^115PX5H6] [^116ZDMQ8].

> Finally, I should confirm that my bottom line is actionable and honest about uncertainty. There is no single "best" ESWT for all conditions; the best approach is to match device type, energy, and protocol to the specific diagnosis and disease biology, prioritize exercise-first strategies for tendinopathies, and counsel patients about expected benefits, timelines, and potential adverse effects, with the understanding that ongoing research may refine indications and parameters and could change current recommendations [^111pq7ir] [^114rPiHg].

---

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is best for **chronic plantar fasciitis** [^116TpLhr] and **calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy** [^116FEoHW], with moderate-to-high quality evidence supporting clinically meaningful pain and function improvements [^114EqeUC] [^116jg9b3]. For plantar fasciitis, **focused ESWT without anesthesia** is preferred [^114EqeUC]; for calcific tendinopathy, **high-energy focused ESWT** is superior to low-energy [^116jg9b3]. ESWT is less effective or unsupported for lateral epicondylitis [^113oQtCq] [^1115eYqW], non-calcific rotator cuff disease [^112iRm6y], and knee osteoarthritis [^notfound], and should not be first-line for these conditions. Low-intensity ESWT is investigational for erectile dysfunction [^1179QvVo] and chronic pelvic pain [^111gUAsz], with emerging but limited evidence [^111UWHwG] [^1146F8oG]. Overall, ESWT is safe, noninvasive, and most appropriate after conservative care fails, with patient selection and protocol tailoring key to outcomes [^116TpLhr] [^114rPiHg].

## Indications with strong evidence

### Plantar fasciitis

- **Evidence**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show focused ESWT reduces pain and improves function in chronic plantar fasciitis [^116TpLhr] [^114EqeUC].
- **Protocol**: Focused ESWT without anesthesia, typically 2000–3000 shocks at 0.25–0.28 mJ/mm², 1–3 sessions [^114EqeUC] [^113q1Jvy].
- **Comparison**: ESWT is superior to placebo and comparable to corticosteroid injections, with fewer recurrences [^116tVDhZ].

---

### Calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy

- **Evidence**: High-energy focused ESWT improves pain, function, and calcification resorption [^116jg9b3] [^116FEoHW].
- **Protocol**: High-energy focused ESWT (> 0.20 mJ/mm²), 2000–3000 shocks, 1–2 sessions [^116FEoHW].
- **Comparison**: Superior to low-energy ESWT and comparable to ultrasound-guided needling in some studies [^116jg9b3] [^115LMVig].

---

## Indications with moderate or conflicting evidence

### Lower limb tendinopathies

For lower limb tendinopathies, **Achilles tendinopathy** shows moderate evidence of benefit, particularly for insertional disease [^113BsuFG] [^1165XhHP], whereas **patellar tendinopathy** has limited evidence and mixed results [^113BsuFG] [^113shGqX]. Typical protocols use radial or focused ESWT at 2000–3000 shocks and 0.12–0.25 mJ/mm², with 3–5 sessions.

---

### Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)

Evidence is mixed, with **some studies showing no benefit** over placebo or other interventions [^113oQtCq] [^1115eYqW]. When used, protocols generally employ radial ESWT at 2000 shocks, 0.12–0.18 mJ/mm², in 3–5 sessions.

---

## Indications with limited or emerging evidence

### Erectile dysfunction (ED)

Evidence is emerging but remains **investigational** [^1179QvVo]; some guidelines advise considering low-intensity ESWT in selected patients [^112roE28]. Typical protocols use low-intensity ESWT at 1500–3000 shocks, 0.09–0.25 mJ/mm², in 6–12 sessions.

---

### Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)

Evidence is limited but **promising**, with moderate recommendations in some guidelines [^111gUAsz] [^1146F8oG]. Protocols commonly use low-intensity ESWT at 2000–5000 shocks, 0.25–0.29 mJ/mm², in 4–6 weekly sessions.

---

## Conditions with insufficient or negative evidence

- **Non-calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy**: Evidence does not support routine use [^112iRm6y] [^115jdVCK].
- **Knee osteoarthritis**: Evidence is limited and inconsistent [^111SiQiY] [^113fiXUK].
- **Burn scars and cellulite**: Evidence is weak and heterogeneous [^116qwy7x] [^1145LwpU].

---

## Safety and contraindications

ESWT is **generally safe**, with transient pain, swelling, and petechiae as common adverse effects. Absolute contraindications include malignancy in the treatment area, pregnancy, and blood clotting disorders; relative contraindications include open growth plates and local infections [^116ZDMQ8].

| Chronic pelvic pain syndrome | Emerging | Low-intensity ESWT, 2000–5000 shocks, 0.25–0.29 mJ/mm², 4–6 sessions | Conditionally recommended |

---

ESWT is **most effective for chronic plantar fasciitis and calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy**, with focused, higher-energy protocols yielding the best outcomes. It is less effective or unsupported for lateral epicondylitis, non-calcific rotator cuff disease, and knee osteoarthritis, and should be reserved for select cases after conservative care fails. Low-intensity ESWT shows promise for ED and CP/CPPS but remains investigational.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the healing and management of venous leg ulcers [^114Feab5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Leg ulcers are chronic wounds of the lower leg, caused by poor blood flow, that can take a long time to heal. The pooling of blood in the veins can damage the skin and surrounding tissues, causing an ulcer to form. Venous leg ulcers are associated with impaired quality of life, reduced mobility, pain, stress and loss of dignity. The standard treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression bandages or stockings. Shock wave therapy may aid the healing of these wounds through the promotion of angiogenesis (the formation and development of blood vessels) and reduction of inflammation, though this process is poorly understood at present.

Objectives

To assess the effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on the healing and management of venous leg ulceration.

Search Methods

In April 2018 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. We applied no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the healing and management of venous leg ulceration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection. We planned that two review authors would also assess the risk of bias of included studies, extract study data and rate the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We found no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCTs assessing the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the healing and management of venous leg ulceration. The lack of high-quality evidence in this area highlights a gap in research and may serve to justify the need for further research and evidence to provide guidance concerning the use of this treatment option for this condition. Future trials should be of clear design and include concomitant use of the current best practice treatment, multilayer compression therapy. Recruitment should aspire to best represent patients seen in clinical practice and patient-related outcome measures should be included in study design.

### Is extracorporeal shock wave therapy clinical efficacy for relief of chronic, recalcitrant plantar fasciitis? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo or active-treatment controlled trials [^111eVb8B]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and provide clinicians with an evidence base for their clinical decision making.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews.

Study Selection

All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ESWT for chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis were searched. Searching identified 108 potentially relevant articles; of these, 7 studies with 550 participants met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Number of patients, population, body mass index, duration of symptoms, adverse effects, blinding method, and details of shockwave therapy were extracted.

Data Synthesis

For intervention success rate, ESWT of low intensity was more effective than control treatment of low intensity. For pain relief, the pooled data showed a significant difference between the ESWT and control groups. For function, only low-intensity ESWT was significantly superior over the control treatment.

Conclusions

The efficacy of low-intensity ESWT is worthy of recognition. The short-term pain relief and functional outcomes of this treatment are satisfactory. However, owing to the lack of a long-term follow-up, its long-term efficacy remains unknown.

### Does the type of extracorporeal shock therapy influence treatment effectiveness in lateral epicondylitis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oQtCq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been used in various musculoskeletal disorders, including lateral epicondylitis. However, in 2005, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that ESWT provides minimal or no benefit in terms of pain and function in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Since the review, several randomized controlled trials including different types of ESWT such as radial type for lateral epicondylitis have been published. Investigations of the effect modifiers such as symptom and follow-up duration on the effects of ESWT on lateral epicondylitis have not been performed.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does ESWT reduce pain and improve grip strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis? (2) Which type of ESWT, radial or focused, is more effective? (3) Is the duration of symptoms associated with the efficacy of ESWT for lateral epicondylitis? (4) Do improvements in pain scores remain in patients with longer follow-up?

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched up to July 2019 for articles published in English or Korean. Studies were included if patient allocation was randomized, the sample was composed of patients with lateral epicondylitis, interventions were ESWT (focused or radial), comparison group only received sham stimulation or no additional treatment, and the study outcome was pain intensity or grip strength. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twelve studies including 1104 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The mean difference for pain reduction and improvement in grip strength was calculated.

Results

The meta-analysis showed no clinically important difference in the VAS score (2.48 ± 7.55 versus 3.17 ± 9.78, mean difference -0.68 [95% confidence interval -1.17 to -0.19]; p = 0.006) and grip strength (38.02 ± 70.56 versus 34.85 ± 108.26, mean difference 3.33 [95% CI 0.93 to 5.73]; p = 0.007) after ESWT relative to the comparison group's score. Even though radial ESWT showed more improvement than focused, the mean difference for VAS did not exceed the minimal clinically important differences threshold. There were no clinically important effects on the VAS scores of patients with lateral epicondylitis (2.78 ± 5.57 versus 3.92 ± 6.29, mean difference -1.13 [95% CI -1.84 to -0.42]; p = 0.002) and focused ESWT did not improve pain in patients with lateral epicondylitis. In the subgroup analysis, ESWT was effective in patients with a symptom duration of more than 6 months (2.28 ± 8.48 versus 3.31 ± 11.81, mean difference -0.95 [95% CI -1.75 to -0.15]; p = 0.02) but not for those with shorter symptom duration. The effects did not last beyond 24 weeks (2.52 ± 9.19 versus 3.34 ± 5.93, mean difference -0.82 [95% CI -2.57 to 0.93]; p = 0.36).

Conclusions

ESWT did not show clinically important improvement in pain reduction and grip strength. Radial ESWT, symptom duration of longer than 6 months, and short follow-up duration (less than 24 weeks) were related to better effects. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate protocol and elucidate the effects according to the intervention type and specific disease condition.

### Efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for lower-limb tendinopathy: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112tGneD]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy, including radial shock wave and focused shock wave types, is widely used for managing tendinopathies. The difference in efficacy between the 2 shock wave characteristics with different dosage levels remains controversial, and the purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine it for patients with lower-limb tendinopathy.

Design

A comprehensive search of online databases and search engines was performed. This study included randomized controlled trials reporting the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in treating lower-limb tendinopathy. The included randomized controlled trials were subjected to a meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment.

Results

In total, 29 randomized controlled trials were included, all of which had a good methodological quality, with a PEDro score of ≥ 6/10. General extracorporeal shock wave therapy showed significant effects at the immediate follow-up [pain score: standardized mean difference = -1.41, 95% confidence interval = -2.01 to -0.82, P < 0.00001; function: standardized mean difference = 2.59, 95% confidence interval = 1.54 to 3.64, P < 0.00001] as well as at 3, 6, and ≥ 12 months. In sequence, high-dosage focused shock wave, high-dosage radial shock wave, and low-dosage radial shock wave had superior pooled effects on overall clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy exerted a positive overall effect on pain and function for lower-limb tendinopathy. Shock wave types and dosage levels may have different contributions to treatment efficacy.

### Update on shock wave lithotripsy technology [^114H29te]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Since the first patient was successfully treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in 1980, its rapid acceptance and widespread use have championed this form of stone therapy as the treatment of choice for the majority of renal and ureteral calculi. Worldwide clinical series have documented the efficacy and safety of shock wave lithotripsy.

Recent Findings

Shock wave lithotripters have undergone modifications of the source for generation of shock waves, focusing, and even localization techniques since the introduction of the original Dornier HM3 lithotripter. Yet the basic concepts remain the same: to produce an acoustic wave that can be focused at a specific location for stone fragmentation. Safety and efficacy of the different generations of lithotripters is well documented. Indications and utilization of shock wave lithotripsy have expanded, with clinical efficacy approaching or exceeding that of other modalities of minimally invasive surgery. Complications, however, can arise as a result of shock wave therapy.

Summary

This review provides an update of the latest shock wave technology, reviewing the clinical indications and efficacy of treatment and discussing the potential adverse events associated with shock wave lithotripsy.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for limb dysfunction after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112V8va7]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recently, extracorporeal shock wave therapy has emerged as a novel and noninvasive approach for alleviating spasticity and pain, improving motor dysfunction after stroke. To determine the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy and the effects of shock wave parameters in relieving spasticity, pain, and motor dysfunction after stroke.

Design

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EBSCOhost, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials on extracorporeal shock wave therapy for limb dysfunction after stroke from inception until February 1, 2023. Two researchers independently searched and screened articles identified from each database, used RevMan v.5.4 analyzing data.

Results

This review included 9 articles and 327 patients. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy improved the spasticity, pain, and motor function after stroke. They also improved the passive range of motion in the lower limbs. The treatment effect was highest when the shock wave frequency was < 8 Hz and pressure was < 2 bar. However, the effect was not significantly affected by treatment duration. Compared to focused extracorporeal shock waves, released extracorporeal shock waves were associated with better outcomes.

Conclusions

The treatment outcomes are optimal when a shock wave frequency < 8 Hz, pressure < 2 bar, and released extracorporeal shock waves are used.

### High-energy versus low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy for calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder: which is superior? A meta-analysis [^116jg9b3]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are several treatment options for calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder. The next step treatment after conservative treatment fails is still a matter of dispute. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been shown to be a good alternative to surgery, but the best treatment intensity remains unknown. High-energy ESWT is much more painful, more expensive, and usually is done in an inpatient setting, whereas low-energy ESWT can be performed in an outpatient setting by a physical therapist.

Questions/Purposes

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials was performed to answer two clear research questions: (1) Is there a greater increase in the Constant-Murley score in patients treated with high-energy ESWT compared with those treated with low-energy ESWT by 3 months and by 6 months? (2) Is there a greater chance of complete resorption of the calcifications in patients treated with high-energy ESWT compared with those treated with low-energy ESWT by 3 months and by 6 months?

Methods

Five relevant electronic online databases, Medline (through PubMed), EMBASE (through OVID), Cinahl (through EBSCO), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were systematically searched. We also crosschecked the reference lists of articles and reviews for possible relevant studies. Eligible for inclusion were all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared high-energy ESWT (> 0.28 mJ/mm²) with low-energy ESWT (< 0.08 mJ/mm²). One author examined titles and abstracts of each identified study to assess study eligibility. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and study quality. The primary outcome measure, the Constant-Murley score, was assessed by comparing mean functional outcome scores between the groups. Secondary outcomes were assessed using odds ratios, when appropriate data were pooled. Based on this process, five RCTs (359 participants) were included.

Results

All five RCTs showed greater improvement in functional outcome (Constant-Murley score) in patients treated with high-energy ESWT compared with patients treated with low-energy ESWT at 3 and 6 months. The 3-month mean difference was 9.88 (95% CI, 9.04–10.72, p < 0.001; 6-month data could not be pooled). Furthermore, high-energy ESWT more often resulted in complete resorption of the deposits at 3 months. The corresponding odds ratio was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.35–8.58) and p = 0.009 (6-month data could not be pooled).

Conclusion

When shock wave therapy is chosen, high-energy shock wave therapy is more likely to result in improved Constant-Murley score and resorption of the deposits compared with low-energy therapy.

Level Of Evidence

Level I, therapeutic study. See the Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for plantar fasciitis: randomised controlled multicentre trial [^116QbhQE]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy compared with placebo in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.

Design

Randomised, blinded, multicentre trial with parallel group design.

Setting

Nine hospitals and one outpatient clinic in Germany.

Participants

272 patients with chronic plantar fasciitis recalcitrant to conservative therapy for at least six months: 135 patients were allocated extracorporeal shock wave therapy and 137 were allocated placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary end point was the success rate 12 weeks after intervention based on the Roles and Maudsley score. Secondary end points encompassed subjective pain ratings and walking ability up to a year after the last intervention.

Results

The primary end point could be assessed in 94% (n = 256) of patients. The success rate 12 weeks after intervention was 34% (n = 43) in the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group and 30% (n = 39) in the placebo group (95% confidence interval - 8.0% to 15.1%). No difference was found in the secondary end points. Few side effects were reported.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is ineffective in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.

We performed the online search until October, 2022. The following terms were used (Osteoarthritis) AND ("knee joint") AND ("Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy"). Eligibility criteria: (1) randomized clinical trials; (2) effects comparison of shockwave therapy to a sham or kinesiotherapy in individuals with knee osteoarthritis; (3) pain and physical function as outcome variables. Risk of bias assessed using the PEDro scale. PROSPERO registration (CRD42021235597).

Results

We identified 4217 studies, and 12 were included in the qualitative synthesis and the meta-analysis, totaling 403 individuals submitted to the intervention and 331 control individuals. Compared to sham, shockwave was favored in short-term for the function outcome (SMD = -1.93; 95%CI: [-2.77; -1.09]; I ² = 83%; P < 0.01). For the pain outcome, the shockwave was favored in the short (MD = -2.05; 95%CI: [-2.59; -1.51]; I ² = 84%; P < 0.01), medium (MD = -3.46; 95%CI: [-4.03; -2.89]; I ² = 0%; P < 0.01) and long-term (MD = -2.01; 95%CI: [-3.36; -0.65]; I ² = 98%; P < 0.01). The association with kinesiotherapy was favored in the short term for the function outcome (SMD = -1.88; 95%CI: [-2.98; -0.78]; I ² = 94%; P < 0.01) and favored for the pain outcome in the short (MD = -1.44; 95%CI: [-1.81; -1.07]; I ² = 37%; P = 0.14), medium (MD = -1,31; 95%CI: [-1.76; -0,85]; I ² = 0%; P = 0.41), and long terms (MD = -1.63; 95%CI: [-1.73; -1.52]; I ² = 0%; P = 0.43).

Conclusion

Shockwave therapy may improve functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis in the short term and pain in all follow-up moments, compared with sham. When associated to kinesiotherapy, it may improve function in the short term and pain in all follow-up time points, although improvement in pain may not be clinically significant.

### The effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in lower limb tendinopathy: a systematic review [^1155dQha]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) when treating lower limb tendinopathies including greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), patellar tendinopathy (PT), and Achilles tendinopathy (AT).

Purpose

To evaluate the effectiveness of ESWT for lower limb tendinopathies.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

PubMed (Medline), Embase, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, and CINAHL were searched from inception to February 2013 for studies of any design investigating the effectiveness of ESWT in GTPS, PT, and AT. Citation tracking was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Animal and non-English language studies were excluded. A quality assessment was performed by 2 independent reviewers, and effect size calculations were computed when sufficient data were provided.

Results

A total of 20 studies were identified, with 13 providing sufficient data to compute effect size calculations. The energy level, number of impulses, number of sessions, and use of a local anesthetic varied between studies. Additionally, current evidence is limited by low participant numbers and a number of methodological weaknesses including inadequate randomization. Moderate evidence indicates that ESWT is more effective than home training and corticosteroid injection in the short (< 12 months) and long (> 12 months) term for GTPS. Limited evidence indicates that ESWT is more effective than alternative nonoperative treatments including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and an exercise program and equal to patellar tenotomy surgery in the long term for PT. Moderate evidence indicates that ESWT is more effective than eccentric loading for insertional AT and equal to eccentric loading for midportion AT in the short term. Additionally, there is moderate evidence that combining ESWT and eccentric loading in midportion AT may produce superior outcomes to eccentric loading alone.

Conclusion

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is an effective intervention and should be considered for GTPS, PT, and AT particularly when other nonoperative treatments have failed.

### Effect and optimal timing of extracorporeal shock-wave intervention to patients with spasticity after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wk2Ra]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study investigated the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy as well as the optimal intervention timing for extracorporeal shock wave therapy for patients with spasticity after stroke.

Design

A search of randomized controlled trials was conducted in different electronic databases. We performed a meta-analysis to measure the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy versus sham interventions on spasticity and limb functionality. The meta-regression analysis was performed to determine the adequate intervention timing of extracorporeal shock wave therapy. The follow-up period of the outcomes was divided into the short (< 2 wks), mid (> 2 wks and ≤ 4 wks), and long (> 4 wks and ≤ 3 mos) terms.

Results

Thirteen studies with 677 participants were evaluated. Spasticity significantly improved throughout the follow-up duration. Limb functionality significantly improved in the short-term follow-up period. The meta-regression analysis showed that patients with stroke duration less than 45 mos may be benefited from extracorporeal shock wave therapy in improving limb function in all follow-up periods.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is an effective method for reducing spasticity in patients with stroke, and the effect could be maintained for up to 3 mos. Its effects on limb functionality could persist for at least 2 wks. Patients who had stroke for less than 45 mos may have significant benefit from extracorporeal shock wave therapy in all follow-up periods.

### Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) [^115Cshkf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Randomised controlled trials were reviewed to evaluate the evidence of the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the management of tennis elbow. Seven relevant trials were found, which had satisfactory methodology but conflicting results. Further research with well designed randomised control trials is needed to establish the absolute and relative effectiveness of this intervention for tennis elbow.

### Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of previously untreated lateral epicondylitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1172YtsS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a relatively new therapy used in the treatment of chronic tendon-related pain. Few randomized controlled trials have been performed on it, and no studies have examined the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy as a frontline therapy for tendon-related pain.

Hypothesis

Subjects treated with active extracorporeal shock wave therapy will have higher rates of treatment success than subjects treated with sham extracorporeal shock wave therapy.

Design

Double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Sixty subjects who had previously untreated lateral epicondylitis for less than 1 year and more than 3 weeks were included in this study. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive 1 session per week for 3 weeks of either sham or active extra-corporeal shock wave therapy. Subjects in the active therapy group received 2000 pulses (energy flux density, 0.03–0.17 mJ/mm(2)). All subjects were provided with a forearm-stretching program. After 8 weeks of therapy, subjects were classified as either treatment successes or treatment failures according to fulfillment of all 3 criteria: (1) at least a 50% reduction in the overall pain visual analog scale score, (2) a maximum allowable overall pain visual analog scale score of 4.0 cm, and (3) no use of pain medication for elbow pain for 2 weeks before the 8 week follow-up. Visual analog scale scores were also collected for pain at rest, during sleep, during activity, at its worst, and at its least, as well as for quality of life (using the EuroQoL questionnaire) and grip strength.

Results

Success rates in the sham and active therapy groups were 31% and 39%, respectively. No significant difference was detected between groups (χ²(1) = 0.3880, P = 0.533). Mean change in quality of life over 8 weeks was an increase of 1.3 and 3.3 for sham and active therapy groups, respectively, and mean change in grip strength over 8 weeks was an increase of 7.4 kg and 6.8 kg for sham and active therapy groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Despite improvement in pain scores and pain-free maximum grip strength within groups, there does not appear to be a meaningful difference between treating lateral epicondylitis with extracorporeal shock wave therapy combined with forearm-stretching program and treating with forearm-stretching program alone, with respect to resolving pain within an 8-week period of commencing treatment.

### Clinically relevant effectiveness of focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: a randomized, controlled multicenter study [^114EqeUC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of plantar fasciitis is controversial. The objective of the present study was to test whether focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy is effective in relieving chronic heel pain diagnosed as plantar fasciitis.

Methods

Two hundred and fifty subjects were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled U.S. Food and Drug Administration trial. Subjects were randomized to focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy (0.25 mJ/mm²) or placebo intervention, with three sessions of 2000 impulses in weekly intervals. Primary outcomes were both the percentage change of heel pain on the visual analog scale composite score (pain during first steps in the morning, pain with daily activities, and pain with a force meter) and the Roles and Maudsley score at twelve weeks after the last intervention compared with the scores at baseline.

Results

Two hundred and forty-six patients (98.4%) were available for intention-to-treat analysis at the twelve-week follow-up. With regard to the first primary end point, the visual analog scale composite score, there was a significant difference (p = 0.0027, one-sided) in the reduction of heel pain in the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group (69.2%) compared with the placebo therapy group (34.5%). Extracorporeal shock wave therapy was also significantly superior to the placebo therapy for the Roles and Maudsley score (p = 0.0006, one-sided). Temporary pain and swelling during and after treatment were the only device-related adverse events observed.

Conclusions

The results of the present study provide proof of the clinically relevant effect size of focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy without local anesthesia in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis, with success rates between 50% and 65%.

### Shock wave therapy in plastic surgery: a review of the current indications [^1145LwpU]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) represents a promising, non-invasive management strategy supporting the treatment of a variety of conditions related to plastic surgery.

Objectives

This literature review aimed to give a systematic overview of current applications, its mechanism of action, and its potential to provide tangible therapies in plastic surgery.

Methods

The databases PubMed (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD), Embase (via Ovid [Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands]), and the Cochrane Library (Cochrane, London, UK) were searched for articles published up to June 1, 2021. Clinical studies of any design including ESWT in the context of plastic surgery were included. Two reviewers extracted data, and 46 articles were analyzed after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

Forty-six included studies (n = 1496) were categorized into the following broad themes: cellulite/body contouring/skin rejuvenation, burns/scar treatment, diabetic foot ulcers/chronic wound, and future perspectives of ESWT. Overall, applications of ESWT were heterogenous, and the majority of studies reported effectiveness of ESWT as an alternative treatment technique. Flawed methodology and differences in technical standards limit the outcome and conclusion of this review.

Conclusions

There is yet insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any specific intervention included in this review; however, all included studies reported improvements in key outcomes. Where reported, ESWT displayed a good safety profile with no serious adverse events. Further research is needed to provide more evidence to delineate the indications of ESWT in plastic surgery.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy on spasticity after upper motor neuron injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HxH6k]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on spasticity after upper motor neuron injury.

Design

Eight electronic databases were searched systematically from their inception to August 3, 2021, to provide robust evidence for the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for spasticity and range of motion after upper motor neuron injury. Study screening, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and evaluation of the certainty of evidence were performed independently by two independent reviewers. Data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3.5 and R 3.6.1 software.

Results

Forty-two studies with 1973 patients who met the eligibility criteria were selected from articles published from 2010 to 2021, of which 34 were included in the meta-analysis. A comparison intervention revealed that extracorporeal shock wave therapy significantly decreased the Modified Ashworth Scale score and increased the passive range of motion of a joint. Regarding the safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, slightly adverse effects, such as skin injury, bone distortion, muscle numbness, pain, petechiae, and weakness, were reported in five studies.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be an effective and safe treatment for spasticity after upper motor neuron injury. However, because of poor methodological qualities of the included studies and high heterogeneity, this conclusion warrants further investigation.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^1179QvVo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction — investigational and experimental therapies (Recommendations 23–25): For men with ED, low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy should be considered investigational. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) For men with ED, intracavernosal stem cell therapy should be considered investigational. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) For men with ED, platelet-rich plasma therapy should be considered experimental. (Expert Opinion) Randomized sham-controlled trials do not clearly indicate that benefits reliably outweigh risks/burdens for shock wave therapy or ICI stem cell therapy and these treatments should only be considered investigational; platelet-rich plasma therapy should not be offered unless administered under an institutional review board approved experimental clinical research protocol, and at this time no full-text peer-reviewed publications are available to constitute an evidence base.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of chronic tendinopathies [^116ujH2e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Many clinical trials have evaluated the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for treating patients with chronic tendinosis of the supraspinatus, lateral epicondylitis, and plantar fasciitis. Although extracorporeal shock wave therapy has been reported to be effective in some trials, in others it was no more effective than placebo. The multiple variables associated with this therapy, such as the amount of energy delivered, the method of focusing the shock waves, frequency and timing of delivery, and whether or not anesthetics are used, makes comparing clinical trials difficult. Calcific tendinosis of the supraspinatus and plantar fasciitis have been successfully managed with extracorporeal shock wave therapy when nonsurgical management has failed. Results have been mixed in the management of lateral epicondylitis, however, and this therapy has not been effective in managing noncalcific tendinosis of the supraspinatus. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy has consistently been more effective with patient feedback, which enables directing the shock waves to the most painful area (clinical focusing), rather than with anatomic or image-guided focusing, which are used to direct the shock wave to an anatomic landmark or structure.

### Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of shock wave therapy for lateral elbow pain [^117UF8UW]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for lateral elbow pain.

Methods

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials using Cochrane Collaboration methodology.

Results

Nine placebo-controlled trials (1006 participants) and one trial of ESWT versus steroid injection (93 participants) were included. The 9 placebo-controlled trials reported conflicting results, although 11 of 13 pooled analyses found no significant benefit of ESWT over placebo, e.g., weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) from baseline to 4–6 weeks (pooled analysis of 3 trials, 446 participants) was -9.42 (95% CI -20.70 to 1.86). Two pooled results favored ESWT, e.g., relative risk of treatment success (at least 50% improvement in pain with resisted wrist extension at 12 weeks) for ESWT in comparison to placebo (pooled analysis of 2 trials, 192 participants) was 2.2 (95% CI 1.55 to 3.12). However, this finding was not supported by the results of 4 other trials that were unable to be pooled. Steroid injection was more effective than ESWT at 3 months after the end of treatment assessed by a reduction of pain of 50% from baseline [21/25 (84%) vs 29/48 (60%); p < 0.05]. Minimal adverse effects of ESWT were reported.

Conclusion

Based upon systematic review of 9 placebo-controlled trials, there is "platinum" level evidence that ESWT provides little or no benefit in terms of pain and function in lateral elbow pain. There is "silver" level evidence based upon one trial that steroid injection may be more effective than ESWT.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a randomized multicenter trial [^114VXkEY]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2002). Low credibility.

Background

On the basis of observational trials, numerous investigators have recommended extracorporeal shock wave therapy as an alternative treatment for chronic lateral epicondylitis of the elbow. However, there has been no evidence of its efficacy from well-designed randomized clinical trials. The objective of this study was to find out whether extracorporeal shock wave therapy in combination with local anesthesia was superior to placebo therapy in combination with local anesthesia.

Methods

A randomized multicenter trial with a parallel-group design was conducted. Following administration of local anesthesia, either extracorporeal shock wave therapy with three treatments of 2000 pulses each and a positive energy flux density (ED+) of 0.07 to 0.09 mJ/mm² or placebo therapy was applied on an outpatient basis. Treatment allocation was blinded for patients and for observers. The primary end point was based on the rate of success, as determined with the Roles and Maudsley score and whether additional treatment was required, twelve weeks after the intervention. Crossover was possible after assessment of the primary end point. Secondary end points were the Roles and Maudsley score, subjective pain rating, and grip strength after six and twelve weeks and after twelve months. The planned number of 272 patients was included in the study.

Results

The primary end point could be assessed for 90.8% of the patients. The success rate was 25.8% in the group treated with extracorporeal shock wave therapy and 25.4% in the placebo group, a difference of 0.4% with a 95% confidence interval of -10.5% to 11.3%. Similarly, there was no relevant difference between groups with regard to the secondary end points. Improvement was observed in two-thirds of the patients from both groups twelve months after the intervention. Few side effects were reported.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy as applied in the present study was ineffective in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. The previously reported success of this therapy appears to be attributable to inappropriate study designs. Different application protocols might improve clinical outcome. We recommend that extracorporeal shock wave therapy be applied only in high-quality clinical trials until it is proved to be effective.

### Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave treatment improves erectile function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UWHwG]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

As a novel therapeutic method for erectile dysfunction (ED), low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave treatment (LI-ESWT) has been applied recently in the clinical setting. We feel that a summary of the current literature and a systematic review to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LI-ESWT for ED would be helpful for physicians who are interested in using this modality to treat patients with ED.

Objective

A systematic review of the evidence regarding LI-ESWT for patients with ED was undertaken with a meta-analysis to identify the efficacy of the treatment modality.

Evidence Acquisition

A comprehensive search of the PubMed and Embase databases to November 2015 was performed. Studies reporting on patients with ED treated with LI-ESWT were included. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Erection Hardness Score (EHS) were the most commonly used tools to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LI-ESWT.

Evidence Synthesis

There were 14 studies including 833 patients from 2005 to 2015. Seven studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, in these studies, the setup parameters of LI-ESWT and the protocols of treatment were variable. The meta-analysis revealed that LI-ESWT could significantly improve IIEF (mean difference: 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99–3.00; p < 0.0001) and EHS (risk difference: 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04–0.29; p = 0.01). Therapeutic efficacy could last at least 3 mo. The patients with mild-moderate ED had better therapeutic efficacy after treatment than patients with more severe ED or comorbidities. Energy flux density, number of shock waves per treatment, and duration of LI-ESWT treatment were closely related to clinical outcome, especially regarding IIEF improvement.

Conclusions

The number of studies of LI-ESWT for ED have increased dramatically in recent years. Most of these studies presented encouraging results, regardless of variation in LI-ESWT setup parameters or treatment protocols. These studies suggest that LI-ESWT could significantly improve the IIEF and EHS of ED patients. The publication of robust evidence from additional RCTs and longer-term follow-up would provide more confidence regarding use of LI-ESWT for ED patients.

Patient Summary

We reviewed 14 studies of men who received low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave treatment (LI-ESWT) for erectile dysfunction (ED). There was evidence that these men experienced improvements in their ED following LI-ESWT.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy on spasticity after upper motor neuron injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XTcsB]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

- Spasticity, a common motor impairment after upper motor neuron injury, affects patients' motor recovery and presents challenges for researchers and clinicians.
- Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a potential therapy for ameliorating spasticity.

What Is New

- Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is relatively effective for improving the Modified Ashworth Scale score and the passive range of motion of joint of spastic patients after upper motor neuron injury.
- The effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy is better with higher pressure, frequency, or energy flux density.

Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone with an exaggerated tendon jerk resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as first defined by Lance in 1980. This dysregulation of motor tone and muscle activation occurs as a result of damage to inhibitory upper motor neurons (UMNs). The cause of UMN injury includes cerebral palsy (CP), stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), and spinal cord injury (SCI). The estimated prevalence of spasticity in CP is 1.78 per 1000 patients, and most (69.8%) children with CP experience spasticity. For stroke survivors, the prevalence of spasticity ranges from 30% to 80%. In addition, spasticity is experienced in 52.5% of individuals with MSand 86.5% with chronic SCI. Spasticity is associated with pain, weakness, joint stiffness, and/or contracture, which may exacerbate spasticity. In addition, spasticity can lead to gait disorders, falls, fatigue, and sleep disturbance and may prolong the time to wheelchair dependence, which may increase disability and dependence and cause social isolation and depression. Furthermore, several studies found that spasticity was associated with a worse quality of life – and greater cost.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is effective in treating chronic plantar fasciitis: a meta-analysis of RCTs [^116TpLhr]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain. It may remain symptomatic despite conservative treatment with orthoses and analgesia. There is conflicting evidence concerning the role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in the management of this condition.

Questions/Purposes

We investigated whether there was a significant difference in the change of (1) VAS scores and (2) Roles and Maudsley scores from baseline when treated with ESWT and placebo. Specifically we compared overall improvement from baseline composite VAS, reduction in overall VAS pain, success rate of improving overall VAS pain by 60%, success rate of improving VAS pain by 60% when taking first steps, doing daily activities, and during application of a pain pressure meter.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched from January 1980 to January 2013 and a double extraction technique was used to obtain relevant studies. Studies had to be prospective randomized controlled trials on adults and must not have used local anesthesia as part of their treatment protocol. Studies must have specifically recruited patients who continued to be symptomatic despite a minimum of 3 months of conservative treatments. All papers were assessed regarding their methodologic quality and a meta-analysis performed. Seven prospective randomized controlled trials were included in this study. There were 369 patients included in the placebo group and 294 in the ESWT group.

Results

After ESWT, patients had better composite VAS scores (random effects model, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.05, 0.72; z = 2.27). They also had a greater reduction in their absolute VAS scores compared with placebo (random effects model, SMD = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.85; z = 4.64). Greater success of improving heel pain by 60% was observed after ESWT when taking first steps (random effects model, risk ratio [RR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04, 1.62; z = 2.29) and during daily activities (random effects model, RR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13, 1.84; z = 2.96). Subjective measurement of pain using a pressure meter similarly favored ESWT (random effects model, RR = 1.37, 95% CI, 1.06, 1.78; z = 2.41). There was a significant difference in the change to "excellent - good" Roles and Maudsley scores in favor of the ESWT group.

Conclusions

ESWT is a safe and effective treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis refractory to nonoperative treatments. Improved pain scores with the use of ESWT were evident 12 weeks after treatment. The evidence suggests this improvement is maintained for up to 12 months. We recommend the use of ESWT for patients with substantial heel pain despite a minimum of 3 months of nonoperative treatment.

### The effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on pain intensity and neck disability for patients with myofascial pain syndrome in the neck and shoulder: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1151yFjT]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on myofascial pain syndrome in the neck and shoulder compared with that of other treatments.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched until May 30, 2019, to select randomized controlled trials.

Review Methods

The randomized controlled trials comparing extracorporeal shock wave therapy with sham extracorporeal shock wave therapy or other treatments for patients with myofascial pain syndrome in the neck and shoulder patients were included. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies. The Cochrane Handbook was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included randomized controlled trials. Main outcomes associated with pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, and neck disability were selected. The study was registered with PROSPERO (Registration Number CRD 42019137459).

Results

A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were finally included. The results indicated that extracorporeal shock wave therapy had a large effect size on improving pain intensity (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.11 to 1.23, P = 0.02) and pressure pain threshold (SMD = 1.19, 95% confidence interval = 0.27 to l2.12, P = 0.01) at postintervention. However, there was no significant effect on neck disability at postintervention (SMD = 0.03, 95% confidence interval = -0.76 to 0.83, P = 0.93). After the subgroup analyses on the type of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy had a significant effect on improving pain intensity (SMD = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = 0.13 to 1.36, P = 0.02) and pressure pain threshold (SMD = 1.70, 95% confidence interval = 0.21 to 3.18, P = 0.03) at postintervention in comparison with that of other treatments.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is superior to other treatments in terms of alleviating the pain intensity and pressure pain threshold of patients with myofascial pain syndrome in the neck and shoulder at postintervention. In particular, focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy shows significant improvement in pain relief. However, radical extracorporeal shock wave therapy for myofascial pain syndrome treatment still remains unclear.

### Shock wave therapy for lateral elbow pain [^1115eYqW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one in a series of reviews of interventions for lateral elbow pain.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for lateral elbow pain.

Search Strategy

Searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index (SCISEARCH) were conducted in February 2005, unrestricted by date.

Selection Criteria

We included nine trials that randomised 1006 participants to ESWT or placebo and one trial that randomised 93 participants to ESWT or steroid injection.

Data Collection and Analysis

For each trial two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and extracted data. Methodological quality criteria included appropriate randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, number lost to follow up and intention to treat analysis. Where appropriate, pooled analyses were performed. If there was significant heterogeneity between studies or the data reported did not allow statistical pooling, individual trial results were described in the text.

Main Results

Eleven of the 13 pooled analyses found no significant benefit of ESWT over placebo. For example, the weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) from baseline to 4–6 weeks from a pooled analysis of three trials (446 participants) was -9.42 (95% CI -20.70 to 1.86) and the weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) provoked by resisted wrist extension (Thomsen test) from baseline to 12 weeks from a pooled analysis of three trials (455 participants) was -9.04 (95% CI -19.37 to 1.28). Two pooled results favoured ESWT. For example, the pooled relative risk of treatment success (at least 50% improvement in pain with resisted wrist extension at 12 weeks) for ESWT in comparison to placebo from a pooled analysis of two trials (192 participants) was 2.2 (95% CI 1.55 to 3.12). However this finding was not supported by the results of four other individual trials that were unable to be pooled. Steroid injection was more effective than ESWT at 3 months after the end of treatment assessed by a reduction of pain of 50% from baseline (21/25 (84%) versus 29/48 (60%), p < 0.05). Minimal adverse effects of ESWT were reported. Most commonly these were transient pain, reddening of the skin and nausea and in most cases did not require treatment discontinuation or dosage adjustment.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon systematic review of nine placebo-controlled trials involving 1006 participants, there is "Platinum" level evidence that shock wave therapy provides little or no benefit in terms of pain and function in lateral elbow pain. There is "Silver" level evidence based upon one trial involving 93 participants that steroid injection may be more effective than ESWT.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy on pain and foot functions in subjects with chronic plantar fasciitis: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^111fCUUm]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on pain, and foot function in subjects with plantar fasciitis.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were done to identify randomized controlled trials of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in subjects with plantar fasciitis. PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included trials. Visual Analogue Scale and Foot Function Index were the primary outcome measures of this review. Due to varying of entailed trials, meta-analysis was not carried out.

Results

Eleven randomized controlled trials with 658 patients were included. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy exhibited a moderate confirmation to better pain, and foot function of individuals with chronic plantar fasciitis.

Conclusion

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy could be a promising rehabilitation intervention and might support to improve pain, and foot function of subjects with chronic plantar fasciitis. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONExtracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) exerted beneficial effects on pain and functional outcomes for chronic plantar fasciitis.ESWT could be effectively performed with no side effects.ESWT could be an alternative to the conventional management of chronic plantar fasciitis.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for chronic painful heel syndrome: a prospective, double blind, randomized trial assessing the efficacy of a new electromagnetic shock wave device [^111FA4Yf]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Published data describing the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of plantar heel pain provide conflicting results, and optimal treatment guidelines are yet to be determined. To assess the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shockwave therapy compared with placebo in the treatment of chronic painful heel syndrome with a new electromagnetic device, we undertook a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 40 participants who were randomly allocated to either active, focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (0.25 mJ/mm²) or sham shockwave therapy. Both groups received 3 applications of 2000 shockwave impulses, each session 1 week apart. The primary outcome was the change in composite heel pain (morning pain, pain with activities of daily living, and pain upon application of pressure with a focal force meter) as quantified using a visual analog pain scale at 12 weeks after completion of the interventions compared with baseline. Secondary endpoints included changes in morning pain, pain with activities of daily living, and pain upon application of pressure with a focal force meter, as measured on a visual analog pain scale, as well as the change in the Roles and Maudsley score, at 12 weeks after the baseline measurement. Active extracorporeal shockwave therapy resulted in a 73.2% reduction in composite heel pain, and this was a 32.7% greater reduction than that achieved with placebo. The difference was not statistically significant (1-tailed Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.0302), but reached clinical relevance (Mann-Whitney effect size = 0.6737). In regard to the secondary outcomes, active extracorporeal shockwave therapy displayed relative superiority in comparison with the sham intervention. No relevant adverse events occurred in either intervention group. The results of the present study support the use of electromagnetically generated extracorporeal shockwave therapy for the treatment of refractory plantar heel pain.

### A randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) [^113UAsLS]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial were to determine whether ultrasound-guided extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) reduced pain and improved function in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) in the short term and intermediate term.

Methods

Sixty-eight patients from community-based referring doctors were randomized to receive 3 ESWT treatments or 3 treatments at a subtherapeutic dose given at weekly intervals. Seven outcome measures relating to pain and function were collected at followup evaluations at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after completion of the treatment. The mean changes in outcome variables from baseline to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months were compared for the 2 groups.

Results

The groups did not differ on demographic or clinical characteristics at baseline and there were significant improvements in almost all outcome measures for both groups over the 6-month followup period, but there were no differences between the groups even after adjusting for duration of symptoms.

Conclusion

Our study found little evidence to support the use of ESWT for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis and is in keeping with recent systematic reviews of ESWT for lateral epicondylitis that have drawn similar conclusions.

### Updated recommendations on the therapeutic role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for Peyronie's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pab8B]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

ESWT has a certain effect on relieving pain during erection or sexual intercourse and softening or reducing plaques in the short term, but its effect on completely reversing the curvature of the penis and improving sexual function in the long term is still very limited. As a safe and effective treatment, it still deserves our attention. We need more high-quality clinical studies for more precise evaluation.

### Effects of kinesio taping and extracorporeal shock wave therapy in combination with exercise in sarcopenic older adults: a study protocol of a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^112Rbiyn]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This RCT will fill crucial evidence gaps by evaluating the first combined KT + ESWT + exercise protocol for sarcopenia. Our results will determine whether this novel strategy outperforms standard exercise therapy while expanding KT/ESWT indications beyond their current musculoskeletal uses. These results will directly inform clinical decisions about safe, non-pharmacological adjuncts to exercise, while guiding future research on mechanistically synergistic therapies.

### Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in chronic plantar fasciitis: a meta-analysis [^1171vYzR]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating chronic plantar fasciitis. An online database search was conducted for studies using ESWT in managing chronic plantar fasciitis. Eleven high-quality randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis and showed that ESWT was more effective in reducing morning pain (weighted mean difference, -0.77 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -1.30 to -0.25]; odds ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.42–1.00]). Moderate-intensity ESWT was more effective in decreasing overall and activity pain (weighted mean difference, -6.6 [95% CI, -6.74 to -6.46], and weighted mean difference, 0.47 (95% CI, 0.30–0.74). Both moderate- and high-intensity ESWT were more effective in improving functional outcome, with odds ratios of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.30–0.84) and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.29–0.75). The adverse effects that were seen more in ESWT were pain on the calcaneal area and calcaneal erythema. This study concludes that moderate- and high-intensity ESWT were effective in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^113TEeku]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for spasticity: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against extracorporeal shock wave therapy for spasticity management (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Low-quality evidence from an SR of 13 RCTs reported MAS improvements versus sham ESWT or conventional physiotherapy at short-term (1–2 weeks after treatment), mid-term (> 3 and < 4 weeks after treatment), and long-term (up to 12 weeks after treatment), but effects were interpreted by the Work Group as not clinically significant; the included studies evaluated patients (n = 677), with MAS analyses including 11 short-term (n = 533), 9 mid-term (n = 421), and 4 long-term (n = 285). An NMA of 33 RCTs (n = 1,930) found in short-term analyses that botulinum toxin, fESWT, and rESWT significantly reduced spasticity and were more effective than control, while in mid-term analyses there were no significant differences; overall, the evidence available is limited in determining clinical significance, and the SR authors did not review the reported complications of the RCTs' interventions.

### Clinical effectiveness of shockwave therapy in lateral elbow tendinopathy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kYFEe]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy compared with other interventions on pain, grip strength and disability in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library and clinical trial registries.

Review Methods

We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy alone or as an additive intervention compared with sham or other interventions. Pain intensity, grip strength and elbow disability were used as primary outcome measures. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro score and quality of evidence with the GRADE approach.

Results

Twenty-seven studies with 1871 patients were finally included. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduced pain intensity at mid-term follow-up (standardized mean difference: -1.21, 95% confidence interval:-1.53, -0.89, P < 0.001) and improved grip strength at very short- (mean difference:3.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.91, 6.94, P = 0.01) and short-term follow-up (mean difference:4.87, 95% confidence interval:2.24, 7.50, P < 0.001) compared with sham treatment. However, no clinically significant results were found between comparators in all outcomes and follow-up times. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy presented clinically better compared to Laser in grip strength at short-term (mean difference:3.50, 95% confidence interval:2.40, 4.60, P < 0.001) and ultrasound in pain intensity at very-short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference: -1.54, 95% confidence interval: -2.60, -0.48, P = 0.005).

Conclusion

Low to moderate certainty of evidence suggests that there are no clinical benefits of extracorporeal shockwave therapy compared to sham interventions or corticosteroid injections. Based on very-low and moderate certainty of evidence, extracorporeal shockwave therapy outperforms against Laser and ultrasound, respectively. Level of Evidence: Therapy, level 1a.

### Shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease with or without calcification [^1121FVwf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Shock wave therapy has seen widespread use since the 1990s to treat various musculoskeletal disorders including rotator cuff disease, but evidence of its efficacy remains equivocal.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease, with or without calcification, and to establish its usefulness in the context of other available treatment options.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP up to November 2019, with no restrictions on language. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved trials to identify potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that used quasi-randomised methods to allocate participants, investigating participants with rotator cuff disease with or without calcific deposits. We included trials of comparisons of extracorporeal or radial shock wave therapy versus any other intervention. Major outcomes were pain relief greater than 30%, mean pain score, function, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life, number of participants experiencing adverse events and number of withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was shock wave therapy compared to placebo.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (2281 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Most trials (25) included participants with rotator cuff disease and calcific deposits, five trials included participants with rotator cuff disease and no calcific deposits, and two trials included a mixed population of participants with and without calcific deposits. Twelve trials compared shock wave therapy to placebo, 11 trials compared high-dose shock wave therapy (0.2 mJ/mm² to 0.4 mJ/mm² and above) to low-dose shock wave therapy. Single trials compared shock wave therapy to ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid needling, ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injection, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), no treatment or exercise; dual session shock wave therapy to single session therapy; and different delivery methods of shock wave therapy. Our main comparison was shock wave therapy versus placebo and results are reported for the 3 month follow up. All trials were susceptible to bias; including selection (74%), performance (62%), detection (62%), and selective reporting (45%) biases. No trial measured participant-reported pain relief of 30%. However, in one trial (74 participants), at 3 months follow up, 14/34 participants reported pain relief of 50% or greater with shock wave therapy compared with 15/40 with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.94); low-quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Mean pain (0 to 10 scale, higher scores indicate more pain) was 3.02 points in the placebo group and 0.78 points better (0.17 better to 1.4 better; clinically important change was 1.5 points) with shock wave therapy (9 trials, 608 participants), moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for bias). Mean function (scale 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better function) was 66 points with placebo and 7.9 points better (1.6 better to 14 better, clinically important difference 10 points) with shock wave therapy (9 trials, 612 participants), moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for bias). Participant-reported success was reported by 58/150 people in shock wave therapy group compared with 35/137 people in placebo group (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.91; 6 trials, 287 participants), low-quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). None of the trials measured quality of life. Withdrawal rate or adverse event rates may not differ between extracorporeal shock wave therapy and placebo, but we are uncertain due to the small number of events. There were 11/34 withdrawals in the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group compared with 13/40 withdrawals in the placebo group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.31; 7 trials, 581 participants) low-quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision); and 41/156 adverse events with extracorporeal shock wave therapy compared with 10/139 adverse events in the placebo group (RR 3.61, 95% CI 2.00 to 6.52; 5 trials, 295 participants) low-quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Subgroup analyses indicated that there were no between-group differences in pain and function outcomes in participants who did or did not have calcific deposits in the rotator cuff.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon the currently available low- to moderate-certainty evidence, there were very few clinically important benefits of shock wave therapy, and uncertainty regarding its safety. Wide clinical diversity and varying treatment protocols means that we do not know whether or not some trials tested subtherapeutic doses, possibly underestimating any potential benefits. Further trials of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease should be based upon a strong rationale and consideration of whether or not they would alter the conclusions of this review. A standard dose and treatment protocol should be decided upon before further research is conducted. Development of a core set of outcomes for trials of rotator cuff disease and other shoulder disorders would also facilitate our ability to synthesise the evidence.

### The effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of burn scars: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial [^116qwy7x]. Burns (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current scientific evidence on the effect of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) as adjunctive treatment for burn scars is scarce. However preliminary evidence, indicates it might prove a useful tool.

Materials and Methods

A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted from February 2017 to February 2019. Patients with burn scars were divided into two groups with twenty patients per group. The control group received the standard treatment for burn scars. The ESWT group received the standard treatment and treatment of burn scars with ESWT 512 impulses of 0.15mJ/mm 2 in each session, twice per week for 4 weeks. We assessed the appearance of scar with the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), pruritus and pain with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before the start of the treatment and at 2 weeks and 5 months after the treatment.

Results

Both groups showed improvements in all variables through the study. However, these improvements were only statistically significant for the VSS at the 6th month for the control group and VSS and VAS pain and pruritus for the ESWT group. Nonetheless the results failed to show statistically significant differences between the ESWT and the control group neither at two weeks after treatment nor at 5 months after treatment.

Conclusion

Our study questions the relevance of ESWT as adjunctive treatment for burn scars as far as outward appearance, pain and pruritus as end-results are concern. Nonetheless, further studies are required to accurately assess the potential benefits of ESWT as an adjunctive treatment for burn scars.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^116ZDMQ8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer patients sometimes show immobilizing musculoskeletal conditions which prohibit active exercise due to severe bodily pain. Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively in the exercise program. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT, the application of radial and/or focused shock waves with low or high energy) has been shown to be effective and efficient in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, one historical paradigm was the fact that, in the past, cancer was seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT.

Methods

Clinical note to present indications, benefits, and contraindications of shock wave treatment in cancer patients.

Results

Malignant tumors in the treatment area have to be seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT treatment. Cancer itself — in the form of the underlying disease — is not a contraindication for the treatment with radial and focused shock wave therapy with low or high energy. Plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spurs, calcified shoulder, tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, and delayed healing and chronic wounds are typical approved standard indications for ESWT, and are allowed when the malignant tumor is not in the treatment area. There are also other musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal indications (e.g. myofascial syndrome, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema) that are relevant for cancer survivors. These indications are recommended by the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) for "common empirically tested clinical use" and as exceptional indications/expert indications.

Conclusion

ESWT is a safe and relevant modality for the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients.

### Is radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), sham-rESWT or a standardised exercise programme in combination with advice plus customised foot orthoses more effective than advice plus customised foot orthoses alone in the treatment of plantar fasciopathy? A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^1164DMdU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this trial evaluating patients with plantar fasciopathy, no additional benefit of rESWT, sham-rESWT or a high-load exercise programme over advice plus customised foot orthoses alone was observed in improving pain, foot function and health-related quality of life. All treatment groups improved significantly in all outcomes from baseline to 6 months, except for the Mental Component Summary score of RAND-12 in the sham-group. The ITT analysis of the mean changes in the primary and secondary outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months revealed no significant between-group differences.

Ibrahim et al and Gerdesmeyer et al demonstrated that rESWT was superior compared with sham-rESWT, which contrasts with the results from the present trial. The previous studies are comparable methodologically to the present RCT, but neither assessed a patient evaluation of the blinding. The uncertainty regarding the success of blinding, may have affected the results. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis have revealed the powerful placebo effects of ESWT in the treatment of plantar fasciopathyand may be an explanation of the improvements in the sham-rESWT group in the present study. The present study complement the results of a recent systematic review including RCTs comparing radial or focused ESWT with placebo showing no superior effects of shock wave therapy.

In contrast to previous trialsthe physiotherapist in the present study conducted multiple sessions with patients in the high-load strength training group to provide guidance and ensure adherence, as the ability to attain sufficient progressive loading can influence treatment outcomes. Most patients in the exercise group (74%) completed according to the per protocol, though the physiotherapist made individualised adjustments that deviated from the planned regimen. Few patients reached 6 RM at week 9–12. Individualisation is necessary in clinical practice, and Riel et al found no differences in the effectiveness of self-dosed and predetermined exercise programmes for patients with plantar fasciopathy. The plantar fascia is not considered a regular tendon, as it has no direct in-line muscular attachment. This may cause a response to high-load strength training that differs from that of other tendons in the lower extremities, which may explain the lack of benefit of the training programme observed in this study. It is possible that future trials on other types of progressive strengthening programmes provide different results.

### Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy without local anesthesia in patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1114uoK3]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis without local anesthesia.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to September 2015 for randomized controlled trials comparing ESWT without local anesthesia versus placebo for treatment of plantar fasciitis in adults. The primary outcome was the 12-week post-intervention success rate of reducing the visual analog scale score by 60% from baseline at the first step in the morning, reducing the VAS score by 60% from baseline during daily activities, reducing the Roles and Maudsley score, reducing overall heel pain, and reducing pain after applying a force meter.

Results

Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, ESWT significantly improved the success rate of reducing overall heel pain, reducing the VAS score by 60% at the first step in the morning and during daily activities, improving the Roles and Maudsley score to excellent or good, and reducing heel pain after application of a pressure meter.

Conclusions

ESWT seems to be particularly effective in relieving pain associated with RPF. ESWT should be considered when traditional treatments have failed.

### Is radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), sham-rESWT or a standardised exercise programme in combination with advice plus customised foot orthoses more effective than advice plus customised foot orthoses alone in the treatment of plantar fasciopathy? A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^112K5bCh]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar fasciopathy is a degenerative condition characterised by under-surface heel painthat can cause exercising or walking during daily activities to be challenging. Plantar fasciopathy has been reported to affect 3.6%–9.6% of the populationand is associated with psychological stress and reduced health-related quality of life. It is assumed that plantar fasciopathy resolves over time, but reported recovery times vary from several months to years. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of common treatment approaches have not drawn firm conclusions regarding the optimal management strategy for this condition. A recent best practice guide by Morrissey et al suggested a core approach including taping, plantar fascia stretching and individualised education consisting of advice on pain, load management, proper footwear and avoiding barefoot walking. For patients progressing slowly or inadequately, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and custom orthoses were recommended. However, the optimal insole type and the therapeutic effect of orthoses in the treatment of plantar fasciopathy remain uncertain.

Radial ESWT (rESWT) is a widely used non-invasive treatment with few registered harms. This modality has been reported to be more effective than sham-rESWT for treating plantar fasciopathy, though the methodological limitations of previous trials highlight the necessity for additional high-quality studies to determine if rESWT is an ideal therapeutic method, particularly for the long-term resolution of symptoms.

Recent research has shown high-load strength training or heavy-slow resistance training (HSR) to have promising effects on pain and function in the treatment of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy. Researchers have proposed that this exercise method may reduce structural abnormalities, such as hypoechoic areas, irregular structures, neovascularisation and tendon thickening. Few trials, however, have assessed the effectiveness of high-load strength training in treating plantar fasciopathy. In a study by Rathleff et al, high-load strength training was found to be more effective than stretching after 3 months, though there was no difference between the groups after 12 months. A recent three-armed RCT by Riel et al found no clinically relevant between group differences after 12 weeks comparing advice and heel cups versus advice, heel cups and HSR training versus advice, heel cups, HSR and a single cortisone injection. The results indicated that performing exercises was no better than not performing exercises.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112yW6R6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Data synthesis — For extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) versus sham or no treatment, meta-analysis used a profile likelihood random effects model in "Stata/SE 16.1" to estimate differences in NIH-CPSI total score "(scale 0 to 43)" and related domains including pain (NIH-CPSI pain "[scale 0 to 21]" or pain VAS "[scale 0 to 10]"), urinary symptoms (NIH-CPSI urinary "[scale 0 to 10]" or IPSS "[scale 0 to 35]"), QOL "(scale 0 to 12)", and erectile function via the International Index of Erectile Function "(IIEF, scale 0 to 75)" with variations "IIEF-5 [scale 5 to 25]" and "IIEF-EF [scale 0 to 30]". Outcomes were evaluated at end of treatment including "up to 1 week" and post-treatment at "4, 8 to 9, 12 to 13, 20 to 26, and 52 weeks". Effect sizes were "MD for NIH-CPSI total score and QOL score, and… standardized mean difference for pain, urinary, and erectile function", with heterogeneity assessed using "Q-statistic and I² statistic" and stratified by risk of bias, NIH CP/CPPS category, ESWT type, sham control, and whether ESWT was added to a standardized regimen. The primary ESWT analysis "excluded data reported from one trial at 4, 12–13, and 20–26 weeks", with sensitivity analyses including those time points, use of "One-year post-treatment results", and analyses "excluding outlying trials".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^116gF4Py]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Spasticity management — extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT): At the mid-term network meta-analysis (NMA), botulinum toxin (WMD: -0.44; 95% CI: -0.62 — -0.26), fESWT (WMD: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.26 — -0.23), and rESWT (WMD: -0.79; 95% CI: -1.07 — -0.51) were statistically superior in reducing spasticity compared with control; however, the Work Group felt that although these results were statistically significant, they were not clinically significant, interpretation has limitations because of variations in ESWT dosing and the timing of therapy following stroke was varied, and the included studies did not specifically report rates of severe adverse effects though side effects might include transient skin petechiae or localized pain; some variation occurs in patient preferences, ESWT might be a reasonable non-pharmacologic option as part of an individualized care plan, and the intervention requires the acquisition of the machine and in-person treatments by a trained provider, thereby limiting access for some clinics and patients; the evidence was categorized as Reviewed, New-added and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low, leading to the recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against extracorporeal shock wave therapy for spasticity management.

In our opinion, ESWT is a very effective, safe, and time- and cost-efficient method, which can be considered as an interesting modality in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients. ESWT could thus be an effective way to reduce pain and mobilize cancer patients to attend rehabilitation programs and/or to return to work, for example, in cases of calcaneal spurs or calcific tendinitis of the shoulder, which are both very immobilizing conditions in both cancer and non-cancer patients. Thus, ESWT can be considered as a good measure when being used for the above-described indications. Nevertheless, further research is urgently needed to identify the technical parameters (number of sessions, energy transmitted) to implement ESWT as a safe and efficient tool for specific indications (e.g. polyneuropathy or lymphedema) in cancer rehabilitation.

### Updated recommendations on the therapeutic role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for Peyronie's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iSMZ3]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Compared with previous studies, this study has included more literatures and all are high-quality RCTs. However, there are still differences among different studies in baseline data of patients, interventions as well as the way outcomes were evaluated, which partly affect the reliability of the results. In the follow-up study, the inclusion and exclusion criteria should be strictly set, and a relatively consistent experimental intervention plan (such as shock wave energy, frequency, etc.) should be developed, a unified evaluation method of outcome indicators (such as penile curvature - degree, plaque size - mm², pain degree - VAS score, sexual function - IIEF-5 score), and similar follow-up time of outcomes should be developed. Similar suggestions were also given in the previous meta-analysis. However, it is worth noting that the results of this study and previous similar clinical trials show that ESWT, as a physical therapy, can not fundamentally correct the penis deformity caused by tunica albuginea lesions, but can only alleviate the additional symptoms of the lesions, such as pain and inflammatory reaction. Therefore, we need more high-quality studies for exploring the application strategies of ESWT, and higher levels of evidence can be obtained through clinical experiments with uniform intervention conditions, which can guide us to give more effective recommendations for the clinical application of ESWT. For example, combination therapy with drugs such as antioxidants, rather than pursuing the efficacy of ESWT alone.

### Effects of kinesio taping and extracorporeal shock wave therapy in combination with exercise in sarcopenic older adults: a study protocol of a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^112uf6Xe]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sarcopenia is an age-related disease characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength, and its prevalence is increasing. Exercise is an effective treatment to improve muscle mass, muscle strength, and functional activity in sarcopenic older adults. Kinesio taping (KT) and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) are widely-used treatments for musculoskeletal disorders and can increase muscle performance and/or muscle mass. However, the potential synergistic effects of combining KT and ESWT with exercise for primary sarcopenia remain unknown. This study aims to determine whether the addition of KT and ESWT could enhance the beneficial effects of exercise on sarcopenia.

Methods

Nighty-four older adults (60 to 75 years old) with sarcopenia will be recruited and assigned randomly into two groups: (1) exercise+placebo ESWT+placebo taping and (2) exercise+ESWT+KT. All participants will undergo an 8-week treatment program, and outcomes will be measured at recruitment and 1, 4, and 8 weeks after the initial treatment. The primary outcome will be skeletal muscle index, and the secondary outcomes will be knee muscle strength, muscle tone, gait speed, timed-up-and-go test, five-time chair test, Short Physical Performance Battery, and biomarkers in blood. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA will be used to analyze the differences between the two groups at each time point.

Discussion

This RCT will fill crucial evidence gaps by evaluating the first combined KT+ESWT+exercise protocol for sarcopenia. Our results will determine whether this novel strategy outperforms standard exercise therapy while expanding KT/ESWT indications beyond their current musculoskeletal uses.

### Cellular signaling pathways modulated by low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy [^116BXWHD]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (Li-ESWT) is a form of energy transfer that is of lower intensity (< 0.2 mJ/mm²) relative to traditional Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) used for management of urinary stones. At this intensity and at appropriate dosing energy transfer is thought to induce beneficial effects in human tissues. The proposed therapeutic mechanisms of action for Li-ESWT include neovascularization, tissue regeneration, and reduction of inflammation. These effects are thought to be mediated by enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Upregulation of chemoattractant factors and recruitment/activation of stem/progenitor cells may also play a role. Li-ESWT has been studied for management of musculoskeletal disease, ischemic cardiovascular disorders, Peyronie's Disease, and more recently erectile dysfunction (ED). The underlying mechanism of Li-ESWT for treatment of ED is incompletely understood. We summarize the current evidence basis by which Li-ESWT is thought to enhance penile hemodynamics with an intention of outlining the fundamental mechanisms by which this therapy may help manage ED.

### The midterm effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in the management of chronic calcific shoulder tendinitis [^117XS96C]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This systematic review explored the midterm effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in reducing pain and improving shoulder function. Calcified rotator cuff tendinitis is a common cause of chronic shoulder pain that leads to significant pain and functional limitations. ESWT is an alternative to surgery when conservative treatments such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, steroidal injections, and physiotherapy fail to relieve symptoms. It is hypothesised that ESWT is effective in the midterm for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic calcific tendinitis and that a dose-response relationship exists in the treatment parameters for effectiveness.

Materials and Methods

Articles were electronically searched from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE, SPORTSDiscus and PEDro using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials testing the midterm effectiveness of ESWT for chronic calcific tendonitis. Methodologic quality was assessed by PEDro (total score = 10). The strength of the evidence was reported using the National Health and Medical Research Council body of evidence framework.

Results

Six of the nine included studies scored 7 or more for methodologic quality. All studies had follow-up periods of at least 6 months. Common methodologic flaws were insufficient blinding of clinicians and assessors. There was consistent evidence of midterm effectiveness of ESWT in reducing pain and improving shoulder function for patients with chronic calcified tendinitis.

Discussion

ESWT is a potential alternative to surgery with good mid-term effectiveness and minimal side effects. This review noted several limitations with the current body of evidence. Studies were mainly from a few European countries involving medical doctors, with a lack of diverse perspectives and effectiveness evaluation from other health professionals who might use this treatment option for patients with chronic calcific tendinitis. Further, the different outcome measures used and inadequate reporting details in the included studies did not permit a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of this treatment. A lack of follow up period beyond one year in the studies also precluded conclusion to be made on the longer term effectiveness of ESWT.

Conclusion

Due to variable treatment parameters (eg dosage), this review was unable to provide clear guidance of the dose-effect of the midterm effectiveness of ESWT. Studies of better methodologic design using standardized treatment protocols and studies with longer follow-up are required.

### Efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy on pain and function in myofascial pain syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114KqFrk]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in reducing pain, improving functionality, joint range of motion, quality of life, fatigue, and health status self-perception in people with myofascial pain syndrome.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and SPORTDiscus were systematically searched for only randomized clinical trials published up to June 2, 2022. The main outcome variables were pain, as reported on the visual analog scale and pressure pain threshold, and functionality. A quantitative analysis was conducted using the inverse variance method and the random effects model.

Results

Twenty-seven studies were included (N = 595 participants in the extracorporeal shockwave therapy group). The effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy for relieving pain was superior for the extracorporeal shockwave therapy group compared with the control group on the visual analog scale (MD = -1.7 cm; 95% confidence interval = -2.2 to -1.1) and pressure pain threshold (mean difference = 1.1 kg/cm²; 95% confidence interval = 0.4 to 1.7) and functionality (standardized mean difference = -0.8; 95% confidence interval = -1.6 to -0.04) with high heterogeneity. However, no differences were found between extracorporeal shockwave therapy and other interventions as dry needling, exercises, infiltrations, and lasers interventions.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy is effective in relieving pain and improving functionality in patients with myofascial pain syndrome compared with control and ultrasound therapy.

### Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy for erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy: a review of preclinical studies [^113BWpAT]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2018). Low credibility.

Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (LI-ESWT) is a novel treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). Its ability to improve erectile function has been shown in patients with vasculogenic ED by many randomized-controlled trials against sham procedures. However, the role of LI-ESWT in ED caused by radical prostatectomy (RP) is still questionable because this type of ED was excluded from nearly all clinical studies; it has been investigated in only a few small single-arm trials. This review summarizes preclinical studies on mechanisms of action of LI-ESWT for ED and neurological diseases to explore the potential of this treatment for nerve-impaired ED after RP.

### A systematic review of extracorporeal shockwave therapy as a novel treatment for intermittent claudication [^112QvWDa]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is emerging as a potential new treatment option for a variety of clinical scenarios including promotion of wound healing and symptom control in end-stage ischemic heart disease. A number of small trials have investigated ESWT in the management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). A systematic review of the literature was performed investigating the efficacy and potential mechanism of action of ESWT for PAD.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE and PubMed databases in keeping with the standard reporting guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis group to identify any publications relating to the use of ESWT in PAD.

Results

Systematic literature review identified 5 studies in 4 articles investigating ESWT in the treatment of symptomatic PAD. Although participant numbers within the identified studies were small, significant improvements in pain-free walking distance and maximum walking distance were demonstrated. The mechanism of action is thought to be due to mechanotransduction and subsequent angiogenesis.

Conclusions

ESWT shows promise as a potentially efficacious novel treatment for symptomatic PAD. However, studies to date are small and record heterogeneous outcomes. Appropriately powered, randomized, sham-controlled data including objective clinical outcomes to comprehensively assess the efficacy of this novel treatment modality is still required before determining if ESWT should be brought into routine clinical practice.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy without local anesthesia for chronic lateral epicondylitis [^1143HGzR]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy without local anesthesia to treat chronic lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

One hundred and fourteen patients with a minimum six-month history of lateral epicondylitis that was unresponsive to conventional therapy were randomized into double-blind active treatment and placebo groups. The protocol consisted of three weekly treatments of either low-dose shock wave therapy without anesthetic or a sham treatment. Patients had a physical examination, including provocation testing and dynamometry, at one, four, eight, and twelve weeks and at six and twelve months after treatment. Radiographs, laboratory studies, and electrocardiograms were also evaluated prior to participation and at twelve weeks. A visual analog scale was used to evaluate pain, and an upper extremity functional scale was used to assess function. Crossover to active treatment was initiated for nonresponsive patients who had received the placebo and met the inclusion criteria after twelve weeks.

Results

A total of 108 of the 114 randomized patients completed all treatments and the twelve weeks of follow-up required by the protocol. Sixty-one patients completed one year of follow-up, whereas thirty-four patients crossed over to receive active treatment. A significant difference (p = 0.001) in pain reduction was observed at twelve weeks in the intent-to-treat cohort, with an improvement in the pain score of at least 50% seen in 61% (thirty-four) of the fifty-six patients in the active treatment group who were treated according to protocol compared with 29% (seventeen) of the fifty-eight subjects in the placebo group. This improvement persisted in those followed to one year. Functional activity scores, activity-specific evaluation, and the overall impression of the disease state all showed significant improvement as well (p < 0.05). Crossover patients also showed significant improvement after twelve weeks of active treatment, with 56% (nineteen of thirty-four) achieving an improvement in the pain score of at least 50% (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that low-dose shock wave therapy without anesthetic is a safe and effective treatment for chronic lateral epicondylitis.

### Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy is safe and effective in the treatment of chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis: results of a confirmatory randomized placebo-controlled multicenter study [^113q1Jvy]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for chronic plantar fasciitis that can be administered to outpatients without anesthesia but has not yet been evaluated in controlled trials.

Hypothesis

There is no difference in effectiveness between radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy and placebo in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.

Study Design

Randomized, controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Three interventions of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (0.16 mJ/mm²; 2000 impulses) compared with placebo were studied in 245 patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. Primary endpoints were changes in visual analog scale composite score from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up, overall success rates, and success rates of the single visual analog scale scores (heel pain at first steps in the morning, during daily activities, during standardized pressure force). Secondary endpoints were single changes in visual analog scale scores, success rates, Roles and Maudsley score, SF-36, and patients' and investigators' global judgment of effectiveness 12 weeks and 12 months after extracorporeal shock wave therapy.

Results

Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy proved significantly superior to placebo with a reduction of the visual analog scale composite score of 72.1% compared with 44.7% (P = 0.0220), and an overall success rate of 61.0% compared with 42.2% in the placebo group (P = 0.0020) at 12 weeks. Superiority was even more pronounced at 12 months, and all secondary outcome measures supported radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy to be significantly superior to placebo (P < .025, 1-sided). No relevant side effects were observed.

Conclusion

Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy significantly improves pain, function, and quality of life compared with placebo in patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis.

### Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy for peyroniès disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fPbkH]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has also been employed for urological indications since the mid-1990s. The conventional shock wave lithotriptors utilize higher energy densities (0.5–0.9 mJ/mm²) for treatment. The energy range examined in this review is 0.07–0.5 mJ/mm², which is not highly accurate and should be categorized as medium to low energy. However, the principal objective of this study is to differentiate it from high energy.

In the future, research on LI-ESWT should be based on both basic and clinical science. To comprehend the mechanism of LI-ESWT, extensive fundamental research is required. Several types of equipment are available on the market, each equipped with focused shock sources, including electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric generators. Different types of equipment require distinct treatment plans. More research is required to assess various devices. There is an urgent demand for well-designed, long-term, multicenter randomized controlled trials to assess the true potential and ultimate usage of such devices in Peyronie's disease patients.

### Shockwave lithotripsy-new concepts and optimizing treatment parameters [^115hrHux]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of kidney stone disease has changed dramatically over the past 30 years. This change is due in large part to the arrival of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). ESWL along with the advances in ureteroscopic and percutaneous techniques has led to the virtual extinction of open surgical treatments for kidney stone disease. Much research has gone into understanding how ESWL can be made more efficient and safe. This article discusses the parameters that can be used to optimize ESWL outcomes as well as the new concepts that are affecting the efficacy and efficiency of ESWL.

### Extracorporeal shockwave therapy for patellar tendinopathy: a review of the literature [^113shGqX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (EWST) has become a popular treatment for patellar tendinopathy. The purpose of this review was to study the effectiveness of ESWT treatment for patellar tendinopathy; to draft guidelines for an effective treatment protocol of ESWT treatment; and to identify topics for further research.

Methods

A computerised search of the Medline and Embase databases was conducted on 1 August 2007, to identify studies dealing with the effectiveness of ESWT for patellar tendinopathy.

Results

Seven articles describing the effectiveness of ESWT on patellar tendinopathy, all published after 2000, were included. These studies included a total of 283 patients (298 tendons), 204 of whom (215 tendons) were assigned to ESWT treatment. The treatment results were positive but most studies had methodological deficiencies, small numbers and/or short follow-up periods. Method of application and shockwave generation, energy level, number and frequency of treatments, use of (local) anaesthesia and method of localisation were variable.

Conclusion

ESWT seems to be a safe and promising treatment for patellar tendinopathy with a positive effect on pain and function. Based on current knowledge it is impossible to recommend a specific treatment protocol. Further basic and clinical research into the working mechanism and effectiveness of ESWT for patellar tendinopathy are necessary.

### Low-intensity shockwave therapy for erectile dysfunction: is the evidence strong enough? [^113CfLuq]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects ∼30% of all men above the age of 40 years and its prevalence steadily increases with age. Current nonsurgical treatment options, including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I), provide temporary relief but have failed to provide a permanent improvement of the condition. Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) is noninvasive and uses acoustic waves, which can pass through tissue and be focussed to target specific areas or organs to induce the desired effects. The use of Li-ESWT has previously been described in other disease contexts, such as ischaemic heart disease, bone fractures, and burns, in which it improves neoangiogenesis; similar principles seem to apply in the erectile tissue. The major potential advantage of the treatment, therefore, is the possibility to restore natural erectile function. Thus, Li-ESWT is the only currently marketed treatment for ED that might offer a cure, which is the most desired outcome for most men with ED. Li-ESWT has also been suggested to improve the effect of PDE5I in nonresponders, reducing the need for more invasive treatments. Several single-arm trials have shown benefit of Li-ESWT on patient-reported erectile function scores, but data from randomized trials are conflicting, and many questions remain to be answered before we can routinely offer this treatment to patients. Thus, the search for the true clinical value of Li-ESWT for ED represents a dynamic and continuing field of enquiry.

### Efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy, compared to corticosteroid injections, on pain, plantar fascia thickness and foot function in patients with plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tVDhZ]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of extracorporeal shock waves versus corticosteroids injections on pain, thickness of plantar fascia and foot function in patients with plantar fasciitis. Secondarily, to assess the efficacy of radial and focused extracorporeal shock waves and the most appropriated intensity (high, medium or low).

Data Sources

PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and PEDro, until April 2024, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Review Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of extracorporeal shock waves versus corticosteroids injections on pain intensity and sensitivity, thickness of plantar fascia and foot function in patients with plantar fasciitis. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using PEDro Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Pooled effect was calculated using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI).

Results

Sixteen studies involving 1121 patients, showing a mean of 6 points in PEDro scale, were included. At three months, extracorporeal shock waves were better than corticosteroids injections in reducing pain (SMD -0.6; 95%CI -1.1 to -0.11) and thickness of the plantar fascia (SMD -0.4; 95%CI -0.8 to -0.01) and increasing foot function (SMD 0.27; 95%CI 0.12–0.44). At six months, extracorporeal shock waves are more effective in reducing pain (SMD -0.81; 95%CI -1.6 to -0.06) and increasing foot function (SMD 0.67; 95%CI 0.45–0.89). Local pain and slight erythema were the most frequent adverse events.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock waves are a safe therapy, presenting more efficacy than corticosteroids injections in improving pain, thickness of plantar fascia and foot function at mid-term.

### Energy-based therapies for erectile dysfunction: current and future directions [^113nu3CU]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Energy-based therapies are novel treatments for erectile dysfunction that are thought to work by stimulation of tissue vasodilation, neoangiogenesis, and so forth. Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (Li-ESWT) is the energy-based therapy with the most robust evidence basis demonstrating efficacy and safety. Among this evidence, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating Li-ESWT have largely been focused on responders to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Many of these RCTs have limitations including short follow-up durations, inconsistent protocols, and small sample sizes. Until more diverse patient populations are studied and these limitations are addressed, the use of Li-ESWT should remain limited to IRB-approved clinical research trials.

### The effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in common lower limb conditions: a systematic review including quantification of patient-rated pain reduction [^113BsuFG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in treating Achilles tendinopathy (AT), greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), patellar tendinopathy (PT) and proximal hamstring tendinopathy (PHT).

Design

Systematic review.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised and non-randomised studies assessing ESWT in patients with AT, GTPS, MTSS, PT and PHT were included. Risk of bias and quality of studies were evaluated.

Results

Moderate-level evidence suggests (1) no difference between focused ESWT and placebo ESWT at short and mid-term in PT and (2) radial ESWT is superior to conservative treatment at short, mid and long term in PHT. Low-level evidence suggests that ESWT (1) is comparable to eccentric training, but superior to wait-and-see policy at 4 months in mid-portion AT; (2) is superior to eccentric training at 4 months in insertional AT; (3) less effective than corticosteroid injection at short term, but ESWT produced superior results at mid and long term in GTPS; (4) produced comparable results to control treatment at long term in GTPS; and (5) is superior to control conservative treatment at long term in PT. Regarding the rest of the results, there was only very low or no level of evidence. 13 studies showed high risk of bias largely due to methodology, blinding and reporting.

Conclusion

Low level of evidence suggests that ESWT may be effective for some lower limb conditions in all phases of the rehabilitation.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^112roE28]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for erectile dysfunction, more specifically with respect to extracorporeal shockwave therapy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to offer low-intensity shockwave therapy (with or without PDE5 inhibitors) in patients with mild vasculogenic ED or poor responders to PDE5 inhibitors, or as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed patients not wishing or not suitable for oral vasoactive therapy.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^112ahe1R]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for Peyronie's disease curvature or plaque — randomized designs reported no benefit, and the panel concluded ESWT does not appear to improve curvature or plaque in PD patients; ESWT, therefore, should not be used by clinicians for this purpose, with body of evidence strength Grade B.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^112jGwWZ]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for penile pain — Clinicians may offer extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) to improve penile pain. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade B). Across randomized designs, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores decreased with ESWT, including reductions from baseline value of 4 to post-treatment value of 1.5 versus placebo from baseline value of 4 to post-treatment value of 3 with 85% of ESWT patients reporting decreases compared to 48% of the placebo/sham group, from 5.5 at baseline to 0.46 at 24 weeks versus placebo from 5.2 at baseline to 2.7 at follow-up, and from 5.2 at baseline to 0.45 at 24 weeks versus ESWT + tadalafil from 4.9 at baseline to 0.43 at 24 weeks; the panel interpreted these data to mean that ESWT may reduce pain in PD patients. Adverse events were frequent, including localized petechial bleeding or bruising in from 50 to 90% of patients with most studies reporting rates of 50% or greater, urethral bleeding or transient hematuria in from 1.9% to 19% of patients with most studies reporting rates < 10%, and minor ecchymosis in from 3.6% to 16% of patients; severe adverse event pain was reported in 1.9% to 4.0% of patients.

### Updated recommendations on the therapeutic role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for Peyronie's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oXq6M]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Analysis of complications is also a part worth discussing, which is an important perspective to prove the safety of ESWT. The 4 RCTs all paid attention to the occurrence of complications, which is worthy of reference for subsequent research. "Bruises" is a clearly reported complication after treatment. In our study defined the occurrence of "bruises" as postoperative complications with the exclusion of minor abrasions of the skin and small bleeding points. There are differences in the intensity of shock waves applied in different studies, and in course settings, leading to differences in the negative effects of shock waves on patients. It is also important to note when conducting intervention designs that, although increasing the intensity and frequency of shock waves within a certain range is able to increase efficacy, too high doses of shock waves also cause irreversible damage to penile structures, increase the risk of complications, and impair physiological function of PD patients, which has also been demonstrated in animal trials. Fortunately, based on the analysis of the included studies, the complication rate is not significantly increased in the ESWT group compared with the control group, indicating that the application of low-dose shock waves can play a therapeutic role without causing serious complications.

### Is radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), sham-rESWT or a standardised exercise programme in combination with advice plus customised foot orthoses more effective than advice plus customised foot orthoses alone in the treatment of plantar fasciopathy? A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^114VWNmy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses

This RCT included a large sample of patients, unlike the small samples used in most studies included in previous systematic reviews. We compared the effectiveness of common treatments with placebo and an intervention including advice plus customised foot orthoses, which enhanced the study's relevance and external validity. The harms associated with the interventions were regarded as minor and only 13% (23 of 172) of the patients reported additional treatment during the trial at 6 months.

The sample size was based on an assumed mean difference in pain during activity of 2 on the NRS. Varying MIC values for pain has been reported. Increasing the sample size in order to detect smaller between group differences may lead to increased type I errors.

The study was completed at one hospital and the treatments was delivered by one highly experienced physiotherapist. In addition, most patients had long-term symptoms suggesting a more severe spectrum of the condition, typically representing a specialised care settingwhich limits generalisability. Customised orthoses are not routinely provided for patients with plantar fasciopathy and limits the applicability of the trial findings in a primary care setting.

The higher number of patients believing that they received real rESWT compared with sham-rESWT could be a result of patients' previous experience with rESWT or the lack of blinding of the physiotherapist. However, this appeared to not impact the study's result.

Comprehensive process evaluation was not performed in the present study and might have shed more light on the important components of the treatment arms as well as confounding environmental factors. Participating in a study conducted in a specialised care setting with multidisciplinary healthcare involvement or the natural course of the condition may have influenced the outcome. The present study was not powered for subgroup analyses, but explorative analyses of predictive factors for the total sample will be provided in a future manuscript.

### Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy is not more effective than placebo in the management of lateral epicondylitis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112qbrSL]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) on pain, function, and grip strength in the treatment of patients with lateral epicondylitis unresponsive to previous treatments.

Design

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in outpatient clinics in a medical faculty hospital. Fifty-six patients with lateral epicondylitis were randomized to rESWT (n = 28) or sham rESWT (n = 28) groups. Both the patients and the outcome assessing investigator were blinded to group assignment. The rESWT was administered to the painful epicondyle at the elbow with a total of 2000 pulses of 10 Hz frequency at a 1.8 bar of air pressure at each session at three once weekly sessions. Sham rESWT was applied without the contact of the applicator at the same area. Study patients were assessed at baseline and at 1 and 3 mos after treatment using a visual analog scale for pain and Roles and Maudsley scale and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation for pain and function. Grip strength of the affected extremity was also measured using a hand dynamometer.

Results

Both rESWT and sham rESWT groups showed a significant improvement in all outcome measures at posttreatment follow-up points. Favorable absolute and percentage changes in assessments at 1- and 3-mo posttreatment did not show any significant difference between groups.

Conclusions

The rESWT does not seem to be more effective either in reducing pain or improving function or grip strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis at least at 3 mos after treatment when compared with sham rESWT.

### High-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy as a treatment for insertional achilles tendinopathy [^1165XhHP]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Results of high-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy are not determined. It is unclear how local anesthesia alters the outcome of this procedure.

Hypothesis

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Local anesthesia field block adversely affects outcome.

Study Design

Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Thirty-five patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy were treated with 1 dose of high-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT group; 3000 shocks; 0.21 mJ/mm²; total energy flux density, 604 mJ/mm²), and 33 were treated with nonoperative therapy (control group). All extracorporeal shock wave therapy procedures were performed using a local anesthesia field block (LA subgroup, 12 patients) or a nonlocal anesthesia (NLA subgroup, 23 patients). Evaluation was by visual analog score and by Roles and Maudsley score.

Results

One month, 3 months, and 12 months after treatment, the mean visual analog score for the control and ESWT groups were 8.2 and 4.2 (P < .001), 7.2 and 2.9 (P < .001), and 7.0 and 2.8 (P < .001), respectively. Twelve months after treatment, the number of patients with successful Roles and Maudsley scores was statistically greater in the ESWT group compared with the control group (P > .0002), with 83% of ESWT group patients having a successful result, and the mean improvement in visual analog score for the LA subgroup was significantly less than that in the NLA subgroup (F = 16.77 vs F = 53.95, P < .001). The percentage of patients with successful Roles and Maudsley scores did not differ among the LA and NLA subgroups.

Conclusion

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Local field block anesthesia may decrease the effectiveness of this procedure.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^1122XHzu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Cancer rehabilitation has been shown to be a relevant means to accelerate return to work and improve the work ability and social participation of cancer survivors. In cancer rehabilitation, physical modalities such as exercise to improve muscular strength, endurance capacity, sensorimotor functions, and flexibility are of a very high relevance. Nevertheless, some musculoskeletal conditions, such as plantar fasciitis or calcaneal spurs, calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder, and tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, immobilize the patient and prohibit active participation in exercise, due to severe bodily pain. Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the bodily pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in musculoskeletal disorders is a conservative treatment modality, which has been developed over the last 25 years, and has been shown to be both very effective and time- and cost-efficient. Nevertheless, there are several historical (and "traditional") paradigms which have changed during this time period; one of them was the fact that, in the past, cancer represented a contraindication for the use of ESWT.

The International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) (the managing board, the advisory board and the Senators of the ISMST) issued clinical recommendations for the use of therapeutic shock waves in clinical practice in October 2016.

These recommendations were assembled based on an assessment of the current published scientific and clinical information and accepted approaches to treatment, and were intended to aid the clinician in the use of ESWT. In particular, the guidelines were intended to clarify the indications and contraindications for treatment. Malignant tumors, metastasis, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma in the treatment area have to be seen as contraindications for treatment with radial and focused shock waves with low and high energy. Cancer itself, in the form of the underlying disease, is not a contraindication for ESWT. Active leukemia and leukemic phase of lymphoma (not in remission) are, however, contraindications for the use of ESWT. A minimum level of standard examinations before performing ESWT is necessary, including clinical examination, radiological imaging, and neurological and/or laboratory diagnostic tests.

### Comparison of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy and local corticosteroid injection effectiveness in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome: a randomized controlled study [^111NoniD]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy and local corticosteroid injection on pain, function, and nerve conduction studies in the treatment of idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.

Design

A total of 72 patients who were diagnosed as having carpal tunnel syndrome were included in the study. The radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy group received radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy, the local corticosteroid injection group received local corticosteroid injection, and the control group only used a resting hand splint. The patients were evaluated using a Visual Analog Scale-pain, a Visual Analog Scale-numbness, the Boston Symptom Severity Scale, the Boston Functional Status Scale, and handgrip strength tests before treatment 1 and 12 wks after the treatment.

Results

Both clinical and nerve conduction study parameters improved with all three groups, and this effect continued at the 12th-week follow-up of the patients. The Visual Analog Scale-pain, Visual Analog Scale-numbness, Boston Symptom Severity Scale, and Boston Functional Status Scale scores in the first week after the treatment, as well as Visual Analog Scale-pain and Boston Functional Status Scale scores in the 12th week after the treatment, were significantly lower in the local corticosteroid injection group compared with the other two groups.

Conclusions

Our study revealed the success of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy, splint, and local corticosteroid injection, but symptom relief was greater in the first week and 12th week with local corticosteroid injection.

### Insights into the pathophysiology of cellulite: a review [^116df3H9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) uses electrical energy to create mechanical disruption of targeted tissues without cytolysis, resulting in extracellular healing responses that create tissue regeneration changes such as collagen remodeling and improvement of local blood circulation from neovascularization. – Shock waves can pass through tissue and confine effects to areas of differing densities, with no substantial effect on the surrounding tissue. Radial systems produce energy in a more dispersed form, creating more diffuse and superficial tissue effects that can nonetheless penetrate up to 25 mm, thus reaching subcutaneous fat and connective tissue structures. Focused waves are typically higher energy and penetrate more deeply into tissue. The mechanism of ESWT efficacy has not been completely elucidated, but studies have indicated that potential mechanisms include induction of the formation and remodeling of collagen, neoelastin formation, and skin laxity improvement.– Because of effects on collagen and improvement in skin characteristics, ESWT has been proposed as a treatment for cellulite by targeting the dermis, adipose, and septae (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table S1). –,

Clinical trials have evaluated the use of acoustic wave therapy (AWT)and ESWT, to target the dermis. A randomized controlled trial of 53 women treated with focused ESWT on the buttocks and thighs for 6 sessions reported a significant 2.5-point improvement (p = .001) in photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CSS) score compared with sham control at 12 weeks post-treatment. Of note, additional assessments of skin improvement, such as change in the number (p = .01) and depth (p = .001) of depressions in the treatment group, were significantly reduced versus sham control, but skin elasticity was similar between the groups. A second randomized controlled trial of 16 women treated with radial AWT on the thighs and buttocks for 7 sessions demonstrated statistical significance at 1 and 3 months post-treatment in the overall results (p = .01) of skin waviness, surface, and volume of depressions and elevations assessed by 3-dimensional (3-D) imaging. Using 2-dimensional (2-D) photographs, 4 investigators reported significant improvement in cellulite severity using the CSS. A third randomized controlled clinical trial of 14 women treated unilaterally with radial ESWT on the posterior thigh and buttock for 8 sessions reported a mean improvement from baseline of 0.82 cellulite grades at 4 weeks.

### Use of extracorporeal shockwave therapies for athletes and physically active individuals: a systematic review [^113meAMJ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and investigate outcomes following the use of ESWT for athletes and physically active individuals.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and searched four databases: PubMed (NLM), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (EBSCO) and Web of Science (Clarivate).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Included studies were randomised controlled trials, cohort and case-control studies, cases series and reports that evaluated outcomes following ESWT for athletes, physically active individuals and occupational groups requiring regular physical activity such as military cadets.

Results

56 studies with 1874 athletes or physically active individuals were included. Using the Oxford level of evidence rating, included studies were 18 level I (32.1%), 3 level II (5.4%), 10 level III (17.9%), 13 level IV (23.2%) and 12 level V (21.4%). Based on the level I studies, ESWT may be effective alone in plantar fasciitis, lateral epicondylitis and proximal hamstring tendinopathy and as an adjunct to exercise treatment in medial tibial stress syndrome and osteitis pubis in athletes or physically active individuals. In most studies, athletes were allowed to continue activities and training and tolerated ESWT with minimal side effects.

Conclusion

ESWT may offer an efficacious treatment alone or as an adjunct to concurrent exercise therapy in selected sports-related injuries and without major adverse events. Further high-level research is needed to better define the role and clinical outcomes of ESWT.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for rotator cuff disorders, more specifically with respect to extracorporeal shockwave therapy, APTA 2022 guidelines recommend to offer high- or low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy to reduce pain and disability and decrease calcific deposit size in patients with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy. Prefer high-energy intensity with > 0.20 mJ/mm² due to greater efficacy in reducing pain and disability.

### Efficacy of extracorporal shock wave therapy in patient with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome… [^111JgDVp]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

As discussed earlier, blood flow reduction, ischemia and disorders in endothelium of vessels may cause pain in these patients and methods to improve blow flow may help. One of these methods is extracorporeal shockwave therapy which is typically used for tendonitis, acceleration in bone reunion and wound healing, improvement in muscle movements through a reduction in passive muscular tonus, increasing muscular range of motion after cerebrovascular accident, treatment of Peyronie's disease and erectile dysfunction. The use of ESWT for the treatment of CP/CPPS has been evaluated in a few studies. In a double-blind randomized control trial, Zimmermann et al placed 60 patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome from chronic non-bacterial prostatitis into two groups and treated one of them in 4 sessions with a frequency of 3000 per session. The treatment group showed superior results in terms of symptom improvement.

In another study, Zimmermann et al followed 34 patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, after one, four and twelve weeks post ESWT in terms of quality of life and pain reduction. They showed that this method is useful and without any complications. Considering the promising results of the cited articles along with the paucity of data in this regard we decided to perform a double-blind sham-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of ESWT in CP/CPPS. After briefing the patients about the method and obtaining written consent from, he will be randomly allocated into either the treatment or control group. In the first group patients will be treated by ESWT once a week for 4 weeks. Patients are considered by doctor for NIH index according to NIH-CPSI scale at the beginning and end of study. |12 months|.

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^111pq7ir]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Tendinopathy poses a substantial socioeconomic burden globally comprising 30% of all general practice musculoskeletal consultations. Its aetiology is multifactorial and its exact pathophysiology remains uncertain; however, it appears to result from an imbalance between the protective/regenerative changes and the pathological responses that result from tendon overuse. The the most common exacerbating factor is thought to be overuse (particularly during sporting activities) causing repetitive microtrauma and consequent degeneration due to failure of the healing process. The net result is tendon degeneration, weakness, tearing, and pain.

As the research on the management of tendinopathy is constantly increasing, new treatment modalities continuously emerge making decisions difficult for the treating healthcare professionals. In the absence of complete tendon tears, loading remains the mainstay of treatment and it is recommended as first line for all tendinopathies for 6 months. The choice of second-line treatment, which ranges from non-invasive modalities such as extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), glyceryl trinitrate patchesand injection therapies to invasive surgery remains controversial.

Surgery, which may be open or arthroscopic, is usually reserved for patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative management and complete tendon tears; however, its effectiveness has been repeatedly questioned. While expert opinion, guidelinesand systematic reviewshave attempted to provide guidance to the practising clinician on when surgery may be an appropriate next step the actual evidence from studies comparing surgical and non-surgical treatments on tendinopathies remains limited, and therefore definitive conclusions about the benefits and ideal timing of surgical intervention are yet to be reached.

Studies assessing the effectiveness of surgery in orthopaedics have had bias due to the inability for blinding. In recent years, studies have compared some orthopaedic operations (including surgery for tendinopathy) with sham surgeryin a double-blinded manner to mirror the placebo effect of surgery. In those studies, there were no differences between control and intervention groups.

The aim of this systematic review was to consider evidence that derives from studies assessing the effectiveness of surgery for tendinopathy in the general population. This includes comparisons of surgery (open or arthroscopic) with either non-surgical treatment modalities, sham surgery or no treatment in all tendinopathies with respect to the following outcome measures: pain, function, range of movement (ROM), force/strength, patient satisfaction, treatment success, quality of life (QoL) and complications.

### High-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy as a treatment for chronic noninsertional achilles tendinopathy [^111xf9fv]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

High-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy. The results of high-energy shock wave therapy for chronic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy have not been determined.

Hypothesis

Shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy.

Study Design

Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Thirty-four patients with chronic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy were treated with a single dose of high-energy shock wave therapy (shock wave therapy group; 3000 shocks; 0.21 mJ/mm(2); total energy flux density, 604 mJ/mm(2)). Thirty-four patients with chronic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy were treated not with shock wave therapy but with additional forms of nonoperative therapy (control group). All shock wave therapy procedures were performed using regional anesthesia. Evaluation was by change in visual analog score and by Roles and Maudsley score.

Results

One month, 3 months, and 12 months after treatment, the mean visual analog scores for the control and shock wave therapy groups were 8.4 and 4.4 (P < .001), 6.5 and 2.9 (P < .001), and 5.6 and 2.2 (P < .001), respectively. At final follow-up, the number of excellent, good, fair, and poor results for the shock wave therapy and control groups were 12 and 0 (P < .001), 17 and 9 (P < .001), 5 and 17 (P < .001), and 0 and 8 (P < .001), respectively. A chi(2) analysis revealed that the percentage of patients with excellent ("1") or good ("2") Roles and Maudsley scores, that is, successful results, 12 months after treatment was statistically greater in the shock wave therapy group than in the control group (P < .001).

Conclusion

Shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for chronic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy.

### Ultrasound-guided extracorporeal shock wave therapy for plantar fasciitis: a randomized controlled trial [^115Asss4]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is increasingly used for plantar fasciitis, but limited evidence supports its use.

Objective

To determine whether ultrasound-guided ESWT reduces pain and improves function in patients with plantar fasciitis.

Design

Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted between April 1999 and June 2001.

Setting

Participants were recruited from the community-based referring physicians (primary care physicians, rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and sports physicians) of a radiology group in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

We screened 178 patients and enrolled 166; 160 completed the 15-week protocol. Entry criteria included age at least 18 years with plantar fasciitis, defined as heel pain maximal over the plantar aspect of the foot of at least 6 weeks' duration, and an ultrasound-confirmed lesion, defined as thickening of the origin of the plantar fascia of at least 4 mm, hypoechogenicity, and alterations in the normal fibrillary pattern.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ultrasound-guided ESWT given weekly for 3 weeks to a total dose of at least 1000 mJ/mm² (n = 81), or identical placebo to a total dose of 6.0 mJ/mm² (n = 85).

Main Outcome Measures

Overall, morning, and activity pain, measured on a visual analog scale; Maryland Foot Score; walking ability; Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) score; and Problem Elicitation Technique score, measured at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment completion.

Results

At 6 and 12 weeks, there were significant improvements in overall pain in both the active group and placebo group (mean [SD] improvement, 18.1 [30.6] and 19.8 [33.7] at 6 weeks [P = 0.74 for between-group difference], and 26.3 [34.8] and 25.7 [34.9] at 12 weeks [P = 0.99], respectively). Similar improvements in both groups were also observed for morning and activity pain, walking ability, Maryland Foot Score, Problem Elicitation Technique, and SF-36. There were no statistically significant differences in the degree of improvement between treatment groups for any measured outcomes.

Conclusion

We found no evidence to support a beneficial effect on pain, function, and quality of life of ultrasound-guided ESWT over placebo in patients with ultrasound-proven plantar fasciitis 6 and 12 weeks following treatment.

### A systematic review of shockwave therapies in soft tissue conditions: focusing on the evidence [^116j2ZNw]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

'Shock wave' therapies are now extensively used in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. This systematic review summarises the evidence base for the use of these modalities.

Methods

A thorough search of the literature was performed to identify studies of adequate quality to assess the evidence base for shockwave therapies on pain in specific soft tissue injuries. Both focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (F-ESWT) and radial pulse therapy (RPT) were examined.

Results

23 appropriate studies were identified. There is evidence for the benefit of F-ESWT and of RPT in a number of soft tissue musculoskeletal conditions, and evidence that both treatment modalities are safe. There is evidence that F-ESWT is effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis, calcific tendinitis, and that RPT is effective in plantar fasciitis. Where benefit is seen in F-ESWT, it appears to be dose dependent, with greater success seen with higher dose regimes. There is low level evidence for lack of benefit of low-dose F-ESWT and RPT in non-calcific rotator cuff disease and mixed evidence in lateral epicondylitis.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy role in the treatment of burn patients. A systematic literature review [^1143epzg]. Burns (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), first described in the eighties for the treatment of urolithiasis, has also been applied in other fields such as orthopaedics and chronic wound care. Recently it has also been used in the treatment of burns and its sequelae since several studies suggest it could be an important tool in the conservative management of these conditions. The aim of this article is to review the literature for published evidence on the use of ESWT for the treatment of acute burn patients and its sequelae and to elaborate a brief report on the current state of the matter.

Material and Methods

We carried on a search on PUBMED database and Cochrane database with the following terms: ('burns' [title/abstract] OR 'burn' [title/abstract]) AND "shock wave" ([title/abstract]). For an optimal reporting of the studies found we followed the PRISMA statement.

Results

This search found 34 articles from which only 15 were actually related to the use of ESWT in burn patients. From these 15 articles, 7 involved the use of ESWT in the treatment of acute burns, 6 related to its application in post-burn scars, 1 in the treatment of heterotopic ossification and 1 was about the use of ESWT in skin-graft donor site. Except for the latter, all of them were carefully reviewed.

Conclusion

Scientific evidence on the use of ESWT for the treatment of burn patients is weak due to the paucity of studies and their low quality. However, ESWT seems to be a promising tool in this field and therefore more high-quality trials should be conducted.

### Is radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), sham-rESWT or a standardised exercise programme in combination with advice plus customised foot orthoses more effective than advice plus customised foot orthoses alone in the treatment of plantar fasciopathy? A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^111zfWyB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

rESWT/sham rESWT

The rESWT and sham-rESWT treatments were administered by the physiotherapist once a week for a total of three treatments, which is in line with previously suggested treatment protocols for plantar fasciopathy. The sham-rESWT was administered in the exact same way as the real rESWT, with the patient lying in a prone position (online supplemental appendix 1). Details of the rESWT and sham-rESWT treatments are reported in the study's protocol (online supplemental file 2).

High-load exercise programme

The exercise programme administered to the patients allocated to the exercise group included two exercises: unilateral heel raises and unilateral leg squats. Patients in this group were instructed to perform the exercises three times a week for 12 weeks. The heel raise exercise was performed as in the study by Rathleff et al using a rolled-up towel or similar underneath the toes standing on a stairway or similar locationand the leg squad was performed the same way but standing on the floor. The programme was similarly as reported by Kongsgaard et al slowly progressing throughout the period, starting with 12 repetition maximum (RM) in week 1–3, progressing to 6 RM in week 9–12. We used three sets per exercise. The details of the programme are described in the protocol (online supplemental file 2). Each patient participated in a total of eight sessions supervised by a physiotherapist at the outpatient clinic. To increase motivation, self-management and adherence, the patients received a thorough explanation and clear demonstration of the exercises as well as a written manual for use at home. They were informed of common side effects, such as muscle soreness and transient pain. Any barriers to execution were evaluated and adjustments were provided (online supplemental appendix 1). Patients were encouraged to record their repetitions, sets, weight load and number of training sessions, which the physiotherapist monitored to ensure progression (online supplemental appendix 1).

Outcome measures

Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Patients attended baseline, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups at the outpatient clinic. For the 3-month follow-up, a letter containing the outcome measures was sent to the patients to complete and return.

### Recommendations for use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in sports medicine: an international modified Delphi study [^114rPiHg]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

While extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may be an efficacious adjunctive treatment option for musculoskeletal injuries, current research is limited by significant heterogeneity within treatment protocols. This study aims to establish international expert consensus recommendations on ESWT terminology, parameters, procedural considerations, contraindications and side effects in the application of ESWT to sports injuries.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed on the use of ESWT for musculoskeletal and sports medicine injuries to identify potential panellists, followed by the development of a steering committee-led questionnaire. A three-stage, modified Delphi questionnaire was provided to a panel of 41 international clinical and research experts across 13 countries. Panellists had the opportunity to suggest edits to existing statements or recommend additional statements in Round 1. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement.

Results

All 41 panellists completed Rounds 1, 2 and 3. Consensus was reached on 69/118 statements (58.5%), including recommendations on terminology and fundamental concepts, indications for use, procedural aspects for tendinopathy and bone pathologies, treatment correlations with imaging, periprocedural and postprocedural considerations, absolute and relative contraindications and potential side effects. Of the 49 statements that did not reach consensus, 17/49 (34.7%) were related to procedural aspects of bone pathology.

Conclusion

This international panel presents recommendations on ESWT terminology, indications and treatment considerations to guide ESWT use and decision-making by sports medicine clinicians. While our panel supported the use of ESWT in the treatment of bone pathologies, certain procedural aspects of ESWT specific to these injuries did not reach consensus and require further investigation.

### Which method is more effective in treatment of calcific tendinitis in the shoulder? Prospective randomized comparison between ultrasound-guided needling and extracorporeal shock wave therapy [^115LMVig]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Ultrasound (US)-guided needling with subacromial corticosteroid injection is more effective than extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for function restoration and pain relief in patients with calcific tendinitis of the shoulder.

Methods

Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All patients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded before the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last follow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by radiography.

Results

The average follow-up period was 23.0 months. At last follow-up, the mean size of the deposits was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.001); it decreased to 0.5 mm from 14.8 mm in the US needling group and to 5.6 mm from 11.0 mm in the ESWT group. There were also significant improvements in clinical outcomes in both groups after treatment (P < .05). At 1-year follow-up, the US needling group had significantly better scores than the ESWT group with regard to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons assessment (90.3 and 74.6, respectively; P = 0.001), Simple Shoulder Test (83.3 and 70.8, respectively; P = 0.015), and visual analog scale for pain (1.4 and 3.3, respectively; P = 0.003). The initial calcium deposit sizes and clinical outcomes were weakly correlated in both groups (P > .05).

Conclusion

Both treatment modalities for calcific tendinitis improved clinical outcomes and eliminated calcium deposits. US-guided needling treatment, however, was more effective in function restoration and pain relief in the short term.

### Does shockwave therapy lead to better pain and function than sham over 12 weeks in people with insertional achilles tendinopathy? A randomised controlled trial [^111eCCDs]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse condition characterized by activity-related pain, disability, swelling and local tissue pathology. Achilles tendinopathy can severely reduce physical capacity, including walking and runningand accounts for up to 9% of all running injuries. There are two related variants – midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy has been reported to be challenging to manage compared to midportion Achilles tendinopathy. This may be because of poor blood supply to the tendon insertionand compression of the tendon against the bone that occurs at this site.

Although exercise is the recommended first-line treatment for Achilles tendinopathyup to 44% (in a sedentary population) and 75% (using undefined exercise) of people may not respond to this intervention. A common adjunct therapy for insertional Achilles tendinopathy is radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (rESWT). Radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy involves high-frequency pressure waves delivered to the tendon. Despite being commonly used clinically, evidence for radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy among people with insertional Achilles tendinopathy is not certain. Only one adequately powered study has investigated whether radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy is superior to sham when added to exercise. Mansur et al.utilised an eccentric training program that involves 90 repetitions (45 with the knee bent and 45 with the knee straight). There were no between-group differences for the primary composite pain and function outcome at any time point up to 24 weeks. However, the absence of findings may be explained by all participants being asked to stop running and sports activities for 8 weeks regardless of pain levels, which is not currently recommended by the clinical practice guidelines. Considering the widespread use of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy in clinical practice and the importance of education, it is important to re-evaluate its efficacy compared to placebo in the current context of recommended care.

The primary aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy or sham in combination with recommended exercise and education on pain and function outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks (primary endpoint) among people with insertional Achilles tendinopathy. The secondary aim was to investigate the efficacy of the radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy or sham at the same timepoints on overall pain, physical activity, psychological (kinesiophobia, catastrophising, pain self-efficacy) and health-related quality of life outcomes.
