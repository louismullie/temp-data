## Question

Does benadryl lower blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Benadryl (diphenhydramine) lowers blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of diphenhydramine and whether it has any direct hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and safety communications say about blood pressure effects. Next, I will check for any clinical studies that measured blood pressure changes with diphenhydramine. After that, I should consider indirect or contextual effects, like sedation, orthostatic hypotension, or overdose scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and practical guidance, making sure I distinguish therapeutic dosing from overdose situations.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine with prominent H1 blockade and anticholinergic activity; it is sedating and can reduce salivation, but it is not classified as an antihypertensive and does not directly vasodilate or otherwise lower systemic vascular resistance in a clinically meaningful way at therapeutic doses, which already makes me cautious about assuming any BP-lowering effect [^c146be45].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory sources. The FDA's consumer and professional safety communications about diphenhydramine emphasize risks like seizures, arrhythmias, and death with overdose, but they do not list blood pressure lowering as a labeled or expected effect at therapeutic doses, which supports the idea that routine use is not associated with clinically significant BP reduction [^5ddf6c02] [^bab44287].

> I need to check for direct clinical evidence. A controlled study in healthy volunteers comparing diphenhydramine 75 mg with modafinil and placebo measured blood pressure and found diphenhydramine reduced salivation and caused sedation, but did not demonstrate a blood pressure–lowering effect; in fact, modafinil increased systolic BP, underscoring that diphenhydramine's autonomic profile is not hypotensive in that context [^c146be45].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider indirect or situational effects. Sedation and somnolence can impair autonomic responses, and in susceptible individuals, orthostatic symptoms may occur, but this is not the same as a direct pharmacologic BP-lowering effect; importantly, when hypotension is discussed in diphenhydramine-related contexts, it is typically in overdose or in the setting of treating extrapyramidal reactions from antipsychotics, where hypotension is part of the toxidrome or treatment scenario rather than a therapeutic effect of diphenhydramine itself [^247ea6dc] [^8ecec0f5].

> Let me reconsider the overdose angle. In toxic ingestions, diphenhydramine can cause wide-complex tachycardias, seizures, and hemodynamic instability; management focuses on supportive care and sodium bicarbonate for sodium-channel blockade, not on treating "hypotension" from the antihistamine itself, which reinforces that any BP changes in overdose are nonspecific and often secondary to cardiac toxicity rather than a predictable hypotensive pharmacodynamic effect [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether any guideline or review lists diphenhydramine as an agent that lowers blood pressure. I find no hypertension guideline or systematic review of antihypertensives that includes diphenhydramine, which aligns with the conclusion that it lacks clinically meaningful antihypertensive properties at therapeutic doses [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. At therapeutic doses, Benadryl (diphenhydramine) does not lower blood pressure in a clinically significant or predictable way; any observed drops are more likely due to indirect effects like sedation-related orthostatic symptoms, co-administered drugs, or underlying medical conditions rather than a direct antihypertensive action of diphenhydramine itself [^c146be45] [^5ddf6c02].

> But wait, what if someone is using it for sleep and feels dizzy when standing? Could that mimic a BP effect? Yes, sedation and anticholinergic effects can blunt autonomic reflexes and contribute to orthostatic intolerance in some patients, so I should counsel on slow positional changes and review other medications that truly lower BP or cause orthostasis, while clarifying that diphenhydramine is not an appropriate therapy for hypertension management [^c146be45].

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) **does not meaningfully lower blood pressure** at therapeutic doses. While it can cause sedation and dizziness that may worsen orthostatic hypotension, especially in older adults or when combined with other sedatives, it is **not an antihypertensive** and should not be used to treat high blood pressure. In overdose, diphenhydramine can cause severe cardiovascular effects, including hypotension, but this is a toxicologic emergency and not a therapeutic effect [^5ddf6c02].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to blood pressure

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that **blocks H1 receptors** and has significant anticholinergic activity. These effects explain its sedation, dry mouth, and urinary retention, but they do not translate into clinically meaningful blood pressure reduction. Unlike antihypertensives, diphenhydramine does not directly vasodilate, inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, or block alpha/beta-adrenergic receptors.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding blood pressure effects

### Therapeutic doses

At therapeutic doses, diphenhydramine **does not meaningfully lower blood pressure**. A controlled study in healthy volunteers showed no significant blood pressure reduction with 75 mg, though it did cause sedation and reduced salivation, reflecting anticholinergic effects [^c146be45]. The FDA labeling lists dizziness and drowsiness as common side effects but does not identify hypotension as a typical adverse effect at recommended doses [^notfound].

---

### Overdose scenarios

In overdose, diphenhydramine can cause **severe cardiovascular toxicity**, including hypotension, arrhythmias, and shock; these effects reflect sodium-channel blockade and CNS depression rather than a therapeutic antihypertensive action [^notfound]. The FDA has warned about serious cardiac complications with high doses, underscoring that any blood pressure drop in overdose is a toxicologic emergency, not a desired effect [^5ddf6c02].

---

## Factors influencing blood pressure response to Benadryl

Several factors can modulate whether diphenhydramine produces hypotension-like symptoms:

- **Age**: Older adults are more prone to orthostatic hypotension and anticholinergic effects, increasing the risk of dizziness and falls.
- **Comorbidities**: Autonomic dysfunction, dehydration, or cardiovascular disease heighten susceptibility to orthostatic symptoms.
- **Drug interactions**: Sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and alcohol can amplify sedation and orthostatic intolerance.
- **Dosage**: Higher doses increase the risk of hypotension and arrhythmias, particularly in overdose [^5ddf6c02].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current hypertension guidelines **do not recommend diphenhydramine** for blood pressure management. It is not included in any guideline as an antihypertensive agent, and its use should be limited to approved indications such as allergy symptoms, motion sickness, and insomnia.

---

## Comparison with antihistamines and blood pressure effects

Among antihistamines, **second-generation agents** (e.g. loratadine, cetirizine) are preferred in patients with cardiovascular risk because they are less sedating and anticholinergic, and thus less likely to worsen orthostatic symptoms. None of the antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, are used to lower blood pressure.

---

## Clinical implications and precautions

Clinicians should be aware that diphenhydramine can **worsen orthostatic symptoms**, especially in older adults or those on multiple sedatives. Patients with autonomic neuropathy, volume depletion, or on antihypertensives should use caution. If hypotension occurs, assess for other causes and consider alternatives with less anticholinergic burden.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) **does not meaningfully lower blood pressure** at therapeutic doses. While it can cause sedation and dizziness that may mimic or worsen orthostatic hypotension, it is not an antihypertensive and should not be used to treat hypertension. In overdose, it can cause severe hypotension and arrhythmias, which require urgent care. Clinicians should counsel patients with cardiovascular risk to use caution and consider second-generation antihistamines when appropriate.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Hypertension

Adult Patients

In single-dose studies, benazepril HCl lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved between 2 and 4 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single-dose persisted for 24 hours. In multiple-dose studies, once-daily doses of between 20 mg and 80 mg decreased seated pressure 24 hours after dosing by about 6 to 12 mmHg systolic and 4 to 7 mmHg diastolic. The trough values represent reductions of about 50% of that seen at peak.

Four dose-response studies using once-daily dosing were conducted in 470 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients not using diuretics. The minimal effective once-daily dose of benazepril HCl was 10 mg; but further falls in blood pressure, especially at morning trough, were seen with higher doses in the studied dosing range (10 to 80 mg). In studies comparing the same daily dose of benazepril HCl given as a single morning dose or as a twice-daily dose, blood pressure reductions at the time of morning trough blood levels were greater with the divided regimen.

The antihypertensive effects of benazepril HCl were not appreciably different in patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.

In normal human volunteers, single-doses of benazepril caused an increase in renal blood flow but had no effect on glomerular filtration rate.

Use of benazepril HCl in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood-pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. By blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of benazepril HCl tends to reduce the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.

Pediatric Patients

In a clinical study of 107 pediatric patients, 7 to 16 years of age, with either systolic or diastolic pressure above the 95th percentile, patients were given 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg then titrated up to 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 40 mg once daily. After four weeks of treatment, the 85 patients whose blood pressure was reduced on therapy were then randomized to either placebo or benazepril and were followed up for an additional two weeks. At the end of two weeks, blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) in children withdrawn to placebo rose by 4 to 6 mm Hg more than in children on benazepril. No dose-response was observed.

### Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^c782a711]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypotension

Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, benazepril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide.

Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of benazepril or diuretic is increased.

If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablet treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.

Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide.

In a small study of hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with benazepril was associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of benazepril therapy, concomitant diuretic therapy, or both.

OVERDOSAGE

(See also ADVERSE REACTIONS .)

SYMPTOMS — Primarily involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism producing some of the dystonic reactions described above.

Symptoms of central nervous system depression to the point of somnolence or coma. Agitation and restlessness may also occur. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus.

TREATMENT — It is important to determine other medications taken by the patient since multiple-dose therapy is common in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to induce emesis because a dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop that could result in aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates or Benadryl. See prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing respiratory depression.

If administration of a stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended.

Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g., picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.

If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory shock should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor, Levophed and Neo-Synephrine are most suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine derivatives may reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause further lowering of blood pressure.

Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are not dialyzable.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Benazepril HCl has been evaluated for safety in over 6,000 patients with hypertension; over 700 of these patients were treated for at least one year. The overall incidence of reported adverse events was similar in benazepril HCl and placebo patients.

The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relation between side effects and age, duration of therapy, or total dosage within the range of 2 mg to 80 mg.

Discontinuation of therapy because of a side effect was required in approximately 5% of U.S. patients treated with benazepril HCl and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation were headache (0.6%) and cough (0.5%).

Adverse reactions seen in at least 1% greater frequency in patients treated with benazepril HCl than placebo were headache (6% vs. 4%), dizziness (4% vs. 2%), somnolence (2% vs. 0%) and postural dizziness (2% vs. 0%).

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19. 1 million participants [^a1519c14]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The estimated decrease in blood pressure in high-income countries in our analysis is consistent with findings of country studies and the MONICA Project. Fewer studies have analysed blood pressure trends in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. The available studies suggest reductions in blood pressure in central and possibly eastern Europe, the Middle East and north Africa, and Latin America, and increases in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and possibly in east and southeast Asia.

We also found that the prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in some regions where mean blood pressure did not change, and remained unchanged where the mean increased. Some other studies, have also found a larger decrease in the upper tail of blood pressure distribution than in its mean. In the MONICA Project, the upper percentiles of blood pressure distribution decreased more than the mean in some communities but not in others. Although the changing shape of the distribution is partly due to antihypertensive drugs, it has also occurred in younger adult ages when medication use is uncommon. To investigate the drivers of the changing distribution would require historical data on multiple determinants of blood pressure throughout the life course. Finally, our finding of a higher mean blood pressure in men than in women, especially in premenopause ages, is consistent with previous studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^93fdd9dc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (eg, counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^153060cd]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope pathophysiology and thresholds emphasize that the basis for syncope is a fall in systemic blood pressure with decreased global cerebral blood flow, and that a sudden cessation of cerebral blood flow for as short as 6–8 s is sufficient to cause complete loss of consciousness; experience from tilt testing showed that a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 60 mmHg or lower is associated with syncope. Systemic blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance, and a fall in either can cause syncope, with classification centered on low BP/global cerebral hypoperfusion at the centre, adjacent to low or inadequate peripheral resistance and low cardiac output; low resistance can result from inappropriate reflex activity causing vasodilation and bradycardia manifesting as vasodepressor, mixed, or cardioinhibitory reflex syncope.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Hypertension

TENORMIN is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^c1ba517b]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

The effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in reducing the risk of CHD events and stroke can therefore be estimated according to the reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure (or the average of the two), from the regression slope, S, and the decrease in blood pressure, d, from the above equations. As an example, the effect of three drugs at half standard dose in preventing stroke in people aged 60–69 with a pretreatment systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg systolic is estimated as: decrease in systolic blood pressure = [19.9+(3×0.078×(180−150))] = 26.9 mm Hg, and relative risk of stroke = 0.43¹⋅³⁴⁵ = 0.32 (a 68% decrease).

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^f90f9e30]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking JALYN?

Avoid driving, operating machinery, or other dangerous activities when starting treatment with JALYN until you know how JALYN affects you. JALYN can cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure, especially at the start of treatment. A sudden drop in blood pressure may cause you to faint, feel dizzy or lightheaded.
You should not donate blood while taking JALYN or for 6 months after you have stopped JALYN. This is important to prevent pregnant females from receiving JALYN through blood transfusions.

What are the possible side effects of JALYN?

JALYN may cause serious side effects including:

Decreased blood pressure. JALYN may cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure upon standing from a sitting or lying position, especially at the start of treatment. Symptoms of low blood pressure may include:
fainting
dizziness
feeling lightheaded
Rare and serious allergic reactions, including: Get medical help right away if you have these serious allergic reactions.
swelling of your face, tongue, or throat
difficulty breathing
serious skin reactions, such as skin peeling

Higher chance of a more serious form of prostate cancer.

Eye problems during cataract or glaucoma surgery. During cataract or glaucoma surgery, a condition called Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) can happen if you take or have taken JALYN in the past. If you need to have cataract or glaucoma surgery, tell your surgeon if you take or have taken JALYN.
A painful erection that will not go away. Rarely, JALYN can cause a painful erection (priapism), which cannot be relieved by having sex. If this happens, get medical help right away. If priapism is not treated, there could be lasting damage to your penis, including not being able to have an erection.

### Time course for blood pressure lowering of β-blockers with partial agonist activity [^04edd52c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. We do not know whether the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-blockers varies across the day. This review focuses on the subclass of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity (BBPAA).

Objectives

To assess the degree of variation in hourly BP lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period in adults with essential hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for relevant studies up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We sought to include all randomised and non-randomised trials that assessed the hourly effect of BBPAA by ambulatory monitoring, with a minimum follow-up of three weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials and extracted the data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included in the review were end-point hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device.

Main Results

Fourteen non-randomised baseline controlled trials of BBPAA met our inclusion criteria, but only seven studies, involving 121 participants, reported hourly ambulatory BP data that could be included in the meta-analysis. Beta-blockers studied included acebutalol, pindolol and bopindolol. We judged most studies at high or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low for all outcomes. We analysed and presented data by each hour post-dose. Very low-certainty evidence showed that hourly mean reduction in BP and HR visually showed an attenuation over time. Over the 24-hour period, the magnitude of SBP lowering at each hour ranged from -3.68 mmHg to -17.74 mmHg (7 studies, 121 participants), DBP lowering at each hour ranged from -2.27 mmHg to -9.34 mmHg (7 studies, 121 participants), and HR lowering at each hour ranged from -0.29 beats/min to -10.29 beats/min (4 studies, 71 participants). When comparing between three 8-hourly time intervals that correspond to day, evening, and night time hours, BBPAA was less effective at lowering BP and HR at night, than during the day and evening. However, because we judged that these outcomes were supported by very low-certainty evidence, further research is likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and may change the conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw general conclusions about the degree of variation in hourly BP-lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period, in adults with essential hypertension. Very low-certainty evidence showed that BBPAA acebutalol, pindolol, and bopindolol lowered BP more during the day and evening than at night. However, the number of studies and participants included in this review was very small, further limiting the certainty of the evidence. We need further and larger trials, with accurate recording of time of drug intake, and with reporting of standard deviation of BP and HR at each hour.

### Hypertension management 2011: optimal combination therapy [^7ced18ed]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Raised levels of blood pressure result from the complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. The complexity of blood pressure control mechanisms has major implications for individual responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs. The underlying haemodynamic disorder in the majority of cases is a rise in peripheral vascular resistance. This observation led to the discovery and development of increasingly sophisticated and targeted vasodilators, although many of the earlier antihypertensive drugs, by virtue of their actions blocking the sympathetic nervous system, had a vasodilator component to their mode of action. A recent meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials of monotherapy in unselected hypertensives, reports average (placebo-corrected) blood pressure responses to single agents of 9.1 mmHg systolic and 5.5 mmHg diastolic pressure. These average values disguise the extremely wide ranging responses in individuals across a fall of 20–30 mmHg systolic at one extreme, to no effect at all, or even a small rise in blood pressure at the other. The second factor determining individual responses to monotherapy is the extent to which initial falls in pressure are opposed by reflex responses in counter regulatory mechanisms that are activated following the blood pressure reduction. Thus, a satisfactory blood pressure response is rarely reached with monotherapy alone. What then is the next step if blood pressure is not a goal after the patient has been treated with monotherapy for a few weeks? Should you uptitrate, substitute or combine?

Effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in lowering blood pressure according to dose

These estimates are taken from a meta-analysis of 354 short term randomised placebo controlled trials of blood pressure lowering drugs in fixed dose, which showed that the five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs produce similar reductions in blood pressure when taken at standard dose or at the same multiple of standard dose. It also showed that the blood pressure lowering effect of the drugs increased with dose and with pretreatment blood pressure, and reported regression equations that quantified the reduction in blood pressure from one drug according to pretreatment blood pressure. From the average blood pressure of 154 mm Hg systolic and 97 mm Hg diastolic one drug at standard dose lowered blood pressure by 9.1 mm Hg systolic and 5.5 mm Hg diastolic on average. At lower or higher pretreatment blood pressures the blood pressure reduction decreased (or increased) by 0.10 mm Hg systolic and 0.11 mm Hg diastolic per mm Hg decrease (or increase) in pretreatment blood pressure. The estimated effect of one drug at standard dose in lowering blood pressure from a pretreatment blood pressure P is therefore [9.1+0.10(P−154)] systolic and [5.5+0.11(P−97)] diastolic. So for example the reduction in blood pressure was 8.7 mm Hg systolic from a pretreatment value of 150 mm Hg, 4.7 mm Hg diastolic from a pretreatment value of 90 mm Hg. The estimated blood pressure reduction for two or three drugs at standard dose was calculated by applying these equations to each drug in turn, allowing for the effect of the first in lowering pretreatment blood pressure for the second, and the second for the third. In the above example the pretreatment blood pressure for the second drug would be 141.3 (150−8.7) mm Hg systolic and 85.3 (90−4.7) mm Hg diastolic.

(A) Systolic blood pressure; (B) diastolic blood pressure reduction. Abbreviations as in Figure 1.

A total of 6 trials with 9 comparisons between LDC vs placebo provided data on the between-group difference in mean (95% CI) change in DBP, which was −6.2 (−4.9, −7.4) mm Hg. The between-group difference in mean change in DBP was −4.3 (−2.8, −5.9) mm Hg for trials with pretreatment DBP < 90 mm Hg compared to −9.4 (−7.3, −11.5) mm Hg for trials with pretreatment DBP ≥ 90, with significant interaction between the 2 subgroups (P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). Meta-regression showed a trend for greater DBP reduction with higher pretreatment DBP (P = 0.106) (Figure 2B).

Compared to placebo, LDC was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in achieving target BP < 140/90 mm Hg at first follow-up visit between 4 and 12 weeks (61% vs 27%; RR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.62–3.62) (Supplemental Figure 3).

### Propranolol hydrochloride (inderal XL) [^fb08eb4a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INDERAL XL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including beta-blockers.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Long term monitoring in patients receiving treatment to lower blood pressure: analysis of data from placebo controlled randomised controlled trial [^f8424ecb]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the probability of correctly identifying true increases in blood pressure of moderate magnitude using a typical monitoring regimen is poor, with a large proportion of observed increases in blood pressure being false positives. Monitoring at shorter time intervals increases the probability of identifying false positive increases in blood pressure attributable to short term within person variability of blood pressure. Longer intervals between measurements increase the probability that an observed increase in blood pressure is real, but the capacity of monitoring to distinguish true increases in blood pressure is poor even if monitoring is left for several years. Clinicians need better information about the value of different monitoring strategies, and future evidence based monitoring guidelines would be invaluable.

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19. 1 million participants [^b91f3558]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The estimated number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015 (figure 7), comprising 597 million men and 529 million women. At the global level, this increase was attributable to population growth and ageing, offset partly by falling age-specific prevalence. In the high-income western super-region, the absolute number of people with raised blood pressure has decreased steadily since 1975 because the steep decrease in prevalence outweighed the effect of population growth and ageing. Nonetheless, 141 million adults in the constituent countries had raised blood pressure in 2015. Similarly, in central and eastern Europe, the number of people with raised blood pressure peaked in 1988 and went below its 1975 levels in 2002, driven by decreasing prevalence. In high-income Asia Pacific, the number of people with raised blood pressure has decreased since 2007 but is still higher than it was in 1975. In other low-income and middle-income super-regions, the number of people with raised blood pressure is still increasing. In Latin America and the Caribbean and central Asia, the Middle East, and north Africa, this rise is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing and decrease due to lower age-specific prevalence. In Oceania, south Asia, east and southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, three quarters or more of the rise is attributable to population growth and ageing, and the remainder is due to an increase in prevalence (figure 7). In 2015, 258 million (23%) of the 1·13 billion adults with raised blood pressure lived in south Asia (199 million of whom in India) and another 235 million (21%) lived in east Asia (226 million of whom in China).

### Protective effects of renin-angiotensin blockade beyond blood pressure control [^dbf3a402]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drugs exert a number of blood pressure-independent benefits. However, demonstrating the clinical significance of these effects may be difficult for a number of reasons. First, blood pressure can be measured in the clinic, at home and over the 24-h period by ambulatory monitoring. Second, differences between these measures mean that achieving equivalent blood pressure reductions in two treatment arms may be difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, even small differences in blood pressure can translate into significant effects on cardiovascular risk, especially in the later stages of the cardiovascular continuum. In large clinical trials, other errors limiting the sensitivity to treatment differences include high patient dropouts and unplanned crossover. In addition, as so many patients fail to achieve blood pressure goals even in clinical trials where patient's and physician's motivation is high, the need for cardiovascular protection beyond blood pressure control is unequivocal. Clinical trials of angiotensin II receptor blockers have suggested significant effects beyond blood pressure control, which are observed throughout and with greater consistency in the early phases of the cardiovascular continuum. There may also be differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Conclusive demonstration that these blood pressure-independent effects do exist will require, however, a much more accurate and extended assessment of the blood pressure effects of the drugs.

### Intermediate hyperglycaemia, diabetes and blood pressure in rural Bangladesh: five-year post-randomisation follow-up of the DMagic cluster-randomised controlled trial [^1867ea3b]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Though our DMagic interventions did not specifically target blood pressure, raised blood pressure and raised blood glucose share several common risk factors and so many of the possible PLA intervention mechanisms that reduce diabetes risk could plausibly also have beneficial effects on blood pressure. However, despite the large observable effects on blood glucose in 2018, intervention effects on hypertensionand measures of blood pressure (retrospective analysis in supplementary Table S3) were not observed in our 2018 data. There may be several reasons for this, including a possible inertia in blood pressure that means that changes resulting from intervention mechanisms take longer to have an effect. Alternatively (or in addition), the observed improvements in blood pressure might themselves be mediated by improvements in blood glucose and so may not be expected to occur simultaneously with reductions in intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes.

We do not have measures of the quantity of salt consumed by study participants or the relative or absolute changes in the amount of salt consumed, but small reductions in salt being added to food were observed in PLA clusters relative to control. Reduction of salt consumption is one of the most effective ways to reduce blood pressure in populations and individuals and may have contributed to the changes in blood pressure we observed. Effective reduction of population salt consumption is likely to require a combination of targeted salt reduction strategies as well as community interventions – such as PLA – that address individual and contextual factors influencing dietary salt use.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^ccfaeb3d]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Expected reduction in disease events for a specified reduction in blood pressure

The associations between systolic and diastolic blood pressure and CHD events and stroke were taken from the largest published meta-analysis of 61 cohort (prospective observational) studies. This showed that in every age group cardiovascular mortality plotted on a logarithmic scale against blood pressure on an arithmetic scale is well fitted by straight lines, indicating a constant proportional change in risk for a specified change in blood pressure from any level of pretreatment blood pressure. Age specific slopes of the lines (regression coefficients) were published, permitting the calculation of the predicted proportional reduction in disease events for any age and blood pressure difference. For an age specific regression slope, S (see web extra table 3), and decrease in blood pressure, d, the relative risk is S d/20 for systolic pressure and S d/10 for diastolic pressure. The following examples illustrate the calculations. At age 60–69, the relative risk of stroke is 0.43 (57% decrease) for a 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure. For a blood pressure decrease twice as great (40 mm Hg), the relative risk of 0.43 effectively applies twice (0.43×0.43, or 0.43²), which is 0.18 (an 82% decrease). For a reduction in blood pressure half as great, by symmetry the relative risk is √0.43, or 0.43¹⁄², which is 0.66 (a 34% decrease). For a 30 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure the relative risk is 0.43¹⋅⁵ (since 30/20 = 1.5), which is 0.28 (a 72% decrease). The sloping lines in the lower portion of figure 6 reflect these regression coefficients for stroke and CHD events in the age groups 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79 years.

### Effect of lower sodium intake on health: systematic review and meta-analyses [^cb2f5c34]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Randomised controlled trials of four or more weeks' duration showed no indication that reducing sodium intake had any adverse effects on blood lipids or catecholamine levels. These results were consistent with a previous systematic review when it considered only the studies of four or more weeks. There was also no indication of an adverse effect of reducing sodium intake on renal function, and the results were even suggestive of a beneficial effect. The quality of evidence for these outcomes in adults was high.

Subgroup analyses suggest that reduced sodium intake decreases blood pressure in people both with and without hypertension. The reduction in blood pressure was greater in those with hypertension; none the less, the benefit was evident in all groups. The relatively small effect of decreased sodium intake on blood pressure reduction in people without high blood pressure is consistent with a previous review. Nevertheless, a modest decrease in blood pressure can have important public health benefits. The health risk attributable to raised blood pressure is present across the entire population distribution of blood pressure. Raised blood pressure is the leading modifiable risk factor for mortality, accounting for almost 13% of deaths globally. In the United States, a decrease of 2 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in the population could result in an estimated 17% decrease in the prevalence of hypertension, 6% decrease in risk of coronary heart disease, and 15% decrease in risk of stroke, and prevent an estimated 67 000 coronary heart disease events and 34 000 stroke events every year. Researchers estimate that a 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in the population of the United Kingdom could reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 50% in that country. Additionally, the relation between blood pressure and risk of vascular mortality is positive, strong, and linear down to a systolic blood pressure of 115 mm Hg, below which there is no evidence; and most averted vascular events owing to small reductions in blood pressure across the entire distribution will occur among people with moderately raised blood pressure levels, including those within the normal range for prehypertension. Thus almost all reductions in blood pressure are beneficial for health, and modest population-wide reductions in blood pressure can result in important reductions in mortality, substantial health benefits, and meaningful savings in healthcare costs.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^67027f34]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Despite the widespread use of blood pressure lowering drugs and the results of many randomised trials, w1-w162 uncertainty remains about which drugs to use and who to treat. Five questions encapsulate this uncertainty. Firstly, do β blockers have a special effect over and above lowering blood pressure in preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) events in people with a history of CHD? This view is widely held but such an effect has not been shown directly or quantified. We aimed to answer this question from an analysis of all relevant trials, and then to answer four further questions after excluding CHD events in trials of β blockers in people with a history of CHD if they did have a special effect. Secondly, does the effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke differ in people with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (that is, is there a different effect in secondary and primary prevention)? Thirdly, does blood pressure reduction alone explain the effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke? There are claims of additional non-blood pressure lowering (so called pleiotropic) effects of drugs. w135 w136 w139 Selected trial data have been used to suggest that each of the five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs (thiazides, β blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) has a greater preventive effect, w126 w129 and each a lesser preventive effect, w126 w135 than other drugs. Clinical guidelines tend to reflect the view that differences in efficacy exist. Fourthly, should the use of blood pressure lowering drugs be limited to people with "high" blood pressure and not given to those at high risk of cardiovascular disease who have a lower blood pressure? A corollary is whether blood pressure should be reduced to a limited extent only, a treat to target approach. Although cohort (prospective observational) studies do not show a lower blood pressure limit below which risk ceases to decline ("the lower the better"), this has not been shown in randomised trials across a wide range of blood pressure. Finally, what is the quantitative effect of taking one or more blood pressure lowering drugs in lowering blood pressure and preventing CHD events and stroke according to dose, pretreatment blood pressure, and age? To date no such quantitative summary of effect, taking account of these determining factors, has been made.

### The effects of propionate on blood pressure and arterial function [^fd954844]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Epidemiological data are presented in Table 1. We observed a significant reduction in peripheral SBP and DBP and in central DBP when comparing baseline with follow-up measurements as displayed in Supplemental Table 2. Peripheral SBP decreased from 130.3 ± 14.8 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 126.5–134.2] to 127.9 ± 14.2 mmHg (95% CI: 124.4–131.6; P = 0.0181; Cohen's d = 0.17), as displayed in Supplemental Figure 2. Peripheral DBP decreased from 86.3 ± 9.1 (95% CI: 83.9–88.6) to 83.8 ± 9.2 mmHg (95% CI: 81.4–86.2; P = 0.0155; Cohen's d = 0.27), and diastolic central BP from 87.7 ± 9.0 (95% CI: 85.4–90.1) to 85.3 ± 9.2 mmHg (95% CI: 82.9–87.8; P = 0.0198; Cohen's d = 0.26). Systolic central BP did not decrease significantly (120.0 ± 14.1 vs. 118.5 ± 13.2 mmHg; P = 0.11). As an exploratory analysis, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of response (defined as a reduction in BP from baseline to follow-up), including age, sex, and baseline BP. While no associations were found between BP reduction and age (R² < 0.001, P = 0.92) or sex (R² = 0.0511, P = 0.0827), baseline BP was significantly associated with BP reduction (R² = 0.18, P = 0.0011). To evaluate baseline BP as a predictor of response independent of a hypertension diagnosis, we performed a ROC analysis excluding all patients with known hypertension. This analysis yielded an AUC of 0.7734 (P = 0.035), as shown in the supplementary materials (Supplemental Figure 1). We additionally performed a subgroup analysis for central and peripheral BP in patients with and without hypertension (n = 13 and n = 45, respectively). The subgroup analysis for patients with hypertension revealed no changes from baseline to follow-up, whereas the subgroup analysis for patient without hypertension is in line with the results for the general population (reduction in central diastolic and peripheral systolic and diastolic BP), as shown in Supplemental Table 2.

### Different drug classes have variable effects on blood pressure depending on the time of day [^a5e1f187]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) is controlled by a variety of systems, the activities of which vary throughout the day. As drugs are developed that selectively block these systems, the fall in BP may not be consistent over 24 h.

Methods

A total of 24 patients (aged > 65 years) with systolic BP (SBP; > 150 mm Hg) that had not been treated entered a substudy of a larger study performed in 74 patients. In a double blind, crossover study with a balanced design, they received placebo, atenolol 50 mg, perindopril 8 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg. The study periods were 2 months. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at the end of each period, and was divided into awake periods (9:00 AM to 10:00 PM), sleep periods (12:00 AM to 6:00 AM), and morning periods (6:00 AM to 9:00 AM). Medication was taken at 9:00 AM.

Results

The four drug classes lowered 24-h mean SBP (P < .05), but the fall with atenolol was less than with the other drugs. The fall in awake BP with perindopril was less than with felodipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Atenolol caused no significant fall in sleep or morning SBP, and the falls with the other three drugs were significant and were greater than the fall with atenolol. The fall in sleep BP with perindopril was greater than with the other drug classes. The awake-sleep difference in SBP increased with perindopril, stayed the same with felodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, and was reduced by atenolol.

Conclusions

In this study, the response to the different drug classes differed. The response to drugs that work relatively nonspecifically (diuretics, calcium blockers) was relatively consistent over 24 h. The response to beta blockers and to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reflected the activity of control systems. This finding supports the concept of multiple drug therapy that may need to be tailored to the time of day.

### Statins, antihypertensive treatment, and blood pressure control in clinic and over 24 hours: evidence from PHYLLIS randomised double blind trial [^fe17e7c7]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

A second limitation is that participants in PHYLLIS were hypertensive and received antihypertensive drugs capable of causing a clear cut reduction in ambulatory and clinic measured blood pressure. This restricts our conclusion that statins do not exert any significant blood pressure lowering effect to patients with high blood pressure who receive effective antihypertensive treatment. In other words, the possibility remains that statins cause some reduction in blood pressure when given alone — that is, in the absence of a possible confounding effect of the antihypertensive drug treatment. In this context, however, we should mention that in PHYLLIS on-treatment ambulatory and clinic blood pressure remained well above normal values, leaving a large potential for a further reduction in blood pressure to occur. This makes the above possibility unlikely.

The third limitation relates to the suggestion from a recently published cross sectional analysis that the reduction in blood pressure by statins is mainly evident when the initial blood pressure is particularly high (that is, above the mild hypertension range explored in PHYLLIS). This suggestion is not in line with the observation that in our patients no interaction occurred between baseline blood pressure and the effects of pravastatin on blood pressure. In this context, we also emphasise that our study has a randomised design, which, compared with cross sectional assessment of drug effects, produces results that are much less affected by many confounders that are never completely accounted for in statistical analysis.

Finally, our conclusion obviously refers to data obtained with pravastatin, which means that a blood pressure lowering effect of other statins cannot be ruled out. However, virtually all cardiovascular effects attributable to statins have been documented for more than one drug and are therefore reported as common to the class, and the studies that have reported a statin related blood pressure reduction have used pravastatin as well as of other statins with no evidence of a differential effect on blood pressure. Furthermore, in PHYLLIS pravastatin was used at a dose (40 mg daily) similar to that used in the studies that have reported blood pressure lowering by statins. This dosage caused a marked lipid lowering effect (reduction in serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 1 mmol/l or 40 mg/dl), in line with what is commonly observed with effective doses of any statin.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride) [^8a4f59da]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules?

Avoid driving, operating machinery, or other dangerous activities when starting treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules until you know how dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules affects you. Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules can cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure, especially at the start of treatment. A sudden drop in blood pressure may cause you to faint, feel dizzy or lightheaded.
You should not donate blood while taking dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules or for 6 months after you have stopped dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. This is important to prevent pregnant females from receiving dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules through blood transfusions.

What are the possible side effects of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules?

Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules may cause serious side effects including:

Decreased blood pressure. Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules may cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure upon standing from a sitting or lying position, especially at the start of treatment. Symptoms of low blood pressure may include:
fainting
dizziness
feeling lightheaded
Rare and serious allergic reactions, including:
swelling of your face, tongue, or throat
difficulty breathing
serious skin reactions, such as skin peeling

### The impact of oral phenylpropanolamine on blood pressure: a meta-analysis and review of the literature [^c68cce98]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Oral phenylpropanolamine is commonly used to treat congestion and obesity. Clinicians often wonder what effect it has on blood pressure and whether they are safe in hypertensive patients. The purpose of our systematic review was to assess whether these drugs cause clinically meaningful elevations in pulse or blood pressure. English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral phenylpropanolamine in adults with extractable data on pulse or blood pressure were studied. MEDLINE (1966–2003), Embase, the Cochrane library and reviewed article references were used as sources. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate data were extracted. Additional extracted data included demographics, year, study design, study duration, drug dose and frequency, duration of washout and country. Study quality was assessed using the methods of Jadad and data were synthesized using a random effects model using weighted mean differences. In all, 33 trials reporting 48 treatment arms with 2165 patients were included. Phenylpropanolamine increased SBP 5.5 mmHg (95% CI: 3.1–8.0) and DBP 4.1 mmHg (95% CI: 2.2–6.0) with no effect on pulse. Patients with controlled hypertension were not at greater risk of blood pressure elevation. Immediate release preparations had greater effects on blood pressure than sustained release ones. Higher doses and shorter duration use also caused greater increases. Eighteen studies contained at least one treated subjects having blood pressure elevations ≥ 140/90 mmHg, an increase in SBP ≥ 15 mmHg or an increase in DBP ≥ 10 mmHg. In conclusion, phenylpropanolamine caused a small, but significant increase in systolic blood pressure. The effect was more pronounced with shorter-term administration, higher doses of medication and immediate release formulations.

### Effects of high-versus low-sodium oxybate on blood pressure in patients with narcolepsy [^de065943]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The daily reductions in sodium intake and excretion observed in our study corresponded with statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in BP. Mean 24-hour, daytime, and office SBP reductions of −4.1, −5.1, and −9.2 mm Hg, respectively, were comparable to or in excess of those SBP reductions anticipated with nonpharmacologic dietary interventions for both populations with hypertension and normotensive populations. Notably, reductions in 24-hour ambulatory BP, which is considered the preferred method of evaluating BP changes in an interventional study because of accuracy, reproducibility, and associations with predicting long-term sequelae, were clinically meaningful. Ambulatory BP has also become the recommended methodology to assess changes in BP in the Food and Drug Administration's guidance for the evaluation of potential pressor effects of noncardiovascular therapies. Importantly, for studies of < 12-week duration, single-arm studies are widely used due to the lack of placebo effect and improved intermediate- and long-term reproducibility seen with ambulatory BP compared with office-based readings. – For example, in a pooled analysis of 116 study participants from several small studies, administration of a placebo for 6 to 8 weeks was accompanied by a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic clinic BPs (−5/−4 mm Hg) but not in 24-hour BP. These results provided a substantial database, indicating that 24-hour average BP is not reduced by placebo; thus, it is not necessary to include a placebo control group in clinical studies in which ambulatory BP monitoring is used.

### Long term monitoring in patients receiving treatment to lower blood pressure: analysis of data from placebo controlled randomised controlled trial [^7017dd1a]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

It is usual practice for patients on blood pressure lowering drugs to have their prescription renewed or drugs altered on the basis of blood pressure measurements and clinical review every six months or so. Our results provide little evidence to support the modification of blood pressure management on the basis of measurements made at this interval. If the true on treatment diastolic blood pressure was initially 80 mm Hg then 5.8% of patients would be observed three months later to have a ≥ 10 mm Hg increase to 90 mm Hg or over. This would reflect more than 1000 false positives for every true increase, and in nearly all patients in whom treatment was identified as failing the apparently high blood pressure levels would reflect only measurement error. If the true on treatment diastolic blood pressure was 85 mm Hg instead then 21.6% of patients would be observed to have a ≥ 5 mm Hg increase to 90 mm Hg or over. A much greater proportion of these observations would reflect real increases in blood pressure but there would still be about 11 false positives for every true increase.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of β-1 selective beta blockers for primary hypertension [^3c0844cd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension. The blood pressure reading is the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. The blood pressure lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers is not known.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. We searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (All years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 15 October 2015). The Hypertension Group Specialised Register includes controlled trials from searches of CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, LILACS, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms. No language restrictions were used. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into CENTRAL, EMBASE, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register and ClinicalTrials.gov using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Full strategies are in Appendix 1.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a beta blocker monotherapy arm with fixed dose. People enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are atenolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, pafenolol, practolol.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3.5 was used to synthesise data.

Main Results

We identified 56 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) that examined the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective blockers (beta-1 blocker) in 7812 primary hypertensive patients. Among the included trials, 26 RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross-over studies, examining eight beta-1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range. Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses. Individually and overall beta-1 blockers did not affect pulse pressure, which distinguishes them from other classes of drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides low quality evidence that in people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute as compared to placebo. The effect of beta-1 blockers at peak hours, -12/-9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough hours, -8/-7 mmHg. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta-1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse pressure.

### Are there effects of renin-angiotensin system antagonists beyond blood pressure control? [^5228e56d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recognized to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, which is primarily attributed to their antihypertensive effects. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.

### Fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension [^188eeb0a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension is an excessive fall in blood pressure (BP) while standing and is the result of a decrease in cardiac output or defective or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that increases blood volume and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone is considered the first- or second-line pharmacological therapy for orthostatic hypotension alongside mechanical and positional measures such as increasing fluid and salt intake and venous compression methods. However, there has been no Cochrane Review of the benefits and harms of this drug for this condition.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 11 November 2019: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We also searched trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies evaluating the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone compared to placebo, another drug for orthostatic hypotension, or studies without comparators, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and observational studies. We included studies in people with orthostatic hypotension due to a chronic peripheral neuropathy, a central autonomic neuropathy, or autonomic failure from other causes, but not medication-induced orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension from acute volume depletion or blood loss.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane methodological procedures for most of the review. We developed and used a tool to prioritize observational studies that offered the best available evidence where there are gaps in the evidence from RCTs. We assessed the certainty of evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 13 studies of 513 participants, including three cross-over RCTs and 10 observational studies (three cohort studies, six case series and one case-control study). The included RCTs were small (total of 28 participants in RCTs), short term (two to three weeks), only examined fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension in people with two conditions (diabetes and Parkinson disease), and had variable risk of bias (two had unclear risk of bias and one had low risk of bias). Heterogeneity in participant populations, comparators and outcome assessment methods prevented meta-analyses of the RCTs. We found very low-certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone versus placebo on drop in BP in people with diabetes (-26 mmHg versus -39 mmHg systolic; -7 mmHg versus -11 mmHg diastolic; 1 cross-over study, 6 participants). For people with Parkinson disease, we found very-low certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone on drop in BP compared to pyridostigmine (-14 mmHg versus -22.1 mmHg diastolic; P = 0.036; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) and domperidone (no change after treatment in either group; 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). For orthostatic symptoms, we found very low-certainty evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo in people with diabetes (4 out of 5 analyzed participants had improvements in orthostatic symptoms, 1 cross-over study, 6 participants), for fludrocortisone versus pyridostigmine in people with Parkinson disease (orthostatic symptoms unchanged; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) or fludrocortisone versus domperidone (improvement to 6 for both interventions on the Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale-Orthostatic Domain (COMPASS-OD); 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). Evidence on adverse events was also very low-certainty in both populations, but indicated side effects were minimal. Observational studies filled some gaps in evidence by examining the effects in larger groups of participants, with more diverse conditions, over longer periods of time. One cohort study (341 people studied retrospectively) found fludrocortisone may not be harmful in the long term for familial dysautonomia. However, it is unclear if this translates to long-term improvements in BP drop or a meaningful improvement in orthostatic symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of fludrocortisone on blood pressure, orthostatic symptoms or adverse events in people with orthostatic hypotension and diabetes or Parkinson disease. There is a lack of information on long-term treatment and treatment of orthostatic hypotension in other disease states. There is a need for standardized reporting of outcomes and for standardization of measurements of blood pressure in orthostatic hypotension.

### Intraocular pressure and systemic blood pressure: longitudinal perspective: the beaver dam eye study [^101c0a1b]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the relation between change in systemic blood pressures and change in intraocular pressure.

Methods

This was a population based study of people 43–86 years old living in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Measurements at baseline (1988–90) and 5 year follow up of systemic blood pressures, intraocular pressures, and history of use of blood pressure medications.

Results

Intraocular pressures were significantly correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures at both baseline and follow up. There were significant direct correlations between changes in systemic blood pressures and changes in intraocular pressure. There was a 0.21 (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.27) mm Hg increase in IOP for a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic and 0.43 (0.35 to 0.52) mm Hg increase in IOP for a 10 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure. Further adjustment for diabetes and medication use did not alter these associations. Decreased systolic or diastolic blood pressures of more than 10 mm Hg over 5 years were significantly associated with decreased IOP.

Conclusions

Reduced systemic blood pressure is associated with reduced intraocular pressure. This finding should be evaluated in other studies, especially with respect to the possibility of resultant decreased risk of open angle glaucoma.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Stress-reduction and mindfulness interventions — blood pressure effects in adults — are summarized as follows: Transcendental meditation lowers systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) by approximately 5/2 mm Hg in patients without and with hypertension, meditation appears somewhat less effective than lifestyle interventions, breathing control interventions lower SBP/DBP by approximately 5/3 mm Hg in people with and without hypertension, and yoga of diverse types lowers blood pressure with low- to moderate-grade evidence.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^627afaa8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^0b70afea]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The magnitude of BP benefits for LDC was similar irrespective of whether LDCs are used as initial therapy among those untreated at baseline or among those on monotherapy at baseline — these findings therefore call in to question the requirement for separate evidence in these 2 patient populations in some regulatory guidelines. We did however observe significant heterogeneity between the trials according to trial level pretreatment BP in terms of BP reduction with LDC compared to placebo. Each 10 mm Hg increase in trial level pretreatment SBP was associated with a 6 mm Hg increase in the mean difference in SBP between LDC and placebo. This phenomenon has been previously described by Wald et aland other authors as Wilder's principle — pretreatment value determines post-treatment response. Wald et alreported a 1 mm Hg increase in SBP reduction for monotherapy for each 10 mm Hg higher trial level pretreatment SBP with monotherapy and a 2 to 3 mm Hg for dual and triple therapy. Our data indicate trial level pretreatment BP has a larger impact on BP efficacy with LDCs. The clinical significance is that LDCs can be expected to be very effective at high BP levels, but at lower starting BP levels, LDCs are less potent. This means LDCs are associated with a small increase in symptoms of hypotension such as dizziness (about 3% to 4% absolute increase in our analyses compared to placebo and monotherapy) but also that higher dose combinations may be needed to reach aggressive BP targets.

### Do men and women respond differently to blood pressure-lowering treatment? Results of prospectively designed overviews of randomized trials [^c2e01568]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Large-scale observational studies show that lower blood pressure is associated with lower cardiovascular risk in both men and women although some studies have suggested that different outcomes between the sexes may reflect different responses to blood pressure-lowering treatment. The aims of these overview analyses were to quantify the effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment in each sex and to determine if there are important differences in the proportional benefits of treatment between men and women.

Methods and Results

Thirty-one randomized trials that included 103,268 men and 87,349 women contributed to these analyses. For each outcome and each comparison summary estimates of effect and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for men and women using a random-effects model. The consistency of the effects of each treatment regimen across the sexes was examined using χ² tests of homogeneity. Achieved blood pressure reductions were comparable for men and women in every comparison made. For the primary outcome of total major cardiovascular events there was no evidence that men and women obtained different levels of protection from blood pressure lowering or that regimens based on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, or diuretics/beta-blockers were more effective in one sex than the other (all P-homogeneity > 0.08).

Conclusion

All of the blood pressure-lowering regimens studied here provided broadly similar protection against major cardiovascular events in men and women. Differences in cardiovascular risks between sexes are unlikely to reflect differences in response to blood pressure-lowering treatments.

### Blood pressure-lowering medications, sodium reduction, and blood pressure [^5f9169cb]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Both blood pressure-lowering medication and sodium reduction are effective in hypertension control, but whether the effect of sodium reduction differ across blood pressure-lowering medications is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the dose-response effect of sodium intake reduction on blood pressure in treated hypertensive individuals and the impact of different classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs.

Methods

We searched multiple databases and reference lists up to July 9, 2024. Randomized controlled trials with a duration of ≥ 2 weeks comparing the effect of different levels of sodium intake (measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion) on blood pressure in hypertensive individuals treated with constant blood pressure-lowering medications were included. Instrumental variable meta-analyses based on random-effects models were conducted to evaluate the dose effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the class of blood pressure-lowering drugs, age, baseline sodium and blood pressure levels, and study duration.

Results

We included 35 studies (median duration of 28 days) with a total of 2885 participants. For every 100 mmol reduction in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, systolic blood pressure decreased by 6.81 mmHg (95% CI, 4.96–8.66), diastolic blood pressure decreased by 3.85 mmHg (95% CI, 2.26–5.43), and mean arterial pressure decreased by 4.83 mmHg (95% CI, 3.22–6.44). The dose-response effects varied across classes of blood pressure-lowering medications, with greater effects observed in the β-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and dual therapy groups. No significant subgroup differences were observed across subgroups defined by age, baseline 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, blood pressure levels, or study duration.

Conclusions

Pooled evidence suggests a dose-response relationship between sodium reduction and blood pressure in treated individuals with hypertension, influenced by the class of blood pressure-lowering medications.

### Terazosin [^9f986ef6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In this long-term trial, both symptom scores and peak urinary flow rates showed statistically significant improvement suggesting a relaxation of smooth muscle cells.

Although blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors also lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients with increased peripheral vascular resistance, terazosin treatment of normotensive men with BPH did not result in a clinically significant blood pressure lowering effect:

B. Hypertension

In animals, terazosin causes a decrease in blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance. The vasodilatory hypotensive action of terazosin appears to be produced mainly by blockade of alpha-1-adrenoceptors. Terazosin decreases blood pressure gradually within 15 minutes following oral administration.

Patients in clinical trials of terazosin were administered once daily (the great majority) and twice daily regimens with total doses usually in the range of 5 to 20 mg/day, and had mild (about 77%, diastolic pressure 95 to 105 mmHg) or moderate (23%, diastolic pressure 105 to 115 mmHg) hypertension. Because terazosin, like all alpha antagonists, can cause unusually large falls in blood pressure after the first dose or first few doses, the initial dose was 1 mg in virtually all trials, with subsequent titration to a specified fixed dose or titration to some specified blood pressure end point (usually a supine diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg).

### Statins, antihypertensive treatment, and blood pressure control in clinic and over 24 hours: evidence from PHYLLIS randomised double blind trial [^cec56126]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, antihypertensive treatment with a thiazide diuretic or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor effectively lowered clinic measured and ambulatory blood pressure over a time interval of approximately three years. Compared with administration of placebo, addition of pravastatin to the antihypertensive treatment caused a marked and sustained reduction in serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. This addition, however, did not cause any further reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure values, either when they were measured at regular intervals in the physician's office or when they were repeatedly assessed on an ambulatory basis over 24 hours. This provides evidence against any substantial blood pressure lowering effect of statins in patients with high blood pressure, suggesting that the protective effects of these drugs on the cardiovascular system do not depend on a reduction in the blood pressure related risk of cardiovascular disease.

Strengths and limitations of study

PHYLLIS has several characteristics that make its results robust. Firstly, the study had a prospective randomised double blind design, which guarantees against errors due to inappropriate matching of patients and selection bias of patients or physicians. Secondly, the study had a relatively long duration, which allowed us to determine both the early effect and the possible delayed effect of statins on blood pressure. Thirdly, the effects of administration of statin on blood pressure were regularly assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring — that is, by a method characterised by greater reproducibility than clinic blood pressure measurements, and thus by a greater ability (because of a reduction of background erratic blood pressure changes) to detect small blood pressure differences between treatment groups. Fourthly, the absence of any effect of statins on blood pressure was also shown on additional blood pressure variables, which have been shown to have an independent prognostic significance, such as night-time blood pressure and blood pressure variability.

### Effects of high-versus low-sodium oxybate on blood pressure in patients with narcolepsy [^f61ff402]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that a reduction in medication-related sodium intake following the switch from high- to low-sodium oxybate formulations was associated with a significant reduction in ambulatory SBP in patients with narcolepsy and stages 1 to 2 hypertension. Reduction in mean sodium intake of 1339 mg was corroborated by a reduction in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion of 1288 mg. Moreover, the proportion of participants who were normotensive (defined as 24-hour SBP < 130 mm Hg) increased from 35% at baseline to 56% at the end of the 6-week treatment period. There were larger magnitude decreases in the office SBP, a phenomenon typically observed in studies using both office and ambulatory BPs as clinical end points. Changes from baseline in the ambulatory and office diastolic BPs were smaller than SBP changes but remained significant. A potential explanation for this finding is that the inclusion criteria specified a mean diastolic BP of ≤ 95 mm Hg, which led to the inclusion of participants with normotensive diastolic BPs (mean baseline ambulatory diastolic BP, 77 mm Hg).

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of statins: who benefits? [^b78e5612]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate if the effect of statins on blood pressure is similar in patients grouped by use of antihypertensive medication, level of blood pressure, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Methods

Blood pressure was compared in statins users (n = 995) and nonusers (n = 9536) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The overall effect of statins and their interactions with antihypertensive medication, blood pressure, and HDL-C were estimated using multiple linear and quantile regression.

Results

Adjusted systolic blood pressure was on average 1.8 mmHg lower in statins users than in nonusers (P = 0.05). Although statins had no significant effect among nonusers, it decreased systolic blood pressure by 3.3 mmHg among users of antihypertensive medication (interaction P = 0.02). The effect of statins on systolic blood pressure was similar in individuals with HDL-C levels above and below the median (49 mg/dl). Statins also lowered diastolic blood pressure by an average of 1.9 mmHg (P < 0.01), regardless of antihypertensive medication use. Among individuals with high HDL-C statins did not lower diastolic blood pressure, whereas in those with low HDL-C diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 3.4 mmHg. The effect of statins on systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased with higher blood pressure and changed little with adjustment for total cholesterol.

Conclusion

Statins lower blood pressure by cholesterol-independent mechanisms, and the reduction is larger in individuals with higher blood pressure and those with low HDL-C. Statins may be beneficial in preventing hypertension and may contribute to better blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (Apokyn) [^68735aac]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4	Syncope / Hypotension / Orthostatic Hypotension

In clinical studies, approximately 2% of APOKYN-treated patients experienced syncope. Dopamine agonists, including APOKYN, may cause orthostatic hypotension at any time but especially during dose escalation. Patients with Parkinson's disease may also have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk.

Patients undergoing titration of APOKYN showed an increased incidence (from 4% pre-dose to 18% post-dose) of systolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 20 mm Hg decrease) when evaluated at various times after in-office dosing. A small number of patients developed severe systolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 30 mm Hg decrease and systolic BP ≤ 90 mm Hg) after subcutaneous apomorphine injection. In clinical trials of APOKYN in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, 59 of 550 patients (11%) had orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, and/or syncope. These events were considered serious in 4 patients (< 1%) and resulted in withdrawal of APOKYN in 10 patients (2%). These events occurred both with initial dosing and during long-term treatment. Whether or not hypotension contributed to other significant adverse events seen (e.g., falls), is unknown. APOKYN causes dose-related decreases in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

In a study of healthy subjects, the hypotensive effect of APOKYN on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was exacerbated by the concomitant use of alcohol or sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg). Patients should avoid alcohol when using APOKYN [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Patients taking APOKYN should lie down before and after taking sublingual nitroglycerin. Other vasodilators and antihypertensives may also increase the hypotensive effects of APOKYN. Monitor blood pressure for hypotension and orthostatic hypotension in patients taking APOKYN with concomitant antihypertensive medications or vasodilators [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

### Orthostatic hypotension in the elderly: diagnosis and treatment [^f4334901]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem among elderly patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While acute orthostatic hypotension is usually secondary to medication, fluid or blood loss, or adrenal insufficiency, chronic orthostatic hypotension is frequently due to altered blood pressure regulatory mechanisms and autonomic dysfunction. The diagnostic evaluation requires a comprehensive history including symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, careful blood pressure measurement at various times of the day and after meals or medications, and laboratory studies. Laboratory investigation and imaging studies should be based upon the initial findings with emphasis on excluding diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, amyloidosis, diabetes, anemia, and vitamin deficiency as the cause. Whereas asymptomatic patients usually need no treatment, those with symptoms often benefit from a stepped approach with initial nonpharmacological interventions, including avoidance of potentially hypotensive medications and use of physical counter maneuvers. If these measures prove inadequate and the patient remains persistently symptomatic, various pharmacotherapeutic agents can be added, including fludrocortisone, midodrine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and to make the patient as ambulatory as possible rather then trying to achieve arbitrary blood pressure goals. With proper evaluation and management, the occurrence of adverse events, including falls, fracture, functional decline, and myocardial ischemia, can be significantly reduced.

### The central mechanism underlying hypertension: a review of the roles of sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress and endogenous digitalis in the brain [^0b0df6af]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive agents and the central mechanism of blood pressure regulation

The key factors in the sodium-induced mechanisms of action of hypertension include Na⁺, ENaC, the RAAS, EDLF, oxidative stress and the CNS sympathetic nervous system. Agents that influence these factors can either induce or decrease hypertension (Figure 4). Antihypertensive agents in particular must affect these factors; otherwise, treatment with antihypertensive agents would be accompanied by adverse circulatory events. That is, if the baroreceptor reflex set point is not lowered, the CNS will struggle to restore blood pressure to a higher level. For example, vasodilators such as hydralazineand short-acting dihyropyridine CCBsoften cause angina pectoris by increasing sympathetic tone. In fact, although excellent antihypertensive agents are now available, many antihypertensive agents have been screened during the long clinical history of hypertension treatment, only to be rejected because of adverse events. A number of large-scale clinical trials have evaluated the prognosis of current antihypertensive agents and provided evidence of their efficacy.,

Diuretics lower blood pressure by affecting the central mechanism of hypertension. Specifically, diuretics lower the concentration of circulating Na⁺, decreasing sympathetic outflow. However, decreased venous return to cardiopulmonary region because of circulating volume contraction decreases the low-pressure baroreceptor reflex tone (the sensors are located in the cardio-pulmonary region) and increases sympathetic activity. As a result, sympathetic activity increases after treatment with diuretics in a clinical setting, but blood pressure is decreased and sympathetic hyperactivity is minimal probably due to the central actions of decreased Na + concentrations. Thus, diuretics end up decreasing sympathetic activity and do not result in reflex tachycardia when blood pressure is significantly decreased.

Local blockade of ENaCs in the CNS should reduce blood pressure in humans as well as in animal models. In fact, amiloride and triamterene, which are used to treat hypertension, are thought to act at the distal renal tubules to suppress Na⁺ and K⁺ exchange in the kidney and thereby lower blood pressure. It is also possible that these agents act directly on the central site.

### Effect of oral pseudoephedrine on blood pressure and heart rate: a meta-analysis… [^6b1d6a6a]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The effect in patients with controlled hypertension demonstrated an SBP increase of similar magnitude. Higher doses and immediate-release preparations were associated with greater BP increases. Studies with more women had less effect on BP or HR. Shorter duration of use was associated with greater increases in SBP and DBP. The final list of included articles comprised 24 studies with 45 treatment arms. 15–38. We searched for more extreme effects of pseudoephedrine treatment and found that in the 24 studies involving 1108 patients exposed, 2 patients experienced mean arterial pressure elevations of 20 mm Hg; 5 treated, hypertensive patients had BPs greater than 145/94 mm Hg; 19 patients had a DBP greater than 89 mm Hg; 16 had an SBP greater than 139 mm Hg; 1 reported anxiety, a DBP of 100 mm Hg, and a 25% increase in HR; and 1 reported anxiety and sinus tachycardia.

This analysis demonstrates that pseudoephedrine causes a small but significant mean increase in SBP, with no significant effect on DBP and a slight increase in HR. Immediate-release formulations had a greater effect than sustained-release medications. Among immediate-release formulations, there was a dose-response relationship for all 3 cardiovascular variables. Women seemed to be less susceptible to the cardiovascular effects than men; the higher the proportion of women in each study, the lower were the effects found. This review found a dose-response relationship between the magnitude of the drug dose and the effect on BP. More substantial elevations of SBP and DBP were noted with higher doses of medication. In patients with stable, treated hypertension, pseudoephedrine therapy increased the SBP but had no effect on HR or DBP.

The neutral effect on HR observed in hypertensive patients is likely to be attributed to the 4 study arms that included patients receiving β-adrenergic blockade. We conclude that pseudoephedrine modestly increases SBP and HR. These effects are greatest in magnitude with immediate-release formulations, higher doses of medication, and short-term medication administration. Patients with stable, controlled hypertension do not seem to be at higher risk for BP elevation as a group than other patients when given pseudoephedrine along with their antihypertensive medications.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^277efb4a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — physiologic blood pressure changes and postpartum persistence — blood pressure normally decreases with a nadir at 16–18 weeks of gestation, driven by about a 30% decrease in systemic vascular resistance that typically produces a decrease in blood pressure of 10% as early as 7 weeks of gestation, with diastolic blood pressure falling by as much as 20 mm Hg; approximately 11% of women with chronic hypertension have proteinuria (more than 300 mg/day) at baseline; hypertension persisting longer than 12 weeks after delivery may be retrospectively reclassified as chronic, and in a prospective cohort of 205 preeclamptic women, 33% still had hypertension 12 weeks after delivery and in 50% it took up to 2 years for blood pressure to normalize.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of partial agonist beta blocker monotherapy for primary hypertension [^ee0c97c6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used to treat hypertension in many countries. Partial agonist act by stimulating beta receptors when they are quiescent and blocking beta receptors when they are active. The blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been quantified.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of various partial agonists beta blockers on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies must contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm with fixed dose. Patients enrolled into the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP > 140/90 mmHg). Duration of studies must be between three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (GW and HB) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently.

Main Results

Thirteen randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials that examined the blood pressure lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were included in this review. Five of the included studies were parallel studies and the other eight were cross-over studies. The overall risk of bias is high in this review due to the small sample size and high risk of detection bias. Pindolol, celiprolol and alprenolol lowered SBP and DBP compared to placebo. Acebutolol lowered SBP but there was no clear evidence that it lowered DBP. There was no clear evidence that pindolol and oxprenolol lowered SBP or DBP. Other than for celiprolol, sample sizes were generally small increasing the uncertainty in findings for individual agents versus placebo. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists (considered as a subclass) lowered peak BP by an average of 8 mmHg systolic (95% CI, -10 to -6, very low quality evidence), 4 mmHg diastolic (95%CI, -5 to -3, very low quality evidence) and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute (95%CI, -6 to -4, very low quality evidence). Higher dose partial agonists did not appear to provide additional BP lowering effects compared to lower dose. The maximum BP lowering effect of the overall subclass occurred at the starting dose. Partial agonists reduced pulse pressure by 4 mmHg (95% CI, -5 to -2, very low evidence). Only one study reported withdrawal due to adverse effects, the risk ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.07, 7.67).

Authors' Conclusions

There was very low quality evidence that in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists lowered peak BP by an average of 8/4 mmHg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute. There was no evidence of a greater effect at doses higher than the initial doses. This estimate was probably exaggerated as it was subject to a high risk of bias. Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane reviews on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which also used similar inclusion criteria as this review, the BP lowering effect appeared to be less than the effect in patients with mild to moderate elevated BP who were taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs based on an indirect comparison. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were only reported in one trial so it is impossible to assess the harm of these drugs.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^d45f36d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related BP lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension. To determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate and to evaluate adverse events (mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects and specific adverse events such as dry cough, diarrhoea and angioedema).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies evaluating BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with renin inhibitor compared with placebo for a minimum duration of three to 12 weeks in adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

This systematic review is a comprehensive update which includes four additional studies and extensive detail from nine clinical study reports (CSRs) of previously included studies obtained from EMA. The remaining three CSRs are not available. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. In all cases where there was a difference between the CSR and the published report, data from the CSR was used. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

12 studies (mean duration of eight weeks) in 7439 mostly Caucasian patients (mean age 54 years) with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertension were eligible for inclusion in the review. Aliskiren was the only renin inhibitor evaluated. All included studies were assessed to have high likelihood of attrition, reporting and funding bias. Aliskiren has a dose-related systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) lowering effect as compared with placebo MD with 95% CI: aliskiren 75 mg (MD -2.97, 95% CI -4.76 to -1.18)/(MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.13 to -0.96) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 150 mg (MD -5.95, 95% CI -6.85 to -5.06)/ (MD -3.16, 95% CI -3.74 to -2.58) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 300 mg (MD -7.88, 95% CI -8.94 to -6.82)/ (MD -4.49, 95% CI -5.17 to -3.82) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 600 mg (MD -11.35, 95% CI -14.43 to -8.27)/ (MD -5.86, 95% CI -7.73 to -3.99) mm Hg (low-quality evidence). There was a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure for aliskiren 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. The blood pressure lowering effect of aliskiren 600 mg was not different from 300 mg (MD -0.61, 95% CI -2.78 to 1.56)/(MD -0.68, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.67). Aliskiren had no effect on blood pressure variability. Due to very limited information available regarding change in heart rate and pulse pressure, it was not possible to meta-analyze these outcomes. Mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events were not increased. This review found that in studies of eight week duration aliskiren may not increase withdrawal due to adverse events (low-quality evidence). Diarrhoea was increased in a dose-dependent manner (RR 7.00, 95% CI 2.48 to 19.72) with aliskiren 600 mg (low-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events reported were headache, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to placebo, aliskiren lowered BP and this effect is dose-dependent. This magnitude of BP lowering effect is similar to that for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There is no difference in mortality, nonfatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse effects with short term aliskiren monotherapy. Diarrhoea was considerably increased with aliskiren 600 mg.

### Systematic review of mydriatics used for screening of retinopathy in premature infants [^c6d183c1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Safety

Key findings

The majority of safety specific data is from low level study design studies; therefore, there is limited evidence to support clinical practice (figure 2 and tables 2 and 3).
There is a diverse range of safety aspects evaluating mydriatic safety.
Multiple measures were used to evaluate mydriatic safety.

Twenty-two studies investigated safety aspects of the mydriatic regimens (table 1). Within case reports, there were 30 adverse events post-mydriatic administration.

Participants in the safety studies and case reports were all premature infants. The safety study design was either RCT, non-randomised intervention, observational, retrospective audits or case reports. The majority of the studies were non-randmoised intervention studies, and the sample size between the safety studies ranged from 7 to 1183. Within these studies, the mydriatic regimens, physiological measures (eg, blood pressure, feed intolerance) all varied significantly. This was similar for the case report analysis. Comparisons across papers created difficulty because of the variation in study design, low level of study design and the wide range of mydriatic regimens.

Cardiovascular

Key findings

Systemic absorption of phenylephrine causes vasoconstriction, resulting in increased blood pressure and tachycardia, whereas anticholinergics can cause transient bradycardia, followed by tachycardia, palpitation and arrhythmias. Both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were reported in the literature.
There is a wide range of both mydriatic regimens and blood pressure measures, therefore, making the interpretation of cardiovascular effects challenging.
Clinical significance is difficult to determine due to inability to adjust for confounders and gestational age of infants.
No statistically significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate were seen with microdrop administration.
Case reports highlight serious adverse effects such as cardiopulmonary arrest and pulseless.

A number of authors have investigated blood pressure and heart rate adverse effects associated with mydriatics (table 4). All results in table 4 are after mydriatic administration, but before ROPEE, which is important as ROPEE is a confounder due to the oculocardio reflex-mediated reduction in heart rate, of approximately 10%, following ROPEE.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (apomorphine hydrocloride) [^27bb3aee]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

7.2	Antihypertensive Medications and Vasodilators

In clinical studies, the following adverse events were experienced more commonly in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medications or vasodilators (n = 94) than in patients not receiving these medications (n = 456): hypotension (10% vs 4%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], myocardial infarction (3% vs 1%), serious pneumonia (5% vs 3%), serious falls (9% vs 3%), and bone and joint injuries (6% vs 2%). Some of the events may be related to the increased incidence of hypotension in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medications or vasodilators [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5)].

Concomitant administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin with apomorphine hydrocloride in healthy subjects causes greater decreases in blood pressure compared to apomorphine hydrocloride alone. When nitroglycerin and apomorphine hydrocloride were concomitantly administered to healthy subjects, the mean largest decrease (the mean of each subject's largest drop in blood pressure measured within the 6-hour period following administration of apomorphine hydrocloride) in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (measured over 6 hours) was 9.7 mm Hg and 9.3 mm Hg, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mean largest decrease in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 14.3 mm Hg and 13.5 mm Hg, respectively. Some individuals experienced very large decreases in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, up to a maximum decrease of 65 mm Hg and 43 mm Hg, respectively.

In comparison, the mean largest decrease in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure when apomorphine hydrocloride was administered alone was 6.1 mm Hg and 7.3 mm Hg, respectively, and in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 6.7 mm Hg and 8.4 mm Hg, respectively.

Patients taking apomorphine hydrocloride should lie down before and after taking sublingual nitroglycerin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Systematic review of mydriatics used for screening of retinopathy in premature infants [^b75ad109]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Table 4
Blood pressure and heart rate adverse effects for studies with p values, percentage change from baseline

Evidence collected from a retrospective audit, with a sample size of 1254 premature infants, showed significant increases in blood pressure after administration of phenylephrine 0.5% and tropicamide 0.5%, 3 d (mean diastolic blood pressure 8.5% (p = 0.04), mean systolic blood pressure 5.4% (p = 0.078)). This was compared with other cardiovascular related data sets which were from pilot studies, and within these eight different regimens, statistically significant increases in mean blood pressure were seen. The range of these increases in mean blood pressure from baseline ranged from 3.7% (no SD) to 22.8 ± 17.4% (table 4). Because multiple mydriatic regimens were used in these studies, no causative regimen was identified as having more of an effect on blood pressure.

A reduction in blood pressure was also identified in some studies. Four of these mydriatic regimens in pilot studies found statistically significant reductions in mean blood pressure from baseline, and these ranged from 1 ± 2.3% to 17.1 ± 10.4%.

Clinical significance of all of the blood pressure results is difficult to determine without directly comparing the results to the individual gestational age of the infant and adjusting for confounders.

Statistically significant changes in heart rate only occurred when two anticholinergic medicines were used. An increase of the mean heart rate of 3.7% occurred following cyclopentolate 0.5% (1 d) and tropicamide 0.5% (2 d) administration, additionally, an increase in heart rate of 10% ± 10.6% occurred following phenylephrine 2.5%, tropicamide 0.5% and cyclopentolate 0.5% (2 d) administration.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Lopressor HCT) [^66ca0209]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

LOPRESSORHCT is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Step 6: Add in other drugs

There is a wide choice of additional agents available, albeit with limited RCT evidence to support widespread use, including but not limited to
α-adreneceptor antagonists e.g. Doxazosin XL 4–8 mg.
β-adreneceptor antagonists e.g. bisoprolol or nebivolol, both 2.5–5 mg OD.
Centrally acting drugs e.g. methyldopa, clonidine or moxonidine
Direct vasodilators e.g. hydralazine or minoxidil.

The choice of agent should be carefully considered for each patient, taking into consideration patient choice, previous adverse experiences and the clinical situation.

Adrenoceptor antagonists are perhaps better tolerated in general than the other classes of drug, and PATHWAY-2 provided evidence of efficacy for Doxazosin XL. Therefore, they are a sensible initial choice.

Use of non-modified release doxazosin is not recommended due to higher peak concentration, which may produce rapid reductions in BP and is less well tolerated.

β-blockers may be considered in subjects with a heart rate ≥ 60 bpm with indications for their use e.g. migraine. If they are contra-indicated or poorly tolerated, α-blockers are an alternative.

Centrally acting drugs are effective antihypertensives but are associated with significant side effects such as depression, dry mouth, somnolence and insomnia. Although clonidine, a centrally acting α 2 agonist showed a similar BP-lowering efficacy to spironolactone in RH, it appears less well tolerated, and requires more careful and sustained dose titration. Moreover, there is a risk of rebound hypertension during periods of nonadherence, and it must be withdrawn slowly to avoid this. Transdermal formulations could be preferred but are currently not licensed in the UK. Methyldopa is now rarely used outside pregnancy, due to its poor tolerability and challenges with dose titration. Like clonidine, it should be withdrawn slowly.

Hydralazine and minoxidil are direct acting vasodilators and can cause profound hypotension. Both are licensed in the UK for severe hypertension. Chronic use leads to fluid retention and tachycardia – so-called pseudo-tolerance – which reduces their effectiveness. Hence, they are usually given with β -blockers and loop diuretics to counteract this. Hydralazine can produce a lupus-like syndrome particularly in those genetically defined as slow acetylators, and minoxidil is associated with excess hair growth and, rarely, pericardial effusion.

### FDA warns about serious problems with high doses of the allergy… [^bab44287]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug Safety Communication 09-24-2020 FDA Drug Safety Communication The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that taking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter allergy medicine diphenhydramine can lead to serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death. We are aware of news reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after participating in the "Benadryl Challenge" encouraged in videos posted on the social media application TikTok. Always read the Drug Facts label included on all OTC medicines to find out if they contain diphenhydramine, how much and how often you should take them, and important safety information. Do not take more than the dose listed on the label, as doing so can cause serious problems.

If someone takes too much diphenhydramine and is hallucinating, can't be awakened, has a seizure, has trouble breathing, or has collapsed, immediately get medical attention or contact poison control at 1-800-222-1222 or online. Health care professionals should be aware that the "Benadryl Challenge" is occurring among teens and alert their caregivers about it. Encourage teens and caregivers to read and follow the Drug Facts label. In the event of an overdose, health care professionals should attempt to determine whether a patient with a suspected overdose took diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to temporarily relieve symptoms due to hay fever, upper respiratory allergies, or the common cold, such as runny nose and sneezing. It works by blocking histamine in the body, which is a substance that causes allergic symptoms. When used as recommended, it is a safe and effective medicine.

Diphenhydramine is marketed under the brand-name Benadryl, store brands, and generics. It is also available in combination with pain relievers, fever reducers, and decongestants. We urge health care professionals and consumers to report side effects involving diphenhydramine and other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact FDA" box at the bottom of the page. Health care professionals, patients, and consumers can sign up for email alerts about Drug Safety Communications on medicines or medical specialties of interest to you.

### High blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and lung function in a general adult population [^dbef3f60]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

When reviewing our results, it becomes apparent that from a statistical point of view both high blood pressure and antihypertensive BBL medication have an effect on lung function measurements. But the observed lung function differences between exposed und non-exposed subjects are relatively small, meaning that they have no direct clinical consequence in healthy individuals. However, we could show that among treated but not controlled hypertensive subjects FEV 1 had a lower volume of 160 mL compared to subjects with no high blood pressure and no antihypertensive medication. This finding might be of importance on the population level. One possible explanation for this significant lung function reduction might be an additive effect of both treatment and persistent high blood pressure. However, the cross-sectional study design makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of high blood pressure and antihypertensive medication. Thus, it allows only statements about a single point in time and does not allow evaluating the effect of long-standing high blood pressure. Another explanation for this lung function decrement could be that those with persistent hypertension despite medical treatment have a higher underlying blood pressure compared to effectively treated subject. Moreover, the effects of high blood pressure and antihypertensive medication are highly correlated. A detailed analysis of antihypertensive medication indicates that BBL medication and not any other antihypertensive medication is associated with a reduced lung function. This negative effect of BBL medication still remains, when BBL, other antihypertensive medication and high blood pressure are analysed in the same model. Besides, BBL are the most common prescribed antihypertensive medication and it has to be considered that BBL medication might be prescribed for other indications than hypertension, as for example, coronary heart diseases or heart failure, too. This again suggests that the effect of antihypertensive BBL medication on lung function is mainly ascribed to the medicament and not to the indication. Furthermore, a variety of confounders might affect the association between high blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and lung function. Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for both impaired lung function and high blood pressure and BMI might have an effect on lung function. However, adjustment for these possible confounders did not influence our results. Moreover, we could show that the association was not affected by the concomitance of pulmonary diseases and that the negative effect of BBL medication on lung function is not modified by obstructive lung diseases. This supports our interpretation that BBL have an effect on lung function in the general population. Besides, our results suggest that there may be an effect modification by gender. We could show that in women the percent predicted lung function values did not differ between subjects with and without high blood pressure. Furthermore, the multivariable regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between gender and high blood pressure. This might possibly indicate that high blood pressure has minor effect on lung function in women compared to men.

The antihypertensive efficacy of SULAR was studied in 5 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies, in which over 600 patients were treated with SULAR as monotherapy and about 300 with placebo; 4 of the five studies compared 2 or 3 fixed doses while the fifth allowed titration from doses bioequivalent to 8.5–34 mg. Once daily administration of SULAR produced sustained reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures over the 24 hour dosing interval in both supine and standing positions. The mean placebo-subtracted reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure at trough, 24 hours post-dose, in these studies, are shown below. Changes in standing blood pressure were similar:

In patients receiving atenolol, supine blood pressure reductions with SULAR at doses bioequivalent to 17 and 34 mg once daily were 12/6 and 19/8 mm Hg, respectively. The sustained antihypertensive effect of SULAR was demonstrated by 24 hour blood pressure monitoring and examination of peak and trough effects. The trough/peak ratios ranged from 70 to 100% for diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The mean change in heart rate in these studies was less than one beat per minute. In 4 of the 5 studies, patients received initial doses bioequivalent to 17–25.5 mg SULAR without incident (excessive effects on blood pressure or heart rate). The fifth study started patients on lower doses of SULAR.

Patient race and gender did not influence the blood pressure lowering effect of SULAR. Despite the higher plasma concentration of nisoldipine in the elderly, there was no consistent difference in their blood pressure response except that the lowest clinical dose was somewhat more effective than in non-elderly patients. No postural effect on blood pressure was apparent and there was no evidence of tolerance to the antihypertensive effect of SULAR in patients treated for up to one year.

### The opposing trends of body mass index and blood pressure during 1977–2020; nationwide registry of 2.8 million male and female adolescents [^20ac9a99]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated blood pressure among adolescents has been shown to be associated with future adverse cardiovascular outcomes and early onset diabetes. Most data regarding systolic and diastolic blood pressure trends are based on surveys of selected populations within 10–20-year periods. The goal of this study was to characterize the secular trend of blood pressure given the rising prevalence of adolescent obesity.

Methods

This nationwide population-based study included 2,785,515 Israeli adolescents (41.6% females, mean age 17.4 years) who were medically evaluated and whose weight, height and blood pressure were measured, prior to mandatory military service between 1977 and 2020. The study period was divided into 5-year intervals. Linear regression models were used to describe the P for trend along the time intervals. Analysis of covariance was used to calculate means of blood pressure adjusted for body mass index.

Results

During the study period, the mean body mass index increased by 2.1 and 1.6 kg/m 2 in males and females, respectively (P for trend < 0.001 in both sexes). The mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 3.6 mmHg in males and by 2.9 mmHg in females (P < 0.001 in both sexes). The mean systolic blood pressure increased by 1.6 mmHg in males and decreased by 1.9 mmHg in females. These trends were also consistent when blood pressure values were adjusted to body mass index.

Conclusion

Despite the increase in body mass index over the last four decades, diastolic blood pressure decreased in both sexes while systolic blood pressure increased slightly in males and decreased in females.

### Longitudinal and secular trends in blood pressure among women and men in birth cohorts born between 1905 and 1977: the troms ø study 1979 to 2008 [^5acd8dc6]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

High blood pressure is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Previous studies showing a blood pressure decline in recent decades lack data to follow individuals born in different decades from early and middle adulthood to older age. We investigated changes in age-specific blood pressure by repeated measurements in 37973 women and men born 1905 to 1977 (aged 20–89 years) examined ≤ 5× between 1979 and 2008 in the population-based Tromsø Study. Mixed models were used to estimate time trends. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 1979 to 2008 in both genders in the age groups 30 to 89 years. The decrease was similar in the 80th percentile and the 20th percentile of the population blood pressure distribution. The decrease in systolic blood pressure in age group 40 to 49 years was 10.6 mm Hg in women and 4.5 mm Hg in men. Systolic blood pressure increased with age in women and men born 1920 to 1949, whereas a decrease or flattening of curve was observed in the younger birth cohorts. Thus, we found both time periodic and cohort effects, and trends were more pronounced in women than in men. The findings suggest changes in blood pressure in the population rather than an effect of treatment of high-risk individuals.

### Headaches and the treatment of blood pressure: results from a meta-analysis of 94 randomized placebo-controlled trials with 24, 000 participants [^77e23ac1]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists over whether blood pressure-lowering drugs prevent headache.

Methods and Results

A meta-analysis was carried out of the 94 randomized placebo-controlled trials of 4 different classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs (thiazides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) in fixed doses in which data on headache were reported. There were 17,641 participants who were allocated blood pressure-lowering drugs and 6603 who were allocated placebo. Treatment lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 9.4 and 5.5 mm Hg, respectively, on average. One third fewer people on average reported headache in the treated groups (8.0%) than the placebo groups (12.4%) (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.74; P < 0.001). About 1 in 30 treated persons benefited by having headache prevented. The prevalence of headache was reduced (P < 0.001) in trials of each of the 4 classes of drugs.

Conclusions

Our results show that blood pressure-lowering drugs prevent a significant proportion of headaches. That this effect is seen with pharmacologically unrelated classes of drugs indicates that it is likely to be due to the reduction in blood pressure per se, the only recognized action that the drugs have in common. This in turn indicates that high blood pressure is a cause of headache, but this conclusion is not supported by observational studies of blood pressure and headache. The uncertainty over whether high blood pressure causes headache does not, however, detract from the practical benefits of the use of blood pressure-lowering drugs in preventing headaches and cardiovascular disease.

### Chlorpromazine [^247ea6dc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

[See also ADVERSE REACTIONS].

Symptoms

Primarily symptoms of central nervous system depression to the point of somnolence or coma.

Hypotension and extrapyramidal symptoms.

Other possible manifestations include agitation and restlessness, convulsions, fever, autonomic reactions such as dry mouth and ileus. EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias.

Treatment

It is important to determine other medications taken by the patient since multiple drug therapy is common in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to induce emesis because a dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop that could result in aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine hydrochloride. See prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing respiratory depression.

If administration of a stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended. Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g., picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.

If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory shock should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor, norepinephrine and phenylephrine are most suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine derivatives may reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause a further lowering of blood pressure.

Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are not dialyzable.

### Selegiline hydrochloride (Zelapar) [^77322d0f]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension

Assessments of orthostatic (supine and standing) blood pressures at different times throughout the 12 week study period in two controlled trials showed that the frequency of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and/or > 10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure) was greater with ZELAPAR treatment than with placebo treatment. Patients taking ZELAPAR were most likely to experience a decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks (2 weeks after initiating 2.5 mg ZELAPAR). At that time, the incidence of systolic orthostatic hypotension was about 21% in ZELAPAR-treated patients and 9% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was about 12% in ZELAPAR-treated patients and about 4% in placebo-treated patients. Thus, it appears that there may be an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension in the period after increasing the daily dose of ZELAPAR from 1.25 to 2.5 mg.

The incidence of orthostatic hypotension was higher in geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) than in non-geriatric patients. In the geriatric patients, orthostatic hypotension occurred in about 3% of ZELAPAR-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

5.5 Dyskinesia

ZELAPAR may potentiate dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. In controlled trials, the incidence of dyskinesia was 6% in ZELAPAR-treated patients and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may lessen dyskinesia. The incidence of dyskinesia causing study discontinuation was greater on ZELAPAR than on placebo.

### Effect of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants on blood pressure [^1f645119]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adrenergic agonist oral decongestants are commonly taken daily over long periods of time to relieve sinus and nasal congestion. The mechanism of action of decongestants potentially increases blood pressure, and these effects may be acute or chronic. However, no systematic reviews to date have comprehensively assessed the chronic blood pressure effects of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants as a drug class, despite their widespread non-prescription availability.

Objectives

Primary objective To assess the effects of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants on systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Secondary objective To assess the effects of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants on heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) up to July 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via Cochrane Register of Studies, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There were no language, publication year, or publication status restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of at least seven days' duration with parallel groups (intervention and placebo) comparing adrenergic agonist oral decongestants versus placebo on blood pressure in people aged over six years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JJC and MC) independently assessed the trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias from the included trials. In cases where there were disagreements, the third review author (JMW) adjudicated. For any missing or unclear information in the studies, we contacted the study author to request the missing information or seek clarification. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were heart rate and withdrawal due to adverse effects. We used a fixed-effect model to combine the effect sizes from all studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Five RCTs randomizing 882 participants met the inclusion criteria. The shortest study duration was one week, and the longest study duration was 24 weeks. These studies measured blood pressure and heart rate after one to seven weeks of taking oral decongestants. The largest study included 568 people, and the smallest study included 18 people. The mean age of participants was 20.0 years, with 326 males and 591 females. The studies were conducted in the USA and Europe; most were set in the USA. Pharmaceutical companies funded three of the five included studies. The findings are relevant to all people using adrenergic agonist oral decongestants for seven days or longer regardless of comorbidities or pre-existing conditions. The adrenergic agonist oral decongestants included were ephedrine (one RCT), pseudoephedrine (one RCT), and phenylpropanolamine (three RCTs). Compared to placebo, adrenergic agonist oral decongestants may have little to no effect on systolic blood pressure, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference [MD] 0.91 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.57 to 2.38; 4 RCTs, 784 participants; I² = 54%; very low-certainty evidence). Adrenergic agonist oral decongestants may have little to no effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.44 mmHg, 95% CI -0.59 to 1.48; 5 RCTs, 882 participants; I² = 30%; low-certainty evidence). Adrenergic agonist oral decongestants may have little to no effect on heart rate, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 1.92 beats per minute, 95% CI -0.62 to 4.47; 2 RCTs, 190 participants; I² = 79%; very low-certainty evidence). Adrenergic agonist oral decongestants may have little to no effect on the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio [RR] 1.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.88; 4 RCTs, 806 participants; low-certainty evidence; note 1 study reported withdrawals due to adverse effects but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 3 studies rather than 4). Four studies were at overall high risk of bias, and one study was at overall low risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

In this systematic review, chronic daily intake of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants had little to no effect on blood pressure, heart rate, and withdrawals due to adverse effects. People making decisions about using these medicines should consider the very low certainty of evidence and the theoretical risk of increased blood pressure. Independent trials free from biases that are designed to answer this question are required. The evidence was limited due to the small number of studies, and the blood pressure and heart rate not being measured at the optimal time after drug ingestion.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^8f62e0dc]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations for initiating nOH treatment

There have been no head-to-head comparison studies to guide the initial choice of nOH treatments. An individualized treatment regimen should consider severity, co-morbid disease (especially cardiac or renal failure), and treatment goals. Midodrine has an FDA-approved indication for the treatment of symptomatic OH; FDA approval was based on studies showing an improvement in upright blood pressure as a surrogate for symptom relief. In contrast, the FDA-approved droxidopa with an orphan designation for the treatment of nOH based on studies showing improvement in symptoms of nOH. Patients receiving droxidopa reported a decrease in dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling as if they might black out compared with those receiving placebo. There have been no long-term studies on the durability of the treatment effect for either midodrine or droxidopa. However, a long-term study is underway to study durability of effectiveness with droxidopa (NCT02586623) in patients with nOH for up to 36 weeks of treatment.

Recommendations for changing nOH treatment

Once initial therapy has begun, symptomatic benefit, including impact on activities of daily living, and changes in blood pressure need to be assessed frequently. If symptoms do not improve after reaching maximum labeled dose, it is recommended that the treatment be changed and symptomatic benefit be assessed once more. This process is iterative until either symptomatic benefit is achieved or maximum tolerable dose of the therapy is reached.

Treating nOH — step 4: combination pharmacotherapy

Little data exists to determine efficacy and safety of different combinations of therapy compared to monotherapy for nOH. Based on the experience of the consensus panel, the recommendation is to appropriately titrate to maximum tolerable dose of a single agent and then, if symptomatic benefit is not obtained, consider switching to a different therapy or adding a second agent and titrate from its lowest starting dose.

### Effects of high-versus low-sodium oxybate on blood pressure in patients with narcolepsy [^cb001f86]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

People with narcolepsy are at increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease; excessive sodium intake is linked to both.

METHODS:

We studied patients with narcolepsy and office systolic blood pressures (BPs) of 130 to 155 mm Hg taking twice-nightly high-sodium oxybate for ≥ 6 weeks who switched to low-sodium oxybate at the same dosage. The primary end point was the change from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP at the end of treatment (≈6 weeks after switching). Secondary and exploratory end points included changes in diastolic BP, office BP, and 24-hour sodium excretion.

RESULTS:

Patients (n = 43) had a mean age of 45 years, were 65% female, 33% on antihypertensives, with baseline mean (SD) office BP of 138.0/85.2 (5.7/6.6). Mean (SD) total high- and low-sodium oxybate dosages of 8.0 (1.1) and 8.1 (1.1) g/night, respectively, represented 1456.5 (206.2) and 117.8 (16.3) mg of sodium. The median 24-hour urinary sodium was 4278 mg/d at baseline and 2703 mg/d at the end of treatment (median change, 1288 mg/d). Mean (SE) 24-hour ambulatory systolic BPs at baseline and study end were 132.3 (1.8) and 128.2 (1.8) mm Hg (least-squares mean change, −4.1 [95% CI, −6.9 to −1.4] mm Hg; 1-sided P = 0.0019). BP changes by narcolepsy subtype, sex, body mass index, baseline office BP, and baseline antihypertensive use were consistent with the overall effect size.

CONCLUSIONS:

People with narcolepsy switching from high- to low-sodium oxybate showed substantially reduced daily medication-related sodium intake and significant 24-hour BP reductions. These results demonstrate the importance of reducing pharmaceutical sodium content in this elevated cardiovascular risk patient population.

### Comparison of diphenhydramine and modafinil on arousal and autonomic functions in healthy volunteers [^c146be45]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Arousal is regulated by the interplay between wakefulness- and sleep-promoting nuclei. Major wakefulness-promoting nuclei are the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) of the hypothalamus and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) of the pons, which also play a role in autonomic regulation. First generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are likely to cause sedation by blocking excitatory H1 histamine receptors in the cerebral cortex, and the anti-narcolepsy drug modafinil may promote wakefulness by activating the locus coeruleus. We compared the effects of single doses of diphenhydramine (75 mg) and modafinil (200 mg) on arousal and autonomic functions in 16 healthy male volunteers, using a placebo-controlled, balanced, double-blind design. Arousal was assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), visual analogue scales (VAS) and pupillary fatigue waves (Pupillographic Sleepiness Test (PST)). Autonomic functions measured included resting pupil diameter, light and darkness reflex responses, blood pressure, heart rate and salivation. Data were analysed with ANOVA, with multiple comparisons. Diphenhydramine had sedative effects as shown by reductions in CFFF, VAS alertness ratings and increases of the indices of pupillary fatigue. Modafinil had alerting effects as indicated by reductions in the measures of pupillary fatigue. Comparison of pre-post medication changes in pupil diameter showed a decrease after diphenhydramine and an increase after modafinil. Diphenhydramine reduced salivation, and modafinil increased systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, diphenhydramine and modafinil evoked opposite effects on arousal and sympathetic functions, which are likely to reflect their interaction with the central histaminergic and noradrenergic systems. Hyposalivation by diphenhydramine is likely to be due to its additional anticholinergic property.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of reserpine for primary hypertension [^6926b3d4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many antihypertensive agents exist today for the treatment of primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, or both). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been carried out to investigate the evidence for these agents. There is, for example, strong RCT evidence that thiazides reduce mortality and morbidity. Some of those trials used reserpine as a second-line therapy. However, the dose-related blood pressure reduction with this agent is not known.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to quantify the dose-related efficacy of reserpine versus placebo or no treatment in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP), or both. We also aimed to evaluate the dose-related effects of reserpine on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), as well as the dose-related effects on withdrawals due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 to October 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2016), Embase (January 1974 to October 2016), and ClinicalTrials.gov (all dates to October 2016). We also traced citations in the reference sections of the retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were truly randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing reserpine monotherapy to placebo or no treatment in participants with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed methods of randomisation and concealment. We extracted and analysed data on blood pressure reduction, heart rate, and withdrawal due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found four RCTs (with a total of 237 participants) that met the inclusion criteria, none of which we found through the 2016 update search. The overall pooled effect demonstrates a statistically significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in participants taking reserpine compared with placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) -7.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.05 to -1.78). Because of significant heterogeneity across the trials, a significant effect in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) could not be found. A dose of reserpine 0.5 mg/day or greater achieved the SBP effects. However, we could not determine the dose-response pattern because of the small number of trials. We did not combine data from the trial that investigated Rauwiloid against placebo with reserpine data from the remaining three trials. This is because Rauwiloid is a different alkaloid extract of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina, and the dose used is not comparable to reserpine. None of the included trials reported withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Reserpine is effective in reducing SBP roughly to the same degree as other first-line antihypertensive drugs. However, we could not make definite conclusions regarding the dose-response pattern because of the small number of included trials. More RCTs are needed to assess the effects of reserpine on blood pressure and to determine the dose-related safety profile before the role of this drug in the treatment of primary hypertension can be established.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^6bcfd53c]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Quantitative linking of blood pressure reduction and disease prevention

An important result from our analysis is that results from the meta-analysis of trials of drugs on blood pressure reduction linked to the cohort studies meta-analysis (differences in risk of CHD events and stroke for specified differences in blood pressure) accurately predict the results of the present trials meta-analysis, indicating that blood pressure reduction in itself explains the preventive effect of the drugs. With the possible minor additional effect of calcium channel blockers in preventing stroke the five classes of drugs were equally effective in lowering blood pressure (confirming previous work) and equally effective in preventing CHD events and stroke (figs 3 and 4). A possible explanation for the greater effect of calcium channel blockers on the risk of strokeis the observation that although the different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs reduce peripheral arterial pressure to a similar extent, the reduction in central aortic pressure appears greater with calcium channel blockers and lower with β blockers than with the other three classes of drug. But it is not a persuasive argument because any additional reduction in central aortic pressure should also confer greater prevention against CHD than with other drugs but this was not observed (figs 3 and 4). Thus with the exception of β blockers after acute myocardial infarction and the minor additional effect of calcium channel blockers in reducing the risk of stroke, blood pressure reduction explains the action of the drugs in preventing CHD and stroke; the results thus exclude the blood pressure lowering drugs in general having material pleiotropic effects.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure of patients

In the intervention group, comparing the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the sixth months after discharge and at the initial phase of admission, it differed with a statistical significance (P < 0.05). However, in the control group, only systolic blood pressure was significantly lower than the initial phase of admission (P < 0.05).

In the twelfth months after discharge, the mean intervention group systolic blood pressure decreased by 9.47 mm Hg compared with the initial phase of admission, and the control group decreased by 3.64 mm Hg. The difference of the mean systolic blood pressure between the control and the intervention group (6.56 mm Hg) was statistically significant (P = 0.023). Compared with the initial phase of admission, the mean diastolic blood pressure of the intervention group and the control group decreased by 11.1 mm Hg and 3.7 mm Hg, respectively. The mean diastolic blood pressure change of the control group and the intervention group (7.4 mm Hg) was significantly different (P < 0.001). The results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults aged 18 to 59 years [^de8fe106]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and renal failure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. Systematic reviews have shown proven benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but most of the evidence is in people 60 years of age and older. We wanted to know what the effects of therapy are in people 18 to 59 years of age.

Objectives

To quantify antihypertensive drug effects on all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension. To quantify effects on cardiovascular mortality plus morbidity (including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality plus morbidity), withdrawal due adverse events and estimate magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lowering at one year.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to January 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year' duration comparing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with a placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension defined as SBP 140 mmHg or greater or DBP 90 mmHg or greater at baseline, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular (CVS) mortality plus morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse events, and decrease in SBP and DBP. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a fixed-effect model to combine outcomes across trials. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and a random-effects model as there was significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

The population in the seven included studies (17,327 participants) were predominantly healthy adults with mild to moderate primary hypertension. The Medical Research Council Trial of Mild Hypertension contributed 14,541 (84%) of total randomized participants, with mean age of 50 years and mean baseline blood pressure of 160/98 mmHg and a mean duration of follow-up of five years. Treatments used in this study were bendrofluazide 10 mg daily or propranolol 80 mg to 240 mg daily with addition of methyldopa if required. The risk of bias in the studies was high or unclear for a number of domains and led us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes. Based on five studies, antihypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or untreated control may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality (2.4% with control vs 2.3% with treatment; low quality evidence; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.13). Based on 4 studies, the effects on coronary heart disease were uncertain due to low quality evidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.19). Low quality evidence from six studies showed that drug therapy may reduce total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity from 4.1% to 3.2% over five years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (1.3% with control vs 0.6% with treatment; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Very low quality evidence from three studies showed that withdrawals due to adverse events were higher with drug therapy from 0.7% to 3.0% (RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.92). The effects on blood pressure varied between the studies and we are uncertain as to how much of a difference treatment makes on average.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drugs used to treat predominantly healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension have a small absolute effect to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity primarily due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. All-cause mortality and coronary heart disease were not reduced. There is lack of good evidence on withdrawal due to adverse events. Future trials in this age group should be at least 10 years in duration and should compare different first-line drug classes and strategies.

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) — prevention and orthostatic hypotension management: In type 1 diabetes (T1D), intensive glucose control reduced CAN risk with a 45% reduction, with benefits persisting as a 30% reduction in incident CAN over an additional 14 years of follow-up; in type 2 diabetes (T2D), a multifactorial intervention achieved a 63% reduction in CAN progression. As CAN advances, patients may have resting tachycardia with fixed heart rate (> 100 bpm) and orthostatic hypotension defined as a fall in systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) by > 20 mm Hg or > 10 mm Hg upon standing. For orthostatic hypotension, pharmacological therapy includes midodrine and droxidopa (both FDA approved), and it is recommended to proceed with very slow titration using the minimally effective dose; in selected severe cases, low-dose fludrocortisone may also be an option.
