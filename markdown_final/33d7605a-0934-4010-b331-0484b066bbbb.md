## Question

Parathyroid Hormone (Pth), Intact	258.6 High

next tests to order

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next tests to order to evaluate a markedly elevated parathyroid hormone level of 258.6 pg/mL and structure the next diagnostic steps with appropriate imaging and monitoring guidance based on current guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the calcium–PTH relationship because classification hinges on whether calcium is high, normal, or low. Then, I should verify vitamin D status and renal function to exclude secondary causes. Next, I will consider urinary calcium assessment and the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio to differentiate familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism. After confirming a biochemical diagnosis, I will plan localization imaging for surgical candidates. I will also assess skeletal and renal complications, review medications, and decide whether genetic testing is warranted in select scenarios, while outlining an ordered timeline for testing and follow-up

> Let me first confirm the calcium–PTH relationship because interpretation of a PTH of 258.6 pg/mL depends entirely on concomitant calcium status; I need an adjusted total calcium now, and if normocalcemic disease is suspected, an ionized calcium on at least two occasions 3–6 months apart to establish hypercalcemic versus normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, since both require inappropriately normal or elevated intact PTH for diagnosis [^115mxSJ5] [^114KmBRe] [^113LrxeF].

> Wait, let me verify vitamin D status before I label this as primary hyperparathyroidism, because vitamin D deficiency frequently causes secondary hyperparathyroidism and also coexists with PHPT, altering PTH levels and masking calcium status; I should measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D and replete if low while reassessing calcium and PTH after repletion as recommended by major guidelines [^notfound] [^113LrxeF].

> I need to check kidney function next, because chronic kidney disease is a common driver of secondary hyperparathyroidism and can markedly elevate PTH; measuring creatinine and estimating GFR or creatinine clearance is necessary now, and I should be cautious interpreting very high PTH in CKD, where assay variability and PTH fragment accumulation complicate interpretation, favoring trend-based assessment within CKD-specific frameworks rather than absolute cutoffs [^113LrxeF] [^111g74q9].

> Next, I should review phosphorus and magnesium, because phosphorus tends to be low to normal in PHPT and abnormalities can shift my differential toward secondary causes; obtaining serum phosphorus and magnesium alongside calcium and PTH provides essential context for parathyroid physiology and for planning safe repletion if needed [^113LrxeF] [^114fQoUh].

> Hold on, I should verify urinary calcium handling to exclude familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia before proceeding to surgery considerations; ordering a 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine allows calculation of the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio, where a value less than 0.01 favors FHH and should prompt consideration of CaSR pathway genetics, while higher values with hypercalcemia support PHPT, as emphasized by the Workshop and consensus statements [^111aZ7bs] [^114DBWVe] [^11359pDe].

> Let me consider the timing of imaging carefully; I almost moved to localization now, but wait, that would be premature — both AAES and the Fifth International Workshop state that imaging is for localization after a biochemical diagnosis is established, not for diagnosis itself, so I should defer neck ultrasound, sestamibi, or 4D-CT until PHPT is confirmed biochemically and surgery is planned [^1132GipD] [^112goaqb] [^114QRTai].

> I should assess skeletal involvement because PHPT has direct effects on bone; obtaining a DEXA scan at the lumbar spine, total hip, and distal one-third radius is recommended, with vertebral imaging or trabecular bone score as appropriate, to inform surgical decision-making and establish a baseline for monitoring if nonoperative management is chosen [^114QRTai] [^1145Xcuv].

> I will now examine renal sequelae, since nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis can be silent; if clinically indicated, I should obtain renal imaging to evaluate for stones or nephrocalcinosis and document end-organ involvement that may influence the urgency of parathyroidectomy or follow-up strategies [^115JXTye] [^111MsztM].

> But wait, what if the calcium is normal and PTH is persistently high — could this be normocalcemic PHPT; I should double-check that adjusted total and ionized calcium are normal on at least two occasions 3–6 months apart and ensure all secondary causes — vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, low calcium intake, and medications — are excluded before making that diagnosis, per the Workshop guidance [^114KmBRe] [^113LrxeF].

> Next, I should review medications and clinical context that can raise calcium or PTH inappropriately; thiazide diuretics and lithium can raise calcium and mimic or unmask PHPT, and supplements with calcium or vitamin D can confound interpretation, so I need to reconcile the medication list and consider holding or retesting off offending agents when feasible [^114DBWVe] [^113LrxeF].

> I need to ensure I plan genetic testing selectively, not reflexively; patients younger than about 35–40 years, with a family history of hypercalcemia or parathyroid disease, multigland disease, or atypical features warrant evaluation for MEN1, CDC73/HRPT2, RET, CaSR, GNA11, or AP2S1 variants, and FHH suspicion specifically supports CaSR pathway testing to avoid unnecessary surgery [^115K4TYH] [^11359pDe].

> Let me think about the PTH assay nuances briefly; although second- versus third-generation assay differences and fragment interference can be clinically relevant in CKD, in classic hypercalcemic PHPT the diagnostic construct rests more on the inappropriateness of PTH relative to calcium than on an absolute PTH value, so assay generation typically does not alter diagnosis or management, even though I should try to use the same assay longitudinally for consistency [^111g74q9].

> I should confirm the immediate test ordering sequence to be pragmatic and safe; today I would repeat adjusted total calcium and obtain ionized calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, creatinine with eGFR, intact PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, then, if PHPT is biochemically confirmed, proceed within days to a 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine for hypercalciuria assessment and Ca/Cr clearance ratio, followed by DEXA and, if surgery is planned, high-resolution neck ultrasound as the initial localization study [^113LrxeF] [^114fQoUh] [^112goaqb].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging strategy alignment with surgical planning; if ultrasound is negative or discordant, I would consider technetium-99m sestamibi or contrast-enhanced 4D-CT based on local expertise, keeping in mind that negative or discordant imaging does not preclude referral for parathyroidectomy by an experienced endocrine surgeon [^112goaqb] [^116cAxbj] [^114QRTai].

> If surgery is deferred, I need to outline monitoring; annual serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, periodic PTH as clinically indicated, DEXA at one- to two-year intervals unless bone density is normal, and renal surveillance including creatinine clearance and targeted imaging or 24-hour urinary calcium as indicated are recommended to detect progression or complications [^1145Xcuv].

> Finally, let me reconsider the differential once more before concluding; severe hypercalcemia should always raise flags for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, but in the presence of an inappropriately elevated PTH the leading diagnosis is PHPT or, less commonly, tertiary hyperparathyroidism in longstanding CKD, with FHH as a key mimic that I must exclude using the urinary calcium metrics and clinical context before committing to surgery [^115mxSJ5] [^114DBWVe].

For a PTH of 258.6 pg/mL, order **serum calcium (total and ionized)**, **25-hydroxyvitamin D**, **serum phosphorus**, **serum creatinine and eGFR**, and **24-hour urine calcium** to confirm PHPT and exclude secondary causes [^113LrxeF] [^111aZ7bs] [^114fQoUh]. If PHPT is confirmed, obtain a **DEXA scan** and **renal imaging** (ultrasound or CT) to assess complications, and use **neck ultrasound and sestamibi** for surgical planning [^112goaqb] [^1145Xcuv] [^114QRTai]. Consider **genetic testing** if familial disease is suspected [^115K4TYH].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

### Serum calcium (total and ionized)

Total serum calcium should be measured and corrected for albumin to confirm **hypercalcemia** — the hallmark of PHPT [^113LrxeF]. Obtain **ionized calcium** if total calcium is normal but PHPT is suspected, as it is the physiologically active fraction [^113LrxeF].

---

### Serum phosphorus

Serum phosphorus is typically **low-normal or low** in PHPT due to renal phosphate wasting, whereas secondary hyperparathyroidism often shows normal or high levels [^113LrxeF].

---

### Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

Serum creatinine and **eGFR** should be measured to assess renal function, exclude CKD-related secondary hyperparathyroidism, and guide management [^113LrxeF].

---

### 25-hydroxyvitamin D

Measure **25-hydroxyvitamin D** to exclude deficiency — a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism — and correct any deficiency before confirming PHPT [^113LrxeF].

---

### 24-hour urinary calcium excretion

A 24-hour urinary **calcium** test helps differentiate PHPT (usually > 200 mg/day) from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH, typically < 100 mg/day).

---

## Imaging studies

### Bone mineral density assessment

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (**DEXA**) is used to evaluate bone loss at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and distal radius; cortical bone loss is typical in PHPT [^1145Xcuv].

---

### Renal imaging

Renal **ultrasound** or **CT** can detect nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, which are common complications of PHPT [^111MsztM].

---

### Parathyroid gland imaging

- **Neck ultrasound**: First-line to localize abnormal glands and assess thyroid pathology [^112goaqb].
- **Technetium-99m sestamibi scan**: Localize adenomas or hyperplasia, especially for surgery [^114QRTai].
- **Four-dimensional CT (4D-CT)**: Use if ultrasound and sestamibi are inconclusive or for reoperative planning [^114QRTai].

---

## Additional tests and considerations

### Genetic testing

Consider **genetic testing** for MEN1, RET, or CaSR mutations if familial hyperparathyroidism or FHH is suspected.

---

### Medication review

Medication review should identify thiazides, lithium, or calcium/vitamin D supplements that can affect calcium/PTH and confound diagnosis [^114DBWVe].

---

### Repeat PTH measurement

Repeat **PTH** to confirm persistent elevation and exclude assay variability or transient causes.

---

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: Does assay generation matter [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to varying extents by different generations of PTH assays. These variations are due to differences in fragments recognized and lack of assay standardization. PTH measurement is crucial in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines provide recommendations on these measurements.

This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, focusing on the application of distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and the perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines address PTH measurement in various ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase of the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value.

For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the type of PTH assay utilized does not affect diagnosis or management, as the precise concentration of PTH is less critical. In chronic kidney disease, guidelines recommend treating secondary hyperparathyroidism when there is an increase in PTH between twofold to ninefold. This variation results in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used.

For patients post-bariatric surgery, guidelines specify absolute cutoff values for PTH. However, the impact of different assay generations remains unknown because direct comparisons of PTH assays have not been conducted. During parathyroid surgery, measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more swiftly than second-generation assays. There is an increased need for clinicians to be aware of these assay differences and their implications.

### Preoperative normal level of parathyroid hormone signifies an early and mild form of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115mZy4S]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Contemporary patients are often diagnosed with mild or intermittent hypercalcemia. In addition, most studies demonstrate patients with parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the upper normal range. The aim of the present investigation was to define subgroups of patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), which could be of importance in the decision for, or against surgical treatment.

Two hundred and eleven patients operated on for pHPT were investigated with biochemical variables known to reflect PTH activity, renal function, and bone mineral content. The preoperative diagnosis of pHPT was based on the presence of hypercalcemia combined with an inappropriate serum concentration of PTH. The mean age of the patients was 64 ± 14 years, and the mean serum level of calcium was 2.78 ± 0.19 mmol/L.

- **Patient groups**:
		- One hundred and sixty-two patients (77%) had raised levels of calcium and PTH the day before surgery (overt pHPT).
		- Twenty-five patients (12%) had a normal level of calcium and a raised PTH level (normal calcium group).
		- Twenty patients (9%) had a raised level of calcium and a normal level of PTH (normal PTH group).
		- In four patients, the level of calcium and PTH was normal.

Between-group analysis demonstrated no major difference in symptoms and signs of pHPT, except for lower adenoma weight. Patients in the normal calcium group did not essentially differ from the patients in the overt pHPT group. However, patients in the normal PTH group were a decade younger and had better renal function, lower bone turnover, and preserved bone density compared with patients in the overt pHPT group.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the third international workshop [^112xV7fq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to guide the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: Interested professional societies selected a representative for the consensus committee and provided funding for a one-day meeting. A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed, and the conclusions were then circulated to the participating professional societies.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that:
	1. Reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals.
	2. Second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT.
	3. DNA sequence testing can be useful in familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.
	4. Normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia.
	5. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course.
	6. The estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of renal function.

This structured approach and consensus-driven conclusions aim to improve the diagnostic accuracy and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism.

### The diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^112J6QyU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Classical primary hyperparathyroidism — a disease of 'bones, stones, and psychic groans' — is a rarity in the US, although it is still seen in some parts of the world. Today, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. This change in clinical profile is not merely because of improved detection techniques. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who lack symptoms, if left untreated, rarely develop the 'classical' features that were common previously. Indeed, currently available data suggest that there is a disorder today with different, yet characteristic, effects on the end-organs of the hyperparathyroid process.

In this review, the features of the skeletal, renal, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations of 'asymptomatic' primary hyperparathyroidism are discussed. The considerable body of data that has emerged since the recognition of the new clinical profile of primary hyperparathyroidism has allowed a reconsideration of standards of care for this disease. These data were reviewed and incorporated into new clinical guidelines at the 2002 NIH workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. These recommendations highlight both what is known about the disease and important areas that need investigation. Continued interest in the skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease and therapeutic trials of medical approaches for its management will further refine our understanding and could lead to additional modifications in the approach to patients with this common endocrine disorder.

### Calcitriol [^113c5Ubv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

For dialysis patients, serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase should be determined periodically. For hypoparathyroid patients, serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium should be determined periodically. For predialysis patients, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) should be determined initially. Thereafter, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine should be determined monthly for a six-month period and then periodically. Intact PTH (iPTH) should be determined every 3 to 4 months at the time of visits. During the titration period of treatment with calcitriol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly.

### Parsabiv [^114Ci2sE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Monitoring and dose adjustment**: Monitor corrected serum calcium and PTH levels during dose initiation, dose adjustment, and dose maintenance according to the schedule in Table 1.

Titrate Parsabiv dose based on PTH and corrected serum calcium response. At the maintenance dose, PTH levels should be within the recommended target range, and corrected serum calcium should be within the normal range. Increase the dose of Parsabiv in 2.5 mg or 5 mg increments in individuals with corrected serum calcium within the normal range and PTH levels above the recommended target range based on the patient's PTH levels. Dose adjustments should be made no more frequently than every 4 weeks, up to a maximum dose of 15 mg three times per week.

Decrease or temporarily discontinue Parsabiv dosing in individuals with PTH levels below the target range. In individuals with a corrected serum calcium below the lower limit of normal but at or above 7.5 mg/dL without symptoms of hypocalcemia, consider decreasing or temporarily discontinuing Parsabiv or use concomitant therapies to increase corrected serum calcium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If the dose is stopped, then re-initiate Parsabiv at a lower dose when the PTH is within the target range, and hypocalcemia has been corrected.

Stop Parsabiv and treat hypocalcemia if the corrected serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL or patients report symptoms of hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. When the corrected serum calcium is within normal limits, symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved, and predisposing factors for hypocalcemia have been addressed, re-initiate Parsabiv.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). Natpara is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, because it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Natpara was not studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations, nor in those who develop sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is unknown if Natpara is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger. Natpara should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in Natpara. Before starting Natpara, inform your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions. See the end of this medication guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with elevated PTH levels following successful exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism [^115zy7U5]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Several studies have documented elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after seemingly successful exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). It is not known if this is a transient phenomenon after pHPT surgery or if it predisposes to recurrent disease. A series of 99 consecutive patients with pHPT who had solitary parathyroid adenomas were followed for 5 years. Serum levels of PTH and biochemical variables reflecting PTH activity were measured before operation, at 8 weeks postoperatively, and then yearly for 5 years. All patients were normocalcemic after exploration. At 8 weeks after operation, 28% of the patients had elevated serum PTH levels; at 5 years, this figure decreased to 16%.

During the 5-year follow-up, one group of patients normalized their PTH levels, another group's PTH levels fluctuated, and still another group had consistently normal PTH levels. Patients with fluctuating PTH levels had increased levels of serum calcium and phosphate. Some of these patients (15%) showed signs of impaired renal function. Two patients with consistently elevated PTH levels showed signs of mild renal dysfunction, and one of them developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism (reHPT). Elevated PTH levels after successful parathyroid surgery is not a transient phenomenon. An increased risk for recurrent disease is postulated for some of the patients who do not normalize their PTH levels postoperatively, and long-term surveillance of these patients is suggested.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^116x19Eg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the overall pivotal trial, a greater proportion of patients on NATPARA had albumin-corrected serum calcium above the normal range (8.4 to 10.6 mg/dL). During the entire trial duration, three patients on NATPARA and one patient on placebo had a calcium level above 12 mg/dL. More patients randomized to NATPARA experienced hypercalcemia in both study phases. Notably, all trial participants underwent a 50% reduction in the active vitamin D dose at randomization.

Table 3 displays the number of subjects who had albumin-corrected serum calcium levels above the normal range (8.4 to 10.6 mg/dL) by study treatment period in the placebo-controlled study, based on routine monitoring at each trial visit.

Table 4 displays the number of subjects who had albumin-corrected serum calcium levels below 8.4 mg/dL by treatment period in the placebo-controlled study, based on routine monitoring at each trial visit. More patients randomized to placebo had hypocalcemia of less than 7 mg/dL in the titration phase. In contrast, more patients randomized to NATPARA experienced hypocalcemia of less than 7 mg/dL in the dose maintenance phase.

The risk of hypocalcemia increases when NATPARA is withdrawn. At the trial's end, both NATPARA and placebo were withdrawn, and calcium and active vitamin D were returned to baseline doses. Subjects were followed for 4 weeks, during which more patients previously randomized to NATPARA experienced albumin-corrected serum calcium values of less than 7 mg/dL.

### Elevated parathyroid hormone levels after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^1123e2Ry]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Curative parathyroidectomy is associated with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) along with eucalcemia. This study sought to determine the frequency, clinical significance, and risk factors of this finding.

- **Methods**: Seventy-six consecutive patients surgically treated for primary hyperparathyroidism due to a single parathyroid adenoma in 2006 to 2007 were monitored for 1 month postoperatively; those with elevated PTH levels (> 70 pg/mL) were monitored for 18 months.

- **Results**: Nineteen patients (25%) had high postoperative PTH levels with normal calcium levels. Compared with the remaining patients, this group had a significantly higher average preoperative PTH level (224.89 vs. 156.86 pg/mL) and a lesser intraoperative decrease in PTH.

- **Conclusions**: About 25% of eucalcemic patients may have elevated PTH levels after parathyroidectomy. A high preoperative PTH level (> 225 pg/mL) may predict a persistently high postoperative level. Evaluation of blood and urine calcium, bone density, and cardiac function should be considered in affected patients.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the Fifth International Workshop [^1132GipD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in terms of preoperative thyroid evaluation, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining preoperative imaging in patients undergoing parathyroid surgery to locate abnormal parathyroid glands. Preoperative imaging should not be obtained for diagnostic purposes.

### Variation in parathyroid hormone immunoassay results — a critical governance issue in the management of chronic kidney disease [^1166cEv7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The PTH standardization meeting in September 2010 brought together experts from renal and laboratory medicine and most global companies currently marketing PTH immunoassays. Consensus on how to address the issues outlined above was reached.

- **Short-term priorities**: It was agreed that raising awareness of the clinical implications of assay-related differences in PTH results is the first priority. A systematic review of the literature relating to pre-analytical requirements for PTH should be undertaken with the aim of publishing good practice guidelines to minimize variability associated with differences in patient preparation, sample handling, and storage. Achieving national (or ideally international) agreement about the units in which PTH results are reported would also be highly desirable to minimize the risk of confusion. Molar units have already been accepted and implemented as the preferred unit in Scotland, with adoption throughout the UK recommended.

Achieving agreement on and then adopting assay-specific PTH action limits for CKD patients will improve comparability of clinical practice with respect to the use of PTH results produced by assays, pending a re-standardization of PTH methods using the newest IS. The Scottish Renal Registry, in collaboration with the Scottish Clinical Biochemistry Managed Diagnostic Network, has now proactively implemented the assay-specific target values derived.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism, characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic, but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within the normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removing the parathyroid gland or glands, but identifying patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### The evolution of assays for parathyroid hormone [^116VWSQ2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Recent progress in the assay of parathyroid hormone has revealed that commercially available assays for intact parathyroid hormone also measure additional parathyroid hormone peptides that appear to be truncated at the amino-terminal region and have the elution position on high-performance liquid chromatography of parathyroid hormone 7–84. Specific assays have been developed that measure only the true or 'whole' 84-amino-acid peptide. Such 'whole' parathyroid hormone assays have led to the discovery of new findings that suggest that parathyroid hormone fragments, such as parathyroid hormone 7–84, which have hitherto been considered to be biologically inactive, may actually have biologic effects. These data, coupled with the emerging discovery of additional receptors for parathyroid hormone peptides, suggest that parathyroid hormone fragments might have potentially important actions, at least in the setting of renal failure.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^115vm6iU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Comparison of postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH), adjusted calcium levels, follow-up period, and recurrence rate between those who had normal PTH levels 6 months after parathyroidectomy (group A) and those who had elevated PTH 6 months after parathyroidectomy (group B) is crucial to understanding outcomes.

- **PTH parathyroid hormone, Ca adjusted Ca**: The P value is .05 when compared with the relative postoperative 6-month PTH.

Figure 1 shows the change in mean postoperative PTH level on Day 1, at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years after parathyroidectomy in groups A and B. In both groups, there was a significant rise in PTH from postoperative Day 1 to 3 months. However, after 6 months, there were no significant changes in PTH in group A, whereas there was a significant drop in group B.

Postoperative PTH elevation appeared to peak at 3–6 months in group B. In the first 2 postoperative years, only 78 patients (48.4%) maintained normal postoperative PTH levels over the entire cohort. Moreover, 75 patients (46.6%) had elevated PTH levels on at least one occasion and 8 (5.0%) had persistently elevated PTH on all occasions. On further analysis, in group B, 26 of 55 patients (47.3%) showed normalized PTH at 12 months, while in group A, 10 of 86 patients (11.6%) had an elevated PTH at 12 months. Overall, the proportion of patients with normalized PTH increased from 62.5% at 6 months to 78.7% at 2 years, although at 2 years the difference in PTH level was still significant between the two groups.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to specialists, despite the lack of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still had an imbalance of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation; thus, the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Pth assays in dialysis patients: Practical considerations [^116dhRUW]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1–84 is the main biologically active hormone produced by the parathyroid cells. Circulating PTH molecules include the whole PTH 1–84 along with amino (N) and carboxyl (C) terminal fragments. While PTH is the best available noninvasive biomarker to assess bone turnover in dialysis patients, the biological roles of individual circulating PTH fragments are still not completely known.

The understanding that there is an enormous variation in the target specificity of currently available PTH assays for different circulating forms of PTH has led to the evolution of assays from first to second, then third generation. With a reduction in kidney function, there is a preferential increase in circulating C fragments and non-PTH 1–84 forms, resulting in a decrease in the ratio of PTH 1–84/non-PTH 1–84. However, there are also substantial differences in between-assay measurements, with several-fold variations in results.

Targets based on multiples of the upper limit of normal (ULN) should be used rather than PTH ranges using absolute iPTH values. At the time of writing, the second-generation PTH remains the most widely used assay. Guidelines recommend following iPTH trends rather than absolute values.

Herein, we highlight problems and challenges in PTH assays, measurements, and their interpretations in dialysis patients.

### Diagnosis and management of pseudohypoparathyroidism and related disorders: First international consensus statement [^116LqUBn]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) and related disorders are associated with a spectrum of abnormal physical characteristics as well as neurocognitive and endocrine abnormalities. These issues are primarily caused by molecular defects that impair hormonal signaling via receptors coupled through the α-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (G s α) to activation of adenylyl cyclase.

Upon ligand binding — shown as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) — the G protein-coupled PTH/PTHrP receptor type 1 (PTHR1) activates the heterotrimeric G s protein. The G s α subunit triggers the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to cAMP synthesis. Subsequently, cAMP binds to the regulatory 1 A subunits (R) of protein kinase A (PKA), the predominant effector of cAMP. When cAMP binds, the catalytic subunits (C) dissociate from the R subunits and phosphorylate numerous target proteins, including cAMP-responsive element-binding proteins (CREB) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), such as PDE3A and PDE4D. CREB activates the transcription of cAMP-responsive genes, while intracellular cAMP is deactivated by PDEs like PDE4D and PDE3A.

The main clinical features of PHP and related disorders are due to molecular defects within the PTH–PTHrP signaling pathway, with the possible exception of ectopic ossification. Diseases caused by alterations in the genes encoding the indicated proteins are noted within blue boxes in the original figure.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^114KmBRe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism by confirming normal adjusted total calcium and normal ionized calcium levels, along with elevated intact PTH levels. This should be done using either a second or third-generation assay on at least two occasions over 3–6 months after excluding all alternative causes for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, contributing to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation if these are properly searched for. It is still unclear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcemia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progression of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, medications, and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^115mxSJ5]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism based on an elevated serum calcium level adjusted for albumin, in conjunction with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH level. This should be assessed using either a second or third generation assay on two occasions at least two weeks apart.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic.

Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both.

More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^112Yiz5z]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. During 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, conducting new blood tests, and performing clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^115PLRtA]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and elevated intact FGF23 levels. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting, and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life.

Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular, phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients.

FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets, and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D synthesis.

### The parathyroid hormone assay [^114XrVse]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the history and application of laboratory assays for the measurement of parathyroid hormone.

- **Methods**: Pertinent literature documenting the development of the parathyroid hormone assay was reviewed.

- **Results**: Following its introduction in 1963, the parathyroid hormone assay has evolved into a highly sensitive and specific test. It is now a rapid (less than 20 minutes), relatively inexpensive modality that can be performed without the use of radioactive isotopes. However, the assays commonly used today in clinical practice are still susceptible to certain types of interference and artifacts.

- **Conclusions**: In-house measurement of parathyroid hormone, as well as intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring, is now widely available to clinicians in most larger hospitals. This accessibility has greatly facilitated the study and understanding of primary hyperparathyroidism. Despite assay improvements, the measurement of parathyroid hormone in patients with renal disease remains problematic.

Regarding the medical management of X-linked hypophosphatemia, specifically in managing tertiary hyperparathyroidism, the XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend that patients with elevated PTH levels on therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D should increase the dose of active vitamin D and/or decrease the dose of oral phosphate supplements. In cases of persistent hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia, reduce or stop active vitamin D and phosphate supplements. For adult patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, consider administering active vitamin D without phosphate supplements if careful follow-up is guaranteed. If possible, consider switching these patients to burosumab therapy.

### Parathyroid hormone, a uremic toxin [^114uNZWk]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the innovations in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, there are uremic patients with marked elevation in PTH levels. Uremic toxicity is, in part, attributable to the excess of circulating PTH. It has been known for many years that PTH may induce changes in cell calcium, a key intracellular signal required for normal cell function. The effect of PTH in dialysis patients is not limited to bone; this review summarizes the diverse biological effects of PTH.

- **Presence of different circulating PTH fragments**: This review addresses the presence of various circulating PTH fragments in uremic patients.
- **PTH assays**: The PTH assays currently utilized to measure circulating PTH are discussed.
- **Effects in uremic patients**: Some effects of PTH seen in uremic patients may be due to the interaction of the C-terminal PTH fragment with putative C-terminal PTH receptors.

### Pth — a particularly tricky hormone: Why measure it at all in kidney patients [^114ggsGk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations are commonly measured in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as PTH concentration elevation is typical in this clinical context. Much has been inferred from this raised PTH concentration tendency, both about the state of skeletal integrity and health and also about the potential clinical outcomes for patients. However, we feel that reliance on PTH concentrations alone is a dangerous substitute for the search for, and use of, more precise and reliable biomarkers. In this article, we rehearse these arguments, bringing together patient-level and analytical considerations for the first time.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium levels, and a careful history should be taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of malabsorption syndromes. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. This brief review describes the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### The utility of the Cl:PO4 ratio in patients with variant versions of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115jSq6v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the significance and impact of additional chloride testing as part of a diagnostic laboratory test battery for borderline primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT).

The study design was a retrospective database review of parathyroidectomy patients. The setting was a tertiary care, academic health sciences center.

Patients referred to a head and neck endocrine clinic for evaluation and treatment for pHPT were included. After exclusions, there were a total of 226 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism with the requisite preoperative and postoperative labs. Seventy-seven additional patients who had a thyroid operation for a nonmalignant cause were included as controls. Of the 303 total patients, 166 had normal calcium levels (106 mmol/L). Of the 47 patients with normal calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (< 88 pg/mL), 6 (12.8%) had hyperchloremia, and of the 118 patients with normocalcemic pHPT, 48 (40.7%) were hyperchloremic. The area under the curve for the Cl:PO4 was 0.712. When using a cutoff of 33, the reported sensitivity and specificity of the curve were 58.4% and 28.6%, respectively.

The conclusion of the study was that the Cl:PO4 ratio was a moderately sensitive test for the diagnosis of the borderline variants of primary hyperparathyroidism. The Ca:PO4 ratio was superior to the Cl:PO4 ratio. Our data also showed the superiority of preoperative calcium and ionized calcium over PTH when predicting the presence of pHPT.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) pointed to it as an inexorably progressive disorder. However, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines, PHPT in general does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients remain asymptomatic over many years of observation.

- **Nephrolithiasis and surgery**: In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated.

- **Bone densitometry**: Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation and monitoring process because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with skeletal X-ray results, which are invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement, either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton, that is more than two standard deviations below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion can show evidence of progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

- **Pharmacologic approaches**: There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard.

- **Unanswered questions**: Unanswered questions include whether the lower bone density in milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1137a78P]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 82 patients with plausible primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to a specialist. Cases with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in calcium homeostasis were excluded stepwise after answering a survey and based on the results of new blood tests and an assessment by an experienced endocrine surgeon.

A second sampling of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), ionized calcium, and creatinine was arranged for the remaining cohort of 45 patients. Ionized calcium was chosen for these tests to provide a more specific diagnosis of pHPT in a low-range hypercalcemia as compared to the formerly used albumin-corrected serum calcium values. Limits for exclusion were set at the same levels for PTH (≥ 4.3 pmol/L) and creatinine (< 175 mmol/L) as in the first inclusion criteria, and the limit for ionized calcium was set at 1.26 mmol/L (reference range 1.13–1.30 mmol/L), corresponding to an albumin-corrected calcium of 2.40 mmol/L. All criteria had to be met before patients continued to be included in the study. Four patients declined further participation. Patients not fulfilling the criteria after this new blood sample (n = 12) were offered one repeated testing. Ten patients did not meet the criteria this second time or declined further samplings and had to be excluded. If they fulfilled the criteria at this second new sampling, they were included in the study (n = 2).

Patients in the final study cohort (n = 32) were given outpatient appointments at the Endocrine Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgery, Östersund Hospital. At this point, two patients declined further participation in the study.

Regarding the medical management of hypercalcemia of malignancy, particularly concerning antiresorptive therapies, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a combination of calcitonin and an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab as initial therapy in adult patients with severe HCM (serum calcium > 14 mg/dL; 3.5 mmol/L).

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1147icNP]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The criteria for biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were defined as albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 2.40 mmol/L (ref 2.15–2.50 mmol/L), serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) ≥ 4.3 pmol/L (ref 1.6–6.9 pmol/L), and serum creatinine < 175 mmol/L (ref 50–90 mmol/L) in the same test. PTH was analyzed using a Cobas e 601 instrument with a Roche Diagnostics GmbH third-generation PTH assay (PTH STAT/PTH intact).

From January 12, 2011, to November 24, 2015, a total of 1828 individuals fulfilling these criteria in the same blood sample for the first time were identified in the database of laboratory results at Östersund Hospital in northern Sweden. This hospital serves 127,000 inhabitants in the region of Jämtland-Härjedalen. The data were collected from all primary healthcare centers of the region as well as all departments in the hospital. The 365 individuals tested during 2014 were examined further [Fig. 1].

In total, 365 patients presented with preset criteria for possible pHPT for the first time during 2014. Patients with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in their calcium homeostasis were excluded after reviewing their patient records.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114aSg3C]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

At the Östersund Hospital, and in most Swedish laboratories, normal values of albumin-corrected serum calcium range from 2.15 to 2.50 mmol/L and PTH from 1.9 to 6.9 pmol/L. The true ratio between PTH and calcium that correlates with histologically proven pHPT is still to be established. Studies include normocalcaemic cases (calcium ≥ 2.1 mmol/L and PTH ≥ 6.9 pmol/L) as well as normohormonal cases (calcium ≥ 2.78 mmol/L and PTH < 4.2 pmol/L). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that a significant disturbance of calcium homeostasis exists when calcium levels are in the upper part of the normal range together with non-suppressed PTH levels.

To reduce the number of false positive pHPT patients in the final cohort, we have tried to exclude all patients with a plausible other cause of the disturbed balance of serum calcium and PTH. In total, 156 patients were excluded due to possible differential diagnoses during the different steps of exclusion. A suspicion of a differential diagnosis derived from the patients' records or list of medications was deemed reason enough for exclusion. Of course, this approach causes a high risk of excluding patients with mild pHPT. On the other hand, false positive cases are more easily eliminated. The 82 patients not being cared for properly were all asked to voluntarily participate in the coming studies. Only 7 patients declined further participation.

- **Common differential diagnosis**: The most common differential diagnosis was sHPT due to renal failure. This was expected, as renal failure is a common disorder and the prevalence of sHPT increases with the degree of kidney impairment.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^111mUUWb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Severe hypercalcemia has been reported with NATPARA. In the pivotal trial, three patients randomized to NATPARA required administration of IV fluids to correct hypercalcemia during treatment with NATPARA. The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose of NATPARA but can occur at any time. It is essential to monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Treat hypercalcemia as per standard practice and consider holding and/or lowering the dose of NATPARA if severe hypercalcemia occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Severe hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking NATPARA, including cases of hypocalcemia that resulted in seizures. The risk is highest when NATPARA is withheld, missed, or abruptly discontinued but can occur at any time. Serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be closely monitored. It is recommended to resume treatment with, or increase the dose of, an active form of vitamin D or calcium supplements, or both, if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing NATPARA to prevent severe hypocalcemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Risk of digoxin toxicity with concomitant use of digitalis compounds**: The inotropic effects of digoxin are influenced by serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia of any cause may predispose to digoxin toxicity. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digitalis compounds, it is vital to monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be necessary.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may decompensate from a more or less chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition, hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause; humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms that characterize the crisis are oliguria and anuria as well as somnolence and coma.

After a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program has to be followed either to prove or to exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. In the first case, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid a fatal outcome. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours; during this time, serum calcium should be lowered. Treatment of choice is hemodialysis against a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates could be useful as adjuvant drugs.

### Rapid fire: Hypercalcemia [^116M4fpB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The two most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, the acuity of treatment will depend on the severity of the calcium level and symptoms.

In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112HqZWV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Natpara dose adjustments**: The dose of Natpara may be increased in increments of 25 mcg every four weeks up to a maximum daily dose of 100 mcg if serum calcium cannot be maintained above 8 mg/dL without an active form of vitamin D and/or oral calcium supplementation. The dose of Natpara may be decreased to as low as 25 mcg per day if total serum calcium is repeatedly above 9 mg/dL after the active form of vitamin D has been discontinued and calcium supplement has been decreased to a dose sufficient to meet daily requirements. After a Natpara dose change, monitor clinical response as well as serum calcium. Adjust active vitamin D and calcium supplements per steps 4–6 above if indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Natpara maintenance dose**: The maintenance dose should be the lowest dose that achieves a total serum calcium (albumin-corrected) within the lower half of the normal total serum calcium range (i.e. approximately 8 and 9 mg/dL), without the need for active forms of vitamin D and with calcium supplementation sufficient to meet daily requirements. Monitor serum calcium and 24-hour urinary calcium per standard of care once a maintenance dose is achieved.

- **Natpara dose interruption or discontinuation**: Abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Natpara can result in severe hypocalcemia. Resume treatment with, or increase the dose of, an active form of vitamin D and calcium supplements if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing Natpara; monitor for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia and serum calcium levels.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage; however, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT who did not meet any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery.

One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients. Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery. For those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and assessment of the development of organ damage should be conducted.

### Sensipar [^111KFxga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring for hypocalcemia**: Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis, and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Routine laboratory testing in hemodialysis: How frequently is it needed [^113Av8Sh]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical outcome 4 examined the number of alfacalcidol interventions per year. A comparison was conducted regarding changes in the prescription of alfacalcidol by categorizing patients into two groups: those with no interventions and those with ≥ 1 intervention per year. Patients who were younger, with a median age of 67 years, and those with higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels required at least one yearly modification in their phosphate binders' prescriptions.

- **Statistical tests**: Mann-Whitney test, Chi-Square test, Fisher's Exact test, and Independent t-test were used. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

We conclude that:

1. Reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals.

2. Second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT.

3. Normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia.

4. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course.

5. Genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### The case for routine parathyroid hormone monitoring [^114dWdSx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a uremic toxin with multiple systemic effects, including bone disorders (renal osteodystrophy), myopathy, neurologic abnormalities, anemia, pruritus, and cardiomyopathy. Hyperparathyroidism is common in CKD and results in significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Clinical practice guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes initiative broadened the optimal PTH range to more than two and less than nine times the upper limit of normal for the assay measured. Furthermore, the guidelines recommend following trends in PTH to determine the appropriate therapy. These guidelines address issues with assay variability and assist clinicians in making informed judgments when treating individual patients. They also require frequent measurement to determine trends and implement appropriate treatments.

### Intact PTH combined with the PTH ratio for diagnosis of bone turnover in dialysis patients: A diagnostic test study [^114TMAmX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Determination of parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is the most commonly used surrogate marker for bone turnover in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease on dialysis therapy (CKD-5D). The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of various PTH measurements for identifying low or high bone turnover rates.

- **Study design**: Diagnostic test study.

- **Settings & participants**: 141 patients with CKD-5D from 15 US hemodialysis centers.

- **Index tests**: Intact PTH, PTH 1–84, and PTH ratio (ratio of level of PTH 1–84 to level of large carboxy-terminal PTH fragments).

- **Reference test or outcome**: Bone turnover determined using bone histomorphometry.

- **Other measurements**: Demographic and treatment-related factors, serum calcium, and phosphorus.

- **Results**: Patients presented histologically with a broad range of bone turnover abnormalities. In white patients with CKD-5D (n = 70), PTH ratio 1.6 to intact PTH level of 340–790 pg/mL increased the positive predictive value for high bone turnover from 56% to 71%.

- **Limitations**: Because the research protocol called for carefully controlled blood specimen handling, blood drawing and routine specimen handling might be less stringent in clinical practice. By limiting study participation to black and white patients with CKD-5D, we conclude…

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117Uskx7]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with biochemically determined, mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are not investigated or followed up properly. The high proportion of patients presenting with biochemically determined, mild pHPT underlines the importance of providing local instructions to ensure that patients are investigated and followed up according to the most recent international guidelines.

### Is parathyroid hormone measurement useful for the diagnosis of renal bone disease [^111Xjaby]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The non-invasive diagnosis of bone turnover in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains challenging compared with bone histomorphometry, which is the gold standard. Most clinicians rely on surrogate markers, mainly serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and total alkaline phosphatases, in association with serum calcium and phosphorus. Although very high serum PTH levels generally allow the diagnosis of high bone turnover, slight elevations, normal, or low values do not allow a reliable distinction between normal or low turnover.

Adverse effects of conventional treatment

Conventional treatment with phosphate supplementation and active vitamin D might increase calciuria and thereby promote nephrocalcinosis, which has been reported in 30–70% of patients with XLH. Several reports suggest positive associations between daily oral phosphate doses and the risk of developing nephrocalcinosis, whereas the relationship with active vitamin D therapy and/or with the presence of hypercalciuria has been observed less frequently. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases calciuria in XLH, and potassium citrate might help prevent calcium precipitation, especially in patients with low urinary citrate levels; however, alkalinization of urine increases the risk of phosphate precipitation. Therefore, potassium citrate should be used with caution in XLH.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism, which might aggravate phosphaturia and promote bone resorption, results from the long-term stimulation of parathyroid cells by FGF23 and phosphate supplements and from the suppression of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels by FGF23, especially in patients not treated with active vitamin D. Conversely, suppressed PTH levels secondary to excessive vitamin D therapy and/or insufficient oral phosphate intake might decrease bone turnover and compromise rickets healing and growth. Thus, therapies should be adjusted to keep PTH levels within the normal range (10–65 pg/ml in children and adults). In patients with XLH, adjuvant therapy with a calcimimetic (for example, cinacalcet) decreases serum levels of PTH and FGF23 and increases TmP/GFR.

### Diagnosis and management of hypophosphatemic disorders [^116heeBC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Phosphate, an essential component of the mineralized skeleton, also plays a crucial role in various physiological and cellular functions. Several mineral-regulating hormones, including 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast-growth factor 23, modulate serum phosphate levels primarily at the level of the bone, kidney, and intestine. Impaired serum phosphate levels can lead to non-specific symptoms, and because serum phosphate levels are not routinely measured in laboratory analyses, disorders of hypophosphatemia are often overlooked during patient evaluations.

In recent decades, significant progress has been made in identifying the genetic causes of and novel therapies for hypophosphatemic disorders. This review discusses the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, clinical presentation, work-up, disorders, and treatment of hypophosphatemia.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend including the following in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH:

- **Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia**: Consider in younger patients with a urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01 and/or a family history of hypercalcemia.

- **Thiazide diuretics and lithium**: These medications should also be considered.

- **Ectopic secretion of PTH**: Although very rare, ectopic PTH secretion should be taken into account.
