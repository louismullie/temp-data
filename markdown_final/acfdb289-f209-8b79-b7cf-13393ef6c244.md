## Question

2. Morning in the store. At what price should a mixture of two types of candies be sold if the price of the first type is 10 rubles per kilogram, the second type is 15 rubles per kilogram, and the weight of the first type of candies is three times greater than that of the second?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the selling price per kilogram for a mixture of two types of candies, given their individual prices and a 3:1 weight ratio. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to set up the problem with variables and a clear total cost and total weight. Then, I should verify the weight ratio and translate it into concrete quantities. Next, I will calculate the total cost and total weight, and finally divide to get the weighted average price per kilogram, making sure the units and arithmetic are correct throughout.

> Let me first confirm the setup. I need to define variables for the prices and the weight relationship, and I should decide on a convenient base quantity to make the math straightforward. Let the price of candy A be 10 rubles/kg and candy B be 15 rubles/kg, and let the weight of candy B be x kg, which means candy A weighs 3x kg because the first type is three times greater than the second. I should double-check that this ratio is correctly interpreted as 3:1 for A:B, which it is.

> Now, I will translate the ratio into concrete quantities to avoid errors. If I assume x = 1 kg for simplicity, then candy B is 1 kg and candy A is 3 kg, giving a total mixture weight of 4 kg. Wait, let me verify that this assumption is valid; since we are computing a per-kilogram price, the specific choice of x cancels out, so assuming x = 1 kg is fine and keeps the calculation transparent.

> Next, I should calculate the total cost. Candy A contributes 3 kg × 10 rubles/kg = 30 rubles, and candy B contributes 1 kg × 15 rubles/kg = 15 rubles, so the total cost is 30 + 15 = 45 rubles. Hold on, I should verify the arithmetic: 3 × 10 is indeed 30 and 1 × 15 is 15, and 30 + 15 equals 45, so the total cost is correct.

> I will now examine the total weight to ensure consistency. Total weight is 3 kg + 1 kg = 4 kg, which matches the earlier step. I should confirm that this total weight will be used to divide the total cost to get the per-kilogram price, which it will be.

> Finally, I will compute the weighted average price per kilogram. The mixture price per kg equals total cost divided by total weight, so 45 rubles ÷ 4 kg = 11.25 rubles/kg. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to round to 11.3 rubles/kg, but I should correct that: 45 divided by 4 is exactly 11.25, so the precise answer is 11.25 rubles per kilogram, not 11.3.

> Let me reconsider the general formula to ensure this result is robust beyond the specific assumption of x = 1 kg. The weighted average price is (priceA × weightA + priceB × weightB) ÷ (weightA + weightB), which equals (10 × 3x + 15 × x) ÷ (3x + x) = (30x + 15x) ÷ 4x = 45x ÷ 4x = 11.25 rubles/kg. The x cancels out, confirming that the per-kilogram price is indeed 11.25 rubles regardless of the actual quantities, as long as the 3:1 ratio is maintained.

---

The mixture should be sold at **11.25 rubles per kilogram**. This is a weighted average of the two candy prices, where the cheaper candy (10 rubles/kg) has three times the weight of the more expensive candy (15 rubles/kg). The calculation is: (10 × 3 + 15 × 1) ÷ (3 + 1) = 45 ÷ 4 = 11.25 rubles/kg.

---

## Calculation of the mixture price

Let:

- Price of candy A = 10 rubles/kg
- Price of candy B = 15 rubles/kg
- Weight of candy A = 3x kg
- Weight of candy B = x kg

Total cost = (10 × 3x) + (15 × x) = 30x + 15x = 45x rubles\
Total weight = 3x + x = 4x kg\
Price per kg = Total cost ÷ Total weight = 45x ÷ 4x = 11.25 rubles/kg

---

## Explanation of the calculation

The mixture price is a **weighted average** of the two candy prices, with weights proportional to their quantities. Because candy A is three times more abundant than candy B, its lower price pulls the average down, resulting in a final price of 11.25 rubles/kg.

---

## Conclusion

The mixture should be sold at **11.25 rubles per kilogram**.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^0c4b031b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Ensure that all Foods and Beverages Sold or Served Outside of School Meal Programs Are Nutritious and Appealing — competitive foods, which are any foods or beverages sold or served outside of the school meal program, are identified as the principal source of the low-nutrient, energy-dense foods that students consume at school. The existing federal requirement, last updated in 1985, prohibits the sale of foods of minimal nutritional value (FMNV) during meal periods in areas where reimbursable school meals are served; FMNV are defined as foods and beverages with < 5% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances per serving for eight key nutrients, and examples include soda, water ices, chewing gum, and certain types of candy. However, schools can sell these foods and beverages at other locations on campus during the entire school day, and other foods and beverages of low nutritional value can be sold anywhere on campus, including the food service area. Policy developments include that the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires USDA to develop federal nutrition standards for competitive foods consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and in the last decade a total of 39 states passed a law or policy addressing competitive foods and beverages in schools, although these state measures vary in strength and breadth when compared with the IOM Nutrition Standards for Foods in School. Availability remains widespread; in 2006, 53% of elementary schools, 71% of middle schools, and 89% of high schools had a vending machine or a school store, canteen, or snack bar where students could purchase foods or beverages, and the most commonly available competitive foods are high in sugar, fat, and calories, including high-fat salty snacks, high-fat baked goods, and high-calorie sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks.

3.1.1 Evidence

Excessive intake of low-nutrient, calorie-dense, high-fat food, and sugar-sweetened beverages is a risk factor for obesity. Since 1965 teens have doubled their consumption of sugared soft drinks and fruit-flavored beverages. The average adolescent boy now consumes 50 ounces of such beverages per day. Reducing consumption of sugared beverages (e.g. soda, juices and fruit drinks, and sports drinks) may be an effective way to reduce ingested calories. School-based interventions can reduce soda consumption and reduce weight in students at the highest BMI percentiles.

Increased portion size parallels the increase in obesity. Texas elementary schools are imparting portion control education using educational materials available from the Texas Department of Agriculture (/).

Decreasing caloric intake by consuming more fruits and vegetables instead of dietary fat can decrease the risk of developing obesity and T2DM. Most children do not meet the dietary recommendations needed to maintain a healthy weight and eat < half the recommended five fruits and vegetables a day. Inadequate consumption of dietary fiber may contribute to excessive weight gain.

Fast food accounted for only 2% of children's total caloric intake in 1977–1978, but the proportion increased to 10% by 1994–1996. Consumption of food prepared away from home increased from 18% of total calories in 1977–1978 to 32% in 1994–1996. Overweight children are more likely to report eating fast food and to attend a school with vending machines selling chips and candy. Vending machine foods are sold separate from the National School Lunch Program and are currently exempt from the Dietary Guidelines; these food sales represent an increasing percentage of total school food sales.

Overweight children and adolescents are now more likely to skip breakfast and consume a few large meals per day than their leaner counterparts who are more likely to consume smaller, more frequent meals. Eating breakfast reduces snacking throughout the remainder of the day. One fourth to one third of the energy intake of adolescents is from snacks. Because snacks tend to be higher in calorie density than meals, frequent snacking is associated with high intake of fat, sugar, and calories and with overweight among children. Intervention studies to confirm a relationship between meal and snack patterns and overweight are needed.

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^78324d15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

'Portion' refers to the overall amount (volume, weight or both) of a product that is presented for selection or consumption (for example, 200 g versus 300 g of pasta, 275 mL versus 440 mL of beer, or a packet of 10 versus 20 cigarettes). 'Package' refers to the different ways of packaging a specific portion, including that used for service, consumption or storage (for example, boxes, bags, cans or bottles). For example, the same portion of a food could be served within one large bag or multiple smaller bags. 'Individual unit' refers to the unit of a product that is presented within a given portion (for example, individual sweets or candies, biscuits or cookies, or cigarettes). 'Tableware' refers to crockery, cutlery or glassware used for serving or consuming food or drink (for example, plates, bowls, knives, forks, spoons or glasses). Packages and tableware as defined in this way have the capacity to limit or increase the portion or individual unit size of the consumed product and may therefore influence any corollary effects on selection and consumption.

### Competitive foods and beverages available for purchase in secondary schools – selected sites, United States, 2006 [^53ea98d7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Schools are in a unique position to help improve youth dietary behaviors and prevent and reduce obesity. In most schools, foods and beverages are made available to students through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) school meal programs and the sale of competitive foods, which are any foods and beverages sold at a school separately from the USDA school meal programs. Foods and beverages sold through the USDA school meal programs must meet federal nutrition requirements. Competitive foods are not subject to any federal nutrition standards unless they are sold inside the food service area during mealtimes. A 2007 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report concluded that schools should limit the availability of less nutritious competitive foods or include more nutritious foods and beverages if they make competitive foods available. To identify the types of competitive foods and beverages available for purchase from vending machines or at school stores, canteens, or snack bars, CDC analyzed data from the 2006 School Health Profiles for public secondary schools in 36 states and 12 large urban school districts. CDC also compared 2004 and 2006 data among 24 states and nine large urban school districts. This report summarizes the results of these analyses, which indicated that, from 2004 to 2006, the median percentage of secondary schools across states allowing students to purchase chocolate candy and salty snacks that are not low in fat decreased; however, in 2006, secondary schools still offered less nutritious foods and beverages that compete with school meals. School and public health officials should work together with families to provide foods and beverages at school that follow the IOM recommendations.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^7bf6ba27]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Items sold in competition to school meals: new national standards — Competitive foods sold in vending machines and a la carte lines represent a far less nutritious option than the USDA-sponsored school meals; until 2010, federal law restricted the sale of carbonated drinks, candies, and other "foods of minimal nutritional value" only in the cafeteria during meal service hours, leaving many nutrient-poor products available for sale with lax oversight; access to "empty calories" has been associated with higher daily energy intake and greater BMI and with displacement of more nutrient-rich alternatives; many schools that have taken steps to improve the nutritional quality of competitive foods have not reported subsequent losses in total revenue and in some cases have even increased revenue and school meal participation; in 2004, the AAP published a policy statement ("Soft Drinks in Schools"), and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation published "School Beverage Guidelines" in 2007; a report from the alliance issued in 2010 cited an 88% decrease in total calories shipped to schools, a 95% reduction in the grams of added sugars shipped to schools, and a 65% decline in shipments of full-calorie soft drinks.

### What is the role of portion control in weight management? [^416edf5f]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Early studies

The first known study linking portion size and intake came from Siegelin 1957 who found that people have a 'completion compulsion' or tendency to eat entire servings or units of food. In that brief report, few data were presented and there were no statistics, but there were memorable observations such as: 'In cookie consumption, compulsion is marked enough to stimulate a chuckle. On only one occasion was a fraction of a cookie left behind'. Over the next 30 years, attempts to establish a significant link between portion size and consumption were disappointing. In one study, normal-weight subjects, offered either one sandwich at a time (with more available in a refrigerator) or three sandwiches together, ate an average of two sandwiches in both conditions. In 1986, Edelman et al. tested the effect of varying the portion of lasagna available in a cafeteria at the military facility in Natick, Massachusetts. Although the portion offered varied significantly (255 vs 426 g), no effect of portion size was found. It is not clear why portion size failed to affect intake in these studies, but it may have been that participants could have more helpings than were initially served. Ten years later, Wansinkshowed that the package or container size of a variety of foods (spaghetti, chicken and chocolate candies) affected the amount people took, but intake was not assessed. In a later relatively uncontrolled study conducted in a movie theater, consumers were found to eat more from a large bucket of popcorn than from one half the size. Thus, until recently, there was little experimental evidence showing a direct effect of portion size on intake.

Meanwhile, data were accumulating that portion sizes of many foods and beverages had increased substantially. Furthermore, nationally representative survey data from the United States indicated that as portions increased in size, people reported that they had been consuming larger portions. Between 1977 and 1996, the amount consumed at an eating occasion increased for a wide range of foods. In a seminal paper published in 2002 with the title 'The contribution of expanding portion sizes to the US obesity epidemic', Young and Nestledrew a parallel between the increases in portion sizes of restaurant foods, grocery products and recipes in cookbooks and the rise in the prevalence of obesity. Although the overlap in the rise in portion size and obesity prevalence was compelling, more direct evidence that portion size affects intake was needed.

### Prevalence of artificial food colors in grocery store products marketed to children [^d073c507]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Artificial food colors (AFCs) in foods and beverages may be harmful to children. This study assesses the percentage of grocery store products marketed to children that contain AFCs, by category and company. The research team collected product and food-color information about 810 products in one grocery store in North Carolina in 2014. Overall, 350 products (43.2%) contained AFCs. The most common AFCs were Red 40 (29.8% of products), Blue 1 (24.2%), Yellow 5 (20.5%), and Yellow 6 (19.5%). Produce was the only category that did not have any AFCs. The highest percentage of products with AFCs was found in candies (96.3%), fruit-flavored snacks (94%), and drink mixes/powders (89.7%). Forty-one of the 66 companies marketed products containing AFCs. Given concerns about health effects of AFCs and high proportions of high-AFC categories, clinicians, parents, food companies, and the government can take steps to support children's healthy eating and development by reducing AFCs in children's diets.

### Diet of adolescents with and without diabetes: trading candy for potato chips? [^ee348276]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the dietary intake of adolescents with type 1 diabetes with that of adolescents without diabetes matched on age, sex, and year in school and to compare the diets of both groups with recommendations.

Research Design and Methods

Participants were 132 adolescents with type 1 diabetes, recruited from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, and 131 adolescents without diabetes ranging in age from 10.70 to 14.21 years. Dietary intake was assessed with three 24-h recall interviews with each participant and one parent. Percentage of calories from protein, carbohydrates, and total fat; amount of each type of fat; and amount of cholesterol, fiber, and sugar were calculated as averages across 3 days.

Results

Adolescents with diabetes took in less total energy than recommended. The percentage of calories from carbohydrates and protein were within recommendations for adolescents with and without diabetes, but adolescents with diabetes exceeded the recommended fat intake. The diet of adolescents with diabetes consisted of a greater percentage of fat and protein and a smaller percentage of carbohydrates relative to adolescents without diabetes. Adolescents without diabetes consumed more sugar, while adolescents with diabetes took in more of all components of fat than adolescents without diabetes. Male subjects with diabetes had an especially high intake of saturated fat.

Conclusions

Adolescents with type 1 diabetes consume fewer calories from carbohydrates but more calories from fat than adolescents without diabetes and exceed the recommended levels of fat intake. These findings are of concern given the risk that type 1 diabetes poses for cardiovascular disease.

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^21a99dbf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Vending Machine Sales Data Results

At the transaction level, there were no differences in the mean number of calories sold per beverage or snack transaction (Table 2). Traffic light machines were 25% more likely to sell a yellow (eg, taxed diet soda) compared with a red (eg, taxed soda) beverage compared with beverage tax machines (RRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.07–1.46). For snacks, green-only machines were 10% more likely to sell a green snack (eg, baked chips) compared with a red snack (eg, candy) compared with beverage tax machines (RRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03–1.17). At the machine level, physical activity compared with beverage tax decreased the expected monthly number of beverages sold by 24% (MR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.95) (Table 3). Exploratory machine-level analyses showed that physical activity specifically decreased the beverage calories sold by 35% (MR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.86) and the number of red beverages sold by 34% (MR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.87). Although traffic light did not show overall decreases in beverage sales, the number of red beverages sold decreased by 30% (MR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.88). For snacks, there were no machine-level differences in sales. The 2 sensitivity analyses showed substantively similar results (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2). Secondary analyses showed no significant pairwise differences (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2).

### Package unit size and amount of food: do both influence intake? [^e843318b]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Large portions increase intake and are hypothesized to contribute to the obesity epidemic. However, it is unclear if portion size affects intake through changes in the unit size of available food or the overall amount of food available for consumption. Thus, this study examined the independent effects of package unit size and amount of food on intake. It was hypothesized that both variables would influence intake.

Research Methods and Procedures

Non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m²), non-smoking, unrestrained, college-aged men (n = 12) and women (n = 16) who regularly consumed (≥ 3 times/wk) snack foods were randomly assigned to one of four groups crossing package unit size (small vs. large) and amount of food (small vs. large). Participants were given a box with 4 snack foods (potato chips, cheese crackers, cookies, and candy) packaged according to their assigned group to take home and eat over 3 days. Dependent variables were energy and gram intake of provided snack foods.

Results

An effect of amount of food was found (p < 0.01). A 100% increase in the amount of food provided produced an 81% increase in energy consumed from the snack foods [small amount, 21,037.6 ± 10,852 kJ (5,028 ± 2,596 kcal) vs. large amount, 11,640.7 ± 4,914.1 kJ (2,782 ± 1,174 kcal)]. No effect of package unit size was found.

Discussion

These results suggest that the amount of food available to eat strongly influences intake.

### Evaluation of changes in grams of sugar sold after the implementation of the Seattle sweetened beverage tax [^d8d41679]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Beverages were classified as taxed or untaxed based on Seattle's ordinance; classified by size as individual size (single item ≤ 1 L) and family size (> 1 L or multipack); and classified by type as taxed juice drinks, soda, sports drinks, energy drinks, and tea/coffee, untaxed sweetened (flavored/unflavored) milk, and untaxed SSBs with less than 40 kcal/12 ounces. Sweets were classified by type as candy/confections, frozen desserts, cookies, and other sweets (eg, cakes, pies, muffins, pastries, brownies, and doughnuts). Sugar itself (eg, white/brown sugar) was classified as a single stand-alone sugar category.

Using a research protocol, beverage calorie content and type as well as sugar content for both beverages and sweets were obtained from Label Insight, the United States Department of Agriculture Food Composition databases, and internet research under the direction of a registered dietitian. Beverage size, sweet type, and information on the per-unit weight in grams of stand-alone sugar UPCs were obtained from the Nielsen data. Grams of sugar sold for each beverage UPC were computed as the number of ounces sold times grams of sugar per ounce, which included all sugar in the case of sugary beverages and only added sugars in the case of sweetened milks. Grams of sugar sold for each sweet and stand-alone sugar UPC were computed as the number of units sold times the sugar content per unit based on nutritional research for sweets or the product gram weight for stand-alone sugar. eAppendix 1 in the Supplement presents details on the nutritional coding process.

### Standardized tobacco assessment for retail settings (STARS): dissemination and implementation research [^91d380c2]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1
Reliability statistics for candidate STARS items

To assess price promotions more reliably, STARS captures their presence or absence for each item, without requiring data collectors to categorise types of promotions, such as single-pack or volume price discounts. Among the three items about placement of products and advertising, the presence of tobacco products near candy was the least reliable (κ 0.10–0.27), although per cent agreement indicated higher reliability in one study (see table 1). For price of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, Newport (the leading menthol cigarette), cheapest cigarette pack (regardless of brand) and a disposable e-cigarette (Blu, the leading brand when STARS was developed) all exhibited high reliability (ICC 0.87–1.0).

A few items with unknown reliability (eg, tobacco products sold as single units, tobacco products advertised for less than $1, cross-product promotions and presence of signs with graphic health warnings) were included in STARS because of their relevance to state and local policymaking, such as increasing minimum package size, establishing/increasing minimum price and mandating countermarketing at the point of sale.

Six states (Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Oregon and Texas) volunteered to pilot test STARS in a total of ∼300 stores. The average completion time was < 10 min per store (M = 9.7, SD = 5.6). Based on feedback from pilot testing, the final instrument included a new item about the availability of little cigars/cigarillos for less than $1, and the form was revised to improve question order and data entry format for prices (see online supplementary appendix).

### E-cigarette unit sales by product and flavor type, and top-selling brands, United States, 2020–2022 [^9e37145b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

During January 2020–December 2022, total U.S. e-cigarette unit sales increased by 46.6%, from 15.5 million to 22.7 million units per 4-week period (APPC = 1.1; p < 0.05); however, sales fluctuated during this period (Figure 1). Although sales increased during January 2020–May 2022, the percentage of increase in sales slowed from 36.5% (15.5 million to 21.2 million; APPC = 6.9) during January 2020–June 2020 to 16.8% (21.2 million to 24.7 million; APPC = 1.3) during June 2020–June 2021 to 4.9% (24.7 million to 25.9 million; APPC = 0.4) during June 2021–May 2022 (p < 0.05 for all APPCs). Overall, during January 2020–May 2022, total sales increased 67.2% (APPC = 1.8; p < 0.05), from 15.5 million to 25.9 million units per period. During May–December 2022, total sales decreased by 12.3% (APPC = –1.8; p < 0.05), to 22.7 million units per period.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^31c860f5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Smart Snacks in School — food requirements for competitive foods include "foods sold in schools must have a fruit, a vegetable, a dairy product, or a protein food as its first ingredient", or be a whole grain–rich product "(≥ 50% whole grain or have whole grain as first ingredient)", a "combination food" "containing at least one-quarter cup fruit or vegetable", or "contain 10% of the Daily Value of a nutrient of concern"; fat limits are "Total fat must be ≤ 35% of kilocalories, saturated fat must be < 10% of kilocalories, and trans fat must be 0 g", with sodium and energy caps of "Snack items must contain ≤ 200 mg of sodium" and "entrée items… must contain ≤ 480 mg of sodium per portion", plus "Snack items must contain ≤ 200 kcal, and entrée items must contain ≤ 350 kcal per portion"; sugars are constrained as "Total sugar content… is limited to ≤ 35% of weight per portion as sugars".

### The impact of local cigar pack regulations on cigar retail sales [^79ac3a0d]. Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Cigar sales in the United States (US) have increased since the early 2000s, while cigarette sales have declined. The average price per cigar pack is approximately $1.50, compared to a national average of over $8 per pack of cigarettes. This price difference is largely due to the availability and popularity of small cigar pack sizes, with singles, two-packs, and three-packs being commonly sold. Cigarettes are federally mandated to be sold in pack sizes of 20 or more, whereas cigars can be sold for as little as $0.50 each or five for $1.00 in various flavors.

In the absence of federal restrictions on cigar pack size and price, over 250 localities across five US states and the District of Columbia (DC) have enacted policies that establish minimum cigar pack sizes and prices. There are three broad types of cigar pack size and price policies: (1) minimum pack size without a price requirement (e.g. cigars must be sold in packs of at least five cigars), (2) minimum pack size with price floor (e.g. cigars must be sold in packs of at least five cigars for at least $5.00 per pack), and (3) minimum price (e.g. cigars must be sold for at least $5.00). Each policy type is designed to reduce the availability of inexpensive cigars. The impact of price on tobacco use is well-documented, with studies highlighting how price increases can reduce consumption. Similarly, pack size has been used as a tool to influence consumer behavior. Tobacco industry documents reveal that smaller pack sizes are designed to attract new consumers and those looking to reduce their consumption, while larger pack sizes are intended for those who smoke more and seek a lower cost per cigar. Qualitative research, secondary analyses, and experimental studies examining the associations between pack size purchase and consumption support these findings, indicating that cigar pack size influences behavior and patterns of use.

### The dynamics in food selection stemming from price awareness and perceived income adequacy: a cross-sectional study using 1-year loyalty card data [^393b6219]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Total purchase prices for individuals were calculated by first adding up the expenditure (in euros), energy (megajoules), and volume (kilograms) of the purchased food items by group on each loyalty cardholder. One euro (€) is approximately US $1.18 (average conversion rate for 2018), and 1 MJ is equal to 239 kcal. The individuals' purchase prices of the foods in different categories were then obtained by dividing the expenditure of the group by either energy or volume of the group. Similarly, the proportion of energy and the proportion of expenditure from each food group were computed as the ratio of group-specific energy and expenditure to the total energy and total expenditure across all groups, respectively. Individual-level quantities were then summarized as medians for PIA levels because their distributions were skew.

To test for a trend in the prices, expenditures, and NRFI (outcome variables) between levels of PIA (ordinal grouping factors), nonparametric methods were chosen owing to deviations from a normal distribution. We used a 2-sided Jonckheere–Terpstra test, with a control of the false discovery rate by the Benjamini–Hochberg method set at 5% level. To control the potential confounding factors, we used the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method of the Jonckheere–Terpstra test. In practice, we estimated the probabilities of falling into one of the PIA levels by a multinomial model, including education and sex as explanatory variables, and the inverses of these probabilities were used as weights. The effect size was estimated by relating the intragroup variance of the medians across different levels of PIA to the variability of the medians across food groups and PIA levels. SAS, version 9.4, was used in the analysis. The correlation of price per kilogram and per megajoule between the food groups was examined by using group-based median price per megajoule and per kilogram and the Spearman correlation coefficients across groups.

In the figures, we showed the data without confounder adjustment because these indicate the food selection of actual participant groups instead of weighted yet artificial groups that would match the IPW-adjusted Jonckheere–Terpstra tests. We focused on price per kilogram (in contrast to price per megajoule) because this is the price consumers see, it is likely to be related to their food selection, and it is not associated with energy density of the food.

### Association of a sweetened beverage tax with purchases of beverages and high-sugar foods at independent stores in Philadelphia [^ce735a9e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The relationship between a sweetened beverage tax and changes in the prices and purchases of beverages and high-sugar food is understudied in the long term and in small independent food retail stores where sugar-sweetened beverages are among the most commonly purchased items.

Objective

To examine whether a 1.5 cent-per-fluid-ounce excise tax on sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was associated with sustained changes in beverage prices and purchases, as well as calories purchased from beverages and high-sugar foods, over 2 years at small independent stores.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes in beverage prices and purchases of beverages and high-sugar foods (candy, sweet snacks) at independent stores in Philadelphia and Baltimore, Maryland (a nontaxed control) before and 2 years after tax implementation, which occurred on January 1, 2017. Price comparisons were also made to independent stores in Philadelphia's neighboring counties.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in mean price (measured in cents per fluid ounce) of taxed and nontaxed beverages, mean fluid ounces purchased of taxed and nontaxed beverages, and mean total calories purchased from beverages and high-sugar foods.

Results

Compared with Baltimore independent stores, taxed beverage prices in Philadelphia increased 2.06 cents per fluid ounce (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.38 cents per fluid ounce; P < .001), with 137% of the tax passed through to prices 2 years after tax implementation, while nontaxed beverage prices had no statistically significant change. A total of 116 independent stores and 4738 customer purchases (1950 [41.2%] women; 4351 [91.8%] age 18 years or older; 1006 [21.2%] White customers, 3185 [67.2%] Black customers) at independent stores were assessed for price and purchase comparisons. Purchases of taxed beverages declined by 6.1 fl oz (95% CI, -9.9 to -2.4 fl oz; P < .001), corresponding to a 42% decline in Philadelphia compared with Baltimore; there were no significant changes in purchases of nontaxed beverages. Although there was no significant moderation by neighborhood income or customer education level, exploratory stratified analyses revealed that declines in taxed beverage purchases were larger among customers shopping in low-income neighborhoods (-7.1 fl oz; 95% CI, -13.0 to -1.1 fl oz; P = 0.001) and individuals with lower education levels (-6.9 fl oz; 95% CI, -12.5 to -1.3 fl oz; P = 0.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found that a tax on sweetened beverages was associated with increases in price and decreases in purchasing. Beverage excise taxes may be an effective policy to sustainably decrease purchases of sweetened drinks and calories from sugar in independent stores, with large reductions in lower-income areas and among customers with lower levels of education.

### What is the role of portion control in weight management? [^ab062d56]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Does it matter when or how often PPFs are consumed or what they contain?

The European Food Safety Authority gives specific advice for the use of meal replacements and PPFs. Such products may contain a maximum of 250 kcal, and for weight loss two meals a day should be replaced while for weight loss maintenance one meal a day should be replaced. Such recommendations are based on the totality of the evidence rather than on studies designed to specifically optimize the effectiveness of portion-controlled meals. In particular, for PPFs it is not clear whether there is an optimal energy content or the number or type of meals that should be replaced.

Some commercial weight-loss programs start clients with PPFs across the entire day with the option of eating additional nutrient-rich, low-energy-dense foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Over time, clients transition to less frequent use, but they can continue to substitute PPFs for meals or snacks as desired. Although there are no known studies directly comparing different daily frequencies of consumption, PPFs have been shown to provide a useful tool if consumed twice a day or just at one meal. When PPFs consisting of frozen entrées were used twice a day, at lunch and dinner, they facilitated weight loss over 8 weeks. In another study, consumption of portion-controlled ready-to-eat breakfast cereal for breakfast and one other meal each day for 2 weeks was associated with reduced energy intake and improved weight loss compared with a group receiving no intervention. During an 8-week behavioral weight-loss intervention, the provision of a variety of portion-controlled foods just at breakfast reduced daily energy intake compared with non-portioned packages of the same foods but did not lead to greater weight loss. When subjects in a lab-based study chose a PPF for lunch, they ate around 250 kcal less each day than when they ate lunch from a buffet. This reduction was sustained over the 2-week intervention and led to greater weight loss. Thus substitution of one or two meals a day with PPFs can help people manage their energy intake. Although the ready availability, variety and convenience of PPFs makes them a useful tool to help consumers avoid the overconsumption associated with large portions, studies are needed to ascertain how to best incorporate them into diets to optimize their effectiveness.

### Are energy-dense foods really cheaper? Reexamining the relation between food price and energy density [^05439e43]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The inverse relation between energy density (kcal/g) and energy cost (price/kcal) has been interpreted to suggest that produce (fruit, vegetables) is more expensive than snacks (cookies, chips).

Objective

The objective of this study was to show the methodologic weakness of comparing energy density with energy cost.

Design

The relation between energy density and energy cost was replicated in a random-number data set. Additionally, observational data were collected for produce and snacks from an online supermarket. Variables included total energy (kcal), total weight (g), total number of servings, serving size (g/serving), and energy density (kcal/g). Price measures included energy cost ($/kcal), total price ($), unit price ($/g), and serving price ($/serving). Two-tailed t tests were used to compare price measures by food category. Relations between energy density and price measures within food categories were examined with the use of Spearman rank correlation analysis.

Results

The relation between energy density and energy cost was shown to be driven by the algebraic properties of these variables. Food category was strongly correlated with both energy density and food price measures. Energy cost was higher for produce than for snacks. However, total price and unit price were lower for produce. Serving price and serving size were greater for produce than for snacks. Within food categories, energy density was uncorrelated with most measures of food price, except for a weak positive correlation with serving price within the produce category.

Conclusion

The findings suggest the relation between energy density and food price is confounded by food category and depends on which measure of price is used.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^7db7db80]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Sweet-tasting products — nonnutritive sweeteners may have a role: "Additional improvements in nutrient density of sweet-tasting products could be obtained if nonnutritive sweeteners are used as a tool to replace added sugars and help lower caloric intake". The document notes, "Several nonnutritive sweeteners have been accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration as safe and have shown good safety over time", yet "data are scarce on long-term benefits for weight management in children and adolescents or on the consequences of long-term consumption". It concludes, "Continued research is needed".

### Chocolate-candy consumption and 3-year weight gain among postmenopausal U.S. women [^d9f5b9b5]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that greater chocolate-candy intake is associated with more weight gain in postmenopausal women.

Methods

A prospective cohort study involved 107,243 postmenopausal American women aged 50–79 years (mean = 60.7) at enrollment in the Women's Health Initiative, with 3-year follow-up. Chocolate-candy consumption was assessed by food frequency questionnaire, and body weight was measured. Linear mixed models, adjusted for demographic, socio economic, anthropomorphic, and behavioral variables, were used to test our main hypotheses.

Results

Compared with women who ate a 1 oz (∼28 g) serving of chocolate candy < 1 per month, those who ate this amount 1 per month to < 1 per week, 1 per week to < 3 per week and ≥ 3 per week showed greater 3-year prospective weight gains (kg) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.85), 0.95 (0.84, 1.06), and 1.40 (1.27, 1.53), respectively, (P for linear trend < 0.0001). Each additional 1 oz/day was associated with a greater 3-year weight gain (kg) of 0.92 (0.80, 1.05). The weight gain in each chocolate-candy intake level increased as BMI increased above the normal range (18.5–25 kg/m²), and was inversely associated with age.

Conclusions

Greater chocolate-candy intake was associated with greater prospective weight gain in this cohort of postmenopausal women.

### Is a voluntary healthy food policy effective? evaluating effects on foods and drinks for sale in hospitals and resulting policy changes [^345d8f0c]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Data recorded for each audited food and drink item included (where available) product name or description, brand or manufacturer name, barcode details, product and serving sizes (weight in grams (g) or volume in millilitres (mL) as given on the package or by weighing), nutrient information provided on product packaging (energy, protein, saturated fat, total sugars, sodium, and fibre content per 100 g or 100 mL, and per serve), displayed HSR value (between 0.5 and 5 stars), ingredients list, recipes for cooked mixed dishes, item availability (for packaged items, defined as the number of outward front-facing items when placed on the edge of the shelf or the number of slots an item occupies in a vending machine; for unpackaged items, defined as either available for order from a menu or pre-cooked/pre-prepared as a batch and offered instantly as individual portions), any promotional practice (price reduction, prominent display location such as eye level position, check-out display or placement near cash register), promotional sticker, feature in advertising materials, or part of a package/combo deal), unit price in NZ$, and product photos. Where nutrient information was not readily available, it was sourced from suppliers, manufacturer or supermarket websites, the Nutritrack database of packaged products (managed by the University of Auckland), calculated from recipes, or the research team matched food or drink items to appropriate nutrient lines in the New Zealand food composition tables. Inpatient meals, foods and drinks brought in by staff or visitors for their own consumption, and hot drinks, were excluded since these are not within the Policy scope.

### Candesartan cilexetil [^8f4fe323]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil.

Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension.

All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² should not receive candesartan cilexetil since candesartan cilexetil has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below:

Preparation of Oral Suspension:

Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension.

Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension.

Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus®(80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF®(80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF®(160 mL).
Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle.
Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size.
Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary.
Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle.
Mix thoroughly.
Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles.
Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions:
Store at room temperature (below 30°C/86°F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle.
Do not freeze.
Shake well before each use.

2.3 Adult Heart Failure

The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient.

### Content analysis of e-cigarette products, promotions, prices and claims on internet tobacco vendor websites, 2013–2014 [^7730430e]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the population of Internet e-cigarette vendors (IEVs) and conduct content analysis of products sold and IEVs' promotional, claims and pricing practices.

Methods

Multiple sources were used to identify IEV websites, primarily complex search algorithms scanning over 180million websites. In 2013, 32446 websites were manually screened, identifying 980 IEVs, with the 281 most popular selected for content analysis. This methodology yielded 31239 websites for manual screening in 2014, identifying 3096 IEVs, with 283 selected for content analysis.

Results

While the majority of IEVs (71.9%) were US based in 2013, this dropped to 64.3% in 2014 (p < 0.01), with IEVs located in at least 38 countries, and 12% providing location indicators reflecting two or more countries, complicating jurisdictional determinations. Reflecting the retail market, IEVs are transitioning from offering disposable and 'cigalike' e-cigarettes to larger tank and "mod" systems. Flavored e-cigarettes were available from 85.9% of IEVs in 2014, with fruit and candy flavors being most popular. Most vendors (76.5%) made health claims in 2013, dropping to 43.1% in 2014. Some IEVs featured conflicting claims about whether or not e-cigarettes aid in smoking cessation. There was wide variation in pricing, with e-cigarettes available as inexpensive as one dollar, well within the affordable range for adults and teens.

Conclusions

The number of Internet e-cigarette vendors grew threefold from 2013 to 2014, far surpassing the number of Internet cigarette vendors (N = 775) at the 2004 height of that industry. New and expanded regulations for online e-cigarette sales are needed, including restrictions on flavors and marketing claims.

### Longitudinal evaluation of the impact of standardised packaging and minimum excise tax on tobacco sales and industry revenue in the UK [^98417131]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Tobacco industry revenue

Tobacco industry revenues refer to net revenues after tobacco taxes have been paid (ie, net price multiplied by sales), and hence cover the manufacturing, packaging, retailing, and distribution costs with the remainder accruing as industry profit. Revenue was calculated in three stages. First, to allow for the variation in pack size over time, we calculated price per stick (FM) or stick equivalents (RYO) as our measure of price. To calculate stick equivalent prices for RYO, we again used a weight of 0.5 g per stick. Real prices were calculated via adjusting nominal prices for inflation to May 2015 prices using the official UK measure of inflation. Second, we calculated net revenue per stick as the price per stick minus the taxes due on each stick. The taxes were the tobacco taxes (specific, ad valorem, and MET) and VAT. Third, for each SKU, we multiplied the net price per stick by the volume of sticks sold.

Statistical analysis

To take account of tobacco industry market segments and non-linear effects of predictor variables including time, and to create confidence intervals in order to understand whether patterns in the data are noise or evidence of a significant change in outcome variables, we estimated additive mixed models (AMM), which is a special case of Generalised Additive Mixed Models. We used R version 3.6.1 with the Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness (mgcv) package. Parameter estimation used penalised least squares. We created two models. The dependent variable for the first model was volume and for the second, tobacco industry revenue.

Point of sale data are difficult to model due to a large number of zero sales as products come on and off the market. We overcame this issue by aggregating the UK sales by market segment and type, that is, summing over SKU for each segment type combination. Thus, in our dataset for modelling volume, rather than each case representing a product/SKU (in a particular month and geographical area), each case represented a market segment (in a month). In our model of tobacco industry revenue, we were interested in the overall impact (rather than by market segment), so in the dataset for modelling, each case represented a month. As with volumes, revenues of the original cases were summed to create the revenue for each month in the dataset used for modelling.

### Are food and beverage purchases in households with preschoolers changing? a longitudinal analysis from 2000 to 2011 [^2590b4cc]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

U.S. dietary studies from 2003 to 2010 show decreases in children's caloric intake. We examined purchases of consumer packaged foods/beverages in the U.S. between 2000 and 2011 among households with children aged 2–5 years.

Purpose

To describe changes in consumer packaged goods (CPG) purchases between 2000 and 2011 after adjusting for economic indicators, and explore differences by race, education, and household income level.

Methods

CPG purchase data were obtained for 42,753 U.S. households with one or more child aged 2–5 years using the Nielsen Homescan Panel. Top sources of purchased calories were grouped, and random effects regression was used to model the relationship between calories purchased from each group and race, female head of household education, and household income. Models adjusted for household composition, market-level unemployment rate, prices, and quarter, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05).

Results

Between 2000 and 2011, adjusted total calories purchased from foods (-182 kcal/day) and beverages (-100 kcal/day) declined significantly. Decreases in purchases of milk (-40 kcal); soft drinks (-27 kcal/day); juice and juice drinks (-24 kcal/day); grain-based desserts (-24 kcal/day); savory snacks (-17 kcal/day); and sweet snacks and candy (-13 kcal/day) were among the major changes. Changes in CPG purchases differed significantly by race, female head of household education, and household income.

Conclusions

Trends in CPG purchases suggest that solid fats and added sugars are decreasing in the food supply of U.S. preschoolers. Pronounced differences by race, education, and household income persist.

### Measuring the illicit cigarette market in the absence of pack security features: a case study of South Africa [^10da7ed2]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Price threshold

The price threshold method identifies a price point that separates legal cigarettes from illegal cigarettes. In the market, the final price of cigarettes is the sum of manufacturing costs, taxes (excise, Value Added Tax (VAT) and possibly other duties), distribution costs (producer, wholesaler, and retailer), and profits. A price threshold is determined, below which it is impossible to sell the product and cover all costs. The price threshold method has previously been used in South Africa, Brazil, and Colombia.

The crucial variable for the price threshold method is the price paid by smokers the last time they bought cigarettes. In the absence of minimum price legislation, it is possible that companies sell fully tax-paid cigarettes at a price below the price threshold (eg, in order to gain market share), but such a pricing strategy would be unsustainable for any length of time.

In South Africa, a specific excise tax is applied to every pack of 20 cigarettes, irrespective of brand, price or other features. In 2017, the excise tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes was R14.30 and the 14% VAT on excise was R2.00 (total tax of R16.30). Evidence from the South African tobacco industry suggests that in 2017, it cost R2.50 to produce a pack of cigarettes. If one adds the 14% VAT on R2.50 (R0.35), the total is R19.15. Information on distribution costs and profits (at the producer, wholesale and retail level) were unavailable. These expenses (and the VAT on them) are not included in the price threshold calculation. The price threshold was set at R20 per pack of 20 cigarettes (R1 per stick). Reporting illicit trade estimates by packaging type (single, 10-pack, 20-pack, 30-pack, carton) is important especially in countries where single sticks are widely available, as illicit trade estimates may differ by packaging type. In South Africa, the proportion of cigarettes sold for R1 or less per stick is highest for cartons, while the proportion is similar for those sold in packs of 20 cigarettes and those sold as singles.

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^750f7056]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Intervention costs

Country specific resource needs and costs were derived using the WHO-CHOICE database, which includes detailed component specific estimates of inputs (ingredients) required for each intervention stage for each country's government and the estimated unit price for each input in that country including for example costs of human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment, and mass media (see supplementary eMethods). To facilitate comparisons between countries, we converted all costs to international dollars (I$) (see supplementary eMethods), which account for each nation's currency as well as purchasing power parity. One I$ in any given country can be interpreted as the funds needed to purchase the same amounts of goods or services in that country as one US$ would purchase in the US. For countries with lower incomes than the US, conversion of our findings from I$ to US$ would substantially increase the apparent cost effectiveness (ie, the cost in US$ per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved would be much lower). We summed costs by year to calculate the total cost of the 10 year intervention for each country, with 3% annual discounting.

We modeled only governmental intervention costs, for several reasons. First, this cost is most relevant to budget constrained governments, since the program cost must be borne directly and immediately. Second, net industry sector costs for product reformulation in each country would be difficult to determine because once the relevant reformulation has been undertaken in any single country, the knowledge of that reformulation can be extended with much less additional cost to other countries. For example, multinational companies transfer improved recipes and reformulation strategies across borders with no cost, as do food scientists moving between firms, and so on. Third, in contrast to recent US models, we did not include estimated healthcare savings or increased productivity from prevented cardiovascular disease events because such savings could, in theory, be partly offset by new downstream health events resulting from enhanced survivaland because comparable healthcare and productivity costing data are available for a minority of countries globally. Because including such cost savings would be optimal according to many cost effectiveness guidelines, our results for overall cost effectiveness should be considered a conservative estimate.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^3a5e8afe]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity prevention — managing the food and activity environment — after an assessment of the current food environment has been performed, the family should be encouraged to buy fewer of the foods that are associated with the development of obesity, such as sweetened beverages (including fruit-flavored drinks), high-caloric-density snacks, or sweets. If these items are present in the house for special occasions or other purposes, they should be purchased immediately before the event and removed immediately afterward to decrease the temptation to snack on these items. In contrast, healthy alternatives, such as water pitchers, fruits, vegetable snacks, and other low-calorie snacks should be readily available at all times and placed in plain sight; for example, in front of the refrigerator or in large bowls on the kitchen counter or table. Practically, the cookie jar should be replaced by a fruit bowl.

### Top sources and trends in consumption of total energy and energy from solid fats and added sugars among youth aged 2–18 years: United States 2009–2018 [^fce03f15]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High energy intake from non-nutrient-dense sources correlates with poorer diet quality.

Objectives

The aims were to 1) estimate total energy intake and energy from solid fats and added sugars combined (SoFAS) and identify their top food category sources for ages 2–18 y in 2015–2018 and 2) describe trends over time in 2009–2018.

Methods

Data were from the NHANES. Pairwise differences were examined using univariate t statistics (2015–2018, n = 5038), and trends by age and over time (2009–2018, n = 14,038) were examined using orthogonal polynomials.

Results

In 2015–2018, SoFAS contributed a mean (SE) of 30.0% (0.3%) of total energy. Solid fats [16.1% (0.2%)] and added sugars [13.8% (0.2%)] each contributed > 10%. The contribution of added sugars increased with age from 11.1% (2–3 y) to 14.4% (14–18 y), and was higher for all other race/Hispanic origins than non-Hispanic Asians. The top 5 sources of energy were sweet bakery products, savory snacks, pizza, other mixed dishes, and unflavored milk, and for SoFAS also included soft drinks, other desserts, candy, and snack bars. Total energy did not change between 2009 and 2018, but energy from SoFAS, and servings of solid fats, and added sugars declined. The contribution of unflavored milk to total energy declined for all ages and most race/Hispanic origins. Fruit drinks (all ages) and soft drinks (9–18 y) remained among top added sugars sources despite declines. The contribution of sweet bakery products to energy from SoFAS increased for most ages and candy and snack bars to energy from added sugars.

Conclusions

In 2015–2018, SoFAS contributed > 30% of total energy for ages 2–18 y, which doubled the Dietary Guidelines for Americans' recommended limit of 15%. The top 5 sources of total energy were similar to those of solid fats, and those of SoFAS similar to those of added sugars. These results may inform public health efforts for improving diet quality.

### Cost-effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infection in long-term care facilities: economic evaluation with a randomized controlled trial [^d630797e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Costs

The economic model included two types of costs. The first was the costs of cranberry use (parameter c 1). These costs were estimated at €439 annually (€0.62 per intake) based on one capsule twice a day, a market price of €44 for 180 capsules, on average 45 seconds of nursing time per capsule (estimated using time registrations), nursing time valued at €30 per hour, and 97% adherence (1.00 euro = 1.37 U.S. dollar).

The second type of costs were the costs associated with each UTI (parameter c 2, Table 1), including costs of UTI diagnostics and antibiotic treatment, additional care by the elderly-care physician, additional nursing care, and hospitalizations. Costs of UTI diagnostics and antibiotic treatment per UTI were calculated from actual costs in patient records for each UTI (n = 548). Additional care by the elderly-care physician was estimated at on average €25 per UTI (10–30 minutes of time, valued at €111 per hour). Additional nursing costs during the 2 weeks after a UTI were estimated in proportion to the Care Dependency Scale, which measures 15 items of basic care needs, each rated on a 5-point scale (1 = completely dependent; 5 = completely independent). Hospitalizations costs were recorded for six UTIs (1% of n = 548), all in high-UTI-risk participants. Costs per hospitalization ranged from €3,000 (for 6 days of normal hospital care) to €15,000 (for 7 days of normal care and 5 days of intensive care).

### Children and adolescents' exposure to food and beverage marketing in social media apps [^7ed61550]. Pediatric Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Food marketing exposures were also categorized as promoting either a product or a brand (the former if they featured a specific product and the latter if they featured a company logo or an unidentified food item; eg, branded disposable cup). The instances of food marketing were also categorized by food company and by food category. The food categories included the following: cold cereal, cakes, cookies, and ice cream, candy and chocolate, snacks, 100% fruit juice, sugar‐sweetened beverages (including regular soft drinks, sports drinks, fruit drinks, energy drinks and iced tea, among others), diet soft drinks, alcohol, tea or coffee, water, fast food restaurant, nonfast food restaurant, yogurt, cheese, supermarket (unless it featured a product), food delivery service/company, condiments/spreads, and other and mixed categories as has been used in previous research. 13

The classification of food marketing instances as described above was done by one research assistant (E‐A.R.) and reviewed by another (E.P.).

2.3 Nutritional analysis

The energy and nutrient content of promoted products (except for alcohol) was collected from, in order of priority, the Canadian company website, the Nutrition Facts table found on packaging in store, US company website, or the Canadian Nutrient File. Information collected included calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, carbohydrates, fibre, sugar, and protein per stated serving size. The volume of beverages (mL) was converted into grams using their specific density (g/mL). 14 Nutrition information for products featured in nine food marketing exposures was incomplete (n = 8) or not available (n = 1).

The healthfulness of promoted foods was assessed by a registered dietitian (E.P.) using the Pan American Health Organization Nutrient Profile Model (PAHO NPM) 15 and the UK Nutrient Profile Model (UK NPM). 16 The former was chosen as it only considers negative nutrients that are of concern for public health while the latter was chosen because it categorizes food based on their content in healthier and less healthy nutritional components and has been validated. 17, 18

### Pricing of tobacco products during, and after, the introduction of standardized packaging: an observational study of retail price data from independent and convenience (small) retailers in the United Kingdom [^7f5359a8]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Analysis

Data were analysed using SPSS version 23 and Microsoft Excel. In each month, the nominal average RRP and sales price (i.e. unadjusted for inflation and tax) were calculated for each product across the retailer sample, with 5% trimmed means used to exclude outlying values from manual EPoS errors. The nominal average RRP and sales price for each product were then adjusted to October 2017 prices using the 'all items' Consumer Prices Index, including owner‐occupiers' housing costs (CPIH), the lead measure of inflation in the United Kingdom 40, 41. Inflation increased 3.6% over the 18 months of observation (CPIH Index range = 100.8–104.4; base year = 2015). Inflation‐adjusted prices were calculated by multiplying the nominal average RRP and sales price for each product by the CPIH 'all items' Index for October 2017 divided by the Index value for each reference month.

The monthly RRP‐per‐cigarette/gram and sales price‐per‐cigarette/gram was calculated for each product by dividing the average inflation‐adjusted RRP and sales price by pack size. The average RRP/price‐per‐cigarette was calculated across all FMC products and in each price segment (value, mid‐price, premium). The average RRP/price‐per‐gram was calculated across the RYO category, without segmentation. In each month, a product was only included in the average RRP/price‐per‐cigarette or per‐gram if it had been sold by at least 1% of the retailer sample (n = 5). If a product was available in a price‐marked and non‐price‐marked variant, prices‐per‐cigarette and prices‐per‐gram were computed using the combined average.

### Effect of a price discount and consumer education strategy on food and beverage purchases in remote indigenous Australia: a stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial [^8f8c501c]. The Lancet: Public Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence is mounting that price discounts can be effective in improving diet. This study examined the effectiveness of a 20% price discount on food and drink purchases with and without consumer education in remote Indigenous Australia.

Methods

A 20% discount on fruit, vegetables, water, and artificially sweetened soft drinks was applied for 24 weeks in 20 communities in remote Indigenous Australia where the community store was managed by the Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation (ALPA) or Outback Stores (OBS) in a stepped-wedge randomised trial. Communities were randomly allocated to a fixed framework of five sets of four stratified by store association; ten stores (two in each set) were randomly assigned to receive consumer education. A store from each of the ALPA and OBS store groups (contained in separate opaque envelopes) was selected, and stores in turn continued to be consecutively allocated to the fixed store set framework, starting with the first store slot in the first store set, until all stores had been allocated. The effect of the discount on the weight of fruit and vegetables purchased (the primary endpoint) was assessed using weekly store sales data and mixed models per protocol. We did sensitivity analyses by repeating the analyses with the outliers included and repeating the analyses for the primary outcome measure removing each store one at a time. This trial was registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12613000694718.

Findings

Weekly store sales data on all food and drink products sold in 20 stores were collected from July 1, 2012, to Dec 28, 2014. Price discount alone was associated with a 12.7% (95% CI 4.1–22.1) increase in purchases in grams of fruit and vegetables combined (primary outcome), and a 19.8% (6.2–35.1) increase post discount (after vs before); an effect of 12 g and 18 g per capita per day. Sensitivity analyses did not modify the results for the primary outcome measure.

Interpretation

A 20% discount can only increase fruit and vegetable purchases to help protect against obesity and diet related disease to a certain extent. Large discounts might have a greater impact than small discounts. Creative merchandising approaches to consumer education could also be considered alongside fiscal interventions to achieve marked improvements in diet.

### Potential impact on prevalence of obesity in the UK of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks: modelling study [^26feb1ba]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analyses

Analyses were carried out on the full sample and subsamples by annual income (low < £20 000, middle £20 000–49 999, and high ≥ £50 000) and BMI (not overweight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 to < 30), and obese (≥ 30)) of the main household purchaser — that is, the person generally responsible for food purchase in a household. As not all participants on the 2013 database reported income (11% missing, 3554 households), the final estimation sample used to estimate changes included 29 066 households. BMI data were missing from a further 13% (4290 households), hence the number of participants for the stratified analysis by BMI group equalled 24 776.

We used the own PED and cross PED matrix for all BMI and income groups to estimate change in per person energy purchase simulating a 20% price increase in one or multiple high sugar snack groups. New energy purchase totals per income or BMI group, or both were constructed by totalling scenario specific energy purchases for each food group. Confidence intervals of changes in energy purchase were constructed using intragroup variability of energy purchase as well as variance of estimates for own PEDs and cross PEDs (see equations 1 and 2 in the technical appendix).

To estimate the combined effect of multiple price increases on energy purchase we used a chained version of the methods previously described. This covered the combined effect of a 20% price increase in confectionery, biscuits, and cake.

We used the change in average energy purchased per household member (unadjusted for age or sex) as a proxy for change in energy intake of the main purchaser to estimate change in weight. A static model estimated average weight change for each BMI and income group (see equation 3 in the technical appendix) based on change in energy intake. An average of 7715 kcal/kg (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ = 0.00418 MJ) weight loss was used, with a standard deviation of 245 kcal (representing a 7% coefficient of variation and assumed a normal distribution, in line with values reported in the literature for energy expenditure in healthy adults (eg). We disregarded any changes in energy expenditure resulting from weight fluctuations, as we expected the change in weight and hence energy expenditure to be small over the course of one year. For each subgroup we ran 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using best estimates, variance of change in energy purchase and variance of energy expenditure.

### Intakes and sources of total and added sugars among 4 to 13-year-old children in China, Mexico and the United States [^8b654757]. Pediatric Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Our data show that the added sugars contribution represented 12% and 16% of TEIs in Mexico and in the United States, respectively. This ratio was obtained by using the energy intake calculated from the participant's 24‐h dietary recall (1847 kcal in Mexico and 1905 kcal in the United States) and is above WHO's recommendation of 10% of total energy from free sugars. On average, the recommended energy intake for moderately active children aged 4–12 years can be assumed to be around 1700 kcal d −1 24, indicating that overall mean energy consumption is above the recommended threshold as well. Therefore, if one would take this recommended energy intake value, the percent contribution of added sugars would be even higher, which represents a further risk of calorie displacement.

Different food sources contributed to total and added sugar intakes between countries. In China, the main source of sugars was from naturally‐occurring sources, such as fruits and vegetables. In contrast, in both Mexico and the United States, the main contributors to sugar intakes were added sugars present in beverages, such as SSBs (soft drinks and fruit drinks) and sweetened milk‐based beverages. These results highlight the cultural differences in food choices. Previous research has also observed the excessive contribution of SSBs in the United States 17 and Mexico 25. Indeed, in Mexico, some traditional dishes are commonly consumed with a sweetened beverage such as a soda 26 rather than plain water. Second, while bakery products were common sources of total and added sugars across the three countries, the type of the bakery products differed. In China, these were mainly rolls and buns, cakes and pies; in Mexico, these were mostly cookies and sweetened breads (pan dulce); and in the United States these were mainly ice cream and frozen dairy desserts, candy, cookies and brownies, and RTE cereal (mostly high sugars RTE cereal (> 21.2 g/100 g)). While these foods are typically consumed at snacking occasions or breakfast, their history of consumption varies between countries: in the United States, brownies, cookies and candies have been consumed for a long time and their consumption is embedded in the local culture. Similarly, in Mexico, bread was introduced by the Spaniards, and sweetened breads (pan dulce) are part of the every day diet 16. Finally, the introduction of sweet pastries is more recent in China; those may be consumed at the expense of traditional diets which comprise whole grains, legumes and vegetables, a reflection of the nutrition transition 27. This potentially rapid change in eating habits highlights the need to monitor the changes in intake of sweet bakery products with time in China.

### Opportunities and barriers for smaller portions in food service: lessons from marketing and behavioral economics [^c171aee9]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Change default to smaller portion of less-healthy foods and add healthier ones

Another way to reduce the default sizes of less-healthy foods is to serve them with additional portions of complementary healthy items. For example, some restaurants offer customers French fries, salad, or half-and-half. Half-and-half could be made the new default at places like Applebee's. McDonald's has experimented with something similar in its Happy Meals, replacing its traditional small French fries with a small serving of French fries (100 calories) plus apple slices.

The advantages of this approach are that it allows customers to satisfy their craving for French fries while reducing energy intake, and not undermining value perception (because the smaller portion of fries is made up with something else). Still, risks remain.

If consumers do not like the virtue item (salad or apples) they may throw it out, not only leading to unnecessary waste, but also leading the customer to perceive a value loss. Even if they eat the virtue item, many consumers may not enjoy it very much, at least compared to the French fries, leading to reduced satisfaction. This tradeoff is one that many 'eager' health customers will like, but reluctant customers will be more resistant to. So the opportunity is biggest with chains that have a large eager segment.

The approach will not work for all menu categories. For example, it will not work straightforwardly for things that cannot be mixed or put on the same plate, like beverages. Still, beverages can be served in separate glasses or bottles. In addition, some blends may work better than previously thought. The Mushroom Council is now working with food operators to market a blended burger that is 60% beef and 40% mushroom. If something like that became the default, higher-calorie beef portions would effectively be reduced.

The main cost barrier in most of these mixed offerings is that in most cases it adds to product and operational costs. Generally, the operator will need more of the healthier items, which tend to be more expensive (although perhaps not in the case of beef versus mushrooms), and adding two items to a side dish instead of one involves operational costs in cooking, serving and communicating.

Still this is one of the best opportunities because it limits the major threat of value erosion. And operational innovation can reduce the cost of most complicated processes. The question is will any operators invest the research and development dollars to make this happen?

### Costs of vaping: evidence from ITC four country smoking and vaping survey [^bcf72e2e]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides the first evidence using self-reported prices paid for NVP devices and supplies compared with cigarettes in four countries. In general, we found price of disposable NVPs to be higher than the price of a comparable unit for combustible cigarettes in EN, USA and CA. Price of prefilled cartridges is higher than the price of a comparable unit of combustible cigarettes in USA and CA. By contrast, price of e-liquid is lower than the price of a comparable unit of combustible in all four countries. In AU, price of all NVP types is consistently lower than the price of a comparable unit of combustible, in part due to the very high cigarette prices there.

For startup costs, the cost of purchasing a rechargeable NVP with refilled cartridges or e-liquids is approximately 3–5 times higher than purchasing a pack of cigarettes across all four countries. For an average daily smoker who smokes around 15 cigarettes per day (CPD), it takes the equivalent of around 7 packs of 20 cigarettes to pay for the device, meaning the cost of purchasing a rechargeable device could be recovered in approximately 9–10 days.

In addition, our data indicate that while the startup price of using rechargeable NVPs is relatively high, once the starter kit is purchased, the additional cost for prefilled cartridges or bottles of e-liquids may be a financially attractive alternative to factory-made cigarettes, especially for smokers from AU and EN. The high upfront costs of purchasing a reusable NVP may discourage some smokers from switching to vaping. However, the average lower costs of cartridges and e-liquids relative to a package of cigarettes makes switching to a NVP an attractive alternative to smoking in the long term so long as smokers switch completely to vaping.

The findings from this study underscores the importance of policy makers considering how policies they implement might impacting the relative price differential between NVPs and cigarettes. For example, policies that restrict where NVPs are sold could inadvertently increase the cost of NVPs relative to cigarettes making NVPs less attractive as cigarette substitutes. Regulators should consider tax systems for NVPs which imposes taxes high enough to discourage initiation among young people, but also keep the prices of NVPs low relative to the costs of cigarettes which pose a greater risk to health.

### Estimated costs of production and potential prices for the WHO essential medicines list [^6f2818e7]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

Additional references for this section are given in an online supplementary appendix. Medicines with solid oral formulations from the 2015 EML were included (see online supplementary appendix for excluded formulations). All monetary values are expressed in US dollars.

Country of production

We assumed API procurement and formulation of finished pharmaceutical product (FPP) in India due to its large generic industry and historical importance in treatment of the HIV epidemic. The main alternative country to consider as a focus for the analysis was China; for pharmaceutical manufacture, India and China are similar in cost of labour, infrastructure and tax. However, Indian manufacturers have more experience with the WHO prequalification programme (an initiative that certifies the quality of medicines), which currently lists 335 products manufactured in India, but only 23 manufactured in China.

Estimation of API cost

Data on price per kilogram of API exported from India was collected from an online database (infodriveindia.com) that collects data published pursuant to Indian customs regulations. Prices for exported goods in the database are given in both Indian rupees and US dollars, with the US dollar value calculated based on the exchange rate on the day of the transaction. Search terms used and full exclusion criteria are available in the online supplementary appendix. The default timeframe for API shipments used in the database search was 1 July 2014 to 1 July 2016, and was extended backwards by 2 years until at least 100 records were available, up to a maximum 6-year timeframe.

Linear regression was used to estimate the per-kilogram price on 1 July 2016 of exported API. API price per dose was calculated, and multiplied by a 'salt-factor' for drugs whose dose is expressed in the EML in terms of the active molecule, but for which the API is manufactured in a salt form (eg, an 'erythromycin 250 mg' tablet contains 360 mg of erythromycin estolate). Stata/IC V.14.0 for Mac was used for statistical analysis of the API dataset.

Costs of excipients

Typical costs of excipients used in tablets and typical proportion of the FPP made up by each excipient were combined, and excipients were assumed to represent 50% of total tablet weight. This yielded an estimated average excipient cost of US$2.63 per kilogram of FPP (see online supplementary appendix).

### The advertised price of cigarette packs in retail outlets across Australia before and after the implementation of plain packaging: a repeated measures observational study [^2837d381]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Store sample and selection

In May 2012, stores were selected from 16 sampling areas within Australia's two largest cities — Melbourne and Sydney — and eight areas in each of the cities of Adelaide and Perth. Sampling areas were selected by stratifying all postcodes within the metropolitan boundaries of each city into four SES categories using the Socioeconomic Indices for Areas 2011 Index of Relative Disadvantage, then randomly selecting equal numbers of postcodes from each SES category in each city. Each of these postcodes formed the primary postcode of that sampling area. For efficiency during store selection, a nearby secondary postcode was selected for each area, matched by SES category. Therefore, each sampling area was comprised of two postcodes.

Maps of each sampling area identifying potentially useful shopping strips and centres were created. Fieldworkers were instructed to visit the largest shopping strip in the primary postcode and, using a rigorous set of walking rules, sample all potentially eligible stores until either their store quotas were met or they had sampled the entire shopping strip. In the latter situation, the second largest shopping area in the primary postcode was then sampled, and so on. If all shopping strips were exhausted in the primary postcode, the sampling procedure was continued in the secondary postcode. Potentially eligible stores were:
Supermarkets: large grocery chains;
Convenience stores: small independent supermarkets and branded chain convenience stores with a broad range of products and extended opening hours;
Small mixed-businesses: milk bars (Melbourne), delis (Adelaide and Perth), corner stores and general stores;
Petrol stations: any store that sold petrol, including those branded as convenience stores or supermarket chains;
Newsagents/lottery outlets: stores that sold newspapers, magazines and stationery as their primary business and/or lottery tickets and services.

Quotas were set at nine stores per area, including one of each store type in every area wherever possible. We visited a total of 796 stores, of which a total of 375 (47.1%) did not meet the eligibility criteria in that they did not sell tobacco (n = 129, 16.2%), had no visible price board (n = 225, 28.3%), or displayed fewer than three single cigarette pack prices (n = 21, 2.6%), leaving 421 stores in the sample.

### Impact of smoking reduced nicotine content cigarettes on sensitivity to cigarette price: further results from a multi-site clinical trial [^79341699]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the impact of a reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes on estimated consumption of reduced nicotine cigarettes and usual brand cigarettes at a variety of hypothetical prices.

Design

Double-blind study with participants assigned randomly to receive cigarettes for 6 weeks that were either usual brand or an investigational cigarette with one of five nicotine contents.

Setting

Ten sites across the United States.

Participants

A total of 839 eligible adult smokers randomized from 2013 to 2014.

Intervention and Comparator

Participants received their usual brand or an investigational cigarette with one of five nicotine contents: 15.8 (primary control), 5.2, 2.4, 1.3, or 0.4 mg/g.

Measurements

The Cigarette Purchase Task was completed at baseline and at the week 6 post-randomization visit.

Findings

Compared with normal nicotine content controls, the lowest nicotine content (0.4 mg/g) reduced the number of study cigarettes participants estimated they would smoke at a range of prices [mean reduction relative to 15.8 mg/g at a price of $4.00/pack: 9.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.81,12.19]. The lowest nicotine content also reduced the maximum amount of money allocated to study cigarettes and the price at which participants reported they would stop buying study cigarettes [median reduction relative to 15.8 mg/g, 95% CI = $8.21 (4.27,12.15) per day and $0.44 (0.17,0.71) per cigarette, respectively]. A reduction in nicotine content to the lowest level also reduced the maximum amount of money allocated to usual brand cigarettes (median reduction relative to 15.8 mg/g: $4.39 per day, 95% CI = 1.88,6.90).

Conclusions

In current smokers, a reduction in nicotine content may reduce cigarette consumption, reduce the reinforcement value of cigarettes and increase cessation if reduced nicotine content cigarettes were the only cigarette available for purchase.

### Tobacco industry strategies undermine government tax policy: evidence from commercial data [^cdf54425]. Tobacco Control (2017). Low credibility.

Segmentation

Consistent with our previous study, SKUs were allocated to price segments and price segment labels were identified based on the commercial literature review and an analysis of their relative pricing each month. Details are provided in online supplementary file 1.

Analysis of pricing and volumes

Having allocated SKUs to segments, we explored prices, volumes, use of price-marking and variation in pack sizes by segment. In order to lessen small number anomalies, analyses were restricted to SKUs which reached a market share of > 0.008% for at least 3 months (see online supplementary table S2).

Weighted average real prices

Weighted average real pricesby segment were calculated by weighting for volumes sold and adjusting for inflation (thus creating real prices) using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For each segment, we assessed pack and stick prices. For the latter, one RYO stick was set to contain 0.5 g tobacco based on the latest available survey data showing this is the average weight per RYO stick in Englandand the UK. For pack prices, preliminary analysis showed that pricing patterns over time for different pack sizes were similar, so data on all pack sizes were pooled to calculate weighted average real prices by segment for FM and RYO.

Impact of 2011 budget on RYO pricing

To understand whether the 2011 budget was successful in its objective of raising RYO prices, we compared the median monthly price rise in each RYO segment immediately after the 2011 budget enactment with median monthly price rises immediately following the other budget enactments and across the data series as a whole.

Volumes

As pack sizes changed over time, we assessed changes in sales volumes of FM and RYO over time using the number of sticks sold (again based on 0.5 g of tobacco per RYO stick). We assessed volumes in the tobacco market as a whole, for FM and RYO and by segment.

Pack size and price-marking

To examine changes in pack size over time, we identified popular pack sizes and calculated the market share by pack size for each segment annually over the study period. We explored patterns in the use of price-marking (printing the price on the pack, normally in bright bold font) by calculating the percentage of price marked packs by segment and pack size each month. We also calculated real weighted average prices (as above) and the % difference between the prices of price marked and non-price-marked packs in each segment.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^ff523ca1]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Increasing access to healthy, affordable foods — community food retail strategies detail partners and store-level actions. The food retail environment has a significant impact on the health of communities, and a healthy food retail environment is one in which it is easier to make healthy choices by encouraging the purchase of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other nutritious items, rather than energy-dense foods and beverages of low nutritional value. Community partners, including public health agencies, retailers and vendors, business leaders, health care systems and providers, local farmers, food pantries and banks, community development organizations, community members, and other stakeholders, can collaborate in a variety of ways to develop and maintain a healthy retail environment. Both full-service and smaller grocery stores can market and promote healthier choices through leveraging shelf labeling systems to help consumers identify healthier choices and place these items at eye level, in-store promotions of healthy options and recipes, and healthy checkout aisles that limit foods and beverages of low nutritional value. A store can also apply to become an approved vendor for federal nutrition assistance programs funded and administered through the USDA, which provides financial incentives to participants in federal nutrition assistance programs for the purchase of healthier options. Smaller stores face unique challenges, including difficulty meeting distributors' minimum order requirements to receive reasonable prices on healthy options, and working collaboratively, smaller stores can establish group purchasing collectives to increase purchasing power to facilitate the provision of healthier food and beverage options.

### Changes in the volume, power and nutritional quality of foods marketed to children on television in Canada [^3747caa6]. Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data were purchased for May 2006 (May 1–28) and May 2011 (May 2–29) for Toronto and Vancouver for the two primary children's specialty channels from Nielsen Media Research, a marketing research company that analyzes television viewing data and provides advertising information services. These two specialty channels were selected as they are the only specialty stations recorded by Nielsen Media Research that specifically target children and/or teens and they are heavily viewed by children and teens in Canada. The month of May was selected because of its distance from major holidays that could potentially inflate advertising budgets. As food advertising for Toronto and Vancouver was almost identical on these two stations for the time period in question, data for Toronto, the largest English language television market in Canada, was selected as the market for this study. The data that were purchased included all food/beverage advertisements belonging to 11 food/beverage categories that aired on the two children's specialty channels in May 2006 and May 2011. These purchased food/beverage categories included candy, chocolate bars, cookies, portable snacks, cheese, yogurt, cereal, juices, soft drinks, diet soft drinks, and fast food (see Table 2 for their description). The Nielsen Spot Watch software, which enables its users to select specific criteria about particular television channels, was used to determine which advertisements were broadcast on these two stations between 6and 12for May 2006 and May 2011 for the 11 food categories listed above.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^672e0c47]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

School meal reimbursement and costs — Higher quality school meals engender substantial costs; despite an additional $0.06 per meal allocated by the 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization, reimbursement for food service over the past 20 years has never kept pace with rising expenses or inflation; the National School Boards Association cited that, even by the USDA's conservative estimates, the recent reimbursement rates (2010) will cover less than one-half the costs of implementing the new nutrition standards over the next 5 years; if prices of nonreimbursed meals increase, more children may bring meals from home, purchase food from other sources, or skip meals altogether, each of which will be detrimental to achieving better diet quality; additional federal and state budget cuts in the near-term threaten many aspects of child nutrition strategy and are an important point of advocacy for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

### Candesartan cilexetil [^3159dad9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age ± SD was 12.9 ± 2.6 years.

The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg.

In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1–6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil.

### Pattern recognition based on machine learning identifies oil adulteration and edible oil mixtures [^fc938ea0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Previous studies have shown that each edible oil type has its own characteristic fatty acid profile; however, no method has yet been described allowing the identification of oil types simply based on this characteristic. Moreover, the fatty acid profile of a specific oil type can be mimicked by a mixture of 2 or more oil types. This has led to fraudulent oil adulteration and intentional mislabeling of edible oils threatening food safety and endangering public health. Here, we present a machine learning method to uncover fatty acid patterns discriminative for ten different plant oil types and their intra-variability. We also describe a supervised end-to-end learning method that can be generalized to oil composition of any given mixtures. Trained on a large number of simulated oil mixtures, independent test dataset validation demonstrates that the model has a 50 th percentile absolute error between 1.4–1.8% and a 90 th percentile error of 4–5.4% for any 3-way mixtures of the ten oil types. The deep learning model can also be further refined with on-line training. Because oil-producing plants have diverse geographical origins and hence slightly varying fatty acid profiles, an online-training method provides also a way to capture useful knowledge presently unavailable. Our method allows the ability to control product quality, determining the fair price of purchased oils and in-turn allowing health-conscious consumers the future of accurate labeling.

### Candesartan [^f01f9d7f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age ± SD was 12.9 ± 2.6 years.

The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg.

In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1–6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil.

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^bfa00b30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Purchasing

There were 11 purchasing studies in real‐world settings.

Bergen 2006 assessed the impact of labelling on drinks purchased from vending machines by measuring the mean number of low‐energy soft drinks sold weekly over a nine‐week period (two‐week baseline period, five‐week intervention period, and two‐week postintervention period).

Balasubramanian 2002 assessed the impact of labelling on 'light' entrées and juices purchased from a grocery store by measuring sales transactions (i.e. the percentage of labelled products bought relative to other products bought) each week over a seven‐year period.

Nine studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drinks purchased in restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops. Studies measured the outcome using the mean energy content of items purchased at each meal over a period of time (2 weeks: Ellison 2013; 4 weeks: VanEpps 2016; 41 days: Chu 2009; 2 months: Holmes 2013; 19 weeks: Ellison 2014a), mean weekly energy sales of 45 labelled food items for 12 weeks (Cioffi 2015), the proportion of high‐calorie purchases over a six‐week period (as a percentage of total drinks or snacks sold) (Allan 2015); mean energy of food and drinks bought per sales transaction over 14 months (Bollinger 2011), or the probability of purchasing low‐energy items from three different food categories (vegetables, salads, entrées) during an 18‐week period (Dubbert 1984).

Consumption

Seventeen studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drink consumed in artificial or laboratory settings. In 14 of these studies, the outcome was mean energy consumed during a snack, a single meal, or across multiple meals (Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013; Girz 2012 ‐ study 1; Girz 2012 ‐ study 2; Girz ongoing; Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; James 2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Temple 2010; Wansink 2006 ‐ study 1; Wansink 2006 ‐ study 3). Of the three remaining studies, two measured mean grams of food consumed (Cavanagh 2014; Roberto 2012), and one measured mean volume of a drink consumed (Vermeer 2011).

Further details of each study are reported in the table of Characteristics of included studies.

### The dynamics in food selection stemming from price awareness and perceived income adequacy: a cross-sectional study using 1-year loyalty card data [^e996f0f0]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Higher cost of healthy foods may explain unhealthy dietary patterns in lower-income households. Unfortunately, combining food selection and nutrient intake data to price and expenditure is challenging. Food retailer's customer loyalty card data, linked to nutrient composition database, is a novel method for simultaneous exploration of food purchases, price, and nutrition.

Objectives

We studied the associations between perceived income adequacy (PIA) as a grouping variable with price (per kilogram or megajoule) and the volume of purchases (percentage of expenditure or energy) simultaneously as outcome variables for 17 most purchased food groups.

Methods

We used 1-year (2018) loyalty card data from the largest grocery chain in Finland. Participants were 28,783 loyalty cardholders who made ≥ 41% of food purchases from the retailer and answered an online questionnaire at the midpoint of data collection. The 5-level PIA described the perceived financial situation in the household. Energy and nutrient content of foods purchased were from the Finnish Food Composition Database Fineli. We calculated the Nutrient Rich Food Index per 100 g food using 11 nutrients. Trends in prices and expenditures between PIA levels were analyzed using 2-sided Jonckheere-Terpstra tests, with false discovery rate control (Benjamini-Hochberg method) and confounder adjustments (inverse probability weighting).

Results

Lower PIA participants selected cheaper foods per kilogram and megajoule within most food groups. They also favored unhealthy food groups cheap in energy [< 1 € (USD 1.18)/MJ]. Despite lower purchase price, the expenditure (%) among lower PIA was higher on alcohol, snacks, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sweets and chocolates.

Conclusions

Participants with lower PIA showed stronger price awareness. It is crucial to consider the pricing of competing alternative food groups, when steering toward environmentally sustainable and healthier food purchases. Package labeling might also direct the selection of healthier choices among the less expensive items within a food group.

### Are retailers compliant with zoning regulations that ban tobacco sales near schools in changsha, China? [^50107d8a]. Tobacco Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco retail sales are prohibited within 100m of schools in many large cities in China. However, little is known about the enforcement of this zoning regulation. The objectives of this study were to estimate tobacco retailers' compliance with the regulation, examine the density of tobacco retail stores, describe the types of tobacco products sold in stores and how they are marketed, and determine if there are displays of warning messages in retail stores around schools and in neighbourhoods in Changsha, China.

Methods

Tobacco retail stores located within 200m of 36 schools and 36 residential neighbourhoods were audited by trained students with a validated audit form.

Results

On average, there were about 3 tobacco retail stores within 100m of the front entrance of schools. The density of the stores and the types of tobacco products sold in the stores were similar near schools and in neighbourhoods. Over one-fourth of the stores had exterior tobacco advertisements. Interior advertising was slightly less prevalent, and it was most prevalent among tobacco shops (62.5%). Tobacco displays that target children were pervasive, with about 83% of tobacco retail stores displaying cigarettes within 1m of the floor and 59% displaying cigarettes within 0.3m of toys and candy. About 40% of stores within 100m of a school had a visible retail licence. Only 19.6% of the stores had a 'smoke-free' sign and 22.2% had a 'no sales to minors' sign.

Conclusions

We observed low enforcement of the regulation that bans tobacco retail sales near schools and high prevalence of tobacco displays that target children in Changsha, China. Chinese officials should act to effectively enforce the regulation bans of tobacco sales near schools. In addition, regulations are urgently needed to limit tobacco marketing practices at the point of sale, especially those targeting youth.

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^58cbe01c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Overeating and harmful alcohol and tobacco use have been linked to the aetiology of various non-communicable diseases, which are among the leading global causes of morbidity and premature mortality. As people are repeatedly exposed to varying sizes and shapes of food, alcohol and tobacco products in environments such as shops, restaurants, bars and homes, this has stimulated public health policy interest in product size and shape as potential targets for intervention.

Objectives

1) To assess the effects of interventions involving exposure to different sizes or sets of physical dimensions of a portion, package, individual unit or item of tableware on unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco products in adults and children.2) To assess the extent to which these effects may be modified by study, intervention and participant characteristics.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, eight other published or grey literature databases, trial registries and key websites up to November 2012, followed by citation searches and contacts with study authors. This original search identified eligible studies published up to July 2013, which are fully incorporated into the review. We conducted an updated search up to 30 January 2015 but further eligible studies are not yet fully incorporated due to their minimal potential to change the conclusions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with between-subjects (parallel-group) or within-subjects (cross-over) designs, conducted in laboratory or field settings, in adults or children. Eligible studies compared at least two groups of participants, each exposed to a different size or shape of a portion of a food (including non-alcoholic beverages), alcohol or tobacco product, its package or individual unit size, or of an item of tableware used to consume it, and included a measure of unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco.

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies for inclusion and to collect data and assess risk of bias. We calculated study-level effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) between comparison groups, measured as quantities selected or consumed. We combined these results using random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate summary effect sizes (SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for each outcome for size and shape comparisons. We rated the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Finally, we used meta-regression analysis to investigate statistical associations between summary effect sizes and variant study, intervention or participant characteristics.

Main Results

The current version of this review includes 72 studies, published between 1978 and July 2013, assessed as being at overall unclear or high risk of bias with respect to selection and consumption outcomes. Ninety-six per cent of included studies (69/72) manipulated food products and 4% (3/72) manipulated cigarettes. No included studies manipulated alcohol products. Forty-nine per cent (35/72) manipulated portion size, 14% (10/72) package size and 21% (15/72) tableware size or shape. More studies investigated effects among adults (76% (55/72)) than children and all studies were conducted in high-income countries - predominantly in the USA (81% (58/72)). Sources of funding were reported for the majority of studies, with no evidence of funding by agencies with possible commercial interests in their results. A meta-analysis of 86 independent comparisons from 58 studies (6603 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion, package, individual unit or tableware size on consumption of food (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46), providing moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased quantities of food consumed among children (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31) and adults (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52). The size of this effect suggests that, if sustained reductions in exposure to larger-sized food portions, packages and tableware could be achieved across the whole diet, this could reduce average daily energy consumed from food by between 144 and 228 kcal (8.5% to 13.5% from a baseline of 1689 kcal) among UK children and adults. A meta-analysis of six independent comparisons from three studies (108 participants) found low quality evidence for no difference in the effect of cigarette length on consumption (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.65). One included study (50 participants) estimated a large effect on consumption of exposure to differently shaped tableware (SMD 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.78), rated as very low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider bottles (versus taller, narrower bottles) increased quantities of water consumed by young adult participants. A meta-analysis of 13 independent comparisons from 10 studies (1164 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion or tableware size on selection of food (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59), rated as moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased the quantities of food people selected for subsequent consumption. This effect was present among adults (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75) but not children (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.34). In addition, a meta-analysis of three independent comparisons from three studies (232 participants) found a very large effect of exposure to differently shaped tableware on selection of non-alcoholic beverages (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.43), rated as low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider (versus taller, narrower) glasses or bottles increased the quantities selected for subsequent consumption among adults (SMD 2.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.83) and children (SMD 1.03, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.65).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that people consistently consume more food and drink when offered larger-sized portions, packages or tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions. This suggests that policies and practices that successfully reduce the size, availability and appeal of larger-sized portions, packages, individual units and tableware can contribute to meaningful reductions in the quantities of food (including non-alcoholic beverages) people select and consume in the immediate and short term. However, it is uncertain whether reducing portions at the smaller end of the size range can be as effective in reducing food consumption as reductions at the larger end of the range. We are unable to highlight clear implications for tobacco or alcohol policy due to identified gaps in the current evidence base.

### The impact of price discounts and calorie messaging on beverage consumption: a multi-site field study [^82706297]. Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of alternative approaches for shifting consumers toward zero calorie beverages. We examined the effect of price discounts and novel presentations of calorie information on sales of beverages.

Methods

This prospective interrupted time-series quasi-experiment included three sites in Philadelphia, PA, Evanston, IL, and Detroit, MI. Each site received five interventions: (1) a 10% price discount on zero-calorie beverages; (2) the 10% discount plus discount messaging; (3) messaging comparing calorie information of sugared beverages with zero-calorie beverages; (4) messaging comparing exercise equivalent information; and (5) messaging comparing both calorie and exercise equivalent information. The main outcome was daily sales of bottled zero-calorie and sugared beverages. Data was collected from October 2009 until May 2010 and analyzed from May 2010 until May 2011.

Results

The overall analysis failed to demonstrate a consistent effect across all interventions. Two treatments had statistically significant effects: the discount plus discount messaging, with an increase in purchases of zero calorie beverages; and the calorie messaging intervention, with an increase in purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages. Individual site analysis results were similar.

Conclusions

The effects of price discounts and calorie messaging in different forms on beverage purchases were inconsistent and frequently small.

### Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods [^12fdb17e]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Method 1: diet diaries and food expenditures

All foods and beverages reported in each participant's coded 4-day diet diary were linked to corresponding items in the participant's receipts, collected during weeks 1–4 of the study. To compute the expenditure for each food portion of food or beverage consumed, the gram weight consumed was multiplied by the ratio of the purchase price over total grams purchased, correcting for edible portion (EP):

For example, the expenditure associated with a 1 cup portion (109 g) of fresh apple that was purchased for $1.49/pound (454 g) was 109 g × $1.99/(454 g × 0.90) = $0.531. Overall, approximately 80% of all foods and beverages consumed were accounted for in the participants' receipts. For missing receipt data, expenditures were imputed using food prices collected by study staff. The posted price was recorded for the product and matched for details provided by the participant. The key details were product brand, type, package size and the retail outlet from which it was purchased. When product or retail outlet information was not available, the closest match was identified from among three major supermarket chains (described below) and the lowest price was recorded. Expenditures were calculated for each day and were averaged over the 4 days.

Method 2: diet diaries and supermarket prices

Each item in the coded 4-day diet diary was matched with one of the foods in the database of supermarket prices for 384 foods and beverages in 152 categories. The database has been described before and contains lowest, non-sale prices collected from three major supermarket chains in the region as described previously. In brief, prices were collected from May to July 2006 from Safeway, Albertson's and Quality Food Centers (a subsidiary of Kroger), which were selected because of their large market share in the region. Prices were obtained during in-store visits and from supermarket home shopping websites (Safeway and Albertson's), which reported to list the same prices as those available to in-store customers. When no exact match from the 384 products was available, the closest match from among the broader food categories was used. As in Method 1, daily totals were computed and 4-day means were derived.

### Evaluation of changes in grams of sugar sold after the implementation of the Seattle sweetened beverage tax [^22577ce5]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

The analytical balanced sample included 1326 taxed beverage UPCs, 239 untaxed beverage UPCs, 2054 sweets UPCs, and 81 stand-alone sugar UPCs. The summary statistics presented in Table 1 report mean (SD) kilograms of sugar sold per UPC in Seattle and Portland pretax and in year 1 and year 2 posttax implementation. The mean (SD) kilograms of sugar sold for taxed SSB UPCs was 1006 (2919) in the pretax period in Seattle, which decreased to 669 (1840) at the year 2 posttax implementation. The mean (SD) kilograms of sugar sold pretax in Seattle was highest for soda at 1888 (4849) and lowest for tea/coffee drinks at 357 (708). The mean (SD) kilograms of sugar sold for untaxed beverages was 322 (626); among sweets, it was highest for frozen desserts at 746 (919) and lowest for other sweets at 405 (537). In addition, mean (SD) kilograms of sugar sold was the highest of all categories of UPCs for stand-alone sugar at 9838 (23 959). The pretax mean kilograms of sugar sold across product categories was consistently higher in Portland compared with Seattle.

Table 1.
Kilograms of Sugar Sold in Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, Pretax to Year 2 Post tax a

Abbreviations: SSBs, sugar-sweetened beverages; UPCs, universal product codes.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of total grams of sugar sold in Seattle in the pretax period across the beverage, sweets, and stand-alone sugar categories included in this study. eAppendix 3 in the Supplement provides calculation details. Among these categories, taxed soda was the largest single contributor to sugar sold, accounting for almost one-quarter (22.9% [918 of 4010 million grams]). Next, stand-alone sugar accounted for 19.9% (797 of 4010 million grams), followed by substantial contributions from 2 categories of sweets: 17.1% (684 of 4010 million grams) from candy/confections and 11.9% (476 of 4010 million grams) from frozen desserts. The remaining categories of beverages and sweets each accounted for less than 6% of sugar sold.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^97abe900]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention and mitigation of nutrient deficiencies

Dietary guidance for individuals using GLP‐1s should focus on ensuring nutrient adequacy within an often substantially lower‐calorie diet. To support this, clinicians should emphasize a diversity of nutrient‐dense, minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins, nuts, and seeds. Individuals should be counseled to avoid refined carbohydrates (i.e. refined grains, flour, starches, sugars), sugar‐sweetened beverages, red and processed meats, and most fast foods, ultraprocessed sweets, and savory snacks (Table 6). Dietary supplements can be proactively considered for at‐risk nutrients, such as vitamin D, calcium, B12, or a multivitamin‐mineral tablet, at appropriate doses and tailored to each person's needs.

TABLE 6
Key dietary recommendations to support effective GLP‐1 therapy a.

Small, frequent meals may be effective when hunger and food interest are low. Healthfully prepared smoothies and protein drinks with fruits, vegetables, and various unsweetened milks or yogurt; cottage cheese and soups can provide needed nutrients and are often more appealing to individuals than heavier foods such as red meats, cold cuts, or hard cheeses. If changes to food composition are not enough, setting an alarm or other reminder to eat can be helpful. Sufficient dietary protein should be a priority to help preserve muscle mass and bone density, particularly in combination with a structured strength training program (see below).

Ongoing monitoring and follow‐up should include regular re‐assessment of dietary intake and hydration, for example, using food logs and/or food photos, and re‐assessment of nutrient levels, using clinically accepted methodologies, during therapy to identify and promptly address emerging deficiencies. Dietary recommendations should be adjusted based on the rate of weight reduction, nutrient status, individual tolerance, and treatment response.

### Candesartan cilexetil (Atacand) [^bf972640]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Children < 1 year of age must not receive ATACAND for hypertension.

All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² should not receive ATACAND since ATACAND has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below:

Preparation of Oral Suspension:

ATACAND oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of ATACAND tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension.

Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension.

Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus®(80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF®(80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF®(160 mL).
Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of ATACAND tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle.
Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size.
Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary.
Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle.
Mix thoroughly.
Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles.
Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions:

Store at room temperature (below 30°C/86°F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle.

Do not freeze.

### The effect of large portion sizes on energy intake is sustained for 11 days [^24229ff4]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

A previous study showed that increasing the portion sizes of all foods led to an increase in energy intake that was sustained over 2 days. The objective of the present study was to determine whether participants would compensate for excess energy intake or continue to overeat when portion sizes were increased for 11 days.

Research Methods and Procedures

Participants in the study were 23 normal-weight and overweight participants (10 women and 13 men). All of their foods and caloric beverages were provided during two different periods of 11 consecutive days, which were separated by a 2-week interval. During one period, standard portions of all items were served; during the other, all portion sizes were increased by 50%.

Results

The 50% increase in portion sizes resulted in a mean increase in daily energy intake of 423 ± 27 kcal (p < 0.0001), which did not differ significantly between women and men. This increase was sustained for 11 days and did not decline significantly over time, leading to a mean cumulative increase in intake of 4636 ± 532 kcal. A significant effect of portion size on intake was seen at all meals and in all categories of foods except fruit (as a snack) and vegetables. The effect of portion size on intake was not influenced by the body weight status of participants.

Discussion

These results strengthen the evidence suggesting that increased portions contribute to the overconsumption of energy and to excess body weight.

### Changes in sugar-sweetened beverages and non-essential energy-dense food purchases overall and by type before and after the implementation of taxes in Mexico: repeated cross-sectional national surveys (2008–2018) [^9ffc15d5]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The model was adjusted for area of residence (rural for communities with fewer than 2500 inhabitants and urban for those with 2500 or higher); household head educational level (last grade completed: less than elementary school, elementary school, middle school and high school or higher); household composition (only adults (≥ 20 years), adults and children (< 10 years), adults and adolescents (≥ 10 and < 20 years) and those with children, adolescents and adults; household income (the sum of all sources of income reported by all household members (per capita)); household size (number of members living in the household). To account for seasonality, we created binary variables for each of the 4 months when the data were collected (August to November). We included two national-level contextual variables for each survey round: per capita gross domestic product as a proxy for period-specific disposable income and the National Consumer Price Index to adjust for inflation.

In the second part of the model, we used a generalised linear model where the dependent variable was the quantity of food and beverages purchased in g/capita/week or mL/capita/week among those with food or beverage purchases > 0. To obtain the per capita quantity in grams or millilitres of weekly purchases, we divided total household quantities by the number of members in the household. In this second part, the independent variable was tax implementation. The predicted values from the model integrate both parts of the model and allow that zeros and non-zero purchases are modelled with different densities. Coefficients are expressed as marginal effects.

An interaction term between the variable 'tax implementation' and the 'type of store' was included in both parts of the model. We estimated the predicted values from the models to compare changes in observed purchases (from 2014 to 2018, post-tax period) with expected purchases based on rounds prior to 2014 (pre-tax period).

We calculated absolute differences in grams or millilitres and relative differences (as a percentage change relative to pre-tax volume), between the adjusted predicted values for the period after the tax and those predicted from the previous rounds. We tested whether the absolute change was statistically significant using a t-test for equality of means, considering a p value < 0.05. All analyses were performed using STATA statistical software V.2015, accounting for the survey design.

### Change in non-alcoholic beverage sales following a 10-pence levy on sugar-sweetened beverages within a national chain of restaurants in the UK: interrupted time series analysis of a natural experiment [^f00ba6d3]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

On the 1 September 2015, Jamie's Italian, a national chain of UK restaurants, added a £0.10 levy to the price of non-alcoholic SSBs sold within them. The prelevy price of SSBs ranged from £2.60 to £3.25 (excluding the levy), thus addition of the levy equated to a price increase of 3.1%–3.8%. Other non-alcoholic beverages were similar in price, ranging from £2.00 and £3.95. In combination with the introduction of the levy, Jamie's Italian reorganised the non-alcoholic beverage menu into two sections: SSBs and other beverages (juices, bottled waters and diet cola). In addition, fruit spritzers (fruit juice mixed with water) were added to the main non-alcoholic beverage menu. Text (see figure 1) on the SSB section of the non-alcoholic beverage menu explained the decision to implement the levy and that proceeds from the levy would go directly to a Children's Health Fund that offered grants for children's health initiatives. Introduction of the levy was supported by a Channel 4 television documentary 'Jamie's Sugar Rush', first broadcast on 3 September 2015. Thus, the levy can be seen as a complex 'intervention' comprising a fiscal component (a price rise) in combination with other non-fiscal components that could plausibly help reduce purchases of SSBs.

Non-alcoholic section of the beverage menu. Reproduced with permission by Jamie's Italian Restaurants.

We take advantage of this natural experiment to assess whether the implementation of the levy in combination with non-price activities (for convenience referred to as the 'intervention') is associated with changes in sales of non-alcoholic beverages. We use an interrupted time series (ITS) design to compare the number of SSBs, and other non-alcoholic beverages, sold per customer before implementation of the intervention with sales at 12 weeks and 6 months after. We use itemised electronic point of sale (EPOS) data and investigate the effect of the intervention across all restaurants and whether this effect varies by tertiles of baseline restaurant SSB sales per customer.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^c8830a09]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Costs and cost-effectiveness for GLP-1s in U.S. obesity care — The list price has ranged from ~ $12,000 to > $16,000 per year, with manufacturer coupons and discounts lowering costs to ~ $7000 to ~ $8000/year. Medicare does not currently cover GLP-1s for obesity, and average price reductions for drugs eligible for negotiation in 2025 have ranged from 38 to 79%. Local and regional compounding pharmacies list prices ranging from ~ $1800 to $3000/year. Across economic evaluations, all have found that GLP-1 treatment costs exceed healthcare savings; GLP-1s do not meet accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness (e.g., < $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained), with non-industry sponsored analyses reporting net costs per quality-adjusted life year ranging from $237,000-$483,000.

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^37929e49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nutritional labelling is advocated as a means to promote healthier food purchasing and consumption, including lower energy intake. Internationally, many different nutritional labelling schemes have been introduced. There is no consensus on whether such labelling is effective in promoting healthier behaviour.

Objectives

To assess the impact of nutritional labelling for food and non-alcoholic drinks on purchasing and consumption of healthier items. Our secondary objective was to explore possible effect moderators of nutritional labelling on purchasing and consumption.

Search Methods

We searched 13 electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 26 April 2017. We also handsearched references and citations and sought unpublished studies through websites and trials registries.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies: were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs/Q-RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies; compared a labelled product (with information on nutrients or energy) with the same product without a nutritional label; assessed objectively measured purchasing or consumption of foods or non-alcoholic drinks in real-world or laboratory settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar interventions and outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and we synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary.

Main Results

We included 28 studies, comprising 17 RCTs, 5 Q-RCTs and 6 ITS studies. Most (21/28) took place in the USA, and 19 took place in university settings, 14 of which mainly involved university students or staff. Most (20/28) studies assessed the impact of labelling on menus or menu boards, or nutritional labelling placed on, or adjacent to, a range of foods or drinks from which participants could choose. Eight studies provided participants with only one labelled food or drink option (in which labelling was present on a container or packaging, adjacent to the food or on a display board) and measured the amount consumed. The most frequently assessed labelling type was energy (i.e. calorie) information (12/28). Eleven studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling on purchasing food or drink options in real-world settings, including purchases from vending machines (one cluster-RCT), grocery stores (one ITS), or restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops (three RCTs, one Q-RCT and five ITS). Findings on vending machines and grocery stores were not interpretable, and were rated as very low quality. A meta-analysis of the three RCTs, all of which assessed energy labelling on menus in restaurants, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 47 kcal in energy purchased (MD -46.72 kcal, 95% CI -78.35, -15.10, N = 1877). Assuming an average meal of 600 kcal, energy labelling on menus would reduce energy purchased per meal by 7.8% (95% CI 2.5% to 13.1%). The quality of the evidence for these three studies was rated as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Of the remaining six studies, only two (both ITS studies involving energy labels on menus or menus boards in a coffee shop or cafeteria) were at low risk of bias, and their results support the meta-analysis. The results of the other four studies which were conducted in a restaurant, cafeterias (2 studies) or a coffee shop, were not clearly reported and were at high risk of bias. Seventeen studies assessed the impact of nutritional labels on consumption in artificial settings or scenarios (henceforth referred to as laboratory studies or settings). Of these, eight (all RCTs) assessed the effect of labels on menus or placed on a range of food options. A meta-analysis of these studies did not conclusively demonstrate a reduction in energy consumed during a meal (MD -50 kcal, 95% CI -104.41, 3.88, N = 1705). We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Six laboratory studies (four RCTs and two Q-RCTs) assessed the impact of labelling a single food or drink option (such as chocolate, pasta or soft drinks) on energy consumed during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.27, N = 732). However, the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. There was no evidence that nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy purchased or consumed. Indirect evidence came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling single nutrient content (i.e. placing low energy or low fat labels on high-energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.14to 0.51, N = 718). The effect was small and the confidence intervals wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence from these studies as very low, providing very little confidence in the effect estimate.

Authors' Conclusions

Findings from a small body of low-quality evidence suggest that nutritional labelling comprising energy information on menus may reduce energy purchased in restaurants. The evidence assessing the impact on consumption of energy information on menus or on a range of food options in laboratory settings suggests a similar effect to that observed for purchasing, although the evidence is less definite and also of low quality. Accordingly, and in the absence of observed harms, we tentatively suggest that nutritional labelling on menus in restaurants could be used as part of a wider set of measures to tackle obesity. Additional high-quality research in real-world settings is needed to enable more certain conclusions. Further high-quality research is also needed to address the dearth of evidence from grocery stores and vending machines and to assess potential moderators of the intervention effect, including socioeconomic status.

### Pattern recognition based on machine learning identifies oil adulteration and edible oil mixtures [^6c1bd9bb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the last century there has been a significant shift to using plant oils rather than animal fats in human diets. This shift has prompted numerous scientific investigations on the characterization of fatty acid profiles in the commonly consumed plant oils culminating in a rather large database. However, notwithstanding our knowledge on the fatty acid profiles of specific plant oil types, it has not been possible to deduce and identify a plant oil when given the fatty acid profile. In addition, once two or more plant oils are mixed, the resulting fatty acid profile also changes. In many cases, the fatty acid profile of a blended oil mixture can mimic that of a high-quality product. Taking advantage of this possibility, counterfeiters sell low-value blended oils as high-value products and profit from the price difference; moreover, they even change the blending formulae in response to changes in market prices owing to macroeconomic factors.

The UC Davis olive center reported that up to 69% of California olive samples labeled as extra virgin olive oil failed to meet USDA standards mainly, because of adulteration with cheaper refined olive oil amongst many other reasons. In another independent report, 82% of avocado oil sold in the US market were either expired or adulterated. In Taiwan, olive oil sold to consumers was reported to be 98% palm oil. Such adulterations led to the degradation of sensory quality without significant health effects. Moreover, in some cases, the consequence of adulteration can also pose public health issues. For example, in India, mustard oil adulterated with argemone oil has been reported to cause epidemic dropsy. Adulterations of edible oils are more rampant in countries where regulatory bodies lack the resources and methods to assess and verify the quality of marketed products raising issues of food safety and security. Recent trend to promote nutritional guidance at a personal level further highlights the need for accurate and unadulterated labeling. For example, a consumer who is at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease may prefer to have specific dietary fatty acid requirements provided by specific plant oil types. The ability to detect oil adulteration therefore has both economic and health consequences.

### Oxytocin's inhibitory effect on food intake is stronger in obese than normal-weight men [^66d46aa4]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Assessments of food intake

The breakfast buffet comprised a collection of bread and rolls, spreads (for example, jam, honey), sausages, cheese, fruits, puddings, fruits, milk and juice, which totaled 4562 kcal (see Table 2 for details). Subjects were left undisturbed during breakfast and were not aware that their food intake was measured by weighing buffet components before and after. This procedure enables the precise assessment of primarily hunger-driven food intake in the fasted state. Reward-related eating in the relative absence of hunger was assessed under the pretext of a taste test, that included snacks of three different types but comparable calorie content and macronutrient composition, that is, 'TUC Cracker Classic' (salty taste; Griesson-de Beukelaer, Polch, Germany; 500 kcal per 100 g; 57.2 g carbohydrates per 100 g), 'Rice Waffles' (bland taste; Continental Bakeries B.V. Dordrecht, The Netherlands; 390 kcal per 100 g; 63 g carbohydrates per 100 g), and 'Double Chocolate Cookies' (sweet taste; EDEKA, Hamburg, Germany; 486 kcal per 100 g; 63 g carbohydrates per 100 g). For each variety, 15 snacks broken into bite size pieces were provided on a separate plate, and labeled snack A, B and C, respectively, allowing for a considerable amount to be eaten without the plates appearing empty, to ensure that participants would not restrict snack intake based on whether the experimenter could see how much had been consumed. The participant was instructed to taste and rate each snack type on a visual analog scale anchored by 0 (not at all) and 100 mm (very palatable/sweet/salty). Subjects were informed that during and after completion of the rating they could eat as many snacks as they liked because remaining food would be discarded, and were left alone for 10 min. Intake was covertly measured by weighing the snacks before and after the test.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^ad8fa039]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on school snacks, sweetened beverages, and added sugars describes how food is available in school in 3 venues and highlights beverage guidance and persistent nutrition issues. Food is available in school in 3 venues: federally sponsored school meal programs; items sold in competition to school meals (a la carte, vending machines, school stores); and foods in informal settings such as packed meals and snacks, bake sales, fundraisers, sports booster sales, in-class parties, or other school celebrations. High-energy, low-nutrient beverages contribute substantial calories but little nutrient content to a student's diet. In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that sweetened drinks be replaced in school by water, white and flavored milks, or 100% fruit and vegetable beverages. Although regulations and industry changes have decreased availability of nutrient-poor options, regular access to foods of high energy and low quality remains a school issue, with contributions from students, parents, and staff. Pediatricians are positioned to promote nutrient-rich foods within calorie guidelines and to emphasize nutritional value, variety, appropriate portion, and steady improvements in quality rather than simply advocating for elimination of added sugars. The introduction notes that consistently, 30% to 40% of daily energy of children and adolescents is consumed as energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and drinks, and that more than 55 million children and teenagers attend the nation's 105 000 schools.

### Cigarette pricing 1 year after new restrictions on tobacco industry retailer programmes in Quebec, Canada [^976d5f00]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Over the past 15 years, tobacco companies operating in Canada abandoned their long-standing unitary price model in favour of price differentiation. Concerns about low cigarette prices were identified by the Quebec government in 2015 when it introduced restrictions on the types of incentives that tobacco manufacturers may offer to retailers. This study sought to explore cigarette prices in Quebec 1year after these restrictions came into effect.

Methods

Details on cigarette trading terms and programmes were obtained from websites maintained by retailer groups. Visits were made to tobacco retailers in four Quebec municipalities in the autumn of 2017. The price displayed for cigarettes was observed and recorded in 273 convenience stores.

Results

Two forms of price differentiation were observed. The first was price-segmentation between brands, reflected in a difference of $3 or more in the average displayed price between premium and discount brands of each manufacturer (ie, $10.48 vs $7.43 for a package of 20 cigarettes of the most and least expensive brands sold by Philip Morris International). Price localisation was also observed, reflected in a $2 range of prices between retail outlets for the same package of cigarettes. Even among outlets of a given chain of convenience stores, the price of the least expensive brands varied by more than $1 per package. The size of the variance in prices rivals or exceeds the size of tobacco tax increases in Quebec over the past decade.

Conclusions

Recent restrictions on tobacco industry incentive programmes for retailers have not ended price differentiation. Tobacco manufacturers' and retailers' pricing policies continue to provide price-sensitive smokers with ways to avoid the impact of tobacco tax increases.

### Odevixibat (Bylvay) [^46e704a2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Preparation and Administration Instructions

For patients taking bile acid binding resins, take BYLVAY at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking a bile acid binding resin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Do not crush or chew capsules.
Mix the contents of the shell containing Oral Pellets into soft food or a liquid (as described below).
Discard the emptied shells. Do not let your child swallow the unopened shells containing the Oral Pellets.
Administer BYLVAY with the first morning meal.
Place a small amount (up to 2 tablespoons [30 mL]) of soft food (apple sauce, oatmeal, banana or carrot puree, chocolate or rice pudding) in a bowl. Keep the soft food at, or cooler than, room temperature.
Open the shell containing Oral Pellets and empty the contents into the bowl of soft food. Gently tap the Oral Pellet shell to ensure that all contents have been dispersed.
If the dose requires more than one shell of Oral Pellets, repeat Step 3.
Gently mix until well dispersed and administer the entire dose immediately.
Follow the dose with breast milk, infant formula, or other age-appropriate liquid.
Do not store the mixture for future use.
For patients unable to swallow soft food, see the instructions below.
Administer BYLVAY with the first morning meal.
Open the shell containing Oral Pellets and empty the contents into a small mixing cup. Gently tap the shell containing Oral Pellets to ensure that all contents have been emptied into the mixing cup.
If the dose requires more than one shell of Oral Pellets, repeat Step 2.
Add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of an age-appropriate liquid (for example, breast milk, infant formula, or water).
Let the pellets sit in the liquid for approximately 5 minutes to allow complete wetting REMINDER: The Oral Pellets will not dissolve in the liquid.
After 5 minutes, place the tip of the oral syringe completely into the mixing cup. Pull the plunger of the syringe up slowly to withdraw the liquid/pellet mixture into the syringe. Gently push the plunger down again to expel the liquid/pellet mixture back into the mixing cup. Do this 2 to 3 times to ensure complete mixing of the pellets into the liquid.
Withdraw the entire contents into the oral syringe by pulling the plunger on the end of the syringe.
Place the tip of the syringe into the front of the patient's mouth between the tongue and the side of the mouth, and then gently push the plunger down to squirt the liquid/pellet mixture between your child's tongue and the side of the mouth. Do not squirt liquid/pellet mixture in the back of the child's throat because this could cause gagging or choking.
Do not administer via a bottle or "sippy cup" because the Oral Pellets will not pass through the opening. The oral pellets will not dissolve in liquid.
Follow the dose with breast milk, infant formula, or other age-appropriate liquid.
If any pellet/liquid mixture remains in the mixing cup, repeat Step 7 and Step 8 until the entire dose has been administered.
Check the child's mouth to make sure all of the liquid/pellet mixture has been swallowed.
Take in the morning with a meal.
Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water.
Alternatively, for patients unable to swallow the capsules whole, BYLVAY capsules may be opened, and sprinkled and mixed with a small amount of soft food, or mixed with an age-appropriate liquid. Follow directions above for oral pellets to prepare and administer such a mixture.

### Did the recommended retail price of tobacco products fall in Australia following the implementation of plain packaging? [^511445b4]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess the extent of any fall in recommended retail prices (RRPs) of tobacco products sold in Australia following the 2012 implementation of plain packaging.

Methods

RRPs published in price lists by the New South Wales Retail Tobacco Traders Association covering the months of November 2011, November 2012 and November 2013 were recorded for all listed brands and pack sizes. Average prices per stick were computed in 2013 dollars for cigarette brands in each of 10 possible pack sizes, for each major tobacco manufacturer, and across market segments. Average prices per gram in Australian dollars adjusted to 2013 prices (AUD2013) were calculated for roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco brands for each major manufacturer.

Results

Inflation-adjusted average RRPs per stick in November 2013 were on average 6.4% higher than in November 2011 and 3.4% higher than in November 2012. The average RRP per gram of RYO products in November 2013 was 10.2% and 5.4% higher than in November 2011 and November 2012, respectively. Within cigarette brands, the highest increases in RRP from 2011 to 2013 were seen among mainstream and premium brands (10.0% and 10.1%, respectively) and among packs of 30s (18.3%) and 50s (12.5%).

Conclusions

The RRPs of tobacco products were higher in real terms 1year after Australia's plain packaging legislation was implemented. These increases exceeded increases resulting from Consumer Price Index (CPI) indexation of duty and occurred across all three major manufacturers for both factory made and RYO brands, all three cigarette market segments and all major pack sizes.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^1aad4e56]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

School nutrition environment — availability and standards: "We suggest that clinicians advocate that school districts ensure that only nutritionally sound food and drinks are available to children in the school environment, including the school cafeteria and alternative sources of food such as vending machines (2QOOO)". Evidence indicates the school lunch program provides one third of daily calories (three fifths if breakfast is also at school); of 58 million schoolchildren, about 28 million participate in lunch and 8 million in breakfast; lunch fat exceeded the target of no more than 30% of total calories; and after a 5‑month post‑ban on competitive foods, schools did not lose revenue.
