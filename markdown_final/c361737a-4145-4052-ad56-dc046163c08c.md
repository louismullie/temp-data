## Question

Treatment of trichomonas in men

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis infection in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first-line regimen and whether it differs by sex. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting that regimen in men. Next, I will consider alternatives, including tinidazole and secnidazole, and check their regulatory status and efficacy. After that, I need to review partner management, abstinence, and retesting recommendations. I will then examine special populations such as men with HIV and those with persistent or recurrent infection. Finally, I should confirm counseling points, resistance considerations, and summarize a practical algorithm with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the first-line regimen for men. The CDC 2021 STI Treatment Guidelines recommend metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose for men with trichomoniasis, whereas women should receive metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, reflecting sex-specific efficacy data and reinfection dynamics, so I should not conflate the two regimens [^113o9tb4] [^1131F4wt] [^11488KRC].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for the single-dose approach in men. The guideline notes that no randomized trials directly compare single-dose versus multidose regimens in men, so the recommendation is extrapolated from general efficacy data and practical considerations. In contrast, women benefit from the 7-day regimen based on randomized trials showing superior cure with 500 mg twice daily for 7 days compared with a single 2 g dose, which explains the sex-specific divergence in recommendations [^1131F4wt] [^113hTRS5].

> I should confirm the expected cure rates to set expectations. Recommended metronidazole regimens achieve approximately 84%–98% cure, and tinidazole achieves approximately 92%–100% in clinical trials, which supports the clinical effectiveness of single-dose therapy in appropriate patients, including men without complicating factors [^1131F4wt] [^115d3M4a].

> Next, I will examine alternatives. Tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose is an acceptable alternative with favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability. It may be preferred when metronidazole is not tolerated or when adherence to a multidose regimen is a concern, though cost and access can be limiting in some settings [^115CqZg1] [^1131F4wt]. Hold on, I should verify secnidazole's status. Secnidazole has robust efficacy data in women and supportive open-label data in men, but it is not FDA-approved for trichomoniasis in the United States, so it should be considered investigational or off-label if used for this indication pending regulatory action [^notfound].

> I need to ensure partner management is addressed because reinfection risk is high. Current partners should be presumptively treated and both parties should abstain from sex until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve. Expedited partner therapy may be used where legal, though evidence specific to trichomoniasis is limited compared with chlamydia and gonorrhea, so clinician judgment and local regulations apply [^113hJ877] [^114s2YpM]. Let me double-check the magnitude of partner infection risk; studies show that roughly 70% of male partners of infected women are infected, underscoring the need for concurrent therapy and counseling to prevent ping-pong reinfection [^113uUFua].

> Now, I should review follow-up and retesting. Women should be retested at 3 months due to high reinfection rates, but data are insufficient to recommend routine retesting for men. However, if symptoms persist or recur, men should be re-evaluated and tested for T. vaginalis and other urethritis pathogens, ideally with culture if treatment failure is suspected to enable susceptibility testing, and NAAT should be avoided within 3 weeks of treatment to prevent false positives from residual nucleic acid [^1131F4wt] [^113hJ877] [^111WR5FY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought men should routinely retest at 3 months like women; I should correct that — routine 3‑month retesting is not recommended for men in the absence of symptoms or ongoing risk, though individualized follow-up is reasonable in high-risk scenarios [^1131F4wt].

> Let me consider special populations, especially men with HIV. Treatment for men with HIV follows the same regimen as men without HIV — metronidazole 2 g orally once — because the enhanced multidose regimen studied in women with HIV does not have comparable evidence in men. Nonetheless, clinicians should maintain a low threshold for evaluating persistent symptoms and consider resistance if failure occurs [^111pzv5p] [^114GBoeJ]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with HIV-focused guidance; yes, HIV-specific recommendations endorse the standard male regimen while emphasizing broader STI screening and linkage to care [^114GBoeJ].

> I will now examine persistent or recurrent infection in men. If a man remains symptomatic or tests positive after the single 2 g metronidazole dose, I should first confirm adherence and exclude reinfection from an untreated partner. If neither is present, I should treat with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, and if failure persists, pursue resistance testing through CDC and consider high-dose regimens such as tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days or combination strategies guided by susceptibility results, ideally with infectious diseases consultation [^111WR5FY] [^113hJ877]. Hold on, I should verify that these escalation steps are guideline-supported; yes, the CDC outlines stepwise management for apparent treatment failure, including culture-based resistance testing and alternative nitroimidazole regimens [^111WR5FY].

> Next, I should review counseling and prevention. Patients should abstain from sex until therapy is complete and symptoms resolve, be screened for other STIs including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, and receive risk-reduction counseling with emphasis on condom use. Douching should be discouraged as it may increase risk of vaginal infections in partners, and patients should be informed about local reporting requirements and confidentiality protections [^1131F4wt] [^1147KPGK] [^116jdFDN]. I need to ensure I mention that consistent condom use reduces transmission and that partner treatment is essential to break reinfection cycles, which is repeatedly emphasized in CDC guidance [^1131F4wt] [^113hJ877].

> But wait, what about resistance and pharmacologic considerations. In vitro resistance to 5‑nitroimidazoles remains uncommon but present, with metronidazole resistance around 4%–10% in some series, and tinidazole generally showing lower resistance; this supports first-line therapy while justifying escalation and susceptibility testing in failures, and it reminds me to avoid subtherapeutic topical metronidazole for urethral disease because of poor tissue penetration [^113hJ877] [^1131F4wt]. I should double-check that topical therapy is indeed discouraged for urethral infection; yes, CDC notes inadequate urethral levels with metronidazole gel, reinforcing oral therapy for men [^1131F4wt].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. First-line treatment for a man diagnosed with T. vaginalis is metronidazole 2 g orally once, with tinidazole 2 g orally once as an alternative if metronidazole is not suitable. Ensure concurrent treatment of sexual partners and sexual abstinence until both are treated and asymptomatic. No routine test-of-cure is needed if symptoms resolve, but if symptoms persist or recur, re-evaluate for reinfection, adherence, and resistance, and if no reexposure and adherence are confirmed, treat with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and pursue resistance testing if failure persists [^113o9tb4] [^115CqZg1] [^111WR5FY]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with CDC's stepwise approach. Yes, this mirrors the guideline's management of persistent infection and partner-based reinfection risk [^1131F4wt] [^113hJ877].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and public health steps. Diagnoses should be reported per jurisdictional requirements, patients should be counseled on confidentiality and partner notification, and clinicians should coordinate with partner services when available to facilitate evaluation and treatment of partners, recognizing that laws and local practices vary [^116jdFDN] [^1126CrM6]. I need to ensure I note that while EPT may be used for trichomoniasis where legal, evidence of superiority over other partner management strategies is limited, so shared decision-making and local policy compliance are key [^114s2YpM].

The recommended treatment for trichomoniasis in men is **metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose** [^113o9tb4] or **tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose** [^115CqZg1] as an alternative [^1131F4wt]. Both regimens are highly effective, with cure rates of 84–98% for metronidazole and 92–100% for tinidazole [^1131F4wt] [^116tc83L]. Partners must be treated concurrently to prevent reinfection [^113hJ877], and sexual activity should be avoided until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve [^1131F4wt]. Retesting is not routinely required for men [^1131F4wt], but if symptoms persist or recur, repeat testing and alternative regimens may be considered [^111WR5FY].

---

## Recommended treatment regimens

The CDC recommends the following **first-line and alternative regimens** for treating trichomoniasis in men:

| **Regimen** | **Dosage** | **Cure rate** |
|-|-|-|
| Metronidazole (first-line) | 2 g orally, single dose | 84–98% [^1131F4wt] |
| Tinidazole (alternative) | 2 g orally, single dose | 92–100% [^1131F4wt] [^116tc83L] |

---

Both regimens are effective, but **tinidazole may be preferred** for patients who cannot tolerate metronidazole or when adherence to a single dose is a concern [^1131F4wt].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Metronidazole and tinidazole have **high clinical efficacy** in treating trichomoniasis in men. Metronidazole achieves cure rates of 84–98%, while tinidazole achieves 92–100% [^1131F4wt] [^116tc83L]. These cure rates are comparable to those observed in women, although women with HIV infection may benefit from a multidose metronidazole regimen (500 mg twice daily for 7 days) [^111pzv5p].

---

## Management of sexual partners

Concurrent treatment of sexual partners is essential to prevent reinfection [^113hJ877]. Partners should be **presumptively treated** without waiting for test results, as asymptomatic infection is common in men [^113hJ877]. Both partners should abstain from sexual activity until treatment is complete and symptoms have resolved [^1131F4wt].

---

## Follow-up and retesting

Routine follow-up and retesting are not generally required for men after treatment [^1131F4wt]. However, if symptoms persist or recur, **retesting and alternative treatment regimens** should be considered [^113hJ877] [^111WR5FY]. Persistent or recurrent infection may indicate treatment failure, reinfection, or antimicrobial resistance [^113hJ877].

---

## Side effects and contraindications

Metronidazole and tinidazole are generally well tolerated. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, metallic taste, and headache [^113hTRS5] [^115eWUnQ]. Patients should be advised to **avoid alcohol consumption** during treatment and for at least 24 hours after metronidazole or 72 hours after tinidazole to prevent disulfiram-like reactions [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **HIV infection**: Men with HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimens as those without HIV infection [^111pzv5p].
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Although rare, resistance to metronidazole and tinidazole has been reported. In cases of treatment failure, alternative regimens and susceptibility testing may be required [^111WR5FY] [^113hJ877].
- **Extragenital infection**: Rectal trichomoniasis is rare but may occur. Routine extragenital screening is not recommended, but clinicians should consider it in cases of persistent or unexplained symptoms [^115DBZBV].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line treatment**: Metronidazole 2 g orally, single dose [^113o9tb4].
- **Alternative treatment**: Tinidazole 2 g orally, single dose [^115CqZg1].
- **Partner management**: Concurrent treatment of all sexual partners [^113hJ877].
- **Follow-up**: No routine retesting required; consider retesting if symptoms persist or recur [^notfound].

---

The recommended treatment for trichomoniasis in men is **metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose**, with **tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose** as an alternative [^1131F4wt]. Concurrent treatment of sexual partners and abstinence from sexual activity until completion of treatment are essential to prevent reinfection [^113hJ877].

Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or for 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Follow-Up

Men should be provided their testing results obtained as part of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Trichomoniasis).

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing persistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; voiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-onset premature ejaculation lasting for > 3 months. Men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

Management of Sex Partners

All sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and presumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated according to the management section for their respective pathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is unable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114GBoeJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection treatment in HIV primary care — gonorrhea should be treated per 2020 CDC guidance with a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg (or 1000 mg for those who weigh ≥ 150 kg) without concurrent azithromycin; test of cure with an NAAT is not routinely recommended by the CDC, and repeat testing at 7 days is associated with a higher rate of false-positive results, while culture should be obtained for all treatment failures so that antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be performed. For syphilis, the preferred treatment for early, secondary, latent, and late-latent disease continues to be benzathine penicillin G; doxycycline can be used for 14–28 days when there is true penicillin allergy or penicillin shortage, and if neurosyphilis is present or the patient is pregnant, intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be used, even if desensitization is required. For trichomoniasis, in cisgender women with HIV, metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days is more effective than the single 2-g dose of metronidazole, while cisgender men can be treated using the single-dose regimen. For chlamydia, most cases are treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, and suspected lymphogranuloma venereum is usually diagnosed clinically and treated with 21 days of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.

### Methods for detection of trichomonas vaginalis in the male partners of infected women: implications for control of trichomoniasis [^116XyU9n]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection in men is an important cause of nongonococcal urethritis. Effective detection of the parasite in men using culture requires examination of multiple specimens. We compared culture and PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in urethral swabs, urine, and semen for T. vaginalis detection in male sexual partners of women with trichomoniasis identified by wet mount and culture. Trichomonads were detected by at least one positive test in 205/280 men (73.2%) who submitted at least one specimen for culture and PCR. Whereas InPouch TV culture detected only 46/205 cases (22.5%), PCR detected 201/205 (98.0%). Urethral swab cultures from men with urethritis were more likely to be positive with shorter incubation than specimens from men without urethritis. T. vaginalis was detected more often in men with wet-mount-positive partners. Even with a sensitive PCR assay, reliable detection of T. vaginalis in male partners required multiple specimens. The majority of male sexual partners in this study were infected, emphasizing the importance of partner evaluation and treatment.

### Updates in trichomonas treatment including persistent infection and 5-nitroimidazole hypersensitivity [^115rNFKj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to update information on treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis is estimated to be the most common treatable sexually transmitted infection. In the world and is associated with poor birth outcomes, cervical cancer, sperm motility and morphology issues, and HIV acquisition and transmission.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of the recommended 2-g oral single-dose metronidazole (MTZ) for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women has recently been challenged. Two recent multicentered randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 7-day dose of MTZ 500mg twice daily was nearly two times more efficacious at clearing infection compared with the 2-g dose. Partner treatment is also essential, since up to 70% of male sexual partners can be infected and rescreening of treated women at 3 months is also recommended given the high repeat infection rates. Future studies should examine the importance of treating asymptomatic T. vaginalis, best treatment for men, the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy and different formulations of intravaginal treatments for hypersensitivity.

Summary

7-day 500mg twice daily MTZ should be used as the first line treatment for T. vaginalis-infected women.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common cause of vaginal irritation in women and is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted disease in the world. It has been associated with serious sequelae, the most notable of which are prematurity, low birth weight, and increases in human immunodeficiency virus transmission. We review advances in diagnosis and treatment and the current controversies regarding management.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^114hriDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted of all TV literature published from 9 January 2004 through 24 September 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts. This article describes advances in TV diagnostics which have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biologic and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of recurrent TV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^115eWUnQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
U.S. CDC, European International Union/WHO, and U.K. guidelines for treatment of BV and trichomoniasis.

In light of these practical realities, empirical single‐dose oral tinidazole treatment of both BV and TV (with single‐dose fluconazole) would offer a patient‐centered solution to optimize the chance for first‐time cure, particularly for women challenged by medication adherence and follow‐up capability. Currently, the 2021 U.S. CDC STI guidelines recommend 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole (as four 500‐mg tablets) for TV treatment and 2 g on Days 1 and 2 as an alternative BV treatment option. Due to ED dispensing limitations, the next day's dose would require the patient to fill a prescription. However, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole is already recommended as an alternative treatment of both BV and TV by the European International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) and World Health Organization (WHO) and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) U.K. guidelines (Table 1). Tinidazole's plasma half‐life is 12–14 h, which is longer than metronidazole's (~8 h), allowing for a shorter treatment course, and its safety profile is less adverse, with metallic taste, nausea, anorexia, and constipation associated with longer duration as opposed to single‐dose treatment.TV also exhibits less resistance to tinidazole than metronidazole, demonstrating both lower in vitro minimum lethal concentrations and a high clinical efficacy rate for patients with metronidazole‐refractory TV infection.

### Trichomoniasis: under control or undercontrolled? [^11746SG2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Aside from human papillomavirus, trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States today, yet it has long been regarded as a sexually transmitted infection of minor importance. Medical opinion has traditionally held that it plays little role in health complications in women, and it is rarely seen in men. However, evidence has recently accumulated implicating Trichomonas vaginalis as a contributor to a variety of adverse outcomes among both sexes. Among both women and men, the association of T vaginalis with human immunodeficiency acquisition and transmission has been shown in multiple studies. Among women, trichomoniasis may play a role in development of cervical neoplasia, postoperative infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes and as a factor in atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Among men, trichomoniasis has emerged as a cause of nongonoccocal urethritis and as contributing to male factor infertility. As evidence continues to accumulate, the time has come to increase diagnostic efforts beyond traditional sexually transmitted disease clinic settings.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116rdH4q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

At visit 2 (TOC), patients were queried about treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and assessed for clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis. A provider obtained an additional vaginal specimen for T. vaginalis culture. At this visit, patients received the opposite treatment from baseline (ie, SEC if they had received placebo at baseline or placebo if they had received SEC at baseline) under direct observation by study staff. Patients with a microbiological cure, defined as negative T. vaginalis by InPouch culture at visit 2, were subsequently discharged from the study. Patients with a positive T. vaginalis culture from visit 2 were asked to return for a third visit, 7–12 days later, for an additional assessment, including determination of the need for additional therapy. A fourth visit (7–12 days after visit 3) was scheduled at the investigator's discretion if a repeat T. vaginalis culture at visit 3 was positive. Patients who had a positive culture at visit 3 and visit 4 were offered treatment, based upon the investigator's discretion and per standard of care. InPouch cultures were examined daily for 5 days over a 7-day period to reduce the possibility of false-negative results.

The primary efficacy endpoint was microbiological cure at visit 2 (TOC). The trial was designed to limit the possibility of unprotected sex resulting in reinfection, which would become more likely the longer the interval between treatment and TOC. The InPouch culture was selected as the diagnostic TOC based on its relatively high sensitivity (81%–94%), allowing for a TOC visit within 1 week. We did not perform a T. vaginalis NAAT for TOC as the optimal timing of this highly sensitive test is 3–4 weeks after treatment. Use of this test within 3 weeks after treatment may have detected remnant trichomonal nucleic acid, leading to false-positive test results. In addition, the use of T. vaginalis NAAT for TOC would have required patients to remain sexually inactive for as much as 4 weeks, which was considered impractical.

### Clinical evaluation of the cepheid xpert TV assay for detection of trichomonas vaginalis with prospectively collected specimens from men and women [^113rSczM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Trichomoniasis is a highly prevalent STD and presents with a spectrum of symptoms or with no symptoms. In women, the prevalence of infection spans the reproductive years and beyond, with some studies showing high rates in older women. The epidemiology is less well understood in men, although a recent study showed that age over 40 years was also associated with-associated sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Accurate identification of trichomoniasis is important for several reasons, including optimizing treatment, realizing the need for treatment of the sexual partner(s), and the potential for prevention of associated public health consequences, such as preterm birth and the acquisition and transmission of HIV. The CDC has recently recommended NAAT as the preferred diagnostic modality in light of their superior sensitivity compared to those of direct microscopy or culture-based methods for detecting. Diagnostic testing is recommended for symptomatic women, and screening should be considered for individuals with multiple sex partners, persons who exchange sex for payment, use drugs, and/or have a history of STDs, and women in high-prevalence settings, such as STD clinics and correctional facilities. Annual screening is recommended for women with HIV infection due to the high rates ofinfection in this population. Rescreening is recommended within 3 months of the initial diagnosis due to high recurrence rates. Currently, there are no firm screening recommendations for men due to the fact that an FDA-cleared test has only recently become available. However, men attending STD clinics should be considered for screening. A recent study showed a prevalence rate of nearly 10% among men attending an STD clinic in Birmingham, AL.

### Re-evaluating the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis: emphasizing emerging pathogens – a randomized clinical trial [^114j81XK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a common chlamydia-associated syndrome in men; however, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium are associated with its etiology and should be considered in approaches to therapy. We sought to determine whether the addition of tinidazole, an anti-trichomonal agent, to the treatment regimen would result in higher cure rates than those achieved with treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin alone. A secondary aim was to compare the efficacy of doxycycline therapy and with that of azithromycin therapy.

Methods

Randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase IIB trial of men with NGU. Participants were randomized to receive doxycycline plus or minus tinidazole or azithromycin plus or minus tinidazole and were observed for up to 45 days.

Results

The prevalences of Chlamydia trachomatis, M. genitalium, and T. vaginalis were 43%, 31%, and 13%, respectively. No pathogens were identified in 29% of participants. Clinical cure rates at the first follow-up visit were 74.5% (111 of 149 patients) for doxycycline-containing regimens and 68.6% (107 of 156 patients) for azithromycin-containing regimens. By the final visit, cure rates were 49% (73 of 149 patients) for doxycycline-containing regimens and 43.6% (68 of 156 patients) for azithromycin-containing regimens. There were no significant differences in clinical response rates among the treatment arms. However, the chlamydia clearance rate was 94.8% (55 of 58 patients) for the doxycycline arm and 77.4% (41 of 53 patients) for the azithromycin arm (P = 0.011), and the M. genitalium clearance rate was 30.8% (12 of 39 patients) for the doxycycline arm and 66.7% (30 of 45 patients) for the azithromycin arm (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Addition of tinidazole to the treatment regimen did not result in higher cure rates but effectively eradicated trichomonas. Clinical cure rates were not significantly different between patients treated with doxycycline and those treated with azithromycin; however, doxycycline had significantly better efficacy against Chlamydia, whereas azithromycin was superior to doxycycline for the treatment of M. genitalium.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115Ugp2u]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Other Sexually Transmitted Infections

YMSM and pregnant females should be routinely screened for syphilis (see Pregnant Women; Men Who Have Sex with Men). Local disease prevalence can help guide decision-making regarding screening for T. vaginalis, especially among adolescent females in certain areas. Routine screening of adolescents and young adults who are asymptomatic for certain STIs (e.g. syphilis, trichomoniasis, BV, HSV, HAV, and HBV) is not typically recommended.

Primary Prevention Recommendations

Primary prevention and anticipatory guidance for recognizing symptoms and behaviors associated with STIs are strategies that should be incorporated into all types of health care visits for adolescents and young adults. The following recommendations for primary prevention of STIs (i.e. vaccination and counseling) are based on published clinical guidelines for sexually active adolescents and young adults from federal agencies and medical professional organizations.

HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of 11 or 12 years.
The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents and young adults who have not previously received the universal HBV vaccine series during childhood.
The HAV vaccination series should be offered to adolescents and young adults as well as those who have not previously received the universal HAV vaccine series during childhood.
Information regarding HIV transmission, prevention, testing, and implications of infection should be regarded as an essential component of the anticipatory guidance provided to all adolescents and young adults as part of routine health care.
CDC and USPSTF recommend offering HIV PrEP to adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg and adults who are HIV negative and at substantial risk for HIV infection. YMSM should be offered PrEP in youth-friendly settings with tailored adherence support (e.g. text messaging and visits per existing guidelines). Indications for PrEP, initial and follow-up prescribing guidance, and laboratory testing recommendations are the same for adolescents and adults.
Medical providers who care for adolescents and young adults should integrate sexuality education into clinical practice. Health care providers should counsel adolescents about the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for acquiring STIs and should educate patients regarding evidence-based prevention strategies, which includes a discussion about abstinence and other risk-reduction behaviors (e.g. consistent and correct condom use and reduction in the number of sex partners including concurrent partners). Interactive counseling approaches (e.g. patient-centered counseling and motivational interviewing) are effective STI and HIV prevention strategies and are recommended by USPSTF. Educational materials (e.g. handouts, pamphlets, and videos) can reinforce office-based educational efforts.

### Prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis among male and female general populations in sub-saharan Africa from 2000 to 2024: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^114sd3Da]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Increases in chlamydia prevalence are particularly concerning given the severe, long-term health consequences of untreated infection, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, along with an increased risk of HIV transmission. Co-infection with HIV and other STIs additionally compounds the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, making prevention and control strategies particularly critical in high-burden settings.

Globally, there are major concerns about the impact of rising antimicrobial resistance on gonorrhoea incidence. We did not find evidence of increasing gonorrhoea prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on antimicrobial resistance are sparse in the African region, but available evidence suggests that current first-line and dual therapies continue to be effective, despite resistance to older antibiotics.

Differences in prevalence by sex arise from an interplay of biological, behavioural, and structural factors. Men are more like to experience symptoms of STI infection than women, leading to higher rates of treatment-seeking. Men also have a substantially shorter duration of trichomoniasis infection than women; despite potentially comparable incidence, faster clearance in men results in particularly low prevalence and thus a low male-to-female prevalence ratio. Disparities in treatment coverage, due to healthcare access barriers, sociocultural norms, and stigma, may also influence sex-prevalence differences. These factors, which may have changed over time, drive sub-regional variations in both prevalence and sex-prevalence ratios, but data are limited to attribute effects.

### Metronidazole oral (Likmez) [^1173k89E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Trichomoniasis

Adult Female and Male Patients:

One-day Treatment – Administer 2 g (20 mL) of LIKMEZ, either as a single oral dose or in 2 divided oral doses of 1 g (10 mL) each, given on the same day.
Seven-day Course of Treatment − Administer 250 mg (2.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally 3 times daily for 7 consecutive days.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment may help improve compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen.

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. There are some data from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

When repeat courses of LIKMEZ are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Amebiasis

Adult Patients:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): Administer 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.
For amebic liver abscess: Administer 500 mg (5 mL) or 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.

Pediatric Patients:

Administer 35 mg/kg/24 hours to 50 mg/kg/24 hours of LIKMEZ, divided into three doses, to a maximum dose of 2,250 mg/24 hours (maximum dose 750 mg/dose or 7.5 mL/dose), orally for 10 days.

Reporting and Confidentiality

Accurate and timely reporting of STIs is integral to public health efforts in assessing morbidity trends, allocating limited resources, and assisting local health authorities with partner notification and treatment. STI and HIV/AIDS cases should be reported in accordance with state and local statutory requirements. Syphilis (including congenital syphilis), gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, and HIV are reportable diseases in every state. Because the requirements for reporting other STIs differ by state, clinicians should be familiar with the reporting requirements applicable within their jurisdictions.

Reporting can be provider based, laboratory based, or both. Clinicians who are unsure of state and local reporting requirements should seek advice from state or local health department STI programs. STI and HIV reports are kept confidential. In most jurisdictions, such reports are protected by statute or regulation. Before conducting a follow-up of a person with a positive STI test result, public health professionals should consult the patient's health care provider, if possible, to inform them of the purpose of the public health visit, verify the diagnosis, determine the treatments received, and ascertain the best approaches to patient follow-up.

Retesting After Treatment to Detect Repeat Infections

Retesting 3 months after diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis can detect repeat infection and potentially can be used to enhance population-based prevention. Any person who has a positive test for chlamydia or gonorrhea, along with women who have a positive test for trichomonas, should be rescreened 3 months after treatment. Any person who receives a syphilis diagnosis should undergo follow-up serologic syphilis testing per current recommendations and follow-up testing for HIV (see Syphilis). Additional information regarding retesting is available elsewhere in this report (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis; Trichomoniasis).

### Structural elucidation of recombinant trichomonas vaginalis 20S proteasome bound to covalent inhibitors [^115t86jY]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv), a pear-shaped protozoan organism, is the etiological agent of trichomoniasis, the most widespread non-viral sexually transmitted disease (STD) worldwide –. This parasite possesses a single flagellum, which enables its motility, as well as several hair-like structures called pili, facilitating its attachment to host cells. Tv has a complex cytoskeleton that gives it the ability to alter its shape and traverse host tissues. In women, Tv infection can cause vaginitis, while in men it can cause urethritis and prostatitis. Notably, this infection heightens the risk of transmission of HIV and other STDs in both sexes. Current treatment relies on 5-nitroimidazoles, however, the emergence of resistant strains poses a significant public health threat due to the lack of alternative treatment options. Consequently, effective anti-parasitic compounds are urgently needed. Recently, the critical role of the proteasome in the survival of Tv was demonstrated, validating it as a potential drug target for treating trichomoniasis –.

Management of Sex Partners

Concurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for preventing reinfections. Current partners should be referred for presumptive therapy. Partners also should be advised to abstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated and any symptoms have resolved. EPT might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis and can be used in states where permissible by law; however, no partner management intervention has been demonstrated to be superior in reducing reinfection rates. Although no definitive data exist to guide treatment for partners of persons with persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis among whom nonadherence and reinfection are unlikely, partners might benefit from being evaluated and receiving treatment (see Recurrent Trichomoniasis).

Recurrent Trichomoniasis

A recurrent infection can result from treatment failure (antimicrobial-resistant T. vaginalis or host-related problems), lack of adherence, or reinfection from an untreated sex partner. In the case of a recurrent infection, the origin of the repeat infection should be assessed because most recurrent infections likely result from reinfection. Retesting can be considered in cases of persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis with culture, the preferred test. If NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before 3 weeks after treatment completion because of possible detection of residual nucleic acid that is not clinically relevant.

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobials known to be effective against trichomonas infection. Metronidazole resistance occurs in 4%–10% of cases of vaginal trichomoniasis. Tinidazole resistance is less well studied but was present in 1% of infections in one study. Overall, more T. vaginalis isolates have reported susceptibility to tinidazole than metronidazole. Multidose oral metronidazole is more effective than single-dose treatment, particularly for women who are symptomatic or have a history of T. vaginalis.

### Trichomoniasis in men and HIV infection: data from 2 outpatient clinics at lilongwe central hospital, Malawi [^115jiVH1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the epidemiologic profile of trichomoniasis in men and its relationship to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Among men presenting for care for symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Malawi, trichomoniasis is not considered for first-line treatment.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1187 men attending either a dermatology or STI outpatient clinic in the capital of Malawi. Men were interviewed, and the etiologies of the STIs were determined.

Results

At the STI clinic (n = 756 men), we identified 150 men (20%) with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, 358 men (47%) with HIV infection, and 335 men (44%) with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. At the dermatology clinic (n = 431 men), we identified 54 (13%), 118 (27%), and 2 (0.5%) men, respectively. At both clinics, a lower education level and reporting never having used a condom were predictive of T. vaginalis infection. Only at the dermatology clinic was older age associated with infection, and only at the STI clinic were marital, genital ulcer disease, and HIV-infection status associated with T. vaginalis infection. At the STI clinic, urethral symptoms attributable to trichomoniasis were more severe among HIV-positive men than among HIV-negative men.

Conclusions

Given its high prevalence and the increased risk for HIV transmission, T. vaginalis infection should be reconsidered for inclusion in the Malawi STI-treatment regimen for men.

### Concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in sex partners of patients with selected STIs: implications for patient-delivered partner therapy [^114ZfaWM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) is the practice of providing disease-specific antimicrobial agents to patients for delivery to their sex partners. Some partners who receive PDPT may forgo clinical evaluation, resulting in missed opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions.

Methods

We conducted a review of electronic charts for 8623 individuals attending 4 sexually transmitted disease clinics who were sex partners of patients with selected sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We evaluated the concordance between STIs diagnosed in partners and their reported exposures for which they might have received PDPT.

Results

Among 3503 female and 4647 heterosexual male partners, 19 (0.4%) of 4716 individuals tested were newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and 61 individuals (0.7%) had syphilis. Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in 133 women (3.8%). Seventy-two (3.2%) of 2226 female and heterosexual male partners reporting exposure to patients with chlamydial infection had gonorrhea diagnosed. Chlamydial infection or gonorrhea was diagnosed in 81 heterosexual male partners (10.3%) who reported contact with women with trichomoniasis. Among 473 men who have sex with men (MSM; including bisexual men), 13 (6.3%) of 207 tested were newly diagnosed with HIV infection, and 8 (1.7%) had syphilis. Six (6.1%) of 98 MSM reporting exposure to patients with chlamydial infection had gonorrhea diagnosed.

Conclusions

Infrequent coinfections in female and heterosexual male partners exposed to patients with chlamydial infection or gonorrhea would not preclude use of PDPT. However, PDPT for male partners of women with trichomoniasis and for MSM requires further study.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116cJ4gr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, affecting 3.7 million people in the United States (US). Women with Trichomonas vaginalis have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STIs. Trichomoniasis is also associated with infertility and adverse birth outcomes. National guidelines recommend annual screening of women with HIV for trichomoniasis.

The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines recommend a single 2 g dose of oral metronidazole (MTZ) or tinidazole (TDZ) for T. vaginalis –infected women without HIV; for infected women with HIV, MTZ 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is preferred. The 2020 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) practice bulletin on vaginitis has recently recommended multidose MTZ for all nonpregnant women, based on new clinical trial data. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are pending.

Secnidazole (SEC) is a potent 5-nitroimidazole antibiotic with a longer half-life than MTZ and TDZ. In 2017, SEC was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first, single-dose oral treatment for bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women. The 2020 ACOG guidance includes SEC 2 g as an alternative treatment for BV, based on a randomized controlled trial, finding it comparable to 7-day MTZ for BV.

As a treatment for trichomoniasis, single-dose SEC had microbiological cure rates of 93%–96% after 2–3 days of treatment and up to 100% for ≤ 20 days of treatment in studies conducted outside the US. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-dose SEC in US-based women with trichomoniasis. We hypothesized that microbiological cure rates would be high after treatment of T. vaginalis –infected women with SEC, similar to studies outside the US.

### Trichomonas vaginalis infection in male sexual partners: implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113uUFua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis causes a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, yet trichomoniasis in male sexual partners is not well recognized. Nucleic acid amplification tests can increase detection of T. vaginalis in men compared with culture.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate T. vaginalis infection among male partners of women with trichomoniasis and factors associated with infection by recruiting patients from 3 public clinics in the United States. Male partners were tested for concordant T. vaginalis infection, defined as a positive urethral culture, urine culture, or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A subset of men also provided a semen sample for T. vaginalis culture and PCR. Factors associated with concordant infection were determined from bivariable and multivariable analyses.

Results

We enrolled 540 women with trichomoniasis (diagnosed using wet mount microscopy and/or culture) and 261 (48.4%) of their male partners. T. vaginalis infection was detected in 177 (71.7%) of 256 male partners (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.0%-77.3%), of whom 136 (77.3%) were asymptomatic. A vaginal pH of > 4.5 in a woman was independently associated with infection in the male partner (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0–6.3). Younger male age (20–29 and 30–39 years) was also found to be an independent risk factor for concordant trichomoniasis.

Conclusions

The majority of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were infected; however, few factors predicted infection. T. vaginalis causes a highly prevalent STI, necessitating vastly improved partner management, application of sensitive nucleic-acid based testing, and better clinical recognition.

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11–14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million people in the United States. Although trichomoniasis is common, it has been considered a "neglected" sexually transmitted disease, due to limited knowledge of its sequelae and associated costs. This article reviews current epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods, clinical management recommendations and special considerations, research on associated conditions and costs, prevention strategies, and controversies regarding trichomoniasis.

HIV Infection

BV appears to recur with higher frequency among women who have HIV infection. Women with HIV infection and BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

Trichomoniasis

Trichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral STI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons in the United States. Because trichomoniasis is not a reportable disease, and no recommendations are available for general screening for T. vaginalis, the epidemiology of trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and clinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based T. vaginalis prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among males, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6%) and Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White women (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%). Unlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T. vaginalis prevalence rates are as high among women aged > 24 years as they are for women aged < 24 years. Among persons attending nine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas prevalence was 14.6% among women, and a study of STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified a prevalence of 27% among women and 9.8% among men. Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%). Rates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at 9%–32% of incarcerated women and 3.2%–8% of incarcerated men. Women with a history of incarceration are two to five times more likely to have T. vaginalis. Other risk factors for T. vaginalis include having two or more sex partners during the previous year, having less than a high school education, and living below the national poverty level. Women with BV are at higher risk for T. vaginalis. Male partners of women with trichomoniasis are likely to have infection, although the prevalence of trichomoniasis among MSM is low.

### Epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of trichomonas vaginalis in men [^114yCFTN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men are traditionally considered to be benign and consequently have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and amplified human immunodeficiency virus risk. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed, yet the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111C1QBY]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Section 9. Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Preventive Services focuses on preventive services for 5 STDs that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV: syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in men and women and trichomoniasis in women. This section does not provide comprehensive recommendations about STD preventive services for persons with HIV; other guidance addresses screening, treatment, vaccination, and other interventions for infections that have not been shown to increase the risk of onward HIV transmission (e.g., human papillomavirus, hepatitis A, B, and C) and services for STDs that may increase the risk of HIV acquisition by HIV-uninfected persons, including trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis in women. Settings must be tested in laboratories that have validated procedures specified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) for testing specimens obtained in nonclinical settings. Health departments are responsible for population-level STD prevention and control programs. Quality improvement and program monitoring and evaluation can determine if the interventions described in this section are implemented as intended, yield the expected outcomes, or warrant changes in delivery methods. Although it remains uncertain if bacterial vaginosis results from acquisition of a sexually transmitted pathogen, this condition may increase risk of HIV acquisition.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^1117g5Bv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Assuming microbiological cure rates of 75% and 40% with SEC and placebo, respectively, a sample size of 100 patients (50 patients/group) provided approximately 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant between-treatment-group difference using a 2-sided, 2-sample comparison of proportions at the α = .05 level of significance. Assuming an attrition rate of 30%, 144 patients needed to be randomly assigned to SEC or placebo.

The primary efficacy endpoint was compared between the active and placebo treatment groups using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified by the presence/absence of clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis at baseline, HIV status, and BV status) at the α = .05 level of significance. As required by the FDA and determined a priori, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT population, defined as all randomized patients who had a positive T. vaginalis culture at baseline and a negative chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT at baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis was based on the per protocol (PP) population, defined as patients in the mITT population who received their assigned study medication and had a TOC visit. Post hoc efficacy analyses of the microbiological cure rate at TOC compared SEC- vs placebo-treated patients (1) with trichomoniasis who were symptomatic and those who were asymptomatic, (2) infected with HIV, and (3) with BV at baseline. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

Safety endpoints included the incidence, severity, and relationship to study medication of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests also were assessed. Safety endpoints were evaluated using the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who received any study-related medication.

### Diagnosis and management of trichomonas vaginalis: summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^111VNU6f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is likely the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, as African Americans are > 4 times more likely to be infected than persons of other races. Since publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have bolstered the importance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women, including increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Less is known about the clinical significance of infection in men. Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in women and men, including urine, allowing more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at 3 months after treatment is recommended. In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected persons suggest a role for expedited partner treatment. A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at 1 month test of cure compared with women receiving single-dose therapy (2 g). The 2-g single-dose oral metronidazole regimen remains the preferred treatment in men.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole in cases of reinfection.

### Population-based interventions for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection [^117SbP4R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that in 1995, 333 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occurred. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that over 90% of the 33 million people infected with HIV by December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 1999). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviours, such as frequent unprotected intercourse with different partners, place people at high risk of both infections, and there is clear evidence that conventional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs, and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993) and there is biological evidence that the presence of an STI increases shedding of HIV and that STI treatment reduces HIV shedding (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute substantially to HIV prevention.

Objectives

To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the frequency of HIV infection, frequency of STIs and quality of STI management.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomised trials or reviews: 1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to current using the search terms sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infection 2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register in the most recent issue of the Cochrane Library 3) The specialist register of trials maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group. 4) EMBASE The abstracts of relevant conferences were searched and reference lists of all review articles and primary studies were scanned. Finally, authors of included trials and other experts in the field were contacted as appropriate.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which the unit of randomisation is either a community or a treatment facility. Studies where individuals are randomised were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies with any disagreements resolved by discussion. Trials were examined for completeness of reporting. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers with details recorded of randomisation method, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis and the number of patients lost to follow-up using standard guidelines of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.

Main Results

Four trials were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment of all community members for STIs the rate ratio of incident HIV infection was 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating no effect of the intervention. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (strengthened syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared with 1.9% in the control groups (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.70), corresponding to a 38% reduction (95%CI 15% to 55%) in HIV incidence in the intervention group. Frequency of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in gonorrhoea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms among intervention communities. The prevalence ratio of syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95%CI 0.71–0.89), of trichmoniasis was 0.59 (0.38–0.91), and of bacterial vaginosis was 0.87 (0.74–1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis in the intervention community was 5% compared with 7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95%CI 0.54–0.93). Quality of treatment: In Lima, following training of pharmacy assistants in STI syndromic management, symptoms were recognised as being due to an STI in 65% of standardised simulated patients (SSPs) visiting intervention and 60% of SSPs visiting control pharmacies (p = 0.35). Medication was offered without referral to a doctor in most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p = 0.61). Of those SSPs offered medication, only 1.4% that visited intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those that visited control pharmacies (p = 0.57) were offered a recommended regimen. Similarly in only 15% and 16% of SSP visits respectively was any recommended drug offered. However, education and counseling were more likely to be given to SSPs visiting intervention pharmacies (40% vs 27%, p = 0.01). No SSPs were given partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, following the intervention targeting primary care clinic nurses (strengthened STI syndromic management and provision of STI syndrome packets containing recommended drugs, condom, partner cards and patient information leaflets), SSPs were more likely to be given recommended drugs in intervention clinics (83% vs 12%, p < 0.005) and more likely to be correctly case managed [given correct drugs, partner cards and condoms] (88% vs 50%, p < 0.005). There were no significant difference in the proportions adequately counseled (68% vs 46%, p = 0.06), experiencing good staff attitude (84% vs 58%, p = 0.07), and being consulted in privacy (92% vs 86%, p = 0.4). There was no strong evidence of any impact on treatment seeking behaviour, utilisation of services, or sexual behaviour in any of the four trials.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce HIV incidence in an environment characterised by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly rising prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor and where STIs are highly prevalent. There is no evidence for substantial benefit from treatment of all community members. There are however other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted it can substantially improve quality of services provided. Further community based randomised controlled trials that test a range of alternative STI control strategies are needed in a variety of different settings. Such trials should aim to measure a range of factors that include health seeking behaviour and quality of treatment as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^1136Rb1b]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Box 9 — STD services for symptomatic disease, positive tests, or recent partner treatment — For persons with HIV who have a clinical evaluation indicative of STD or positive screening or diagnostic STD tests, or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydial infection, provide the following services: provide oral or injectable STD treatment onsite, including presumptive treatment (while awaiting STD test results) when indicated, according to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines; advise to return 3 months after treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to obtain retesting for the relevant infection at the anatomic site of infection; advise persons diagnosed with syphilis to return for follow up serologic testing according to latest CDC recommendations; provide or refer for brief or intensive behavioral risk-reduction interventions; refer to voluntary health department HIV/STD partner services or other trained partner services provider; and report cases of STD according to jurisdiction requirements and inform persons diagnosed with STD that case reporting may prompt health departments to offer voluntary, confidential partner services in some jurisdictions.

### Update of trichomoniasis [^111GuYNL]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis remains an extremely common infection despite the fact that rates of other treatable sexually transmitted diseases are declining. Newer diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are documenting higher rates of infection in heterosexual men than have been previously found with culture. Although data on the association of vaginal trichomoniasis with preterm birth are controversial, the association of trichomoniasis with HIV acquisition seems clear. Despite being a readily diagnosed and treated STD, trichomoniasis is not a reportable infection and control of the infection has received relatively little emphasis from public health STD control programmes. More recently, however, appreciation of high rates of disease and of associations of trichomoniasis in women with adverse outcomes of pregnancy and increased risk for HIV infection suggest a need for increased control efforts.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115DBZBV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening might be considered for persons receiving care in high-prevalence settings (e.g. STD clinics and correctional facilities) and for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection (e.g. multiple sex partners, transactional sex, drug misuse, or a history of STIs or incarceration). However, data are lacking regarding whether screening and treatment for asymptomatic trichomoniasis in high-prevalence settings for women at high risk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities or reduce community infection burden. Decisions about screening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis infection. Routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among asymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended because of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis and HIV infection.

Extragenital T. vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon compared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San Francisco, California, reported a 0.6% rate of rectal T. vaginalis; however, this might reflect deposition of T. vaginalis DNA and not necessarily active infection. Few studies of extragenital T. vaginalis among women have been published. The efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of extragenital screening are unknown, and no tests are FDA cleared for extragenital testing; therefore, rectal and oral testing for T. vaginalis is not recommended.

### The clinical spectrum of trichomonas vaginalis infection and challenges to management [^1162WGbx]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection worldwide. T vaginalis infections in women can range from asymptomatic to acute inflammatory vaginitis. In men, this infection is typically asymptomatic but is increasingly being recognised as a cause of non-gonococcal urethritis. Diagnosis of T vaginalis has traditionally been made by direct microscopic examination of a wet mount of vaginal fluid or through the use of culture. The recent commercial availability of nucleic acid amplification tests for the detection of T vaginalis has seen these replace culture as the gold standard for diagnosis. Nitroimidazoles (ie, metronidazole and tinidazole) are the mainstay of therapy. In the case of treatment failure due to drug resistance or in the case of a severe nitroimidazole allergy, alternative intravaginal therapies exist, although their effectiveness has not been evaluated systematically. Novel systemic agents other than nitroimidazoles for the treatment of T vaginalis are needed, and efforts to promote and support antimicrobial drug development in this setting are necessary.

### Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2006 [^114gHBP2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by CDC after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, during April 19–21, 2005. The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2002 (MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-6]). Included in these updated guidelines are an expanded diagnostic evaluation for cervicitis and trichomoniasis; new antimicrobial recommendations for trichomoniasis; additional data on the clinical efficacy of azithromycin for chlamydial infections in pregnancy; discussion of the role of Mycoplasma genitalium and trichomoniasis in urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; emergence of lymphogranuloma venereum protocolitis among men who have sex with men (MSM); expanded discussion of the criteria for spinal fluid examination to evaluate for neurosyphilis; the emergence of azithromycin- resistant Treponema pallidum; increasing prevalence of quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in MSM; revised discussion concerning the sexual transmission of hepatitis C; postexposure prophylaxis after sexual assault; and an expanded discussion of STD prevention approaches.

HIV Infection

Up to 53% of women with HIV have T. vaginalis infection. T. vaginalis infection among these women is substantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Among women who are not virally suppressed, treatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in genital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding; however, no difference might occur among women who are virally suppressed. Because of the high prevalence of T. vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential for adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and possibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and prompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV infection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at least annually thereafter.

A randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV and T. vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose of metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. Factors that might interfere with standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among women with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV infection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired immunity. Thus, to improve cure rates, women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV, screening at the first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are recommended because T. vaginalis infection is a risk factor for vertical transmission of HIV.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. Likelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV infection is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days

If a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the protocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent Trichomonas). Other management considerations, follow-up, and management of sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV infection. Treatment of men with HIV infection should follow the same guidelines as for men without HIV.

For women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection, retesting is recommended 3 months after treatment; NAAT is encouraged because of higher sensitivity of these tests. Data are insufficient to support retesting of men with trichomonas and HIV infection.

### Population-based interventions for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection [^1144fAAh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that in 1999, 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occurred. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that over 95% of the 40 million people infected with HIV by December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 2003). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviours, such as frequent unprotected intercourse with different partners, place people at high risk of both infections, and there is clear evidence that conventional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993). There is biological evidence, too, that the presence of an STI increases shedding of HIV, and that STI treatment reduces HIV shedding (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute substantially to HIV prevention.

Objectives

To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the frequency of HIV infection, frequency of STIs and quality of STI management.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomised trials or reviews:1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 2003 using the search terms "sexually transmitted diseases" and "human immunodeficiency virus infection"2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, in the most recent issue of the Cochrane Library3) The specialist registry of trials maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.4) EMBASE The abstracts of relevant conferences were searched, and reference lists of all review articles and primary studies were scanned. Finally, authors of included trials and other experts in the field were contacted as appropriate.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which the unit of randomisation is either a community or a treatment facility. Studies where individuals are randomised were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. Trials were examined for completeness of reporting. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers, with details recorded of randomisation method, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis and the number of patients lost to follow-up, using standard guidelines of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.

Main Results

Five trials were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment of all community members for STIs, the rate ratio of incident HIV infection was 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating no effect of the intervention. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (strengthened syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared with 1.9% in the control groups (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.70), corresponding to a 38% reduction (95%CI 15% to 55%) in HIV incidence in the intervention group. In the newest trial by Kamali et al, the rate ratio of behavioral intervention & STI management compared to control on HIV incidence was 1.00 (0.63–1.58, p = .98). These are consistent with Rakai data showing no effect of intervention. Frequency of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in gonorrhoea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms among intervention communities. The prevalence ratio of syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95%CI 0.71–0.89), of trichmoniasis was 0.59 (0.38–0.91), and of bacterial vaginosis was 0.87 (0.74–1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis in the intervention community was 5% compared with 7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted re7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95%CI 0.54–0.93). In Kamali et al, there was a significant decrease in gonorrhoea and active syphilis cases. Rate ratio for gonorrhoea was 0.29(0.12–0.71, p = 0.016), active syphilis was 0.53(0.33–0.84, p = 0.016). There was a trend towards significance with intervention on the use of condoms with the last casual partner; the rate ratio was 1.27(1.02–1.56, p = 0.036). Quality of treatment: In Lima, following training of pharmacy assistants in STI syndromic management, symptoms were recognised as being due to an STI in 65% of standardised simulated patients (SSPs) visiting intervention and 60% of SSPs visiting control pharmacies (p = 0.35). Medication was offered without referral to a doctor in most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p = 0.61). Of those SSPs offered medication, only 1.4% that visited intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those that visited control pharmacies (p = 0.57) were offered a recommended regimen. Similarly in only 15% and 16% of SSP visits respectively was any recommended drug offered. However, education and counseling were more likely to be given to SSPs visiting intervention pharmacies (40% vs 27%, p = 0.01). No SSPs were given partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, following the intervention targeting primary care clinic nurses (strengthened STI syndromic management and provision of STI syndrome packets containing recommended drugs, condom, partner cards and patient information leaflets), SSPs were more likely to be given recommended drugs in intervention clinics (83% vs 12%, p < 0.005) and more likely to be correctly case managed [given correct drugs, partner cards and condoms] (88% vs 50%, p < 0.005). There were no significant differences in the proportions adequately counseled (68% vs 46%, p = 0.06), experiencing good staff attitude (84% vs 58%, p = 0.07), and being consulted in privacy (92% vs 86%, p = 0.4). There was no strong evidence of any impact on treatment-seeking behaviour, utilisation of services, or sexual behaviour in any of the four trials.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce HIV incidence in an environment characterised by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly rising prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor and where STIs are highly prevalent. There is no evidence for substantial benefit from treatment of all community members. The addition of the Kamali trial to the existing evidence supports the data from the Rakai trial of no effect. There are, however, other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened, and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted it can substantially improve quality of services provided. The Kamali trial shows an increase in the use of condoms, a marker for improved risk behaviors. Further community-based randomised controlled trials that test a range of alternative STI control strategies are needed in a variety of different settings. Such trials should aim to measure a range of factors that include health seeking behaviour and quality of treatment, as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.

Summary

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11–14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.

### Late recurrence of resistant trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis: relapse or re-infection? [^113udgTn]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between re-infection and relapse of trichomonas infections is often a difficult task in the clinical setting. The chronicity of trichomonas infections and the ongoing sexual activity are two confounding factors. We present a patient with recurrent resistant vaginal trichomoniasis shortly following a sexual contact with an untreated partner after a complete response to treatment with tinidazole for nine months. We hypothesise that re-infection occurred from the asymptomatic partner who was an untreated chronic carrier of resistant trichomonas in the urogenital tract.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114s2YpM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical trials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia or gonorrhea. All three trials reported that more partners were treated when patients were offered EPT. Two reported statistically significant decreases in the rate of reinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or recurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A fourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a difference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of partners treated between persons offered EPT and those advised to notify their sex partners. U.S. trials and a meta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction in reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, differed according to the STI and the sex of the index patient (,–). However, across trials, reductions in chlamydia prevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up.

Existing data indicate that EPT also might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis; however, no partner management intervention has been reported to be more effective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection rates. No data support use of EPT in the routine management of patients with syphilis.

Data are limited regarding use of EPT for gonococcal or chlamydial infections among MSM, compared with heterosexuals. Published studies, including recent data regarding extragenital testing, indicated that male partners of MSM with diagnosed gonorrhea or chlamydia might have other bacterial STIs (gonorrhea or syphilis) or HIV. Studies have reported that 5% of MSM have a new diagnosis of HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal or chlamydial infections; however, more recent data indicate that, in certain settings, the frequency of HIV infection is much lower. Considering limited data and potential for other bacterial STIs among MSM partners, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended. All persons who receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, particularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk for HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^111nrQW2]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^111MG5xF]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis:

In the Female:

One-day treatment − two grams of metronidazole tablets, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given in the same day.

Seven-day course of treatment − 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 500 mg or 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approx. 500 mg for a 70-kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zQfNN]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide each year, there are an estimated 357 million new infections of one of the four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. Aetiological diagnosis via STI testing is the best way to ascertain infection status and promote appropriate treatment. While STI diagnostic tests are available and used in many high-income countries, diagnostic tests in low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) settings are largely unavailable. Syndromic management has been the primary approach for STI treatment in LMICs, which has significant limitations despite its practicality; experts doubt it will impact STI disease burden. Globally, social stigma and a lack of effective policies also affect STI testing uptake and treatment-seeking behaviour. Low STI testing coverage and high transmission rates are common among at-risk vulnerable adolescents and key populations including men who have sex with men (MSM), migrants, sex workers, Indigenous and minority populations and those affected by humanitarian emergencies. Left undiagnosed and untreated, curable STIs can cause acute and chronic illness, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, long-term disability, neurological and cardiovascular disease and death. Serious diseases in their own right, STIs also increase the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV infection. Consequently, greater efforts are needed to expand STI testing globally to reduce this heavy burden of disease.

Model Structure and Probability of Key Clinical Outcomes

We used probability trees to model clinical outcomes of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, adapted from a model framework described in Li et al. We assumed a similar set of secondary outcomes for all 3 STIs examined using the same probability-tree structures, but as relevant allowed model input values (ie, probabilities, durations, and utility) to vary across the 3 STIs. Separate trees were specified for men and women (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

Figure 1.
Probability tree for sequelae of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis among women (Panel A), with complications of PID shown in Panel B. Abbreviations: CPP, chronic pelvic pain; EP, ectopic pregnancy; PID, pelvic inflammatory disease; TFI, tubal factor infertility.

Figure 2.
Probability tree for sequelae of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis among men. Abbreviation: EDS, epididymitis.

For women, each STI was categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic with different durations of infections, which determined the probability of developing PID and subsequent complications (Figure 1). Although treatment for infections is not explicitly distinguished as a separate branch in Figure 1, the estimated durations of infections accounted for the fraction of cases treated. Possible complications following PID were CPP, EP, and TFI (Figure 1 B). The probability that an infection would be symptomatic was derived from estimates from Kreisel et al and Lewis et al. Proportions of treated symptomatic or asymptomatic infections, and durations of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (distinct for treated or untreated) were estimated based on the parameters in these studies (Supplementary Material Section 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Probabilities of PID and sequelae (CPP, EP, and TFI) were estimated based on synthesizing evidence (Supplementary Material Section 3).

For men, infections were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic urethral infections (Figure 2). We assumed that urethritis was present in all symptomatic infections for the duration from symptom onset to testing due to symptoms (Supplementary Table 1), and that urethritis was not present in asymptomatic infections. There is sparse evidence on the relationship between duration of infection and sequelae development for men, and EDS was modeled using a probability that was independent of duration (Supplementary Material Section 3).

Persistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis

The objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU should be made before considering additional antimicrobial therapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might be caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful treatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after treatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the value of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been demonstrated. Treatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has been estimated at 6%–12%. The most common cause of persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially after doxycycline therapy. Treatment failure for M. genitalium is harder to determine because certain men achieve clinical cure (i.e. resolution of symptoms) but can still have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens.

The initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance with treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex partner. If the patient did not comply with the treatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, retreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If therapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure occurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment regimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent or persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, chlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to guide further management decisions.

Trichomonas is a cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); however, studies of its prevalence in men have been hampered by the lack of sensitive diagnostics. DNA amplification allows for reappraisal of the extent of infection in men. Men attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic were tested for trichomonas, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. The prevalence of these pathogens was 17%, 19.6%, and 17.7% respectively. In men with NGU, 19.9% were infected with trichomonas. These data have implications for treatment of NGU and control of trichomoniasis.

### Spontaneous resolution ofinfection in men [^115kNZwU]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the early natural history of Trichomonas vaginalis in men recently testing positive for this infection by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). We hypothesised that 50% of men would spontaneously resolve their infection (in the absence of treatment) on repeat T. vaginalis NAAT.

Methods

Men ages ≥ 18 years at the Jefferson County Health Department Sexual Health Clinic testing positive for T. vaginalis by NAAT during standard-of-care (SOC) within the past 30 days and presenting to the clinic for treatment were approached. At enrolment, participants completed a questionnaire, provided urine for repeat T. vaginalis NAAT, and were treated with 2g oral metronidazole. Those with a repeat positive enrolment NAAT were seen for a 4-week test-of-cure (TOC) visit. At TOC, men provided urine for repeat NAAT. We determined the proportion of men with spontaneous resolution of T. vaginalis and evaluated predictors of spontaneous resolution. In those with a repeat positive enrolment T. vaginalis NAAT, we evaluated the proportion with persistent infection at TOC as a secondary outcome.

Results

Between October 2021 and January 2023, 53 men with a recent positive SOC T. vaginalis NAAT were approached; 37 (69.8%) participated. The mean participant age was 32.9 years (SD 9.9); all identified as Black. The majority (97.3%) reported sex with women only; 35.1% reported sex with > 1 partner in the last month. At enrolment, 26/37 (70.3%) had a repeat positive T. vaginalis NAAT in the absence of treatment after an average of 8.4days (SD 5.9). Sexual partner gender, number of recent sexual partners, genital symptoms, unprotected sex with any partner and recent antibiotic use were not associated with spontaneous resolution. Of the 26 men attending a TOC visit, 17 (65.4%) returned and all except one (94.1%) were cured.

Conclusion

Most men do not spontaneously clear T. vaginalis infection during early repeat testing.

14.2 Trichomoniasis

The efficacy of a single 2-gram oral dose of SOLOSEC for the treatment of trichomoniasis was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, delayed treatment, double-blind, trial (Trial 5, NCT03935217). A total of 147 female patients from the United States aged 15 to 65 years were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either SOLOSEC or placebo. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all randomized patients who were culture positive for T. vaginalis and negative for other sexually transmitted infections. Of the 131 female patients in the mITT population, the median age was 36 years, and 90.8% were African American. Baseline clinical symptoms of vaginal itching, discharge, or odor were reported in 111 (84.7%) patients. Following initial dosing, the test of cure (TOC) visit occurred 6 to 12 days later. At the TOC visit, patients received the opposite treatment (placebo patients received SOLOSEC and vice versa) with a return visit 7 to 12 days later.

Results for microbiological cure, defined as testing negative for T. vaginalis, for the mITT population are presented in Table 5. The microbiological cure rate at the TOC visit was significantly higher in the SOLOSEC treatment group compared to the placebo group.

The single oral 2 g secnidazole dose was also assessed in four open-label trials in males (one comparative study with metronidazole and ornidazole in males only1and three single-arm studies in males and females2,3,4). Parasitological evaluation was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranged from 91.7% (165/180) to 100% (30/30) at time points ranging from 2 to 20 days (n = 437, 211 males and 226 females). In addition, the natural history of trichomoniasis in men was evaluated in one study.5The spontaneous resolution during a mean follow-up of 16 ± 12 days was noted in 36% (5/14) (95% CI: 12.8%, 64.9%) of untreated men.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing exposure and disease in persons with HIV infection — primary prevention should begin with a behavioral risk assessment and routine discussion of sexual behaviors, and health care providers should discuss client-centered risk reduction messages and provide specific actions that reduce sexually transmitted disease acquisition and HIV transmission. Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all sexually active persons with HIV infection, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3–6 months) for those with multiple or anonymous partners; the occurrence of syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection should prompt intensified risk assessment, counseling, and strong consideration of referral for behavioral intervention. Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women. Frequent serologic screening can identify persons recently infected, sometimes before infectious lesions, and treatment can prevent disease progression and transmission; historically, approximately one-third of sex partners of persons with primary syphilis will develop syphilis within 30 days of exposure.

### Tinidazole (tindazole) [^116tc83L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole (2 g single oral dose) use in trichomoniasis has been well documented in 34 published reports from the world literature involving over 2,800 patients treated with tinidazole. In four published, blinded, randomized, comparative studies of the 2 g tinidazole single oral dose where efficacy was assessed by culture at time points post-treatment ranging from one week to one month, reported cure rates ranged from 92% (37/40) to 100% (65/65) (n = 172 total subjects). In four published, blinded, randomized, comparative studies where efficacy was assessed by wet mount between 7–14 days post-treatment, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (8/10) to 100% (16/16) (n = 116 total subjects). In these studies, tinidazole was superior to placebo and comparable to other anti-trichomonal drugs. The single oral 2 g tinidazole dose was also assessed in four open-label trials in men (one comparative to metronidazole and 3 single-arm studies). Parasitological evaluation of the urine was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranged from 83% (25/30) to 100% (80/80) (n = 142 total subjects).

14.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole (2 g single dose) use in giardiasis has been documented in 19 published reports from the world literature involving over 1,600 patients (adults and pediatric patients). In eight controlled studies involving a total of 619 subjects of whom 299 were given the 2 g × 1 day (50 mg/kg × 1 day in pediatric patients) oral dose of tinidazole, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (40/50) to 100% (15/15). In three of these trials where the comparator was 2 to 3 days of various doses of metronidazole, reported cure rates for metronidazole were 76% (19/25) to 93% (14/15). Data comparing a single 2 g dose of tinidazole to usually recommended 5–7 days of metronidazole are limited.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and might reduce transmission. Treatment recommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly symptomatic women without HIV infection. The study demonstrated that multidose metronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of women retesting positive at a 1-month test of cure visit by half, compared with women who received the 2-g single dose. No published randomized trials are available that compare these doses among men.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Men
Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose
Alternative Regimen for Women and Men
Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against T. vaginalis infections. Tinidazole is usually more expensive, reaches higher levels in serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution.

Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.

Other Management Considerations

Providers should advise persons with T. vaginalis infections to abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated (i.e. when therapy has been completed and any symptoms have resolved). Testing for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons with T. vaginalis.

Follow-Up

Because of the high rate of reinfection among women treated for trichomoniasis, retesting for T. vaginalis is recommended for all sexually active women < 3 months after initial treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient to support retesting men after treatment.

### Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy [^113qTjAk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common of sexually transmitted diseases. Trichomoniasis affects women during pregnancy as well but it is not clearly established whether it causes preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various treatments for trichomoniasis during pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing anti-trichomonas agents during pregnancy. Trials including symptomatic or asymptomatic women with trichomoniasis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

We included two trials with 842 pregnant women. In both trials around 90% of women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the US trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 and 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (risk ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.66). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded two recent studies, identified for the current update, because they did not address the primary question.

Authors' Conclusions

Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111VqaEC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g. those aged < 25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Cervicitis*
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
* Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).
Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated for cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after single-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved. Women who receive a cervicitis diagnosis should be tested for syphilis and HIV in addition to other recommended diagnostic tests.

Follow-Up

Women receiving treatment should return to their provider for a follow-up visit to determine whether cervicitis has resolved. For women who are untreated, a follow-up visit gives providers an opportunity to communicate test results obtained as part of the cervicitis evaluation. Providers should treat on the basis of any positive test results and determine whether cervicitis has resolved. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated. If symptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to return for reevaluation.

### A review of evidence-based care of symptomatic trichomoniasis and asymptomatic trichomonas vaginalis infections [^1178xa4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of this infection, which affects 11% of women aged ≥ 40 years and a disproportionately high percentage of black women. Particularly high prevalences have been identified among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients and incarcerated individuals. This article reviews and updates scientific evidence in key topic areas used for the development of the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Current evidence is presented regarding conditions associated with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Nucleic acid amplification tests and point-of-care tests are newly available diagnostic methods that can be conducted on a variety of specimens, potentially allowing highly sensitive testing and screening of both women and men at risk for infection. Usually, trichomoniasis can be cured with single-dose therapy of an appropriate nitroimidazole antibiotic, but women who are also infected with HIV should receive therapy for 7 days. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^117VTgWT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of secnidazole vs placebo in women with trichomoniasis.

Methods

Women with trichomoniasis, confirmed by a positive T. vaginalis culture, were randomized to single-dose oral secnidazole 2 g or placebo. The primary endpoint was microbiological test of cure (TOC) by culture 6–12 days after dosing. At the TOC visit, participants were given the opposite treatment. They were followed for resolution of infection afterward and offered treatment at subsequent visits, if needed. Fifty patients per group (N = 100) provided approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups.

Results

Between April 2019 and March 2020, 147 women enrolled at 10 sites in the United States. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included 131 randomized patients (secnidazole, n = 64; placebo, n = 67). Cure rates were significantly higher in the secnidazole vs placebo group for the mITT population (92.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 82.7%-97.4%] vs 1.5% [95% CI: .0%-8.0%]) and for the per-protocol population (94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%-98.9%] vs 1.7% [95% CI: .0%-8.9%]). Cure rates were 100% (4/4) in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 95.2% (20/21) in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Secnidazole was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were vulvovaginal candidiasis and nausea (each 2.7%). No serious TEAEs were observed.

Conclusions

A single oral 2 g dose of secnidazole was associated with significantly higher microbiological cure rates vs placebo, supporting a role for secnidazole in treating women with trichomoniasis, including those with HIV and/or BV.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111c2ins]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — assessment, condom counseling and provision, presumptive treatment, and scope — are detailed as follows: Assessment of behavioral and biologic risk factors is recommended at initial and subsequent visits in clinical settings providing continuing care, and in clinical or nonclinical settings that provide one-time or episodic STD services, assessment is recommended at initial encounter and when clients seek follow-up services; recalling clients specifically for risk assessment may not be feasible. In this section, the term "assess" means eliciting information about behavioral and biologic risk factors for HIV transmission, including history of STD and STD symptoms, and the term "screen" means testing for STD pathogens in persons without symptoms. This section does not address screening persons with HIV for other conditions that have not been shown to facilitate HIV transmission to others, such as viral hepatitis and human papillomavirus infection. All source guidance advises providing information or counseling about condom use; guidance from the Health Resources and Services Administration advises providing condoms to patients in publicly funded clinics. According to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, immediate presumptive treatment (or immediate linkage to such treatment) is recommended for persons who report sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or have STD syndromes in order to reduce the risk of onward STD transmission; STD syndromes are conditions that can be caused by sexually transmitted pathogens and cause symptoms or abnormal findings (signs) on physical examination, such as genital ulcer disease, urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and proctitis. The cited source guidance describes the rationale for retesting for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection; the Evidence topic describes the rationale for retesting for trichomoniasis.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services — Periodic screening is emphasized because "a high proportion of persons infected with these 3 STDs may lack symptoms or signs, periodic screening with sensitive laboratory tests is needed to detect infection". For follow-up, "Men and women diagnosed with gonorrhea and chlamydial infection and women diagnosed with trichomoniasis can benefit from rescreening 3 months after treatment due to high rates of reinfection or persistent infection". Regarding herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) coinfection in persons with HIV, a "meta-analysis of 11 studies conducted in 2010 showed that HSV-2 coinfection increased plasma HIV viral load by almost a quarter log (difference in mean VL 0.22 log10 copies/mL, 95% CI: 0.04–0.40)", yet "2 randomized controlled trials conducted from 2004–2007 did not find that acyclovir treatment of persons coinfected with HIV and HSV-2 significantly reduced the risk of HIV transmission among HIV-discordant couples", and "no controlled clinical trials of U.S. populations have evaluated the role of STD screening and treatment in preventing onward HIV transmission from persons with HIV".

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were updated by CDC after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta on April 30-May 2, 2013. The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2010;59 [No. RR-12]). These updated guidelines discuss 1) alternative treatment regimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 2) the use of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis; 3) alternative treatment options for genital warts; 4) the role of Mycoplasma genitalium in urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; 5) updated HPV vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) the management of persons who are transgender; 7) annual testing for hepatitis C in persons with HIV infection; 8) updated recommendations for diagnostic evaluation of urethritis; and 9) retesting to detect repeat infection. Physicians and other health-care providers can use these guidelines to assist in the prevention and treatment of STDs.

### Trichomoniasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^115d3M4a]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution. Nitroimidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is concerning because few alternatives to standard therapy exist.

If treatment failure occurs in a woman after completing a regimen of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days and she has been reexposed to an untreated partner, a repeat course of the same regimen is recommended. If no reexposure has occurred, she should be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g once daily for 7 days. If a man has persistent. T. vaginalis after a single 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed to an untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he should be administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. The first is high-dose oral tinidazole 2 g daily plus intravaginal tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 14 days. If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole plus intravaginal paromomycin for 14 days should be considered.

Alternative regimens might be effective but have not been systemically evaluated; therefore, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Clinical improvement has been reported with intravaginal boric acid (.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114w7dPU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to obtaining a behavioral risk assessment, a comprehensive STI and HIV risk assessment should include STI screening as recommended in these guidelines because STIs are biologic markers of risk, particularly for HIV acquisition and transmission among certain MSM. In most clinical settings, STI screening is an essential and underused component of an STI and HIV risk assessment. Persons seeking treatment or evaluation for a particular STI should be screened for HIV and other STIs as indicated by community prevalence and individual risk factors (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis). Persons should be informed about all the tests for STIs they are receiving and notified about tests for common STIs (e.g. genital herpes, trichomoniasis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and HPV) that are available but not being performed and reasons why they are not always indicated. Persons should be informed of their test results and recommendations for future testing. Efforts should be made to ensure that all persons receive STI care regardless of personal circumstances (e.g. ability to pay, citizenship or immigration status, gender identity, language spoken, or specific sex practices).

STI and HIV Infection Prevention Counseling

After obtaining a sexual history from their patients, all providers should encourage risk reduction by offering prevention counseling. Prevention counseling is most effective if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner appropriate to the patient's culture, language, sex and gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs and HIV should be offered to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received an STI diagnosis, have had an STI during the previous year, or have had multiple sex partners. USPSTF recommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs and HIV. Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies. One such approach, known as client-centered STI and HIV prevention counseling, involves tailoring a discussion of risk reduction to the person's situation. Although one large study in STI clinics (Project RESPECT) demonstrated that this approach was associated with lower acquisition of curable STIs (e.g. trichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis), another study conducted 10 years later in the same settings but different contexts (Project AWARE) did not replicate this result.

### Single-dose versus 7-day-dose metronidazole for the treatment of trichomoniasis in women: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113hTRS5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, and is associated with serious reproductive morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose metronidazole treatment might not always clear infection. We compared single-dose metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by bacterial vaginosis.

Methods

In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the USA. We included women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis infection according to clinical screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was T vaginalis infection by intention to treat, at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also stratified by bacterial vaginosis status. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01018095, and with the US Food and Drug Administration, number IND118276, and is closed to accrual.

Findings

Participants were recruited from Oct 6, 2014, to April 26, 2017. Of the 1028 patients assessed for eligibility, 623 women were randomly assigned to treatment groups (311 women in the single-dose group and 312 women in the 7-day-dose group; intention-to-treat population). Although planned enrolment had been 1664 women, the study was stopped early because of funding limitations. Patients in the 7-day-dose group were less likely to be T vaginalis positive at test-of-cure than those in the single-dose group (34 [11%] of 312 vs 58 [19%] of 311, relative risk 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.70; p < 0.0001). Bacterial vaginosis status had no significant effect on relative risk (p = 0.17). Self-reported adherence was 96% in the 7-day-dose group and 99% in the single-dose group. Side-effects were similar by group; the most common side-effect was nausea (124 [23%]), followed by headache (38 [7%]) and vomiting (19 [4%]).

Interpretation

The 7-day-dose metronidazole should be the preferred treatment for trichomoniasis among women.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111WR5FY]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Nitroimidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is concerning because few alternatives to standard therapy exist. If treatment failure occurs in a woman after completing a regimen of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days and she has been reexposed to an untreated partner, a repeat course of the same regimen is recommended. If no reexposure has occurred, she should be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g once daily for 7 days. If a man has persistent T. vaginalis after a single 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed to an untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he should be administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days.

For persons who are experiencing persistent infection not attributable to reexposure, clinicians should request a kit from CDC to perform drug-resistance testing. CDC is experienced with susceptibility testing for nitroimidazole-resistant T. vaginalis and can provide guidance regarding treatment in cases of drug resistance. On the basis of drug resistance testing, an alternative treatment regimen might be recommended. Treatments for infections demonstrating in vitro resistance can include metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days. If a patient has treatment failure after the 7-day regimen of high-dose oral metronidazole or tinidazole, two additional treatment options have been determined to have successful results for women. The first is high-dose oral tinidazole 2 g daily plus intravaginal tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 14 days. If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole (1 g 3 times/day) plus intravaginal paromomycin (4 g of 6.25% intravaginal paromomycin cream nightly) for 14 days should be considered.

Alternative regimens might be effective but have not been systemically evaluated; therefore, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Clinical improvement has been reported with intravaginal boric acid but not with nitazoxanide. The following topically applied agents have minimal success (< 50%) and are not recommended: intravaginal betadine (povidone-iodine), clotrimazole, acetic acid, furazolidone, GV, nonoxynol-9, and potassium permanganate. No other topical microbicide has been reported to be effective against trichomoniasis.

### Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: an update [^1175cE4i]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published revised guidelines for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. One new treatment strategy is the use of azithromycin as a primary, rather than alternative, medication for pregnant women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection continues to increase in the United States; therefore, quinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of this infection. Expedited partner therapy gives physicians another option when addressing the need to treat partners of persons diagnosed with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection. Tinidazole is now available in the United States and can be used to manage trichomoniasis, including trichomoniasis resistant to metronidazole. Shorter courses of antiviral medication can be used for episodic therapy of recurrent genital herpes. Because of increasing resistance, close follow-up is required if azithromycin is used as an alternative treatment in the management of primary or secondary syphilis. Unexpected increases in the rates of lymphogranuloma venereum have occurred in The Netherlands, and physicians should remain vigilant for symptoms of this disease in the United States.

### Metronidazole [^117JupCj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis

In the Female:

One-day treatment − two grams of metronidazole tablets, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given in the same day.

Seven-day course of treatment − 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 500 mg or 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approx. 500 mg for a 70-kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections: challenges ahead [^112Aq4t9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

WHO estimated that nearly 1 million people become infected every day with any of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Despite their high global incidence, STIs remain a neglected area of research. In this Commission, we have prioritised five areas that represent particular challenges in STI treatment and control. Chlamydia remains the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in high-income countries despite widespread testing recommendations, sensitive and specific non-invasive testing techniques, and cheap effective therapy. We discuss the challenges for chlamydia control and evidence to support a shift from the current focus on infection-based screening to improved management of diagnosed cases and of chlamydial morbidity, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is globally recognised. We review current and potential future control and treatment strategies, with a focus on novel antimicrobials. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder in women, but current treatments are associated with frequent recurrence. Recurrence after treatment might relate to evidence that suggests sexual transmission is integral to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, which has substantial implications for the development of effective management approaches. STIs disproportionately affect low-income and middle-income countries. We review strategies for case management, focusing on point-of-care tests that hold considerable potential for improving STI control. Lastly, STIs in men who have sex with men have increased since the late 1990s. We discuss the contribution of new biomedical HIV prevention strategies and risk compensation. Overall, this Commission aims to enhance the understanding of some of the key challenges facing the field of STIs, and outlines new approaches to improve the clinical management of STIs and public health.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^114eaXtD]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116dDgG9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of SEC vs placebo for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Importantly, SEC was superior to placebo in patients with trichomoniasis and vaginal symptoms and in those with HIV and/or BV. Although prior studies have shown trichomoniasis is asymptomatic in 70%–85% of cases, patients can present with symptoms including yellow-to-green frothy vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal odor, pruritus, irritation, and/or dysuria. Thus, single-dose SEC may be an effective option for symptomatic and asymptomatic trichomoniasis in women.

National guidelines have traditionally recommended a single, 2 g dose of oral MTZ or TDZ as the preferred treatment of trichomoniasis in women, with oral MTZ 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days as an alternative regimen. In 2010, results of a randomized, open-label trial of a single oral dose of MTZ 2 g vs the 7-day MTZ 500 mg BID regimen in women with HIV and trichomoniasis demonstrated microbiological cure rates of 83.2% vs 91.5%, 6–12 days after treatment. These results led to the CDC recommendation to use the multidose MTZ regimen for trichomoniasis in women with HIV. In 2018, similar results were reported from a randomized, open-label trial of single- vs multidose MTZ for trichomoniasis in women without HIV. Microbiological cure rates at TOC were 81.4% and 89.1% in the single- and multidose MTZ groups. Hence, the 2020 ACOG practice bulletin on vaginitis now recommends the multidose MTZ regimen as the preferred regimen for trichomoniasis in nonpregnant women. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are anticipated later this year.

Abstract

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of secnidazole vs placebo in women with trichomoniasis.

Methods

Women with trichomoniasis, confirmed by a positive T. vaginalis culture, were randomized to single-dose oral secnidazole 2 g or placebo. The primary endpoint was microbiological test of cure (TOC) by culture 6–12 days after dosing. At the TOC visit, participants were given the opposite treatment. They were followed for resolution of infection afterward and offered treatment at subsequent visits, if needed. Fifty patients per group (N = 100) provided approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups.

Results

Between April 2019 and March 2020, 147 women enrolled at 10 sites in the United States. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included 131 randomized patients (secnidazole, n = 64; placebo, n = 67). Cure rates were significantly higher in the secnidazole vs placebo group for the mITT population (92.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 82.7%–97.4%] vs 1.5% [95% CI:.0%–8.0%]) and for the per-protocol population (94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%–98.9%] vs 1.7% [95% CI:.0%–8.9%]). Cure rates were 100% (4/4) in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 95.2% (20/21) in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Secnidazole was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were vulvovaginal candidiasis and nausea (each 2.7%). No serious TEAEs were observed.

Conclusions

A single oral 2 g dose of secnidazole was associated with significantly higher microbiological cure rates vs placebo, supporting a role for secnidazole in treating women with trichomoniasis, including those with HIV and/or BV.

### Trichomoniasis: clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management [^115ySUBf]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis was originally considered a commensal organism until the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) began to evolve. Trichomoniasis has been associated with vaginitis, cervicitis, urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and adverse birth outcomes. Infection with T vaginalis could have an important role in transmission and acquisition of HIV. T vaginalis is site specific for the genitourinary tract and has been isolated from virtually all genitourinary structures. Asymptomatic disease is common in both men and women, thus screening for disease is important. Various sociodemographic factors have been correlated with presence of T vaginalis, and may be used to predict infection. Diagnosis is usually made from wet mount microscopy and direct visualisation, which are insensitive. DNA amplification techniques perform with good sensitivity, but are not yet approved for diagnostic purposes. In areas where diagnostic methods are limited, management of trichomoniasis is usually as part of a clinical syndrome; vaginal discharge for women and urethral discharge for men. A single dose of metronidazole is effective in the majority of cases. Outside of the United States, other nitroimidazoles may be used and are as effective as metronidazole. Metronidazole resistance is an emerging problem, but its clinical importance is not yet clear. Concomitant treatment of sexual partners is recommended.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections: a review [^113o3hG8]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 2018. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes.

Observations

From 2015 to 2019, the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis increased in the US; from 1999 to 2016, while the rates of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 declined. Populations with higher rates of STIs include people younger than 25 years, sexual and gender minorities such as men and transgender women who have sex with men, and racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx people. Approximately 70% of infections with HSV and trichomoniasis and 53% to 100% of extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are asymptomatic or associated with few symptoms. STIs are associated with HIV acquisition and transmission and are the leading cause of tubal factor infertility in women. Nucleic acid amplification tests have high sensitivities (86.1%-100%) and specificities (97.1%-100%) for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, M genitalium, trichomoniasis, and symptomatic HSV-1 and HSV-2. Serology remains the recommended method to diagnose syphilis, typically using sequential testing to detect treponemal and nontreponemal (antiphospholipid) antibodies. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles, such as metronidazole, are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, M genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral treatment options for gonorrhea and M genitalium. No cure is available for genital herpes. Effective STI prevention interventions include screening, contact tracing of sexual partners, and promoting effective barrier contraception.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had an STI in 2018. Rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in the US have increased, while rates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have declined. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral therapies for gonorrhea and Mycoplasma genitalium, and no cure is available for genital herpes.

Section 9. Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Preventive Services — recommendations for persons with HIV include providing persons with HIV who have STD symptoms or report recent sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis with access to presumptive STD treatment (while awaiting STD test results) through onsite treatment at a health care facility or immediate linkage to a health care facility that offers clinical evaluation and onsite presumptive STD treatment. Engaging nonclinical providers to inform sexually active persons with HIV that some STDs may increase the risk of HIV transmission and that screening for these STDs at least annually is beneficial, to offer recommended STD screening tests using venous blood specimens or provider-initiated self-collected specimens or refer clients to clinical settings that offer STD screening, and to promptly link persons with HIV who report symptoms of STD or sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to health care providers for clinical evaluation (including physical examination and diagnostic testing) and presumptive treatment with recommended injectable or oral antimicrobial drugs. Engaging health departments to integrate or routinely match STD and HIV surveillance data to identify populations or individuals with HIV with STD coinfection who may warrant being offered HIV and STD preventive services, including voluntary HIV partner services; presumptive treatment involves providing treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection or trichomoniasis before results of STD testing or clinical evaluation are available and is recommended for persons who report symptoms suggestive of these STDs or recent sex partners who were treated for these STDs, or have clinical signs of these STDs.

### Neglected parasitic infections in the United States: trichomoniasis [^115UA28j]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common human parasitic infections in the United States, as well as the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection. However, it has long received much less consideration than other parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases. Much of this inattention can be attributed to a poor understanding of the public health impact of trichomoniasis. Increasing recognition of the sequelae of infection, including increased risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and adverse outcomes of pregnancy, has led to increased interest in T. vaginalis. Recent innovations include development of diagnostic tests that could improve detection of the parasite. A number of important questions, such as the epidemiology among men and women, the true public health burden of symptomatic and asymptomatic T. vaginalis infections, and whether current treatments will be adequate to reduce the substantial health disparities and costs associated with trichomoniasis, need consideration to remedy neglect of this important disease.

Methods

Search strategy

We systematically searched Embase (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), Global Health (Ovid), PubMed, and African Index Medicus from 1 January 2000 to 17 September 2024 for studies assessing the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis in sub-Saharan Africa. Search term domains included relevant terms and synonyms for "sexually transmitted infections" and "sub-Saharan Africa" (Supplementary Table S1). We also searched citations from relevant published systematic reviews.,

Eligibility criteria and study selection

We included studies reporting sex-stratified empirical data on the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, or trichomoniasis among adults from the general population in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2024. We considered studies to represent the general population if they enrolled participants from antenatal care (ANC), family planning, or gynaecology clinics; primary healthcare or other outpatient services; educational institutions; or community venues (e.g. social spaces or places of worship); or recruited participants for HIV or STI prevention trials (baseline data only) or population-representative surveys. Studies were eligible regardless of participants' symptom status, though we excluded those that exclusively enrolled symptomatic individuals or individuals seeking treatment for STIs or infertility. We excluded studies with participants enrolled exclusively from populations living with HIV or key populations.

We included studies with participants aged 12 years or older who were tested using internationally recognised aetiologic diagnostic tests with urogenital specimens (urine, urethral, or cervicovaginal samples), and excluded studies that only collected pharyngeal or rectal samples. We also excluded case reports, commentaries, longitudinal and randomised controlled studies reporting only post-baseline outcomes, and studies with fewer than 15 participants. We used the UN M49 standard to define sub-Saharan Africa and its sub-regions (Supplementary Table S2).

Search results were managed and de-duplicated using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Researchers (DMR, EM, JM, JWI-E, JK, LH, MKW, OE, OS, QH, RLA, SK) independently double-screened title and abstract records for eligibility and assessed full text articles for inclusion. A third reviewer resolved discrepancies.

### Interventions for treating trichomoniasis in women [^112Rt95t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Around 120 million women worldwide suffer from Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis every year. The infection is sexually transmitted and is believed to facilitate HIV transmission.

Objectives

To assess the effects of various treatment strategies for trichomoniasis in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Trials were also identified from reference lists of reviews, through pharmaceutical companies, and by informal discovery. Only published data were used in this review. Date of the most recent search: November, 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of different treatment strategies in women with trichomoniasis. Different antitrichomonal drugs or doses were eligible, as were comparisons of treatment with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data extracted by two reviewers independently using standard criteria.

Main Results

Fifty-four trials were included. Nitroimidazole drugs seem to be effective in achieving parasitological cure in short term follow up. Partner treatment can be effective in decreasing longer term reinfection rates.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Parasitological cure can be achieved by single oral dose of nitroimidazole. Further research should focus on developing effective partner treatment strategies to prevent reinfections and reduce trichomoniasis prevalence.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116Xsz4f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, cure rates were 92%–100% in the overall population and in subgroups of women with genital symptoms, HIV, and/or BV. Previous research showed that trichomoniasis treatment significantly decreases HIV viral load and viral shedding and may reduce HIV transmission. Although only 4 patients had HIV, our finding that all were cured is reassuring, and larger clinical trials in this patient population are warranted to confirm these results. Moreover, coinfection of BV and T. vaginalis is common, with rates of 60%–80%. Thus, a single treatment for BV and trichomoniasis may have multiple benefits.

A potential limitation of this study was the use of T. vaginalis culture to achieve a shorter timeframe to TOC. Although InPouch may be less sensitive than NAAT, the accuracy in this study was high as supported by the low placebo responder rate (~1%). Other limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up and the exclusion of men and pregnant women. However, 2 non-US-based studies of SEC for trichomoniasis in patients, including a small subgroup of men, showed cure rates of 91.7%–100% at 2–20 days after treatment. Although our study did not include pregnant women, and data on the use of SEC during pregnancy are limited, reproductive preclinical toxicology studies have shown no evidence of toxicity, and SEC is not contraindicated during pregnancy. The CDC recommends that trichomoniasis treatment be considered for symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage. Finally, 5-nitroimidazole susceptibility testing was not performed on trichomonas isolates in the study; thus, we cannot comment on any resistance that potentially may have been present.

Study strengths include high cure rates for SEC (92%–95%), low placebo responder rates, minimal dropouts, a favorable TEAE profile, and treatment success in women with and without clinical symptoms, HIV, and/or BV.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a single dose of SEC 2 g was efficacious and well tolerated in women with trichomoniasis and in those with trichomoniasis and comorbid HIV and/or BV. If approved by the FDA for the treatment of trichomoniasis, SEC will be the only single oral-dose medication available for the treatment of BV and T. vaginalis. Future studies should be considered in pregnant women and those with persistent T. vaginalis infection, including the use of SEC multidose regimens.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1147KPGK]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The majority of persons who have trichomoniasis (70%–85%) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, and untreated infections might last from months to years. Men with trichomoniasis sometimes have symptoms of urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, and women with trichomoniasis sometimes have vaginal discharge, which can be diffuse, malodorous, or yellow-green with or without vulvar irritation, and might have a strawberry-appearing cervix, which is observed more often on colposcopy than on physical examination. Although many persons might be unaware of their infection, it is readily passed between sex partners during penile-vaginal sex or through transmission of infected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex with women.

Among persons who are sexually active, the best way to prevent genital trichomoniasis is through consistent and correct use of condoms (external or internal). Partners of men who have been circumcised might have a somewhat reduced risk for T. vaginalis infection. Douching is not recommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal infections, including trichomoniasis.

T. vaginalis causes reproductive morbidity and has been reported to be associated with a 1.4-times greater likelihood of preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and infants who are small for gestational age. T. vaginalis was also determined to be associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis. Another meta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but not statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and prostate cancer.

T. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for HIV acquisition and is associated with an increase in HIV vaginal shedding, which is reduced with T. vaginalis treatment among women without viral suppression. Among women with HIV infection, T. vaginalis infection is associated with increased risk for PID.

Partner Services

The term "partner services" refers to a continuum of clinical evaluation, counseling, diagnostic testing, and treatment designed to increase the number of infected persons brought to treatment and to reduce transmission among sexual networks. This continuum includes efforts of health departments, medical providers, and patients themselves. The term "public health partner services" refers to efforts by public health departments to identify the sex and needle-sharing partners of infected persons to ensure their medical evaluation and treatment. Health departments are increasingly incorporating referral to additional services, as indicated, into the partner services continuum. Aside from the general benefit to patients and partners, service referrals and linkage can mitigate the circumstances that increase risk for future STI and HIV acquisition.

The types and comprehensiveness of public health partner services and the specific STIs for which they are offered vary by public health agency, their resources, and the geographic prevalence of STIs. In most areas of the United States, health departments routinely attempt to provide partner services to all persons with infectious syphilis (primary or secondary) and persons with a new diagnosis of HIV infection. Health departments should provide partner services for persons who might have cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea. In contrast, relatively few U.S. health departments routinely provide STI partner services to persons with gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, or other STIs. Because STI diagnoses often can serve as risk markers for HIV acquisition, public health services might include follow-up of MSM with an STI to offer HIV PrEP. Public health services can also include HIV and STI prevention interventions including HIV and STI testing, linkage and relinkage of persons with HIV infection to HIV care clinics, and referral of partners of persons with STIs or HIV infection to HIV PrEP, as indicated. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with public health practices in their area; however, in most instances, providers should understand that responsibility for discussing the treatment of partners of persons with STIs rests with the diagnosing provider and the patient. State laws require a good faith effort by the provider to inform partners, and providers should familiarize themselves with public health laws.
