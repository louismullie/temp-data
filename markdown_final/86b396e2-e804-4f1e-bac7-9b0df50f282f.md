## Question

What is the duration of proning in ards

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, and how to apply that information in practical clinical settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence that established a survival benefit. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about daily session length and total treatment duration. Next, I will check for dose–response signals in meta-analyses and observational data. After that, I need to distinguish the evidence-based standard from the concept of "prolonged" proning beyond 24 hours, which is still investigational. Finally, I should integrate when to stop proning, how often to repeat sessions, and what to do in special populations like COVID-19 ARDS or those on ECMO, while double-checking for any nuances I might be missing.

> Let me first confirm the anchor trial. The PROSEVA randomized controlled trial in severe ARDS showed that prone sessions of at least 16 hours significantly reduced 28-day and 90-day mortality compared with supine positioning, and the intervention was continued daily until clinical improvement was sustained, typically involving about four sessions on average per patient, which establishes the pragmatic "at least 16 hours per session" standard [^111h6eKQ] [^114mLrPG].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline synthesis before I jump ahead. Major society guidelines align tightly with PROSEVA: the ESICM 2023 guideline recommends starting early after stabilization, using prolonged sessions of at least 16 consecutive hours for moderate-to-severe ARDS, and continuing daily until oxygenation and ventilator parameters improve. The ATS/ESICM/SCCM 2017 guideline recommends prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day in severe ARDS, which was retained in the 2024 ATS update, reflecting a strong recommendation with moderate-to-high confidence in the effect estimate [^114KHeYq] [^1175sHG9] [^114y1A28] [^1128FM7M].

> I should confirm the dose–response signal next. Meta-analyses show that sessions shorter than about 12 hours per day fail to show mortality benefit, whereas sessions of 12 hours or more, and particularly around 16 hours, demonstrate consistent reductions in mortality; a meta-regression suggested a trend linking longer daily durations with greater benefit, but definitive thresholds were not established beyond the pragmatic ≥ 16-hour standard adopted by guidelines [^111MLJDU] [^1128FM7M] [^113CwCam].

> Hold on, I should verify how "prolonged" proning is being used in the literature versus the evidence-based standard. "Prolonged" proning typically refers to continuous sessions of 24 hours or more, often 24–48 hours, sometimes up to 72–74 hours; while this strategy has been explored during COVID-19 surges for operational reasons and theoretical physiologic advantages, high-quality evidence does not currently support routine use of sessions beyond the standard 16–20 hours, and systematic reviews conclude that data are insufficient to endorse routine prolonged sessions outside trials [^114VkBGQ] [^116BRCYY] [^113inzod] [^112w156e].

> Let me consider when to stop and how many sessions to perform. The PROSEVA protocol stopped daily proning when the patient maintained adequate oxygenation supine with PEEP ≤ 10 cm H₂O and FiO₂ ≤ 0.6 for at least 4 hours, and patients generally underwent about four prone sessions; many trauma and critical care protocols echo this "stabilization target" approach, reinforcing that continuation without early oxygenation improvement is reasonable because benefits extend beyond gas exchange and relate to lung stress homogenization and VILI reduction [^114mLrPG] [^113fyqyS].

> I need to check timing of initiation and the severity threshold. The benefit is strongest when proning is started early after meeting criteria for moderate-to-severe ARDS, typically PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg on adequate PEEP and FiO₂, with PROSEVA enrolling within 36 hours of intubation and modern guidelines recommending initiation soon after stabilization; subgroup and individual patient data suggest the clearest mortality benefit in severe hypoxemia, including PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100 mm Hg, while some guidelines frame the recommendation around moderate-to-severe ARDS rather than a single rigid cutoff [^111h6eKQ] [^114KHeYq] [^1128FM7M].

> But wait, what about awake proning in nonintubated patients with COVID-19; does the duration differ here? For awake, nonintubated patients, optimal daily durations remain uncertain, with studies using a wide range and some suggesting benefit with longer sessions; randomized data are limited, and current guidance suggests using awake proning as an adjunct without a definitive "minimum effective dose", while avoiding delayed intubation in deteriorating patients [^112nKAex] [^116o4DZZ] [^111y1Zv8].

> I should double-check the ECMO context before concluding. On venovenous ECMO, a recent randomized trial found that prone positioning did not shorten time to successful weaning compared with supine, so routine prolonged proning on ECMO is not supported by high-certainty outcome data; observational series suggest physiologic improvements, but selection and confounding are major issues, so decisions should be individualized and research is ongoing [^116RMXFx] [^116NWb1s].

> Putting this together, the evidence-based standard is to use daily prone sessions of at least 16 consecutive hours for mechanically ventilated adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, initiated early after stabilization, and continued daily until sustained improvement in oxygenation and ventilator parameters is achieved, typically requiring about four sessions. Sessions shorter than 12 hours are unlikely to confer mortality benefit, and extending individual sessions beyond 24 hours remains investigational and should not be routine outside trials [^111h6eKQ] [^114KHeYq] [^1175sHG9] [^111MLJDU] [^112w156e].

---

The recommended duration of prone positioning in ARDS is **≥ 16 consecutive hours per session** [^114KHeYq] [^111h6eKQ], as this is the only strategy with proven mortality benefit in moderate-to-severe ARDS [^notfound]. Sessions are typically repeated daily until oxygenation improves and stabilizes with PEEP ≤ 10 cm H2O and FiO2 ≤ 0.6 for at least 4 hours supine [^113fyqyS] [^114mLrPG]. Prolonged sessions beyond 24 hours are not supported by current evidence and should not be routine outside trials [^112w156e] [^113inzod]. For awake proning, aim for as many hours as tolerated, with ≥ 8 hours/day associated with better outcomes [^116o4DZZ].

---

## Evidence supporting prolonged prone positioning

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate that **prolonged prone positioning** (≥ 16 hours/session) significantly reduces mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS [^111h6eKQ] [^1128FM7M]:

- **PROSEVA trial**: Early prolonged prone positioning (mean 17 hours/session) reduced 28-day mortality from 32.8% to 16.0% (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25–0.63) in severe ARDS [^111h6eKQ].

- **Meta-analyses**: Sessions > 12 hours/day reduce mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.99), with the clearest benefit in severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg) [^1128FM7M] [^111MLJDU].

- **Guidelines**: ESICM 2023 recommends ≥ 16 consecutive hours/session for moderate-to-severe ARDS [^114KHeYq].

---

## Recommended duration and frequency of prone positioning

Current guidelines and evidence support the following **practical approach**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration per session** | **Frequency** | **Total duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 150 mmHg) | ≥ 16 consecutive hours [^114KHeYq] | Daily until improvement | Typically 3–4 days [^1133pUV1] |
| Severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100 mmHg) | ≥ 16 consecutive hours [^114KHeYq] | Daily until improvement | 4–7 days or more |
| Awake proning (non-intubated) | ≥ 8 hours/day (as tolerated) [^116o4DZZ] | Intermittent | Variable |

---

Stopping criteria include sustained improvement in oxygenation (PaO₂/FiO₂ > 150 mmHg with PEEP ≤ 10 cm H₂O and FiO₂ ≤ 0.6 for ≥ 4 hours supine) [^113fyqyS] or **lack of improvement after 3–4 days** [^114mLrPG].

---

## Physiological rationale for prolonged prone positioning

Prolonged prone positioning improves outcomes via **several mechanisms**:

- **Improved oxygenation**: Reduces shunt and improves V/Q matching by recruiting dorsal lung [^111Tow2B].

- **Reduced VILI**: Homogenizes ventilation, lowers stress/strain, and decreases cyclic atelectasis [^1149xsjj].

- **Better compliance**: Improves respiratory system compliance and reduces plateau pressures [^113Yguo1].

---

## Risks and complications associated with prolonged prone positioning

Prolonged prone positioning carries **potential risks**, including:

- **Pressure injuries**: Frequent and severe, especially with repeated turns [^111hxAA4].

- **Airway complications**: Accidental extubation, tube displacement, and obstruction [^113CwCam].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Transient hypotension or desaturation during turns [^114scKZg].

- **Staff workload**: High demand for trained personnel and PPE [^114VkBGQ].

These risks can be mitigated by **trained teams, standardized protocols, and vigilant monitoring** [^113fyqyS].

---

## Comparison with shorter durations

Shorter sessions (< 12 hours) have not consistently reduced mortality and are **inferior to ≥ 16-hour sessions** for improving oxygenation and lung mechanics [^1128FM7M] [^112KpTYf]. Prolonged sessions beyond 24 hours lack robust evidence and are not recommended outside trials [^112w156e] [^113inzod].

---

## Special considerations

- **COVID-19 ARDS**: Prolonged sessions (24–48 hours) have been used operationally, but evidence is limited; standard ≥ 16-hour sessions remain guideline-based [^114VkBGQ] [^114KHeYq].

- **ECMO**: Prone positioning is feasible and may improve oxygenation, but optimal duration and timing remain uncertain [^116NWb1s] [^111fRpiz].

- **Obesity**: May require adjustments to minimize pressure injuries and ensure effective positioning [^notfound].

---

## Current research gaps and ongoing studies

Key uncertainties include the **optimal duration beyond 16 hours**, patient selection for prolonged sessions, and long-term functional outcomes. Ongoing trials are evaluating prolonged versus standard sessions and the role of proning on ECMO [^113AKqkC] [^116NWb1s].

---

The recommended duration of prone positioning in ARDS is **≥ 16 consecutive hours per session**, repeated daily until oxygenation improves and stabilizes. This approach is supported by robust evidence and international guidelines, balancing survival benefit against manageable risks.

The fact that the test of interaction yielded only a trend to different mean effect size of prone ventilation in the subgroup of ARDS patients when compared with studies that included all ALI is not surprising given that studies including ALI patients also enrolled a substantial proportion of patients with ARDS. Without specific studies enrolling only ALI non-ARDS patients, this type of effect comparison may be difficult. Apart from a type II statistical error, the nonsignificant test of interaction might also reflect a true lack of heterogeneity of prone ventilation effects. The use of confidence intervals is helpful to solve this uncertainty. The 95% CI actually represents the range within which the true treatment effect falls 95% of the time. In the subgroup of studies enrolling only ARDS patients, the CI around the point estimate suggests that the reduction of mortality by prone ventilation could not be less than 1%. Similarly, the CI boundaries for the effect of prone ventilation in ALI/ARDS studies do not exclude a reduction by 18% in the mortality in such patients.

Our cumulative meta-analysis shows that beneficial effects of prone ventilation have progressively become apparent as new studies have been published. This finding suggests that the gradual incorporation of research advances (protective lung ventilation, inclusion of homogeneous groups of severity, standardisation of length of proning, and so forth) influenced the trend toward an apparent benefit from prone positioning. This cumulative meta-analysis also shows that the size effect of prone ventilation on mortality has become almost constant since 2006 following the study by Mancebo and colleagues. Subsequent studies have merely contributed to improve precision of this effect as reflected by a progressive narrowing of the confidence interval. Increased precision rather than substantial alteration in size effect is probably what would be added by any new study on prone ventilation. Furthermore, such a study would be difficult to complete given inclusion barriers encountered by most of the recent RCTs. Meanwhile, the present aggregate meta-analysis and the recent individual patient data meta-analyses provide compelling evidence to recommend prone ventilation in ARDS patients.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113cqAuB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilatory strategy — higher versus lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with or without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) — we suggest using higher PEEP without LRMs rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ≥ 35 cm H2O for ≥ 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Compared with lower PEEP, higher PEEP without LRMs probably reduced mortality (n = 4 trials, 1,162 patients; RR, 0.77; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.60–0.96), improved oxygenation (MD PaO2/FiO2 ratio 63.7 mm Hg higher; 95% CrI, 51.5–75.9 mm Hg), and possibly increased ventilator-free days (MD, 1.3 more; 95% CI, 2.5 fewer to 4.3 more), while the impact on barotrauma was uncertain (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87–1.86). Compared with higher PEEP without LRMs, higher PEEP with prolonged LRMs probably increased mortality (RR, 1.37; 95% CrI, 1.04–1.81), whereas brief LRMs or esophageal pressure–guided PEEP titration may have no effect on mortality (RR, 1.07; 95% CrI, 0.79–1.48; and RR, 1.00; 95% CrI, 0.65–1.54). An individual patient meta-analysis including 2,299 patients reported higher PEEP probably improved survival in moderate to severe ARDS (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00; P = 0.049) but possibly increased mortality in mild ARDS (adjusted RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.91–1.83; P = 0.02). For patients with mild ARDS, there were insufficient data to make a recommendation on PEEP strategy, and there was a lack of consensus on brief LRMs and using esophageal pressures to set PEEP.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^112pco7w]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Our study used a different meta-analysis approach and stratified subgroups of studies according to the disease severity of included patients, rather than performing a subgroup analysis of included patients. This study reached the same conclusions as individual patient data meta-analyses, although our findings suggest that the benefits can go beyond the recommended threshold and concern all patients meeting ARDS criteria. A study-level meta-analysis like ours could therefore be an alternative for clinicians to detect true intervention effects (signals) despite differences among studies regarding participants, interventions, and co-interventions (noise). We should, however, recognise that such meta-analysis necessarily suffers some shortcomings - such as mixing in the same subgroup the early study by Gattinoni and colleagues, which included almost 93% ARDS patients, and that by Guerin and colleagues, which included only 30% of ARDS patients.

It is also difficult to control for important confounders such as the differences in prone duration, ventilation strategy, or associated treatments. Indeed, studies that included only ARDS patients also implemented lung-protective ventilation and longer prone duration, making it difficult to ascribe the observed reduction in ICU mortality to only one of these variables. Lung-protective ventilation has proved to lessen ventilation-induced lung injury and to reduce mortality, while longer prone duration helps to increase lung recruitment and enhances gas exchange. Following Gattinoni and colleagues, however, we should admit that a strong physiological rationale underlies the fact that only the most severe forms of ALI (namely patients with ARDS) have physiological conditions for proning efficacy and might derive clinical benefit from prone ventilation. Patients with ARDS indeed have a higher percentage of potentially recruitable lung, greater amounts of lung oedema, and a small portion of aerated lung. Our working hypothesis prompting stratification of included studies according to the severity of acute lung injury (ARDS studies versus ALI/ARDS studies) therefore seems the most likely to account for the observed reduction in mortality in the ARDS subgroup.

Conclusions

The evidence base for supportive modalities for ARDS continues to evolve. As part of this guideline, we provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. Implementation of these recommendations should take into account individual patient and illness characteristics. These guidelines update and build on those developed in 2017 and will be revisited as new information is available.

The ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee reviewed the guideline and determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable for performance measure development. However, two recommendations that remain in place from the 2017 guidelines are suitable for performance measure development: 1) the use of mechanical ventilation strategies that limit tidal volume (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H 2 O) in patients with ARDS and 2) prone positioning for > 12 hours per day in patients with severe ARDS.

Effects on mortality

Pooling all studies was associated with a nonsignificant 9% reduction in ICU mortality (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.1; P = 0.39; I² = 0%). Cumulative meta-analysis, which sorts studies chronologically, shows a progressive shift of the pooled summary effect of prone ventilation from a negative to a positive effect starting with the publication by Mancebo and colleagues, which was the first RCT to include ARDS patients only (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Cumulative meta-analysis of prone ventilation on intensive care unit mortality. The first row shows the effect based on one study, the second row shows the cumulative effects based on two studies, and so on. CI, confidence interval.

As anticipated, the effects of prone positioning were different in both subgroups considered according to disease severity (Figure 3). Proning had no significant effect in the earlier studies (three studies, n = 1,135 patients) that included patients with variable disease severity - that is, all ALI or hypoxemic patients (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.34; P = 0.7; I² = 0%) - while it significantly reduced the ICU mortality rate in the four most recent studies (n = 540 patients) that included only patients with ARDS (OR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.5 to 0.99; P = 0.048; number needed to treat = 11; I² = 0%). The z test of interaction was not significant (z = 1.87; P = 0.06), indicating that a heterogeneity of treatment effects between both subgroups was not certain. Funnel plot inspection did not suggest publication bias, and Begg's rank correlation test was not statistically significant (P = 0.23).

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^11474qSG]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU recommendations — mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies are as follows: For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy over a lower PEEP strategy, and clinicians should monitor for barotrauma if using higher PEEP (i.e. PEEP > 10 cm H2O). For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we suggest using a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy. For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours over no prone ventilation. For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest using as-needed intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) over continuous NMBA infusion to facilitate protective lung ventilation, and in the event of persistent ventilator dyssynchrony or the need for ongoing deep sedation, prone ventilation, or persistently high plateau pressures, we suggest using a continuous NMBA infusion for up to 48 hours. In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 ARDS, we recommend against the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide, whereas in those with severe ARDS and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation and other rescue strategies, we suggest a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator as a rescue therapy and, if no rapid improvement in oxygenation is observed, the treatment should be tapered off. For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, we suggest using recruitment maneuvers over not using recruitment maneuvers, but if recruitment maneuvers are used, we recommend against using staircase (incremental PEEP) recruitment maneuvers. In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, use of rescue therapies, and proning, we suggest using venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), if available, or referring the patient to an ECMO center, noting the remark that because of the resource-intensive nature of ECMO and the need for experienced centers, healthcare professionals, and infrastructure, ECMO should be considered only for carefully selected patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^115hWW8K]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

We based our analysis on the eight trials selected in the previous 2017 guidelines since no further trials on this topic have been conducted since. However, we excluded the 2004 trial that was not restricted to ARDS. Meta-analysis was conducted for the outcome of short-term mortality, defined as either at 28 days or in the ICU, and separately for 90-days mortality.

Relevant clinical heterogeneity was found among the studies in terms of modality of ventilation, dose of daily prone ventilation, patient selection, and timing of application of prone positioning.

Short-term mortality did not differ between prone and supine position (RR 0.79 95% CI [0.61–1.03]). In the subgroup of the first five trials, the short-term mortality did not differ between supine and prone positioning (0.91 [0.77–1.08]). However, the short-term mortality was significantly lower in the prone positioning group of the PROSEVA trial (0.49 [0.35–0.69]), with a statistically significant interaction test (supplement materials).

Longer-term mortality did not differ between prone and supine position (0.81 [0.64–1.02]). In the subgroup of the first five trials the longer-term mortality did not differ (0.93 [0.79–1.09]). 90-days mortality was significantly improved by proning in the PROSEVA trial (0.58 [0.44–0.76]) (p < 0.01). In this case as well the interaction test turned out to be statistically significant. The unique findings of the PROSEVA trial were further highlighted by a cumulative meta-analysis that investigated the results of meta-analyses carried over time (Supplementary Materials). Further, the analysis of heterogeneity performed using the double-p plot approach, identified the PROSEVA trial as a clear outlier.

Our primary analysis was thus based on the individual evaluation of findings from the PROSEVA trial. The secondary analysis included, instead, all the trials.

Expert opinion on clinical application

The overall risk–benefit balance favors prone position used according to the PROSEVA trial criteria, particularly given that its application is feasible in most ICUs with adequately skilled and staffed caregivers when paying careful attention to the risk of pressure-related skin complications.

Figure 3
Unresolved bedside questions regarding ventilator support.

A recent bright spot in trials of ventilation strategy was the demonstration that prone positioning could help very severely ill patients early in the course of illness when recruitability was presumably higher. As the Prone Positioning in Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PROSEVA) study by Guérin and colleagues nicely demonstrated, prone positioning sustained for 12 hours or more early in the course may help those who are severely affected and who have high PEEP requirements in the supine orientation. Glimmerings of the same positive effect for the early/severe cohort were seen in the first large Italian trial testing this same question, which also suggested the caution that some patients who are neither severely ill nor recruitable may not receive benefit but actually may be harmed by the proning intervention.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin definition [^115CVfds]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined in 1994 by the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC); since then, issues regarding the reliability and validity of this definition have emerged. Using a consensus process, a panel of experts convened in 2011 (an initiative of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) developed the Berlin Definition, focusing on feasibility, reliability, validity, and objective evaluation of its performance. A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance (≤ 40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (≥ 10 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per minute (≥ 10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27%; 95% CI, 24%-30%; 32%; 95% CI, 29%-34%; and 45%; 95% CI, 42%-48%, respectively; P < .001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2–11; 7 days; IQR, 4–14; and 9 days; IQR, 5–17, respectively; P < .001). Compared with the AECC definition, the final Berlin Definition had better predictive validity for mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.577 (95% CI, 0.561–0.593) vs 0.536 (95% CI, 0.520–0.553; P < .001). This updated and revised Berlin Definition for ARDS addresses a number of the limitations of the AECC definition. The approach of combining consensus discussions with empirical evaluation may serve as a model to create more accurate, evidence-based, critical illness syndrome definitions and to better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning.

### Early prolonged prone position in noninvasively ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2-related moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure: clinical outcomes and mechanisms for treatment response in the PRO-NIV study [^117D9eJs]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most frequent life-threatening complication of severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. Despite ongoing pharmacological trials, the treatment of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and moderate-to-severe respiratory failure remains supportive, with up to 60% of these patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and suffering from a mortality ranging 40–81%. Hence, noninvasive strategies reducing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in this category of COVID-19 patients are eagerly awaited.

Prone positioning (PP) therapy is a non-pharmacological treatment which ameliorates oxygenation through several mechanisms, including improved ventilation/perfusion matching, relief of the compression of dependent lung regions from mediastinum's weight, and change in chest wall elastance. Furthermore, PP showed benefits independently of its effects on gas exchange.

Prolonged PP is currently recommended for invasively ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in whom it reduced 28-day mortality, but its role in awake patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure is unknown. In small case series and observational studies. PP for short periods of time (i.e. < 3 h/day) improved oxygenation in awake patients with acute respiratory failure of varying severity due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but the durability of this effect after resupination was inconstant, and there was no evidence for a clinical benefit on hard outcomes.

Two trials found either a reduced intubation rate or no benefits from awake PP of varying duration in COVID-19 patients with a wide range of respiratory failure severity treated with high flow nasal cannula. In those trials, patients treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) had no clinical benefits from awake PP. Hence, the utility of proning noninvasively ventilated COVID-19 patients, who are at greatest risk of adverse outcomes, remains uncertain.

Results

Study selection

The systematic search identified 19,986 records. After removing 4,774 duplicates, 15,212 records remained for title and abstract screening, of which 15,184 were excluded based on predefined eligibility criteria. Full texts of 28 articles were assessed, leading to the exclusion of:

16 studies that did not compare prolonged (≥ 24 h) with standard (< 24 h) prone positioning.
Two studies without definitive prone session duration.
One study that was a case series with < 5 cases per arm.

A detailed summary of the characteristics of the excluded studies is provided in Table S1.

Following full-text screening, 9 studies were included in the synthesis (Table 1). The study selection process is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Nine studies met the inclusion criteria: three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six non-randomized studies, two of which adjusted for baseline confounding. Eight studies focused exclusively on COVID-19–related ARDS, while one did not specify the ARDS etiology. Across studies, mean participant age ranged from 48 to 68 years. The baseline PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio varied between 76 and 159; in four studies it was < 100, indicating more severe hypoxemia. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 28–35 in all but one study, which did not report BMI.

Prone positioning duration in intervention groups varied markedly: ~24 h in two RCTs, 34 h in one study, 40–48 h in five studies, and a median of 74 h in one study. In control groups, durations averaged 15–20 h.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112P29t6]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The understanding of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has evolved greatly since it was first described in a 1967 case series, with several subsequent updates to the definition of the syndrome. Basic science advances and clinical trials have provided insight into the mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS and led to reduced mortality through comprehensive critical care interventions. This review summarizes the current understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of ARDS. Key highlights include a recommended new global definition of ARDS and updated guidelines for managing ARDS on a backbone of established interventions such as low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a conservative fluid strategy. Future priorities for investigation of ARDS are also highlighted.

### Standards and stereotypes in COVID-19 [^113aTTGy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

A recent series in the Journal by Ziehr and colleagues details their institutional experience with 66 mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the ICU. Acknowledging differences in outcome definitions and length of follow up, the strikingly low mortality rate of 16.7% reported by these authors still stands in stark contrast to data for such patients from around the world, so much so that this mortality figure resembles survival figures from other sites. This number is also at odds with personal frontline observations, all of which make it challenging to assimilate the study's implications: patients with COVID-19 are no different from a typical population with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and, if managed with conventionally accepted ARDS ventilator strategies alone, a mortality rate under 17% is within reach. A closer look at certain features of the study invites skepticism:

1. A total of 21/66 (34%) patients were treated with statins prior to hospital presentation, but that number ballooned to 54/66 (82%) during the study course. Though mechanistic plausibility exists and patients newly started on a statin may have been clinical trial participants, one is left wondering about a "standard" approach to ARDS management that includes a therapy shown to have no benefit in two major randomized clinical trials.
2. Informative is a juxtaposition of this patient sample with that of the PROSEVA (Proning Severe ARDS Patients) trial, results of which have been widely applied to the care of patients with lung disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the assumption of a common pathobiology and therefore response to interventions. Fewer than half (47%) of patients underwent prone positioning in Ziehr and colleagues, and the median time for this intervention was Day 3. Despite this rate and timing of proning, Figure 1 of Reference 1 demonstrates that the initial median Pa O2 :F O2 ratio of 182 for the entire cohort on Day 1 was already up to a median of approximately 250 by Day 2, a time by which only the first quartile of the eventually proned patients had even begun proning as indicated by the interquartile range of 2–5. In contrast, after the first day, the proning arm of the PROSEVA trial — all of which was proned — exhibited a barely detectable improvement in Pa O2 :F O2 ratio measured in the supine position (Table S2 of Reference 8). Such "unARDS-like" clinical behavior casts a shadow over the conclusions of the study by Ziehr and colleagues.
3. The authors report a tracheostomy rate of 21.2%. This figure far exceeds ARDS tracheostomy rates in a global sample (13%) and in the supine group of the PROSEVA trial (5.2%), study populations that are both characterized by greater ARDS severity than the cohort of Ziehr and colleagues. Tracheostomy has been shown to improve short-term but not long-term survival in patients with ARDS.
4. The authors registered an ICU discharge rate of 75.8%, a result that is discordant with other reports and enthusiasm about which warrants caution. A common frontline observation is that patients with COVID-19 are highly susceptible to complicated hospital courses following initial ICU discharge, punctuated by returns to the ICU and a remarkable propensity for sudden death. Data about this aspect of critical illness in COVID-19 are lacking, but the ICU discharge rate reported by Ziehr and colleagues risks conveying a prematurely optimistic message.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^117U8fy6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicated that glucocorticoid treatment might reduce overall mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

Domain 7: Prone positioning

Question 7.1: In intubated patients with ARDS, does prone position compared to supine position reduce mortality?

Background

Prone position was proposed for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS in the 1970s. Physiological benefits include improvement of oxygenation, better homogenization of lung stress, and decreased right ventricular strain. Over the years, several trials were conducted comparing prone to supine position, with improved designs on the basis of the critical analysis of previous ones. Thus, progressively more hypoxemic patients were selected, the duration of prone ventilation cycles increased, and protective ventilation was combined with pronation. In 2013, the PROSEVA trial demonstrated a clear protective effect of prone ventilation in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. In 2017, the ESICM and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) provided recommendations for the use of prone ventilation in ARDS based on both aggregated and individual patient data meta-analysis that included the largest four trials. In the aggregated data meta-analysis, the overall result was non-significant; however, in studies that used duration of proning longer than twelve hours or included patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 200 mmHg, a statistically significant mortality reduction was found. The individual patient meta-analysis identified a survival benefit in patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 100 mmHg. However, this subgroup analysis did not allow any definitive conclusion since the benefits of randomization are not maintained in subgroups (and only one study stratified patients according to the degree of hypoxemia). In general, subgroup analyses in meta-analysis have an exploratory nature, and results should be interpreted cautiously. There were no RCTs identified specifically addressing proning of mechanically ventilated patients in COVID-19.

### Efficacy of proning in acute respiratory distress syndrome on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^115sBjZp]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient Selection and Proning

Patients on ECMO for ARDS were evaluated for proning by the critical care physician and a cardiothoracic surgeon. Criteria for proning while on ECMO were clinically based on little to no improvement in ECMO requirements after 10 days, with no defined compliance cutoff or ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio threshold used. The time point of 10 days was used, as it was the observed median duration of ECMO during the pandemic. Retrospective data show the median was 11 days for the entire cohort. The decision to prone was determined by the inability to wean sweep requirement, inability to decrease ECMO flows, decrease in compliance on the ventilator, and improvement on radiographs of the chest. Body mass index, chest tubes, and difficult airway were not considered in the selection criteria. There were no exclusion criteria. In summary, patients were considered for proning if they fell into one of the following cohorts: (1) patients had increased sweep requirement, and worsening compliance; and (2) patients had no clinical improvement after 2 weeks, determined by inability to decrease sweep, decreased ECMO flow, continued low compliance, or no improvement on serial radiographs of the chest. For patients with prolonged ECMO courses, multiple episodes of proning were used when the aforementioned criteria were met.

A team consisting of an anesthesiologist, intensive care, advanced care practitioner, bedside nurse, perfusionist, and respiratory therapist was present when patients were proned or placed supine. Patients were manually proned or supinated, and no proning beds were used. ECMO cannulas were secured to the skin with multiple silk sutures along the length of the cannula. The internal jugular (IJ) cannula was also secured with a Velcro headband, and all ECMO cannula connections were reinforced with plastic zip ties. Tracheostomy tubes were secured with a foam and Velcro tracheostomy collar, and tracheostomy tubes were not routinely sutured. Chest drains (if present) were secured with silk sutures and occlusive dressings.

In patients with an endotracheal tube, the head was rotated to the side, facing the ventilator to allow for the tube to exit without kinking. In patients with a tracheostomy, the head and chest were supported in the prone position with pillows to allow for a neutral neck position with no pressure on the tracheostomy tube or appliance. All patients were paralyzed during the time of turning the patient prone or supine. Patients were kept prone between 12 and 18 hours.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^116CV7wg]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current meta-analysis shows that global analysis of RCTs assessing ventilation in the prone position in ALI/ARDS patients does not show a significant benefit on ICU mortality. The subgroup analysis stratified on the type of included patients in primary studies, however, disclosed a statistically significant reduction in mortality in the studies that restricted inclusion to only patients with ARDS, and not in those also enrolling patients with less disease severity. The comparison of the mean effect size between subgroups was close to significance (P = 0.06), however, which does not allow one to ensure that the effects of proning were significantly different between subgroups. Another confounder may also be the daily duration of ventilation in the prone position (P = 0.06). Prone positioning was not associated with an increase in major airway complications. The current study-level meta-analysis confirms and reinforces recent findings of individual patient data meta-analyses made by Sud and colleagues and Gattinoni and colleagues.

In many meta-analyses, the inclusion criteria are so broad that a certain amount of diversity among studies is inevitable. A study-level meta-analysis should anticipate this diversity and interpret the findings according to the results dispersion across the primary studies. We therefore applied the random-effects model, and computed a summary effect in subgroups of studies enrolling patients of variable lung injury severity, yielding important information on the peculiar effects of prone ventilation in the most severe patients.

A way to fully account for the ecological bias inherent to diversity of designs in primary studies is the performance of a meta-analysis using individual patient data. Indeed, previous inferences on prone ventilation benefits for the most severe hypoxemic patients were recently confirmed by the meta-analyses from Sud and colleagues and from Gattinoni and colleagues showing reduced mortality rate in patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 100 mmHg. This threshold was considered prospectively only in the study by Taccone and colleagues, however, while separation on this threshold basis was mostly retrospective for the other trials. Owing to increased risks of untoward effects, the authors recommended considering prone ventilation only in the most severe hypoxemia (despite a significant benefit up to PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio = 140 mmHg).

Uncertainties and research priorities

There are several unanswered questions about NMBAs in ARDS. Although their presumed mechanism of action is through the reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing ventilator dyssynchrony, it remains unknown whether NMBAs might also be of benefit in sedated patients who are already fully passively ventilated. It is also unclear if there is a dose–response relationship across the spectrum of passive breathing to strong or dyssynchronous efforts. Some level of spontaneous breathing may be important to prevent diaphragmatic atrophy, whereas too much respiratory effort may cause lung and diaphragm injury; accordingly, NMBAs may have a variable impact on patients. Further research efforts should also focus on answering questions about NMBA agent selection, as well as the impact of the timing of initiation (i.e. early vs. late, immediately after meeting criteria vs. after a period of stabilization), dosing (i.e. partial blockade vs. full blockade, intermittent vs. continuous dosing), and duration. Finally, longitudinal data are needed to understand the impact of NMBAs on long-term outcomes.

Question 4: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Higher Compared with Lower PEEP, with or without LRMs?

Recommendation

We suggest using higher PEEP without LRMs rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ⩾35 cm H 2 O for > 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Background

Higher PEEP can facilitate alveolar recruitment and prevent cyclic opening/closing injury, which may in turn improve gas exchange by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting and reduce lung stress. However, PEEP can also cause injurious overdistension in aerated lung and hemodynamic compromise via increased right ventricular afterload and decreased venous return. The net balance of benefit to harm is reliant on the proportion of recruitment to overdistension in an individual patient. The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline previously issued conditional recommendations suggesting higher versus lower PEEP and the use of LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Since that time, several large RCTs evaluating various PEEP strategies have been published. Some have included cointerventions of prolonged LRMs, defined as incremental increases in PEEP to achieve airway pressures ⩾35 cm H 2 O for ⩾60 seconds. Thus, it was important to incorporate these most recent studies into an updated recommendation.

### Extended prone positioning duration for COVID-19-related ARDS: benefits and detriments [^117CNczS]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A strategy based on extending duration of proning sessions up to 48 h in patients ventilated for COVID-19-related ARDS, originally implemented for organizational and human resources purposes, did not seem to increase the risk of pressure injuries compared with PP sessions of shorter duration in non-COVID-19-related ARDS. It significantly reduced staff workload and viral exposure and was associated with further improvements in oxygenation and ventilatory parameters during the prone sessions.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^114KHeYq]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend to start prone position in patients with ARDS receiving invasive mechanical ventilation early after intubation, after a period of stabilization during which low tidal volume is applied and PEEP adjusted and at the end of which the PaO2/FiO2 remains < 150 mmHg. Maintain prone positioning for prolonged sessions (≥ 16 consecutive hours) to reduce mortality.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

### Adaptation and uncertainty: a qualitative examination of provider experiences with prone positioning for intubated patients with COVID-19 ARDS [^113Z5ahD]. CHEST Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning was widely adopted for use in patients with ARDS from COVID-19. However, proning was also delivered in ways that differed from historical evidence and practice. In implementation research, these changes are referred to as adaptations, and they occur constantly as evidence-based interventions are used in real-world practice. Adaptations can alter the delivered intervention, impacting patient and implementation outcomes.

Research Question

How have clinicians adapted prone positioning to COVID-19 ARDS, and what uncertainties remain regarding optimal proning use?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with ICU clinicians from two hospitals in Baltimore, MD, from February to July 2021. We interviewed physicians (MDs), registered nurses (RNs), respiratory therapists (RTs), advanced practice providers (APPs), and physical therapists (PTs) involved with proning mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS. We used thematic analysis of interviews to classify proning adaptations and clinician uncertainties about best practice for prone positioning.

Results

Forty ICU clinicians (12 MDs, 4 APPs, 12 RNs, 7 RTs, and 5 PTs) were interviewed. Clinicians described several adaptations to the practice of prone positioning, including earlier proning initiation, extended duration of proning sessions, and less use of concomitant neuromuscular blockade. Clinicians expressed uncertainty regarding the optimal timing of initiation and duration of prone positioning. This uncertainty was viewed as a driver of practice variation. Although prescribers intended to use less deep sedation and paralysis in proned patients compared with historical evidence and practice, this raised concerns regarding patient comfort and safety amongst RNs and RTs.

Interpretation

Prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 ARDS has been adapted from historically described practice. Understanding the impact of these adaptations on patient and implementation outcomes and addressing clinician uncertainties are priority areas for future research to optimize the use of prone positioning.

### Adaptation and uncertainty: a qualitative examination of provider experiences with prone positioning for intubated patients with COVID-19 ARDS [^116FCocv]. CHEST Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 44 ICU clinicians who responded to initial recruitment efforts, we conducted interviews with 40 participants between February and July of 2021. Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. Interview length was a median of 24 min (range, 12–44). MDs, APPs, and RNs were primarily working in three medical ICUs (ranging from 12- to 24-bed units), and RTs and PTs worked in multiple ICUs in both hospitals. The census of patients with COVID-19 varied as COVID-19 surges waxed and waned. All participants were recruited from ICUs that were exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 care at points during the pandemic.

Consistent with quantitative COVID-19 studies, participants noted that prone positioning for COVID-19 ARDS differed from the intervention described by the landmark randomized controlled trial Proning Severe ARDS Patients:

(APP03): If you look at the [Proning Severe ARDS Patients] trial, it's much different than what our practice is now…

Adaptations to proning described by our study participants are outlined, along with supporting quotations, in Table 2. Prone positioning was initiated very early during ARDS and mechanical ventilation, and prone positioning sessions were extended beyond durations outlined in historical evidence and practice.

(RT07): "At the beginning of COVID, we really had a strict 16 hours [prone], 4 hours [supine].… Going further into it, we realized that 16 hours wasn't enough time… So I liked when they [patients] were proned longer because I started seeing benefit".

Clinicians reported variable motivations behind the adaptation of extending proning sessions, suggesting an informal adaptation process. A local guideline did recommend proning patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS for 18- to 24-hour sessions but did not delineate the much more extended sessions that some of our participants described and that we demonstrated in prior quantitative work. Although some clinicians noted that extended proning sessions were related to concerns about supinating severely hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 ARDS, others referenced this strategy as specifically related to their understanding of the physiology.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^116pmt7G]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

ICU mortality was analysed by means of a random-effects model (assuming that the true effect could vary from trial to trial) to compute individual odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a pooled summary effect estimate was calculated. Since a clear change of primary study design has progressively occurred along with incorporation in everyday practice of new evidence generated by research, we evaluated the impact of publication date on the overall effect of prone ventilation by a cumulative meta-analysis. Indeed, this type of presentation roughly evaluates the trend over time for the overall effect of an intervention as new studies are published. We also compared the effect size of prone ventilation in two subgroups of studies: those that included all ALI patients, and those that included the most severe patients (ARDS patients). Noteworthy, this separation allows also comparison of earlier (before 2006) versus recent studies (after 2005), and studies that applied longer prone duration (≥ 17 hours/day) versus studies applying shorter prone duration.

Statistical interaction (heterogeneity effect) was sought by comparing the mean effect size for the two subgroups using the z test. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot and the Begg and Mazmudar rank correlation test. A relationship between study results (the effect size) and daily prone duration was sought with meta-regression. The incidence of complications related to prone positioning was also compared by means of a random-effects model. We analysed the incidence of major airways events corresponding to accidental extubation, and tracheal tube displacement with or without selective intubation. Statistical significance was set at the two-tailed 0.05 level for hypothesis testing and 0.10 for heterogeneity testing. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 measure. The meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta Analysis v2 (Biostat, Eaglewood, NJ, USA). The present study was performed in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines (Additional file 1) and the review protocol has not been previously registered.

### PEEP titration during prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116B8UvJ]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Existing clinical trial data on proning may not be generalizable to patients receiving high PEEP. Current evidence supports the routine use of either proning or high PEEP in moderate-severe ARDS. A prudent approach may be to tailor the choice of strategy to individual patient safety factors, relative contraindications, and staff training/experience. Although concomitant use of proning and high PEEP has never been studied in a clinical trial with patient-centered endpoints, effects may be synergistic. Future clinical trials are needed to compare efficacy and safety of proning, high-PEEP, and both in combination for moderate-severe ARDS.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^116kDUKW]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of respiratory failure that affects approximately 200 000 patients each year in the United States, resulting in nearly 75 000 deaths annually. Globally, ARDS accounts for 10% of intensive care unit admissions, representing more than 3 million patients with ARDS annually.

Objective

To review advances in diagnosis and treatment of ARDS over the last 5 years.

Evidence Review

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2012 to 2017 focusing on randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines. Articles were identified for full text review with manual review of bibliographies generating additional references.

Findings

After screening 1662 citations, 31 articles detailing major advances in the diagnosis or treatment of ARDS were selected. The Berlin definition proposed 3 categories of ARDS based on the severity of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg < Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 100 mm Hg), along with explicit criteria related to timing of the syndrome's onset, origin of edema, and the chest radiograph findings. The Berlin definition has significantly greater predictive validity for mortality than the prior American-European Consensus Conference definition. Clinician interpretation of the origin of edema and chest radiograph criteria may be less reliable in making a diagnosis of ARDS. The cornerstone of management remains mechanical ventilation, with a goal to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Aspirin was not effective in preventing ARDS in patients at high-risk for the syndrome. Adjunctive interventions to further minimize VILI, such as prone positioning in patients with a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, were associated with a significant mortality benefit whereas others (eg, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal) remain experimental. Pharmacologic therapies such as β2 agonists, statins, and keratinocyte growth factor, which targeted pathophysiologic alterations in ARDS, were not beneficial and demonstrated possible harm. Recent guidelines on mechanical ventilation in ARDS provide evidence-based recommendations related to 6 interventions, including low tidal volume and inspiratory pressure ventilation, prone positioning, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, higher vs lower positive end-expiratory pressure, lung recruitment maneuvers, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Conclusions and Relevance

The Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome addressed limitations of the American-European Consensus Conference definition, but poor reliability of some criteria may contribute to underrecognition by clinicians. No pharmacologic treatments aimed at the underlying pathology have been shown to be effective, and management remains supportive with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Guidelines on mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome can assist clinicians in delivering evidence-based interventions that may lead to improved outcomes.

### The clinical effect of an early, protocolized approach to mechanical ventilation for severe and refractory hypoxemia [^11446sbV]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

ARDS remains a source of significant morbidity and mortality in the critically ill patient. The mainstay of therapy entails invasive mechanical ventilation utilizing a lung-protective strategy designed to limit lung injury associated with excessive stress and strain while the underlying etiology of respiratory failure is identified and treated. Less is understood about what to do once conventional ventilation parameters have been optimized but the patient's respiratory status remains unchanged or worsens. In 2015, a protocolized, stepwise approach to mechanical ventilation with partially automated and clearly defined thresholds for management changes was implemented at our institution. We hypothesized that, by identifying appropriate patients earlier, time-to-escalation and rescue therapy implementation would be shortened.

Methods

Subjects with severe ARDS, treated with prone positioning based on our institution's protocolized approach from December 2013 to August 2016 were included. Their baseline characteristics, severity of illness scores, and mechanical ventilation parameters were collected and analyzed.

Results

Baseline characteristics, tidal volumes, P aO2 / F IO2, duration of ventilation after proning, and mortality were similar in both groups. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) PEEP at the time of proning was higher after the protocol implementation (12.5 cm H 2 O [IQR 6.5–19.4] vs 18 cm H 2 O [IQR 10–22], P = 0.386), and mean (IQR) respiratory system driving pressure was lower (16 cm H 2 O [IQR 13–36.2] vs 12 cm H 2 O [IQR 9–19.6], P = 0.029). Median (IQR) time from refractory hypoxemia identification to proning was shorter after protocol implementation (42.2 h [IQR 6.83–347.2] vs 16.3 h [IQR 1–99.7], I = .02), and P aO2 / F IO2 at 1 h after proning was higher. ICU and hospital LOS were shorter after the protocol implementation.

Conclusions

Following the implementation of an early, evidence-based, protocolized approach to optimizing mechanical ventilation, subjects with true refractory hypoxemia were identified earlier and time to proning was significantly shorter. Despite improvement in the evaluation and management of refractory hypoxemia as well as time to initiation of prone positioning, mortality was unchanged and there was variation in the duration of the position.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — retained recommendations from the 2017 guideline include core ventilation targets and adjuncts: We recommend using mechanical ventilation strategies that limit tidal volume (4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) in patients with ARDS; we recommend prone positioning for > 12 hours per day in patients with severe ARDS; and we recommend against the routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in patients with moderate or severe ARDS.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

Unresolved questions and research gaps

It is unlikely that a trial comparing prone to supine will be conducted in moderate-severe COVID-related ARDS given the lack of equipoise in the field at present. A trial is ongoing in France in adult intubated patients with mild to moderate ARDS (NCT05056090).

Question 7.2: In patients with moderate-severe ARDS, when should prone positioning be started to reduce mortality?

Background

No specific trial was designed to explore the role of predetermined criteria in the decision to start prone position. Therefore, the evidence used for this question is the same as that for previous the question.

Expert opinion on clinical application

The current recommendation is based on the evidence obtained from one trial (PROSEVA). The stabilization period before proning should take into account the time to optimize the ventilator settings and hemodynamics. Continuing prone position even if there is no significant initial improvement in oxygenation is based on the potential of prone position to protect the lung by homogenization of lung stress and potentially improving trajectory of recovery.

Unresolved questions and research gaps

There is no trial comparing different durations of prone position and no trial testing strategies other than oxygenation to determine when to cease proning sessions. The difference in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio between prone and subsequent supine position could be used to guide when to cease prone position. Moreover, using respiratory mechanics, e.g. keeping driving pressure within safe ranges, in addition to oxygenation and/or markers of dead-space ventilation, may be taken into account in the decision to stop the sessions. The effect of prolonged sessions of proning in patients showing minimal improvement in gas exchange should be further evaluated.

Question 7.3: In non intubated patients with AHRF, does awake prone positioning (APP) as compared to supine positioning reduce intubation or mortality?

Background

During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with the spread of non-invasive respiratory support strategies in the wards and ICUs, so-called "awake proning" in non-mechanically ventilated patients was often performed and became the focus of several clinical trials. Indeed, all the high-quality evidence from RCTs derived from studies enrolling only COVID-19 patients.

### Physiological response to prone positioning in intubated adults with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective study [^115g3kXy]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is still causing thousands of deaths worldwide. Between 5 and 34% of hospitalized patients develop severe disease and are admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most of these patients fulfill the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a high mortality rate. Prone positioning demonstrated physiological and survival benefits in moderate to severe ARDS non related to COVID-19 and is recommended by the current international guidelines as part of ARDS management. The prone position improves oxygenation by promoting dorsal recruitment, allowing for a more homogeneous ventilation distribution, and improving ventilation/perfusion matching. It may also reduce lung stress and strain with a potential for reducing Ventilation Induced Lung Injury (VILI). It is still debated if COVID-19 related ARDS represents a distinct entity and whether common treatments used in ARDS are equally effective. International guidelines and experts, however, recommend the use of prone position in patients with COVID-19 related moderate to severe ARDS and this technique is more widely used than in the past. Some reports suggest a benefit of proning in COVID-19 patients, but few data are available on the physiological effects of proning in COVID-19 ARDS, except for the effect on the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. Factors associated with success and failure have also not been extensively described.

The main aim of this study was to assess the effects of proning in COVID-19 ARDS patients on oxygenation parameters (PaO 2 /FiO 2 and alveolar-arterial gradient — Aa-gradient) both for all the proning sessions considered together and for the first five proning sessions. As a secondary aim, we assessed the effects of proning (all sessions and first to fifth sessions) on other physiological and respiratory parameters such as respiratory mechanics, and dead space fraction estimates. Finally, as an ancillary aim, we looked for factors associated with treatment failure defined as ICU death or the need for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO).

Materials and methods

Search strategy and study selection

The search strategy and selection of studies are similar to those described in our previous meta-analysis. Pertinent studies were independently searched in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and BioMedCentral (updated 30 March 2010), using the following MeSH and keyword terms: 'acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'acute lung injury', 'acute respiratory failure', and 'prone position ventilation'. RCTs that evaluated mechanical ventilation in prone versus supine positioning in adults with acute respiratory failure, ALI, or ARDS were included in the analysis. To minimise heterogeneity, we decided to keep only studies performed in adults. The rationale of proning in adults is in part based on homogenisation of the pleural pressure gradient and changes in chest wall compliance. Whether this also occurs in children with a different chest wall configuration is not known. Studies conducted in infants were therefore not included.

Data extraction and study characteristics

Three investigators (LO-B, FD and IO) independently evaluated studies for inclusion and abstracted data on methods and outcomes; disagreements were resolved by consensus between investigators. We extracted the study design, type of population and disease severity (assessed by the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), prone position duration on a 24-hour basis, and ICU mortality reported on an intention-to-treat basis. The methodological quality of each trial was evaluated using the five-point scale (0 = worst and 5 = best) as described by Jadad and colleagues. Since all published meta-analyses have shown that prone ventilation was effective on oxygenation and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, while the most recent one expressed doubts about its safety, we focused our analysis mainly on the effects of prone ventilation on both the ICU mortality and the procedure's complications.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^112jq66g]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of prone positioning during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilation has a robust scientific ground and was evaluated in numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Despite significant and sustained increase of oxygenation, prone positioning had no impact on mortality. Most of these studies were underpowered, however, and meta-analyses intended to overcome the effects of inadequate sample sizes in individual RCTs failed to uncover any robust trend toward improved overall survival using prone positioning. Yet from the first RCT evaluating prone ventilation (Prone-Supine Study), Gattinoni and colleagues highlighted in a post-hoc analysis that prone positioning reduced the 10-day mortality of patients with the highest disease severity (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II ≥ 50). A similar message is conveyed by selected analysis of the most severe patients in study-level meta-analyses. These findings were recently reinforced by the conclusions of the Prone-Supine II Study suggesting that the most severe ARDS patients (defined by PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 100 mmHg) could derive beneficial effects from prone ventilation with reduced mortality. Consequently, recent meta-analyses of individual patient data obtained either from all published RCTs or from the four largest published RCTs showed unquestionably that the subgroup of the most severe patients (those with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 100 mmHg) had a significant reduction in mortality with prone ventilation.

### Effect of continuous prolonged prone position versus… [^113AKqkC]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of Continuous Prolonged Prone Position Versus Intermittent Daily Prone Position in ARDS ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Prone position has been shown to be an effective intervention to decrease mortality in adults connected to mechanical ventilation for moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Patients may require one or more sessions of prone position. However, the optimal duration of prone sessions is unknown. The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if applying prone position in prolonged sessions is more effective than applying it in daily sessions. Researchers will compare prolonged versus intermittent prone position to see which approach is better to treat moderate to severe ARDS.

Participants will:

- Receive prone position either in prolonged or daily sessions during the first 7 days
- Be followed for up to 90 days to assess their clinical evolution. Since the publication of the landmark PROSEVA study, which showed that ventilating patients in prone position decreased mortality, the standard approach to prone position has been the use of daily sessions of 16 to 20 hours. With this approach most patients usually require 3 to 4 prone sessions. A non-randomized controlled study from 3 hospital in US even showed that compared to patients treated with standard prone sessions, patients treated with prolonged sessions had a lower risk of mortality. However, other reports have shown conflicting results regarding the potential benefit associated to prolonging prone position sessions beyond 24 hours.

Recent guidelines have acknowledged that the optimal duration of prone position sessions is unknown and must be further investigated. Prolonging prone position sessions may ensure that this lung protective intervention is maintained throughout the acute phase of ARDS. Patients allocated to the control arm will receive prone position sessions for a minimum of 16 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. In both groups prone sessions may be repeated if PaO2/FiO2 ratio falls below 150 after being returned to supine position during the first 7 days. Procedure: Daily prone position sessions Procedure: Prolonged prone position sessions

### Prone position during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: survival analysis needed for a time-dependent intervention [^113X3Ut9]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

This inconsistency could be a failure to address the fact that prone positioning has temporal dimensions, having both a duration and a time course in the patient's illness journey. We used a multistate survival model to address this issue, which is a more realistic model of patient progression through their journey. Patients in prone positioning can move to the supine state and vice versa, and this transition contributes to the complexity of the model and eventually affects the outcome. Hazard ratios from the survival model provide an estimate for transitions between states. A survival approach can account for the average time spent in the prone position, the number still at risk over time, and the probability of transitions. It can also account for the effect of multiple confounders on the transition and outcomes while accounting for the key confounder of time prone positioning began. Analyzing time-dependent treatments using cross-sectional groups that ignore time (e.g. "any prone during stay" and "no prone during stay") can cause significant biases in the effects of the treatment. These cross-sectional comparisons are confounded by time in ICU, which predicts both the probability of receiving prone treatments, and key outcomes such as death and length of stay.

In conclusion, we believe that prone positioning is beneficial for VV ECMO patients with Covid-19 ARDS and continue to recommend its use. Consideration of the temporal aspects of prone ventilation such as day of initiation, time of day of proning, the duration of prone positioning, and number of proning episodes is essential in both retrospective analyses and future randomized controlled clinical trials.

Timing and duration

It should be stressed that the effect of proning on VILI prevention is distinct from its effect on oxygenation. Henceforth, proning should be applied as early as possible after identification of hypoxemic ARDS to make the lung more homogeneous and to reduce the stress and strain imposed on the entire lung by mechanical ventilation. In the Proseva trial, however, patients were, enrolled after a 12- to 24-h stabilization period which was used to confirm ARDS. It is likely that this strategy led to selecting patients with a more recruitable and more heterogeneous lung, which would benefit from proning. Nevertheless, the control group was not disfavored as its mortality was exactly the same as in another trial on similar patients.

Early trials used proning for 7- to 8-h sessions. It turned out that using longer session lasting more than 12 h was feasible. In the Proseva trial the mean session duration was 17 h and the proning treatment was used during 4 days on average. In the PSII trial, these values were 18 h and 8 days, respectively. The criterion to stop proning was defined in the Proseva trial as an improvement in oxygenation for at last 4 h in the supine position (PaO 2 /FIO 2 > 150 mmHg with PEEP < 10 cmH 2 O and FiO 2 < 0.6). In the PSII trial the prone position was stopped once acute respiratory failure resolved (PaO 2 /FIO 2 in supine similar to prone position). These two strategies resulted in different doses of proning, amounting to 73 and 50%, respectively, of the time allocated to prone actually spent in this position.

Risk management/safety

It is interesting to note that in many centers that have used prone position for many years the procedure is simple and done routinely by 3–4 caregivers. In other centers which do not prone patients frequently the procedure is described as complex, cumbersome, and risky. It should be stressed that the procedure really needs a specific implementation program in the ICU and it is likely that, as for other techniques, the volume effect does matter. In the last meta-analyses of trials on prone versus supine position, pressure sores and endotracheal tube obstruction were still significantly more frequent with proning. It should also be stressed that no trial showed harmful effects of prone position as a group.

### Conscious proning: an introduction of a proning protocol for nonintubated, awake, hypoxic emergency department COVID-19 patients [^115jvnga]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has rapidly become a global pandemic. A major cause of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 has been the worsening hypoxia that, if untreated, can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. Past work has found that intubated patients with ARDS experience physiological benefits to the prone position, because it promotes better matching of pulmonary perfusion to ventilation, improved secretion clearance, and recruitment of dependent areas of the lungs. We created a systemwide multi-institutional (New York-Presbyterian Hospital enterprise) protocol for placing awake, nonintubated, emergency department patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the prone position. In this piece, we describe the background literature and the approach we have taken at our institution as we care for a high burden of COVID-19 cases with respiratory symptoms.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KmEwJ]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) is a well-established therapeutic strategy in the management of moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Its physiological rationale lies in promoting a more homogeneous distribution of lung stress and strain. By redistributing transpulmonary pressures, PP facilitates alveolar recruitment, reduces regional overdistension, and mitigates cyclic alveolar collapse - all of which contribute to minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Moreover, PP improves ventilation-perfusion matching, frequently resulting in enhanced gas exchange. Recent evidence suggests a potential dose response relationship, with clinical benefits such as improved oxygenation and reduced mortality being more pronounced when PP is initiated early and maintained for extended durations. Randomized trials and prior meta-analyses support the efficacy of daily prone sessions lasting at least 16 h in improving survival among patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Theoretical and physiological considerations further propose that extending proning sessions beyond 24 h may offer additional benefits, including sustained improvements in lung mechanics and gas exchange, fewer position-related interruptions, and more consistent prevention of VILI. However, prolonged prone positioning may also be associated with an increased risk of certain complications. These include a higher incidence of pressure injuries, such as skin and soft tissue damage, particularly at bony prominences, and a greater need for sedation, which may contribute to longer durations of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. There may also be an increased risk of accidental extubation or displacement of vascular lines during repositioning maneuvers.

Despite growing clinical interest, data on the efficacy and safety of prolonged prone positioning (PPP) remain limited. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of PPP on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS.

### PEEP titration during prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112piKMX]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

No major trial evaluating prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has incorporated a high-positive end-expiratory pressure (high-PEEP) strategy despite complementary physiological rationales. We evaluated generalizability of three recent proning trials to patients receiving a high-PEEP strategy. All trials employed a relatively low-PEEP strategy. After protocol ventilator settings were initiated and the patient was positioned per treatment assignment, post-intervention PEEP was not more than 5 cm H2O in 16.7% and not more than 10 cm H2O in 66.0% of patients. Post-intervention PEEP would have been nearly twice the set PEEP had a high-PEEP strategy been employed. Use of either proning or high-PEEP likely improves survival in moderate-severe ARDS; the role for both concomitantly remains unknown.

Discussion

The summary of the group's recommendations emphasises the importance of avoiding VALI in patients with ARDS, as all of the interventions with positive recommendations apart from maintaining a conservative fluid balance, arguably act through this process. Despite at best moderate quality evidence by MA, we have strongly supported the use of low tidal volume and low airway pressure mechanical ventilation. This ventilation strategy is supported by results of the ARDS Network ARMA study, data from studies whose primary outcome was the prevention of ARDS and a large volume of evidence from preclinical and mechanistic studies. It is now so universally accepted that it is mandated for all patients in clinical trials of ARDS. When applied to patients with moderate/severe ARDS for at least 12 hours per day, prone positioning was also strongly recommended because the most recent studies focused enrolment on the most severe strata of patients with ARDS and involved a multimodal intervention comprising lung-protective ventilation with prolonged prone positioning producing highly favourable outcomes. By contrast, despite a strong theoretical rationale as a means of preventing VALI, high frequency oscillatory ventilation was ineffective or deleterious in two large studies leading to our recommendation strongly against its use.

While broadly similar recommendations for the management of ARDS have been produced, many questions remain. Fundamentally the parameters characterising optimal protective mechanical ventilation are unknown, as are the optimal means of achieving them. We have recommended targeting < 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW), but, based on the absence of evidence of a safe tidal volume threshold on retrospective reanalysis of the ARMA studyand a dose-response effect seen in observational studies, it would be reasonable to recommend minimising tidal volume as far as possible. Similarly, analysing individual patient data from RCT concluded that driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) was a better predictor of outcome than tidal volume or plateau pressure alone. Finally, there is no consensus regarding the means used to optimise PEEP (oxygenation or various lung mechanical parameters) or to manage the respiratory acidosis that commonly accompanies protective ventilation.

Methods

Corresponding authors from all clinical trials identified in a recent meta-analysis on prone positioning for ARDS were contacted. De-identified patient-level data from three of seven trials were ultimately provided, including the two largest proning trials to date. One included trial enrolled patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 of not more than 300) who had an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation of more than 48 hours, of which a subgroup met criteria for ARDS. The other two trials enrolled only patients with moderate-severe ARDS, requiring PaO 2 /FiO 2 of not more than 200 and not more than 150.

PEEP titration strategy

Clinical trial protocols were reviewed for PEEP titration strategy. Individual patient PEEP settings were evaluated at two predefined thresholds — not more than 5 cm H 2 O and not more than 10 cm H 2 O — at each of two time points: baseline and post-intervention. Baseline PEEP refers to values documented after study enrollment but prior to any study intervention, thus reflecting usual care received by patients before the study. Post-intervention PEEP refers to the first documented values after being placed on protocol ventilator settings and positioned either prone or supine per treatment assignment. To avoid risk of informative censoring owing to death or liberation from mechanical ventilation, later time points were not evaluated.

Calculation of expected high PEEP

We also considered what PEEP would have been in the proning trials had a high-PEEP protocol been used. This hypothetical PEEP was calculated for each patient by identifying the PEEP level from PEEP-FiO 2 titration tables that corresponded to each individual's actual preset FiO 2. PEEP-FiO 2 titration tables were obtained from the ALVEOLI (ARDS Network Assessment of Low tidal Volume and elevated End-expiratory volume to Obviate Lung Injury Trial) and LOVS (Lung Open Ventilation Study) protocols, two multicenter trials that compared high- versus low-PEEP strategies. When the titration protocol permitted more than one PEEP setting for a given FiO 2, the lower PEEP level was reported, biasing toward smaller differences between set and hypothetical high-PEEP values.

Statistical analysis

Results are reported as mean ± standard deviation or number (percentage) as appropriate. Differences between set PEEP and expected high PEEP were compared by using the paired t test. Missing data were thought to occur at random given the timing of our analyses immediately after trial enrollment; thus, patients with missing data were excluded from analysis. Statistical significance was determined by using a two-sided alpha of 0.05.

### The effect of prone positioning on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1124TqTF]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Patients with severe ARDS (defined as P/F ratio ≤ 100 mmHg) clearly benefit from PP.

- There is no demonstrated benefit of PP in patients with mild to moderate ARDS.

- Patients ventilated with a higher PEEP level (defined as PEEP ≥ 10 cmH 2 O) also benefit from PP. Because the results of this study do not allow a definitive explanation for these findings, no firm recommendations can be made regarding the use of PP based on PEEP level.

- In this study, we show that the PP duration matters. It is unclear whether this importance resulted from a dose response to PP or whether there existed a threshold daily PP duration that was required to obtain a benefit. The data suggest, however, that PP for < 12 h/day is less likely to be beneficial to patients.

### Effects of early versus delayed application of prone position on ventilation-perfusion mismatch in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study [^114mSL6L]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone position has been shown to improve oxygenation and survival in patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These beneficial effects are partly mediated by improved ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) distribution. Few studies have investigated the impact of early versus delayed proning on V/Q distribution in patients with ARDS. The aim of this study was to assess the regional ventilation and perfusion distribution in early versus persistent ARDS after prone position.

Methods

This is a prospective, observational study from June 30, 2021, to October 1, 2022 at the medical ICU in Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University. Fifty-seven consecutive adult patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS ventilated in supine and prone position. Electrical impedance tomography was used to study V/Q distribution in the supine position and 12 h after a prone session.

Results

Of the 57 patients, 33 were early ARDS (≤ 7 days) and 24 were persistent ARDS (> 7 days). Oxygenation significantly improved after proning in early ARDS (157 [121, 191] vs. 190 [164, 245] mm Hg, p < 0.001), whereas no significant change was found in persistent ARDS patients (168 [136, 232] vs.177 [155, 232] mm Hg, p = 0.10). Compared to supine position, prone reduced V/Q mismatch in early ARDS (28.7 [24.6, 35.4] vs. 22.8 [20.0, 26.8] %, p < 0.001), but increased V/Q mismatch in persistent ARDS (23.8 [19.8, 28.6] vs. 30.3 [24.5, 33.3] %, p = 0.006). In early ARDS, proning significantly reduced shunt in the dorsal region and dead space in the ventral region. In persistent ARDS, proning increased global shunt. A significant correlation was found between duration of ARDS onset to proning and the change in V/Q distribution (r = 0.54, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Prone position significantly reduced V/Q mismatch in patients with early ARDS, while it increased V/Q mismatch in persistent ARDS patients. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05207267, principal investigator Ling Liu, date of registration 2021.08.20).

### Prone position in acute respiratory distress syndrome. rationale, indications, and limits [^1149xsjj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the prone position, computed tomography scan densities redistribute from dorsal to ventral as the dorsal region tends to reexpand while the ventral zone tends to collapse. Although gravitational influence is similar in both positions, dorsal recruitment usually prevails over ventral derecruitment, because of the need for the lung and its confining chest wall to conform to the same volume. The final result of proning is that the overall lung inflation is more homogeneous from dorsal to ventral than in the supine position, with more homogeneously distributed stress and strain. As the distribution of perfusion remains nearly constant in both postures, proning usually improves oxygenation. Animal experiments clearly show that prone positioning delays or prevents ventilation-induced lung injury, likely due in large part to more homogeneously distributed stress and strain. Over the last 15 years, five major trials have been conducted to compare the prone and supine positions in acute respiratory distress syndrome, regarding survival advantage. The sequence of trials enrolled patients who were progressively more hypoxemic; exposure to the prone position was extended from 8 to 17 hours/day, and lung-protective ventilation was more rigorously applied. Single-patient and meta-analyses drawing from the four major trials showed significant survival benefit in patients with PaO2/FiO2 lower than 100. The latest PROSEVA (Proning Severe ARDS Patients) trial confirmed these benefits in a formal randomized study. The bulk of data indicates that in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, carefully performed prone positioning offers an absolute survival advantage of 10–17%, making this intervention highly recommended in this specific population subset.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1164ARDL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs): We suggest using neuromuscular blockade in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty). In seven RCTs that included 1,598 patients, NMBAs may decrease mortality versus no NMBA (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; low certainty), with mortality reduction when compared with deep sedation (n = 3 studies, 431 patients; RR, 0.72, 95% CI, 0.58–0.91) but not light sedation (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15). NMBAs were probably associated with a reduced incidence of barotrauma (n = 4 studies, 1,437 patients; RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85) and a possible increase in ventilator-free days (n = 5 studies; MD, 0.89 more; 95% CI, 0.38 fewer to 2.18 more), but also probably increased the rates of ICU-acquired weakness (n = 4 studies, 885 patients; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98–1.37). The panel specified timing and severity qualifiers: the balance of benefits might be greatest when treatment is targeted to early (< 48 h since ARDS onset) and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ratio < 100 mm Hg) ARDS; no recommendation could be made for later initiation or less severe ARDS. Although this guideline does not recommend a specific NMBA, cisatracurium was used in the two largest RCTs and was noted as possibly preferable; with regard to duration, NMBAs were administered for as long as 48 hours in the majority of study patients, and NMBA duration should be limited to a maximum of 48 hours whenever possible; an appropriate strategy may involve reserving use for early severe ARDS in deeply sedated patients or, under light sedation, when significant ventilator dyssynchrony or clinical deterioration persists despite ventilator or sedation adjustments.

### Prone positioning in awake, nonintubated patients with COVID-19… [^111y1Zv8]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The median improvement in oxygen saturation was 7% after 1 hour of prone positioning. This study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that prone positioning may improve oxygenation in patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome prior to intubation. Prone positioning has several beneficial effects on pulmonary physiology in patients with ARDS. 2 In the supine position, pulmonary edema accumulates in basilar regions, and the heart and abdominal contents further compress these dependent lung regions. This leads to heterogenous ventilation, with increased volume delivered to apical and anterior lung units, which are also the regions that receive less of the pulmonary circulation.

To address these limitations, the Proning Severe ARDS Patients trial, 3 published in 2013, randomized patients with a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen less than 150 mm Hg within 36 hours of intubation to be placed in the prone position for long durations — on average, 17 hours a day. The comparison group was patients ventilated in the supine position. The trial found a hazard ratio for death of 0. 39 in the study arm with prone positioning compared with standard care. The findings have led to increased adoption of prone positioning for mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

In a report on 50 nonintubated hypoxemic patients with suspected COVID-19 who presented to an emergency department in New York City, Caputo and colleagues5 found a significant increase in Spo2 5 minutes after proning. One potential concern with the use of the prone position in spontaneously breathing patients is that it could delay intubation and mechanical ventilation. The optimal timing of intubation and mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS is not known, but delayed intubation has been associated with increased mortality in patients with ARDS. 9 Spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS generate relatively large tidal volumes; the result could be inadvertent self-inflicted lung injury.

Mortality

Mortality (defined as overall mortality at the longest available follow-up) was significantly reduced with prone positioning (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96, 8 studies, 2141 patients) with very low quality of evidence supporting this RR. All trials demonstrated performance bias, because of the impossibility of blinding patients and carers with respect to the intervention. All trials also demonstrated detection bias, where outcome assessors were not blinded to intervention allocation. One RCT additionally demonstrated selection biasand three separate trials suffered from attrition biasaccording to the Cochrane risk of bias recommendations. Inconsistency was very serious, with varied point estimates, overlapping confidence intervals with high and significant levels of heterogeneity. There was also serious indirectness as the cohort of trials included subgroups receiving additional interventions known to demonstrate a mortality benefit.

Subgroup analysis demonstrated that prone positioning in combination with lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume ventilation, 6–8 mL/kg body weight) demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86) compared with patients receiving prone positioning and no lung-protective ventilation (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.13), supported by moderate quality evidence. These findings may be influenced by inclusion of one trial enrolling a sizeable patient cohort with more severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 20 kPa, FiO 2 > 0.6)which showed larger differences in mortality rates between patients managed prone and supine in the setting of lung-protective ventilation.

Subgroup analysis based on the duration of prone positioning found that over 12 hours of prone positioning was associated with significantly reduced mortality (> 12 hour, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; < 12 hour, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17), again supported by moderate quality evidence.

Length of stay

ICU length of stay was only examined in two older MAs. However, these data could not be extracted, as pooled analyses included either confirmed or potential paediatric data. No other trial examined hospital length of stay.

### Prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^111Tow2B]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Prone positioning may be beneficial for several reasons: In the supine position, the lungs are compressed by the heart and abdominal organs. Gas exchange, the process of trading carbon dioxide for oxygen, is reduced in areas of collapsed lung, resulting in low oxygen levels. In the prone position, lung compression is less, improving lung function. The body has mechanisms to adjust blood flow to different portions of the lung. In ARDS, an imbalance between blood and air flow develops, leading to poor gas exchange. Prone positioning redistributes blood and air flow more evenly, reducing this imbalance and improving gas exchange. With improved lung function in the prone position, less support from the ventilator is needed to achieve adequate oxygen levels. This may reduce risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, which occurs from overinflation and excess stretching of certain portions of the lung. Prone positioning may improve heart function in some patients.

In the prone position, blood return to the chambers on the right side of the heart increases and constriction of the blood vessels of the lung decreases. This may help the heart pump better, resulting in improved oxygen delivery to the body. Because the mouth and nose are facing down in the prone position, secretions produced by the disease process in the lung may drain better. Placement of Patients in the Prone Position Movement of patients to a prone position involves risk of serious complications such as a dislodged breathing tube or very low blood pressure. A team of trained clinicians, including respiratory therapists, nurses, and a physician, are necessary to safely reposition a patient. Most hospitals maintain patients in a prone position for at least 12 hours per day, though practices vary. Proning sessions continue until there is a sustained improvement in oxygen levels, or if proning does not improve oxygen levels. Prone positioning is considered on an individual basis.

Although it is beneficial in some settings, not all patients improve and some may worsen. With changes in position, medical devices, breathing tubes, and drains may dislodge. If a breathing tube becomes dislodged, replacement in the prone position is difficult. Performing procedures or cardiopulmonary resuscitation is also challenging in the prone position and may require immediate repositioning. Also, with prone positioning, pressure is placed on the shoulders, chest, knee, and face, predisposing these areas to pressure ulcers. This may also result in nerve injury.

### Prolonged vs shorter awake prone positioning for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure: a multicenter, randomised controlled trial [^116o4DZZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Placing intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) into the prone position has been investigated for 5 decades. It has been shown to improve oxygenation by recruiting dorsal lung regions and by improving the distribution of ventilation. It has also become the standard of care for patients with moderately-severe to severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg) based on studies demonstrating a decreased mortality, likely by decreasing ventilator-induced lung injury.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory system causing mild to severe respiratory illness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies reported the benefit of using the prone position in non-intubated patients (an approach that is often termed "awake proning" or "awake prone positioning") with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Awake prone position has been suggested by ARDS guidelines as the standard of care for these patients to prevent intubation. However, the daily median duration of the awake prone position varied substantially among studies (from 1.7 to 9 h per day) and there were uncertainties over the benefits of longer periods of awake proning.

Longer durations of daily awake prone position appear to be associated with treatment success (survival without intubation) in patients with COVID-19-related AHRF, in line with a prospective cohort study, in which the awake prone position for ≥ 6 h/day reduced the risk of endotracheal intubation; and awake proning for ≥ 8 h/d reduced the risk of hospital mortality. Two recent meta-analyses also suggested a reduction in intubation rate among those with longer durations of daily awake prone position. However, there is no high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence demonstrating that prolonged awake prone positioning can further reduce intubation when compared to standard care which utilizes a short duration of awake prone position.

Given that the efficacy of proning appears to be time dependent in moderate to severe (intubated) ARDS patients, and in non-intubated COVID-19 AHRF patients, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to explore whether a strategy aimed at ensuring prolonged awake prone positioning (aiming for 12 h daily for 7 days) would reduce the rate of intubation at 28 days when compared with standard care with a shorter period of awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related AHRF.

Conclusions

The present study-level meta-analysis based on an observation (each of the most recent RCTs reported a substantial, although nonsignificant, reduction in ICU mortality by prone ventilation) and a working hypothesis (only ARDS patients would derive benefit from prone ventilation) tried to overcome primary trial heterogeneity by a subgroup meta-analysis of studies that restricted inclusion to only ARDS. This meta-analysis shows that prone ventilation significantly reduces ICU mortality in ARDS patients and suggests that long prone durations should be applied.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^111roS4U]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis of individual patient data helps to avoid ecological bias, allows sufficiently powered subgroup analysis, and even allows powerful and reliable evaluation of treatment effects across individuals. This type of meta-analysis, however, does not solve all problems encountered in study-level meta-analyses. Indeed, the accuracy of individual patient data depends on the quality (conduct) and similarity (design) of primary studies, and heterogeneity might still be present if trials are not sufficiently similar or carry potential sources of bias. Moreover, individual patient data meta-analysis has frequently been shown to disclose divergent results from those of study-level aggregate meta-analysis.

In a previous aggregate meta-analysis we emphasised the substantial clinical (rather than statistical) heterogeneity of primary studies, making it difficult to conduct a study-level meta-analysis evaluating prone ventilation. This heterogeneity resulted merely from ecological bias, which is caused by confounding across trials. Ecological bias usually arises from within-group variability in covariates that may influence the outcome. In the particular setting of early studies on prone ventilation, ecological bias consisted of variable prone duration, mixed severity of acute lung injury, variable time-lapse between lung injury onset and inclusion, and lack of standardisation of co-interventions such as the lack of protective lung ventilation. Early studies were also vulnerable to treatment contamination, by allowing for crossover from one trial arm to another.

Given the large sample sizes of the initial studies, the heterogeneity in terms of severity as well as patient management heavily impacted the study-level meta-analyses. Of note, the most recent RCTs - which learned from the shortcomings of early studies, and were able to incorporate recent knowledge advances regarding lung-protective ventilation - reached a consistent design that was sharply different from that of the large RCTs published earlier in the decade. Indeed, careful examination of these trials shows that they share the following common features: inclusion of the most severe patients (ARDS only, excluding acute lung injury (ALI) non-ARDS patients), and control for the most relevant confounders - that is, proning duration (usually > 17 hours/day) and use of lung-protective ventilation. Interestingly, each of these studies reported a substantial reduction in absolute risk of mortality varying between 9 and 15% but lacked power to reject a type II statistical error. The possible minimisation of ecological bias therefore makes these new studies an interesting opportunity for a new updated study-level meta-analysis.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1175gJRH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Methods: We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations. Results: We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Conclusions: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

### Prolonged prone position ventilation for SARS-CoV-2 patients is feasible and effective [^116Cqyyf]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, novel coronavirus 2019 (nCOV-19) is spreading all around the world causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) requiring mechanical ventilation in about 5% of infected people. Prone position ventilation is an established method to improve oxygenation in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and its application was able to reduce mortality rate. Although the severity of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 may require pronation, the huge number of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission may create management problems due to the limited number of healthcare workers compared to the number of patients. Often, sustained oxygenation improvement can only be achieved after several cycles of pronation, with a work overload for healthcare staff. To face these problems, we implemented a pronation protocol that allows to extend the time for the prone position beyond 16 h, aiming to reduce the number of pronation cycles per patient. Thus, the aim of this report was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of prone position ventilation beyond the usual 16 h.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112dDD7E]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^114scKZg]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis did not disclose a statistically significant increase in major airway complications of prone positioning. The most recent RCT (Prone-Supine II Study), however - which should be regarded as the most reliable reflection of real-life practice - recorded a higher incidence of adverse events associated with prone positioning. This concerned not only airway complications but also the need for increased sedation, transient desaturation or hypotension, and displacement of vascular lines. Accordingly, caution should be kept during the manoeuvre - which should be applied only in the most severe patients.

The survival difference between ALI/ARDS studies and only ARDS studies might have additional possible contributors, other than the disease severity. The ALI/ARDS studies are the older studies, characterised by several methodological differences such as the absence of relevant co-treatments (lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy), other criteria of enrolment (time window between ARDS criteria and enrolment), and so forth. The main difference is that the length of the proning treatment - which may constitute an important determinant of the survival benefit - is profoundly different between older studies (shorter duration) and newer studies (longer duration). Indeed, alveolar recruitment in the prone position is a time-dependent phenomenon. Our study therefore cannot ascertain whether the enrolment criteria by themselves explain the results, and suggests that proning duration also played a role. We addressed the practical issue of the optimal proning duration by a meta-regression analysis. We found only a trend towards an interaction between longer proning duration and reduction in mortality. The initial studies by Guerin and colleagues and Gattinoni and colleagues had the greatest impact on the slope of the regression line. The subgroup of studies including only ARDS patients also applied the longest proning durations (17 to 24 hours/day). Hence, although proning duration seems to play a role in the outcome effect, the present analysis cannot definitely confirm this effect.

### To prone or not to prone ARDS patients on ECMO [^111uCB1v]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, one could argue that all patients with ARDS who are receiving ECMO should be proned. This idea could be supported by the fact that the prone position has been shown to increase the survival of non-ECMO patients with ARDS.

Second, it is worth noting that most of these patients had a preferred distribution of tidal ventilation to the ventral zones in the supine position; therefore, they could benefit from homogenizing lung inflation (Fig. 1). Moreover, as this increase in lung homogeneity was also present in patients with lower Crs and was independent of the mechanical response generated, it has been suggested that all ARDS patients who are receiving ECMO should benefit from proning.

Although it has been recently shown that the prone position may reduce inspiratory effort during spontaneous breathing in non-ECMO ARDS patients, the prone position is usually associated with the use of neuromuscular blockade and deeper sedation, avoiding spontaneous breathing. Conversely, the European Life Support Organization guidelines recommend an early reduction in sedation levels and a switch to spontaneous breathing after 24–48 h of ECMO initiation. It is important to highlight that when this strategy is implemented one should be aware that monitoring respiratory drive and inspiratory effort is strongly recommended to minimize the risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury. Indeed, it has been shown that around 50% of ARDS patients on ECMO present injurious inspiratoryeffort despite increasing sweep gas flows.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^116uSsoG]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed a consistent trend of mortality reduction with prone ventilation. We updated a meta-analysis on this topic.

Methods

RCTs that compared ventilation of adult patients with ALI/ARDS in prone versus supine position were included in this study-level meta-analysis. Analysis was made by a random-effects model. The effect size on intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was computed in the overall included studies and in two subgroups of studies: those that included all ALI or hypoxemic patients, and those that restricted inclusion to only ARDS patients. A relationship between studies' effect size and daily prone duration was sought with meta-regression. We also computed the effects of prone positioning on major adverse airway complications.

Results

Seven RCTs (including 1,675 adult patients, of whom 862 were ventilated in the prone position) were included. The four most recent trials included only ARDS patients, and also applied the longest proning durations and used lung-protective ventilation. The effects of prone positioning differed according to the type of study. Overall, prone ventilation did not reduce ICU mortality (odds ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.75 to 1.2; P = 0.39), but it significantly reduced the ICU mortality in the four recent studies that enrolled only patients with ARDS (odds ratio = 0.71; 95% confidence interval = 0.5 to 0.99; P = 0.048; number needed to treat = 11). Meta-regression on all studies disclosed only a trend to explain effect variation by prone duration (P = 0.06). Prone positioning was not associated with a statistical increase in major airway complications.

Conclusions

Long duration of ventilation in prone position significantly reduces ICU mortality when only ARDS patients are considered.

### Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111h6eKQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previous trials involving patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have failed to show a beneficial effect of prone positioning during mechanical ventilatory support on outcomes. We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS.

Methods

In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 mL per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion.

Results

A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P < 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group.

Conclusions

In patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

### Should early prone positioning Be a standard of care in ARDS with refractory hypoxemia? [^117HqyH4]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

For the past 4 decades, the prone position has been employed as an occasional rescue option for patients with severe hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional measures applied in the supine orientation. Proning offers a high likelihood of significantly improved arterial oxygenation to well selected patients, but until the results of a convincing randomized trial were published, its potential to reduce mortality risk remained in serious doubt. Proning does not benefit patients of all disease severities and stages but may be life-saving for others. Because it requires advanced nursing skills and escalation of monitoring surveillance to deploy safely, its place as an early stage standard of care depends on the definition of that label.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113Ysm1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — new recommendations emphasize adjunctive therapies and ventilatory strategies: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); we suggest using venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in selected patients with severe ARDS; and we suggest using neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS. With regard to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), we suggest using higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and we recommend against using prolonged LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

Uncertainties and research priorities

The optimal strategy for setting PEEP in patients with ARDS remains uncertain. None of the included RCTs incorporated assessments of lung "recruitability" in response to higher PEEP strategies. Validating strategies to assess for lung recruitability at the bedside, such as the use of oxygenation response, driving pressure change, recruitment/inflation ratio, stress index, or electrical impedance tomography, may help guide individualized PEEP titration. A large multicenter trial evaluating setting PEEP based on respiratory mechanics (recruitability and effort) is ongoing (CAVI-ARDS [Careful Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome] trial; ID, NCT03963622). There is an essential need for further studies to evaluate the effect of PEEP strategies in specific populations (e.g. obese patients) and specific ARDS phenotypes (e.g. hyper-/hypoinflammatory) and with concomitant interventions (e.g. proning). There is likely no uniform best PEEP strategy for all patients with ARDS, and these future research efforts may help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from each PEEP strategy.

To the Editor:

Assessment of lung ventilation and perfusion of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) is still scarce, especially in response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning. The objective of this study was to describe the physiological effects of PEEP and prone position on respiratory mechanics, ventilation, and pulmonary perfusion in patients with C-ARDS.

### Prone position in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111hxAA4]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

In the last few years prone positioning has been used increasingly in the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and this manoeuvre is now considered a simple and safe method to improve oxygenation. However, the physiological mechanisms causing respiratory function improvement as well as the real clinical benefit are not yet fully understood. The aim of this review is to discuss the physiological and clinical effects of prone positioning in patients with ARDS. The main physiological aims of prone positioning are: 1) to improve oxygenation; 2) to improve respiratory mechanics; 3) to homogenise the pleural pressure gradient, the alveolar inflation and the ventilation distribution; 4) to increase lung volume and reduce the amount of atelectatic regions; 5) to facilitate the drainage of secretions; and 6) to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. According to the available data, the authors conclude that: 1) oxygenation improves in approximately 70–80% of patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome; 2) the beneficial effects of oxygenation reduce after 1 week of mechanical ventilation; 3) the aetiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome may markedly affect the response to prone positioning; 4) extreme care is necessary when the manoeuvre is performed; 5) pressure sores are frequent and related to the number of pronations; 6) the supports used to prone and during positioning are different and nonstandardised among centres; and 7) intensive care unit and hospital stay and mortality still remain high despite prone positioning.

### Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS… [^116RMXFx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Prone positioning may improve the outcome of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, but is prone position superior to supine position among patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe ARDS. Findings. Meaning Among patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO, prone positioning did not reduce time to successful ECMO weaning compared with supine position. Importance Prone positioning may improve outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, but it is unknown whether prone positioning improves clinical outcomes among patients with ARDS who are undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with supine positioning. Objective To test whether prone positioning vs supine positioning decreases the time to successful ECMO weaning in patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO.

Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial of patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO for less than 48 hours at 14 intensive care units in France between March 3, 2021, and December 7, 2021. Interventions Patients were randomized 1: 1 to prone positioning or to supine positioning. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 60 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO and mechanical ventilation–free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, skin pressure injury, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 90-day follow-up. Within 90 days, no significant difference was observed in ECMO duration, ICU length of stay, or 90-day mortality.

No serious adverse events were reported during the prone position procedure. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO, prone positioning compared with supine positioning did not significantly reduce time to successful weaning of ECMO. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04607551.

### Adaptation and uncertainty: a qualitative examination of provider experiences with prone positioning for intubated patients with COVID-19 ARDS [^116Dywp8]. CHEST Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study of ICU clinicians involved with proning mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS provides detailed qualitative data describing adaptations to prone positioning and shows a different approach to the therapy than that described in the landmark proning randomized controlled trial and historical practice. This includes earlier initiation of proning once a patient meets criteria, extended duration of proning sessions and less use of deep sedation and NMB. Clinicians remain uncertain about how to best deliver prone positioning to mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, including when to initiate proning, how long to keep a patient proned, and when to stop repeating proning maneuvers. Although concomitant use of deep sedation and NMB for proned patients may be decreased compared with historical practice, not all care teams were comfortable with this adaptation.

The data from this study provide context for the prone positioning adaptations that have been quantitatively demonstrated by our group and others. Regarding extended proning sessions, COVID-19 ARDS studies reveal significant variability in this practice, with some centers much more likely to adhere to proning sessions around 16 hours, and others using far extended sessions. Clinician uncertainty regarding optimal proning duration, concerns about the labor-intensive nature of repetitive proning and supination, and hesitance to supinate severely ill patients, as described in this study, may drive some of this heterogeneity. Whether extended proning is beneficial to patients, or superior to standard duration proning, is not known. Although emerging observational evidence supports the safety and potential efficacy of this practice, further study is needed. Clinician uncertainty about several issues around timing (initiation, duration) and repetition of proning sessions indicates a need for stronger evidence to optimize use of proning. Finally, clinician uncertainty around proning can inhibit a shared mental model of proning purpose amongst ICU team members. This presents a challenge to uniform implementation of this evidence-based intervention.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113krQRy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) management includes the following recommendations: we suggest the use of corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

### PEEP titration during prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112SrHzN]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prone positioning has been used since the 1970s to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory failure. Several important physiological changes occur with proning: recruitment of dependent lung regions, increased ventilation-perfusion matching, optimized chest wall mechanics, decreased pleural pressure gradient from non-dependent to dependent regions, and augmented drainage of tracheobronchial secretions.

Given these effects, proning would seem likely to benefit patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Indeed, the recent PROSEVA (Proning Severe ARDS Patients) multicenter randomized trial demonstrated significantly improved survival with proning for moderate-severe ARDS. This trial built on cumulative experience from the prior decade of indeterminate trials, which served to refine the target population, intervention strategy, and co-interventions. Key features of PROSEVA that collectively may explain the observed benefit compared with prior trials include enrollment of patients only with more severe ARDS (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2) of less than 150), protocolized low tidal volume ventilation, near-ubiquitous use of continuous neuromuscular blockade, intervening early in the ARDS course, and increased duration of prone positioning.

High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been advocated as part of an "open lung" approach by citing a rationale similar to that of proning — improving lung homogeneity to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Although no large clinical trial to date has demonstrated definitively a mortality benefit with high PEEP, a meta-analysis of three such trials found significantly increased survival and ventilator-free days with high PEEP for moderate-severe ARDS. As a result, several recently completed and ongoing multicenter clinical trials of ARDS have incorporated a high-PEEP strategy, although this practice is not universal.

No major randomized trial of prone versus supine positioning has incorporated a high-PEEP strategy for either study arm. Thus, it is unclear to what extent patients managed with a high-PEEP strategy may gain benefit from prone positioning and vice versa. High PEEP with supine positioning may offer benefit comparable to that of low PEEP with prone positioning; additionally, the combination of high PEEP and proning may be synergistic. To explore this potential limitation of the existing literature further, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of data from recent clinical trials on prone positioning to examine in detail the PEEP titration strategies used and to determine whether PEEP would have been meaningfully different had a high-PEEP strategy been employed.

### Does proning on NIV improve oxygenation? [^1178am2V]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Proning intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an established practice to improve oxygenation temporarily. We present two cases of patients on our intensive care unit with ARDS, on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), in whom proning improved oxygenation at a stage when intubation was the next step. We discuss the mechanisms by which proning improves oxygenation as well as the potential risks proning on NIV brings, for which we make specific recommendations.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118c6Nz]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged prone positioning (PPP) for ≥ 24 h may enhance outcomes in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but may also increase risks such as pressure injuries and complications. Despite clinical rationale, high-quality evidence for PPP's safety and efficacy remains scarce.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies. Trials that compared two distinct treatment groups in adult patients with ARDS were included: prone position < 24 h (standard) and ≥ 24 h (prolonged). Databases searched included MEDLINE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, ICTRP and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register (last search: 3 July 2025). Risk of bias was assessed using ROB-2 for RCTs, and the ROBINS-I V2 tool for non-randomised intervention studies (NRSI). The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included improvement of oxygenation and adverse events. Outcomes (Risk ratios and hazard ratios) were calculated using a random-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE assessment.

Results

Of 19,986 records, 9 (n = 1,045) were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Four studies, including two small RCTs (n = 112) and two NRSIs (n = 581), had a low to moderate risk of bias. Most studies included patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Meta-analysis showed no significant effect on 90-day mortality (n = 641, HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.41–1.25). No heterogeneity was detected among studies (I² = 0%), but the confidence interval for I² was wide (95% CI: 0–89%), suggesting the possibility that substantial heterogeneity may exist. Similarly, no significant differences were found for secondary outcomes.

Discussion

Current evidence does not support the use of PPP outside of clinical studies. Pooled data from small trials and NRSIs reveal no significant effect of PPP on mortality, oxygenation, or safety outcomes. The evidence is of low to very low certainty, limited by inconsistency and imprecision. The wide confidence intervals indicate low statistical power, therefore both harm and benefit remain plausible on the basis of the available evidence. Well-powered RCTs are needed to clarify the potential benefits and risks of PPP in ARDS.

### Management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a primer [^114mLrPG]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Proning

Prone ventilation improves oxygenation and ventilatory mechanics in many patients with severe ARDS. There is often significant heterogeneity of pulmonary edema, consolidation, and atelectasis affecting dorsal lung regions. Proning improves heterogeneity allowing for increased lung recruitment, ventilation-perfusion matching, and decreased overdistension and lung stress. These physiologic effects have been demonstrated in animal models using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The PROSEVA trial is the most notable study of early proning in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F < 150, FIO 2 ≥ 60%). 28-day mortality in the proning group was 16% compared to 32.8% in the supine group (p < 0.001), and 90-day mortality in the proning group was 23.6% compared to 41% (p < 0.001). The average duration per proning session was 17 h and each patient underwent 4 proning sessions on average. Meta-analyses of proning trials have shown improved oxygenation and improved mortality when proning sessions last ≥ 12 h. Proning is generally indicated in moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F < 150) after appropriate ventilator optimization. While paralysis may help to facilitate proning safely, it is not required. In PROSEVA, patients continued proning sessions until supine oxygenation improved to a P/F ≥ 150 with a PEEP ≤ 10 cm H 2 O and an FiO 2 ≤ 0.6; therefore, smaller improvements in patient oxygenation should not necessarily halt proning. If oxygenation does not improve, patients may still benefit from improved respiratory mechanics and reduced lung stress, as the mortality benefit was not directly linked to improved oxygenation. This may suggest static compliance, rather than P/F, is the more physiologically relevant proning endpoint. However, robust data are lacking to support compliance-guided proning strategies.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113inzod]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to methodological issues, population characteristics warrant consideration. Our systematic review predominantly identified studies evaluating patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection that directly compared standard versus prolonged prone positioning. Although some investigations have examined prolonged prone positioning in non-COVID ARDS, these did not include clearly defined comparator groups for standard and prolonged proning. While COVID- and non-COVID ARDS share important pathophysiological features, it remains uncertain whether evidence derived from COVID-19 populations can be generalized to non-COVID ARDS. Moreover, changes in clinical practice during the pandemic, such as resource constraints and staff shortages, may have contributed to longer prone sessions, thereby potentially limiting the applicability of these findings beyond the COVID-19 context.

This meta-analysis has several important limitations. A major concern is the potential for confounding by indication inherent to the observational studies evaluating prolonged prone positioning. Because prone positioning typically leads to improved oxygenation, patients with more severe or persistent hypoxemia were more likely to be maintained in the prone position for extended durations. As a result, these individuals may represent a subgroup with an inherently worse baseline prognosis, thereby biasing the association between prolonged proning and clinical outcomes. To address this, we conducted analyses limited to studies assessed as having low to moderate risk of bias to ensure the reliability of the findings by focusing on the best available evidence. Another major limitation of this review is the variability in the threshold definitions for prolonged prone positioning across included studies, ranging from 24 to 74 h, which reduces comparability and complicates interpretation. Another key limitation is the limited number of eligible studies comparing prolonged and standard prone durations. Consequently, subgroup analyses were not performed due to insufficient data to support reliable conclusions. Additionally, restricting inclusion to studies published in English and German may have introduced language bias.

This systematic review also possesses several strengths. A key strength of our systematic review lies in its comprehensive and methodologically rigorous approach, strictly adhering to PRISMA guidelines, transparent reporting of methodology, and with prospective protocol registration in PROSPERO to ensure transparency and reduce risk of bias. We applied a thorough risk-of-bias assessment and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE framework, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of our findings. By synthesizing data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies, this review addresses a critical evidence gap regarding prolonged prone positioning in ARDS, directly informing clinical decision-making. Our findings support guideline-based prone positioning (≥ 16 h per session) and discourage routine use of prolonged sessions outside of clinical trials.

### The standard of care of patients with ARDS: ventilatory settings and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia [^115Zh7S1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Positioning

Indications for prone position

Prone position ventilation consists of delivering mechanical ventilation to the patient turned face-down. This method frequently and sometimes markedly improves oxygenation in patients with ARDS. As a treatment, prone position ventilation results in significantly better oxygenation than mechanical ventilation applied in the supine position in ARDS patients. As such prone positioning is used as an important strategy in life-threatening hypoxemia to avoid serious adverse events or death due to severe hypoxemia. In an individual patient-data meta-analysis of four large RCTs, prone position was associated with a significantly better survival rate in ARDS patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 100 mmHg. However, in a recent trial that showed significantly better survival in the prone position group compared to the supine position in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the benefit of proning was observed at any level of hypoxemia at the time of randomization and no correlation was found between the magnitude of oxygenation response of the first session and patient survival. Therefore, the beneficial effect of proning is likely explained by factors other than improvement in oxygenation. Among them the prevention of VALI is likely a major contributing factor to the benefit of proning. As such, it should be applied as first-line therapy to any patient with moderate or severe ARDS.

### Extended prone positioning duration for COVID-19-related ARDS: benefits and detriments [^114VkBGQ]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In Europe, between May 1, 2020, and March 10, 2022, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been responsible for an estimated 270,000 hospitalizations in intensive care units (ICU). A vast majority of these patients (80%) have required tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Whether or not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) physiopathology is the same in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients has been strongly debated. However, a relative consensus exists on the benefits of prone position (PP) and 70% of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS have been turned prone contrary to non-COVID-19 ARDS.

Failure of early studies on PP to demonstrate a survival benefit in non-COVID-19 ARDS has been attributed to the insufficient duration of sessions. The first study to demonstrate a clear improvement in survival applied PP sessions of 17 h and the recommended duration of PP is currently of at least 16 h. Pressure injuries are the main complications associated with this technique and are associated with longer stays, higher costs, and higher mortality.

Adherence to duration recommendations implies, however, that patients are turned prone between once and twice daily. Such a high frequency has several major drawbacks: intense workload, increased risk of accidental central venous catheter or tracheal tube removal at each procedure; ICU nurse and physician immobilization during the procedure; overall fatigue; viral exposition and time spent putting and removing personnel protective equipment. The high prevalence of overweight and obesity in COVID-19 patients only amplifies risks of musculoskeletal injuries for healthcare professionals.

For all these reasons, we decided since the beginning of the first wave of COVID-19 to extend the duration of PP sessions up to 48 h to minimize the number of turning procedures thus limiting staff exposure to viral contamination and reducing staff workload.

The primary objective of this retrospective observational study was to assess the safety of our strategy of extending prone position duration in a cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19-related ARDS by reporting the cumulative incidence of pressure injuries. The secondary objectives were to determine the risk factors associated with the occurrence of pressure injuries and to quantify changes in oxygenation and ventilatory parameters during PP sessions of extended duration.

### Efficacy of proning in acute respiratory distress syndrome on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^111fRpiz]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Proning also led to an increased P/F ratio in 68% of events in patients with COVID-19 who were cannulated for ECMO, which is similar to data for other series evaluating the effect of proning for intubated patients with COVID-19. This improvement in oxygenation was not attributable to any changes in ECMO flow, as the flow decreased or had minimal change in 82% of the events, with a mean decrease of 2% in ECMO flow.

While this analysis demonstrates both the safety and feasibility of proning patients cannulated for ECMO, with improved compliance and oxygenation in a majority of patients, we were unable to determine whether proning was associated with improved outcomes. The patients who were proned and those who were not both had good survival to decannulation (100% and 89%, respectively) and good survival to discharge (92% and 89%, respectively). However, this study points to 2 phenotypes of COVID-19 ARDS leading to ECMO requirement. The patients who were in the proned group were found to have significantly longer ECMO duration (52 vs 14 days, P < .0001), ventilator duration (72 vs 25 days, P < .0001), ventilator days after ECMO decannulation (18 vs 7 days, P < .0001), and hospital length of stay (91 vs 34 days, P < .0001). Given that patients were proned due to minimal or no improvement in ECMO requirement after 2 weeks, proning was not the primary variable that led to these differences, but rather was a secondary event after patients had clinically proven to be in the group requiring prolonged support. There was no significant difference in patient age, sex, body mass index, or preexisting conditions between the 2 groups, and the underlying cause for the different clinical courses is unknown. However, it is notable that the patients who were proned, despite significantly prolonged ECMO and ventilator support, had similar outcomes to the nonproned cohort. The good outcome of 90% survival to discharge (for the entire cohort) is contrary to one small single institution retrospective research letter showed a 79% 28-day mortality compared with the control ECMO group, with a 27% 28-day mortality. The differences between the reported data are likely due to multiple factors, but our series demonstrates that proning patients cannulated for ECMO is not necessarily associated with worse survival, as suggested by other data.

### Prone positioning for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS: a review [^114p8sEa]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Prone positioning is an immediately accessible, readily implementable intervention that was proposed initially as a method for improvement in gas exchange > 50 years ago. Initially implemented clinically as an empiric therapy for refractory hypoxemia, multiple clinical trials were performed on the use of prone positioning in various respiratory conditions, cumulating in the landmark Proning Severe ARDS Patients trial, which demonstrated mortality benefit in patients with severe ARDS. After this trial and the corresponding meta-analysis, expert consensus and societal guidelines recommended the use of prone positioning for the management of severe ARDS. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought prone positioning to the forefront of medicine, including widespread implementation of prone positioning in awake, spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Multiple clinical trials now have been performed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of prone positioning in these patients and have enhanced our understanding of the effects of the prone position in respiratory failure. In this review, we discuss the physiologic features, clinical outcome data, practical considerations, and lingering questions of prone positioning.

### To prone or not to prone ARDS patients on ECMO [^116NWb1s]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Research priorities

Several questions remain unanswered, so there is a lot of room for improvement in this field. The evidence is mainly based on physiological or observational studies that included a small number of patients and studies in ARDS patients not receiving ECMO. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are therefore needed to establish the role of the prone position in ARDS patients treated with ECMO. One of the most important unanswered questions is which ECMO patients would benefit from proning. It is also important to know about the relevance of timing of proning, as controversial results exist regarding the effectiveness of early and late proning. Finally, the duration of proning sessions is also important, as some data suggest that the benefits of the prone position may continuously increase beyond 16 h.

Currently, two large RCTs have been designed to analyze the effect of the prone position on ARDS patients treated with ECMO. The first study (Identifier NCT04139733) is designed to address the effect of early proning on the duration of ECMO. The second study (Identifier NCT04607551) aims to analyze the effects of proning on weaning from ECMO.

### Physiological response to prone positioning in intubated adults with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective study [^113Yguo1]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has specific characteristics compared to ARDS in other populations. Proning is recommended by analogy with other forms of ARDS, but few data are available regarding its physiological effects in this population. This study aimed to assess the effects of proning on oxygenation parameters (PaO 2 /FiO 2 and alveolo-arterial gradient (Aa-gradient)), blood gas analysis, ventilatory ratio (VR), respiratory system compliance (C RS) and estimated dead space fraction (V D /V T HB). We also looked for variables associated with treatment failure.

Methods

Retrospective monocentric study of intubated COVID-19 ARDS patients managed with an early intubation, low to moderate positive end-expiratory pressure and early proning strategy hospitalized from March 6 to April 30 2020. Blood gas analysis, PaO 2 /FiO 2, Aa-gradient, VR, C RS and V D /V T HB were compared before and at the end of each proning session with paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05 considered as significant). Proportions were assessed using Fischer exact test or Chi square test.

Results

Forty-two patients were included for a total of 191 proning sessions, median duration of 16 (5–36) hours. Considering all sessions, PaO 2 /FiO 2 increased (180 [148–210] vs 107 [90–129] mmHg, p < 0.001) and Aa-gradient decreased (127 [92–176] vs 275 [211–334] mmHg, p < 0.001) with proning. C RS (36.2 [30.0–41.8] vs 32.2 [27.5–40.9] ml/cmH 2 O, p = 0.003), VR (2.4 [2.0–2.9] vs 2.3 [1.9–2.8], p = 0.028) and V D /V T HB (0.72 [0.67–0.76] vs 0.71 [0.65–0.76], p = 0.022) slightly increased. Considering the first proning session, PaO 2 /FiO 2 increased (186 [165–215] vs 104 [94–126] mmHg, p < 0.001) and Aa-gradient decreased (121 [89–160] vs 276 [238–321] mmHg, p < 0.001), while C RS, VR and V D /V T HB were unchanged. Similar variations were observed during the subsequent proning sessions. Among the patients who experienced treatment failure (defined as ICU death or need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), fewer expressed a positive response in terms of oxygenation (defined as increase of more than 20% in PaO 2 /FiO 2) to the first proning (67 vs 97%, p = 0.020).

Conclusion

Proning in COVID-19 ARDS intubated patients led to an increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 and a decrease in Aa-gradient if we consider all the sessions together, the first one or the 4 subsequent sessions independently. When considering all sessions, C RS increased and VR and V D /V T HB only slightly increased.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115RW6uw]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current evidence does not support the use of prolonged prone positioning outside of clinical trials. To date, no adequately powered RCT has specifically addressed this question. Our systematic review identified three RCTs and six observational studies comparing prolonged with standard prone positioning. One RCT and four observational studies were of high or critical risk of bias, leaving limited high-quality data for pooled analysis. None of the analyses, including those with all eligible studies, those restricted to low-to-moderate risk of bias studies, and sensitivity analyses, revealed statistically significant effects of PPP on primary or secondary outcomes assessing effectiveness or adverse events (Table 3). The wide confidence intervals observed throughout our analysis reflect limited statistical power. Consequently, neither harm nor benefit can be definitely excluded, which underscores the uncertainty of these findings. Most studies enrolled patients with COVID‑19–related ARDS, limiting the generalizability of these findings to other ARDS etiologies. Notably, the total cumulative prone time varied considerably across and within studies, which may have contributed to heterogeneity in the results.

Table 3
Summary of findings

CI: confidence interval; HR: hazard ratio; NRSI: non-randomized trial of interventions; PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen; RCT: randomized controlled trial; RR: risk ratio; SMD: standardized mean difference

Prone positioning is a cornerstone therapy for patients with moderate to severe ARDS and one of the few interventions proven to improve survival in randomized trials. Early studies employing relatively short prone sessions reported no clinical benefit, whereas subsequent trials demonstrated that sessions of at least 16 h, in combination with lung-protective ventilation strategies, significantly reduce mortality. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of prone positioning remains uncertain. Prolongation of sessions may help sustain alveolar recruitment and mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury, potentially improving outcomes, but it may also increase the need for deeper sedation and the risk of complications such as pressure injuries, thereby offsetting potential benefits.

### An updated study-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on proning in ARDS and acute lung injury [^1163h5iU]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The use of prone positioning during ARDS ventilation has a robust scientific ground.

- Available RCTs that were frequently underpowered failed to document an impact on mortality mainly because they included patients with a wide spectrum of disease (ALI and ARDS) and applied variable length of prone positioning.

- Study-level meta-analyses published so far only suggested beneficial effects on mortality.

- Meta-analyses of individual patient data have recently shown that prone positioning could reduce ICU mortality in the subgroup of the most severe patients (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 100 mmHg).

- Using a subgroup analysis focusing on trials that restricted inclusion to only ARDS patients, our study-level meta-analysis shows that prone positioning reduces ICU mortality in patients with ARDS.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^111R7a8i]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Expert statement

Systemic corticosteroids should be used in patients with critical COVID-19.

Dexamethasone is the preferred choice of systemic corticosteroids in patients of C-ARF.

The daily dose of dexamethasone should be 6 mg.

The preferred duration of systemic corticosteroids is 5–10 days.

Discussion

There is a strong suggestion for the use of systemic corticosteroids in critical COVID-19 [World Health Organisation (WHO) definition for COVID-19-ARDS, sepsis and septic shock] to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Experts preferred the use of dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg daily for a duration of 5–10 days, as used in the RECOVERY trial over other corticosteroids, higher dose and longer duration. The RECOVERY trial and subsequent trials on corticosteroids in COVID-19 found a mortality benefit with its use. However, some questions remain unanswered, such as the type, duration of corticosteroid therapy, timing of initiation and role of a higher dose. The results of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04395105 and NCT04509973) will provide further information.

Awake self-proning

Expert statement

Awake self-proning may improve oxygenation when used in patients with C-ARF requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO 2) > 90%.

Discussion

Use of early prone position in patients with severe ARDS on invasive mechanical ventilation has been shown to significantly reduce mortality. Though small observational studies in non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients have reported improvements in oxygenation with awake self-proning, its impact on reducing tracheal intubation or mortality is unknown. Studies have shown either conflicting results or are difficult to interpret, as awake self-proning was used in combination with other non-invasive respiratory support. In addition, there is a concern about delaying intubation in patients in whom awake self-proning is used. Ongoing RCTs on awake self-proning in C-ARF (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04395144, NCT04347941, NCT04350723) may provide further guidance.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114wJ7CP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — systemic corticosteroids: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients and probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of hospital stay, but the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain. Safety signals include that corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

Development of Clinical Recommendations

Each group convened to develop initial recommendations for the individual PICO questions. The co-chairs and methodologists led the groups through a discussion of the evidence profiles and GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to determine the direction and strength of the recommendations (see online supplement). As part of the GRADE Evidence to Decision process, we considered the certainty of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, patient preferences and values, resource use, implications for health equity, acceptability of the intervention to stakeholders, and clinical feasibility. Evidence across the full spectrum of ARDS severity was unavailable for some interventions. For those interventions, recommendations were limited to the specific severity subgroups (i.e. mild, moderate, or severe) for which evidence was sufficient, and no recommendation was made for the subgroups for which it was not. Each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional" (Table 2). After the individual groups generated draft recommendations, these were presented to the full panel for detailed discussion, input, and approval. Final recommendations were determined by consensus of the full panel. Consistent with the GRADE approach, we had planned to use voting for recommendations that could not achieve consensus through discussion, but this was not required.

Table 2.
Implications of Strong versus Conditional Recommendations

Manuscript Preparation

The writing committee composed of the chairs and co-chairs drafted the guideline document for subsequent review by the panel. We summarized the rationale and supporting evidence for each recommendation, as well as issues raised during the GRADE Evidence to Decision process. A patient representative reviewed the draft guidelines and provided feedback regarding the recommendations and selected patient-centered outcomes, which were incorporated into the document. We then integrated feedback from all panel members into the manuscript. The entire panel approved the final wording of the recommendations and justifications, which was then submitted to ATS for review and approval.

### The effect of prone positioning on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111MLJDU]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prone positioning (PP) has been reported to improve the survival of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is uncertain whether the beneficial effects of PP are associated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and long durations of PP. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate whether the effects of PP on mortality could be affected by PEEP level and PP duration and to identify which patients might benefit the most from PP.

Methods

Publications describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which investigators have compared prone and supine ventilation were retrieved by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science and Elsevier Science (inception to May 2013). Two investigators independently selected RCTs and assessed their quality. The data extracted from the RCTs were combined in a cumulative meta-analysis and analyzed using methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Results

A total of nine RCTs with an aggregate of 2,242 patients were included. All of the studies received scores of up to three points using the methods recommended by Jadad et al. One trial did not conceal allocation. This meta-analysis revealed that, compared with supine positioning, PP decreased the 28- to 30-day mortality of ARDS patients with a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤ 100 mmHg (n = 508, risk ratio (RR) = 0.71, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.57 to 0.89; P = 0.003). PP was shown to reduce both 60-day mortality (n = 518, RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68 to 0.99; P = 0.04) and 90-day mortality (n = 516, RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.75; P < 0.0001) in ARDS patients ventilated with PEEP ≥ 10 cmH2O. Moreover, PP reduced 28- to 30-day mortality when the PP duration was > 12 h/day (n = 1,067, RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

PP reduced mortality among patients with severe ARDS and patients receiving relatively high PEEP levels. Moreover, long-term PP improved the survival of ARDS patients.

Search results and trial characteristics

We identified 48 studies for detailed evaluation (Figure 1). Seven RCTs eventually met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In comparison with our previous meta-analysis, one paediatric study was not included according to our new selection criteria, and three new RCTs issued during the past 2 years were added.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the meta-analysis.

The study characteristics and methodological quality are presented in Table 1. These seven studies included 1,675 patients, of whom 862 were ventilated in the prone position for 7 to 24 hours/day. While early studies (published before 2006) included patients (n = 1,135) with a large spectrum of disease severity (ALI and ARDS), used a short duration of prone positioning (< 17 hours), and did not use a protective lung ventilation, the four most recent trials were quite similar regarding patient severity (only ARDS patients were included, n = 540), applied the longest proning duration (17 to 24 hours/day), and ventilated patients with protective lung ventilation.

### The effect of prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury: a meta-analysis. areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^113NpP3K]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of ventilation in prone and in supine position in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS).

Design

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

BioMedCentral, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase (to November 2007), with additional information from authors.

Measurements and Results

From selected randomised controlled trials comparing positioning in ALI/ARDS we extracted data concerning study design, disease severity, clinical outcomes, and adverse events. Five trials including 1,372 patients met the inclusion criteria for mortality analysis; one trial was added to assess the effects on acquisition of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The included trials were significantly underpowered and enrolled patients with varying severity. Prone positioning duration and mechanical ventilation strategy were not standardised across studies. Using a fixed-effects model, we did not find a significant effect of prone positioning (proning) on mortality (odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.77–1.22). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased significantly more with proning (weighted means difference 25 mmHg, p < 0.00001). Proning was associated with a non-significant 23% reduction in the odds of VAP (p = 0.09), and with no increase in major adverse airway complications: OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.71–1.43. Length of intensive care unit stay was marginally and not significantly increased by proning.

Conclusions

Prone position is not associated with a significant reduction in mortality from ALI/ARDS despite a significant increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2), is safe, and tends to decrease VAP. Published studies exhibit substantial clinical heterogeneity, suggesting that an adequately sized study optimising the duration of proning and ventilation strategy is warranted to enable definitive conclusions to be drawn.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1175sHG9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in ARDS — prone positioning recommendation states that adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receive prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-high confidence in effect estimates. The panel notes a lack of consensus on providing a conditional recommendation for prone positioning in patients with moderate ARDS with a Pao2/Fio2 of 101–150 because of lower confidence in the balance of outcomes, and it is unknown whether higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can potentiate the lung-protective effects of prone positioning; trials to date have used moderate levels of PEEP and further research is required to evaluate the benefit of higher PEEP during prone positioning.

Conclusions

In conclusion, timing from ARDS onset is an important factor in the effect of proning on oxygenation response in patients with ARDS. Proning at a later stage of ARDS has limited effect on oxygenation. However, it is important to recognize the beneficial effects of proning in previous studies were not explained by the oxygenation response.

ADJUNCTS TO MECHANICAL VENTILATION

Prone Position

The PROSEVA multicenter trial (27 ICUs) confirmed a significant mortality reduction in ARDS patients enrolled after a 12-hour to 24-hour stabilization period with a Pa 2 /FIO 2 ratio < 150 mm Hg, with PEEP at least 5 cm H 2 O, FIO 2 at least 60%, and tidal volume 6 mL/kg PBW. Patients had, on average, four prone sessions of at least 16 hours duration. Prone position was continued even in the absence of improved oxygenation. This trial validated the results of a previous patient-level meta-analysis from 4 earlier randomized trials which demonstrated significant mortality reduction with prone position in severe ARDS patients. Prone position should be considered in all appropriate patients and maintained daily until the Pa 2 /FIO 2 ratio remains > 150 mm Hg, with PEEP ≤ 10 cm H 2 O, FIO 2 ≤ 60% for at least 4 hours after the end of the most recent proning session. Importantly, ICU-specific prone position protocols and appropriate ICU staff training are required for patient safety.

In trauma patients with severe ARDS, specific considerations which require discussion prior to prone position therapy include need for spine stabilization, traumatic brain injury management, pelvic fracture external fixation, and open abdomen. In most cases, these are not absolute contraindications to prone positioning for treatment of severe ARDS given the high ARDS-associated mortality rate.

### Driving pressure in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with respiratory distress duration before intubation [^115hX7sJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled all consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS who were admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital (April to December 2020). Patients were included if they were on IMV and had positive PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and ARDS. The local ethics committee (protocol number 53398/2020) approved the study with a waiver for informed consent. The primary outcome was the identification of predictors independently associated with patients' respiratory mechanics upon ICU admission.

In all patients, a lung protective protocol (Vof 6–8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and proning [if Pa O 2 /F O 2 < 150 mm Hg]) was adopted. Positive end-expiratory pressure was set after a recruitment maneuver at the level of the lowest DP.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112w156e]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings align with current international guidelines recommending prone positioning for at least 16 h per session, but do not support routine use of prolonged prone sessions outside clinical trials. Consistent with prior meta-analyses and large cohort studies, we found no clear evidence to support further extension beyond this duration. Future research should prioritize randomized controlled trials employing standardized definitions and protocols, with systematic reporting of both individual session length and cumulative prone time. Such studies are essential to determine whether particular patient subgroups may derive benefit from tailored proning strategies. Until such evidence emerges, adherence to current guideline recommendations remains the most appropriate clinical approach.
