## Question

What duration and dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the optimal dose and duration of therapy across medical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the question is drug-specific or principle-based. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and how to appraise studies for dose–duration optimization. Next, I will extract generalizable principles and exemplify them with high-quality data. After that, I should consider special populations and safety trade-offs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight uncertainties that require shared decision-making and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. The query is framed broadly, so I need to ensure I address principles that apply across drugs and conditions rather than a single-agent answer. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should anchor the reasoning in cross-cutting evidence and guidelines that repeatedly grapple with dose, duration, and individualization, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, endocrine therapies, and rehabilitation interventions, while noting where evidence is strong versus uncertain [^d78124c7] [^4d3b0de1] [^828a61bc] [^a16bb71d].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and appraisal approach. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and high-credibility guidelines carry the most weight; cohort and case-control studies inform associations but are more vulnerable to confounding; expert opinion and mechanistic data are supportive but lower in certainty. I need to check that I classify each source accordingly and explicitly state limitations, especially when heterogeneity, indirectness, or imprecision affect confidence in estimates [^0502a522] [^d78124c7] [^e51dc8ff].

> I will now examine generalizable principles for dose selection. Let me think about three pillars: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, exposure–response relationships, and individual patient factors. For antibiotics, PK/PD targets like time above MIC for beta-lactams and AUC/MIC for fluoroquinolones guide dose and interval; for anticoagulants, INR-based targets individualize warfarin dosing; for targeted oncology agents, MTD may not be optimal and lower, biologically active doses can improve the therapeutic window. I should confirm that I cite examples where dose optimization improved outcomes or tolerability without sacrificing efficacy [^094520ec] [^4d3b0de1] [^cc48b83c] [^a1df19de].

> Now, for duration, I need to ensure I distinguish disease biology from habit-driven defaults. Shorter effective courses reduce toxicity, resistance, and cost without compromising cure in many infections; for example, 3 days of amoxicillin can be noninferior to 5 days for chest-indrawing pneumonia in children, and many common infections show noninferiority of short versus long courses. But wait, what if the pathogen or site requires longer therapy? Osteomyelitis and certain severe infections still need extended courses, and cystic fibrosis exacerbations lack definitive duration data, so I should avoid overgeneralization and align duration with pathogen, site, severity, and response [^80e86e5b] [^e51dc8ff] [^8694a6a7] [^19dafcfe].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. Age, renal and hepatic function, body size, comorbidities, and genetics can shift PK/PD and safety thresholds; for instance, warfarin requires INR-guided titration with age-adjusted starts in older adults, and growth hormone dosing is titrated to IGF-1 with attention to age and estrogen status. I should double-check that I emphasize starting low and titrating to effect while monitoring biomarkers or clinical response, especially in pediatrics and frail adults [^4d3b0de1] [^828a61bc] [^8903e096].

> Hold on, I should verify safety trade-offs and the principle of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration. This is repeatedly endorsed for NSAIDs, opioids, and steroids, and is reflected in oncology moves away from MTD toward minimum effective dosing. I need to ensure I note that chronic low-grade toxicities can degrade adherence and net benefit, which is why duration ceilings and taper strategies matter in long-term therapies [^7cc67639] [^2571af43] [^a4350e01] [^fabeac07].

> Next, I should review exemplars that integrate dose and duration with outcomes. For sodium restriction, each 50 mmol/day reduction in urinary sodium yields about a 1.1 mmHg systolic BP reduction, with larger effects in older adults, non-White populations, and those with higher baseline BP; short-term trials underestimate effects, supporting longer, sustained interventions. For stroke rehabilitation, dose–response relationships suggest optimal session frequency and duration around 4–6 sessions per week and roughly 45 minutes per session for mental health gains, though I should acknowledge heterogeneity and the need for individualized programs [^3d8d9583] [^a6e9f757].

> I should confirm the role of adaptive and platform trial designs in resolving dose–duration uncertainty. Drop-the-loser and Bayesian utility designs can efficiently map duration–response curves and identify subgroup-specific optima, while platform trials allow adding or dropping arms as resistance patterns or standards evolve. These designs are particularly relevant for antibiotics and other areas where static guidelines lag behind evolving evidence [^a2d559e5] [^2c8d95bd].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework without oversimplifying. First, define the clinical question and outcome hierarchy, including efficacy, safety, resistance, and cost. Second, appraise the highest-quality evidence for dose–response and duration–response, noting whether data are direct or indirect. Third, individualize based on patient factors and local epidemiology. Fourth, set a monitoring plan with stop rules or reassessment triggers. Fifth, document the rationale and engage in shared decision-making when evidence is weak or trade-offs are substantial. I need to ensure this aligns with stewardship and guideline-based care where available [^d78124c7] [^71f407d3] [^4d3b0de1].

> But wait, what if the evidence is insufficient or conflicting? I should explicitly flag uncertainties and propose mitigation. For example, cystic fibrosis IV antibiotic duration lacks definitive RCTs, so decisions should incorporate clinical response, access, and patient preference; similarly, some endocrine and rheumatologic therapies require ongoing reassessment of benefit–risk with biomarker or symptom-guided adjustments. I should double-check that I communicate these gaps transparently to avoid overpromising certainty [^8694a6a7] [^19dafcfe] [^231432e3].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. Optimal dose and duration are not universal constants; they are moving targets shaped by disease biology, drug PK/PD, patient factors, and the quality of evidence. The safest, most evidence-aligned approach is to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, titrate to measurable response, and adapt as new data emerge, recognizing that some conditions still require prolonged or high-intensity therapy. I should confirm that this synthesis reflects the balance of high-credibility guidelines, meta-analyses, and pivotal trials across the examples cited [^e51dc8ff] [^4d3b0de1] [^3d8d9583] [^a6e9f757].

The optimal dose and duration of therapy depend on the **drug, indication, and patient factors** [^cc48b83c]; there is no universal answer. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the **shortest effective duration** [^7cc67639], balancing efficacy and safety [^2571af43]. For antibiotics, shorter courses are often noninferior to longer courses and reduce resistance and adverse effects [^e51dc8ff] [^506a7cbd]. For chronic diseases, titrate to response and reassess regularly [^828a61bc]. Always individualize based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response [^4d3b0de1].

---

## General principles for determining dose and duration

Several **general principles** apply across therapeutic areas:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose to minimize adverse effects and toxicity [^7cc67639] [^2571af43].
- **Shortest effective duration**: Use the shortest effective duration to reduce exposure-related harms, including resistance and adverse effects [^e51dc8ff] [^506a7cbd].
- **Individualization**: Tailor dose and duration to patient-specific factors such as age, weight, renal/hepatic function, comorbidities, and response [^4d3b0de1] [^828a61bc].
- **Evidence-based guidelines**: Follow current guidelines and high-quality evidence to guide decisions [^4db5541c] [^3d8d9583].

---

## Examples by therapeutic area

### Antibiotics

- **Shorter courses**: Multiple RCTs show shorter antibiotic courses (e.g. 3–7 days) are noninferior to longer courses (10–14 days) for many infections, including community-acquired pneumonia, UTIs, and skin infections [^e51dc8ff] [^506a7cbd].
- **Resistance**: Shorter courses reduce antibiotic exposure and resistance risk without compromising efficacy [^e8235c11] [^506a7cbd].
- **Exceptions**: Some infections (e.g. osteomyelitis, endocarditis) may require longer courses based on clinical judgment and response [^e51dc8ff].

---

### Anticoagulation therapy

- **Warfarin**: Dose is individualized to maintain INR 2.0–3.0; duration varies by indication (e.g. 3 months for provoked VTE, indefinite for recurrent unprovoked VTE) [^4d3b0de1] [^9391f5a4].
- **DOACs**: Fixed doses (e.g. rivaroxaban 20 mg daily) are used with duration tailored to indication and patient risk [^notfound].

---

### Oncology

- **Cytotoxic chemotherapy**: Historically dosed to maximum tolerated dose (MTD), but this may not optimize efficacy or tolerability [^cc48b83c].
- **Targeted therapy**: Dose optimization focuses on efficacy and tolerability, often using lower, continuous doses rather than MTD [^a1df19de].
- **Immunotherapy**: Dose and duration are guided by response and toxicity, with many agents given until progression or unacceptable toxicity [^notfound].

---

### Chronic disease management

- **Growth hormone**: Dose is titrated to normalize IGF-1, with duration individualized to response and tolerability [^828a61bc] [^8903e096].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: DMARDs are continued at full dose until remission, then tapered cautiously; duration is often long-term [^619acffb].
- **Polymyalgia rheumatica**: Glucocorticoids are tapered over 1–2 years based on response and relapse risk [^notfound].

## Factors influencing dose and duration decisions

| **Factor** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Drug properties | Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life, mechanism of action [^094520ec] [^e8235c11] |
| Disease characteristics | Severity, chronicity, organ involvement, resistance patterns [^e51dc8ff] [^f72020f7] |
| Patient factors | Age, weight, renal/hepatic function, comorbidities, genetics, adherence [^4d3b0de1] [^828a61bc] |
| Clinical evidence | RCTs, guidelines, meta-analyses, real-world data [^e51dc8ff] [^4db5541c] |
| Safety profile | Adverse effects, toxicity, drug interactions [^7cc67639] [^2571af43] |

---

## Risks of inappropriate dose or duration

- **Underdosing/short duration**: Treatment failure, relapse, resistance, progression [^8694a6a7] [^e8235c11].
- **Overdosing/long duration**: Increased toxicity, adverse effects, resistance, cost [^506a7cbd] [^d78124c7].
- **Fixed-duration regimens**: May not account for individual response, leading to over- or undertreatment [^f72020f7] [^b7f6882f].

---

## Current research and future directions

- **Personalized medicine**: Efforts to tailor dose and duration using biomarkers, genetics, and patient-reported outcomes [^cc48b83c] [^828a61bc].
- **Adaptive trials**: Designs that allow real-time dose and duration optimization based on accumulating data [^a2d559e5] [^2c8d95bd].
- **Shorter courses**: Continued research to identify infections where shorter courses are safe and effective [^e51dc8ff] [^506a7cbd].

---

The optimal dose and duration are **context-specific** and should be individualized to balance efficacy and safety. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective duration, guided by evidence and patient factors, with regular reassessment to adjust therapy as needed [^7cc67639] [^4d3b0de1].

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^2c8d95bd]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In situations where the optimal decision regarding the best treatment depends on various endpoints, maximising a utility function (or minimising a loss function), a decision-theoretic Bayes (or full Bayesian) approach provides an intuitive solution. A recent Bayesian response-adaptive randomised trial evaluating the usefulness of gepotidacin for the treatment of patients with Gram-positive acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections used a utility function to determine the optimal treatment dose. The dose–response-for-cure rate was modelled using a normal dynamic linear model with the parameter evolution described by a Gaussian random walk, while the dose–response-for-the-discontinuation rate was modelled with a two-parameter logistic model assuming a monotonic change. The cure rate component and the treatment discontinuation component were combined multiplicatively to yield the final utility. An advantage of using a utility function is that the trade-offs between the different components are made explicit and quantified. This approach provides the answer we really want to know, namely 'what is the optimal treatment duration taking into account the trade-offs between efficacy and safety and antibiotic resistance development?' However, given the difficulty in devising a generally acceptable utility function and the computational complexities, the decision-theoretic Bayes approach using a utility function is rarely used. A problem with applying the decision-theoretic approach in medicine is that there are many decision-makers at different stages, including policy-makers, physicians and patients, who likely have different opinions and utility functions. For example, different individuals may not agree that the cure and the discontinuation rates can be combined multiplicatively, and therefore also question the validity of the response-adaptive changes in the trial.

Given these and other difficulties with implementing a decision-theoretic approach, it may be more practical to model separate duration–response curves for efficacy, antibiotic resistance and toxicity during the trial, and combine the information from the different duration–response curves with additional information, such as costs or estimated longer term influence on resistance, into a decision analytic framework. Optimal durations can then be assessed for various prior opinions and utility functions of the different stakeholders.

The optimal treatment duration may differ depending on host- or pathogen-specific characteristics. Formally, this can be tested by including different subgroup-specific interaction terms in models relating duration to response. This could allow stratified medicine, enabling different optimal durations to be identified depending on key patient characteristics.

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^d8bcbb9c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Two conceptualizations of sleep duration — an optimal dose of sleep model and a sleep saturation model are presented. The green line represents an optimal dose of sleep where the odds of incident disease are lowest, whereas the orange line represents a sleep saturation model in which longer sleep is not necessarily associated with poor health and may be beneficial in some circumstances such as recovery from sleep deprivation or illness.

The verdict

Given the considerations laid out above, the fixed duration and the drop-the-loser duration designs theoretically have the most potential to identify optimal antibiotic treatment durations. These designs (1) are less vulnerable to allocation concealment bias than the RAR design; (2) are not vulnerable (fixed duration) or are less vulnerable (drop-the-loser) to time-trend bias compared to the RAR or play-the-winner designs; (3) are not associated with the important logistical challenges often accompanying adaptive trials that allow for changes in the allocation ratios (play-the-winner and RAR designs); and (4) are more likely than the RAR and play-the-winner designs to have sufficient numbers of patients in each arm and/or subgroup at the end of the trial to estimate the complete duration–response curve with sufficient precision, and hence enable evaluation of the potential for important differences in the optimal duration within specific subgroups.

A potential advantage of the drop-the-loser design over the fixed duration design is that the former can drop duration arms that are clearly inferior versus the standard (maximum) duration based on formal statistical analysis. This may ethically be more acceptable by reducing the number of patients allocated to inferior treatment durations.

Although we have only provided theoretical considerations regarding these four designs, we urge the research community to consider developing, testing and applying alternative trial designs that can identify optimal treatment durations, including sample size calculations.

Extensions

Whilst we have focussed on antibiotic duration, evidence supporting doses of many commonly used antibiotics is similarly scarce, and similar methods could also be used to optimise dose. In practice, particularly in primary care, different durations may well be completely equivalent in terms of acute recovery, yet rare but important complications may vary with different durations. Very large numbers would need to be randomised to estimate 'duration–response curves' for these rare outcomes, potentially as co-primary endpoints, or incorporated in a decision analytic framework together with other outcomes. Finally, in the context of changing patterns of resistance or access to care, for example, the optimal duration for any specific indication today may not be optimal tomorrow. A platform duration trial, which allows for the dropping and addition of arms, could be a solution to providing continuously relevant evidence, and would also enable different durations of different drugs to be compared.

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^ceb3fcb3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and Sleep Research Society (SRS) consensus — discussion and rationale for a threshold without an upper limit: The consensus panel focused solely on the dimension of sleep duration, and the recommendation statement indicates a threshold value for the sleep duration necessary to support optimal health in adults, which implies that more sleep is likely not damaging to health. By contrast, an "optimal dose" range model suggests health is compromised by obtaining too little or too much sleep. Since the panel could not reach consensus that longer sleep was physiologically harmful, and since there was a consensus that longer sleep is beneficial for some individuals (e.g., younger adults, those recovering from sleep loss), no upper limit of sleep duration was included in the recommendation statement. More importantly, regardless of whether a threshold or range model is endorsed, both constructs support the notion that too little sleep is unhealthy.

### Novel clinical trial designs with dose optimization to improve long-term outcomes [^a1df19de]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conventional designs for choosing a dose for a new therapy may select doses that are unsafe or ineffective and fail to optimize progression-free survival time, overall survival time, or response/remission duration. We explain and illustrate limitations of conventional dose-finding designs and make four recommendations to address these problems. When feasible, a dose-finding design should account for long-term outcomes, include screening rules that drop unsafe or ineffective doses, enroll an adequate sample size, and randomize patients among doses. As illustrations, we review three designs that include one or more of these features. The first illustration is a trial that randomized patients among two cell therapy doses and standard of care in a setting where it was assumed on biological grounds that dose toxicity and dose-response curves did not necessarily increase with cell dose. The second design generalizes phase I-II by first identifying a set of candidate doses, rather than one dose, randomizing additional patients among the candidates, and selecting an optimal dose to maximize progression-free survival over a longer follow-up period. The third design combines a phase I-II trial and a group sequential randomized phase III trial by using survival time data available after the first stage of phase III to reoptimize the dose selected in phase I-II. By incorporating one or more of the recommended features, these designs improve the likelihood that a selected dose or schedule will be optimal, and thus will benefit future patients and obtain regulatory approval.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^36b1e2b3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes." It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention," and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined," considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### Controversies in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer – what is the optimal combination of hormonal therapy and radiotherapy: a review of literature [^0a17a426]. The Prostate (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In high-risk prostate carcinoma, there is controversy whether these patients should be treated with escalated-dose (≥ 74 Gy) or conventional-dose radiotherapy (< 74 Gy) combined with hormonal therapy. Furthermore, the issue of the optimal duration and timing of hormonal therapy are not well crystallized.

Patients and Methods

A search for evidence from randomized- and large non-randomized studies in order to address these issues, was therefore initiated. For this purpose, MedLine, EMbase, and PubMed and the data base of the Dutch randomized dose-escalation trial, were consulted.

Results and Conclusions

From this search it was concluded that the benefit of hormonal therapy in combination with conventional-dose radiotherapy (< 74 Gy) in high-risk prostate cancer is evident (Level 2 evidence); Levels 2 and 3 evidence were provided by several studies supporting the use of escalated-dose radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer. For the combination of hormonal therapy with escalated-dose radiotherapy in these patients, there is Level 2 evidence for moderately escalated dose (74 Gy) and high escalated dose (≥ 78 Gy). The optimal duration and timing of hormonal therapy are not well defined. More randomized-controlled trials and meta-analyses are therefore needed to clearly determine the independent role of dose-escalation in high-risk patients treated with hormonal therapy and the optimal duration and timing of hormonal therapy.

### Vedolizumab: what is the benefit from increasing the dose frequency? [^d52e6e0e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Vedolizumab was introduced in 2014 as a therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Although recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence were based on a maintenance dose of 300 mg administered intravenously every 8 weeks, the Summary of Product Characteristics includes an option of increasing the frequency of dosing for patients who initially respond but later experience a decrease in response. In this literature review of the evidence for a shorter duration between doses we identified seven studies which report that dose interval shortening recaptures response in around 50% of cases with remission rates of 11% to 34% between 4 and 52 weeks. A sustained response was seen in the majority of patients for up to 1 year, however, patients continued to receive escalated dosing for up to 100 weeks, which does not reflect clinical practice where short-term escalation is usually prescribed. There is a lack of randomised controlled trials and a lack of trials reporting endoscopic remission, which is the goal of care in IBD. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to guide dose escalation is uncertain and further studies are required to help clarify the role of TDM.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^b18c8eb6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Implementation of treatment — Principle 10 (adequate dose and duration) — states that trials should be conducted at a dose and duration sufficient to qualify as adequate, noting dosing is "measured by milligrams per day, milligrams per kilogram per day, or blood level," stimulants "can be dosed empirically or on milligrams per kilogram per dose or milligrams per kilogram per day basis," and that "An older child may require larger doses and more upward dose adjustments…; therefore, the trial may take longer for older and larger children." It adds that "Antidepressants do not work as quickly as stimulants and may require upward of 8 weeks of treatment at an optimal dose to identify a response," that "Completing a trial of adequate dose and duration gives the child the best chance to be able to benefit from a single medication," and warns "The outcomes of medication trials that are not adequate in either dose or duration are difficult to interpret" and "Inadequate medication trials may increase the risk that children will not have the opportunity to benefit or put children at risk for multiple medication switches or medication combinations."

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^1e953fde]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to GH therapy, dosing and duration, AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal duration of recombinant human GH replacement therapy. Consider continuing treatment indefinitely if patients on recombinant human GH replacement experience beneficial effects on QoL and objective improvements in biochemistry, body composition and bone mineral density.

### Dosage and duration of medication for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: two questions without definitive answers [^9c07f68e]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, the dosage and duration of medication in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia are discussed. There is no official guideline, however, and even no professional agreement on these points.

Recent Findings

Considering the dosage, dose-titration is probably not a drawback as there is a high risk of undertreatment or overtreatment when using a single dosage for every patient. Duration of treatment is a matter of concern. A quarter of patients discontinue their treatment early. For the others, a long period of treatment may be mandatory for those patients who are at risk of progression. After a course of medication (6 months to 1 year), a trial without treatment may help to decide whether treatment must be continued if symptoms relapse.

Summary

For men with lower urinary tract symptoms, there seems to be no definitive answer about the appropriate dosage and duration of medicine.

### Interplay between duration of androgen deprivation therapy and external beam radiotherapy with or without a brachytherapy boost for optimal treatment of high-risk prostate cancer: a patient-level data analysis of 3 cohorts [^7639a641]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the optimal minimum duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) when treating high-risk prostate cancer with high-dose radiotherapy?

Findings

This patient-level cohort study of 3 cohorts found a significant interaction between the type of high-dose radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy with or without a brachytherapy boost) and optimal duration. Prolonging ADT for 18 to 28 months was associated with a 63% reduction in death or metastasis with external beam radiotherapy; when a brachytherapy boost was added, the nonlinear association between ADT and distant metastasis-free survival was broad and spanned 12 months.

Meaning

The findings of this cohort study suggest that patients receiving external beam radiotherapy alone may benefit from ADT durations of 18 months or more; if a brachytherapy boost is added, a duration of 18 months or possibly less may be optimal.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^e51dc8ff]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

### Optimizing drug exposure to minimize selection of antibiotic resistance [^e8235c11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance is a concern for public health. The fact that the choice of dose and treatment duration can affect the selection of antibiotic-resistant mutants is becoming more evident, and an increased number of studies have used pharmacodynamic models to describe the drug exposure and pharmacodynamic breakpoints needed to minimize and predict the development of resistance. However, there remains a lack of sufficient data, and future work is needed to fully characterize these target drug concentrations. More knowledge is also needed of drug pharmacodynamics versus bacteria with different resistance mutations and susceptibility levels. The dosing regimens should exhibit high efficacy not only against susceptible wild-type bacteria but, preferably, also against mutated bacteria that may exist in low numbers in "susceptible" populations. Thus, to prolong the life span of existing and new antibiotics, it is important that dosing regimens be carefully selected on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that prevent emergence of preexisting and newly formed mutants.

### Aspirin in tuberculous meningitis [^100930ce]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Similarly to optimal dose, optimal duration of treatment with aspirin in TBM is poorly understood, demonstrated here by the differing treatment duration in the three RCTs (1 month, 60 days, 3 months). Mortality in TBM occurs predominantly in the two weeks after diagnosishowever neuroinflammatory sequelae that lead to morbidity can develop beyond this time. In a recent study of patients with TBM, acute infarcts were predominantly observed on baseline scans (26/60,43%) with only 1/33 undergoing follow-up imaging demonstrating new evidence of infarction 60 days later. Here, 89% of patients showed worsening MRI findings despite treatment including 82% (27/33) with new or enlarged tuberculomas and 76% (25/33) with worsening meningeal enhancement. The discussion around optimal duration therefore must consider the mechanism for which aspirin is used, which in turn reverts to discussion on optimal dose and mechanisms of action; optimal duration may differ depending on whether low (anti-platelet) or high (anti-inflammatory) doses are being used, and whether use is to prevent stroke, or whether there is potential to prevent other neuroinflammatory sequalae.

Consideration of means to assess outcome is also required; the authors concluded that aspirin may have a role in stroke prevention, which was a secondary outcome in this meta-analysis, however there were substantial differences in the type and timing of brain imaging conducted by each study. Pre- and post-contrast MRI is the modality of choice in TBM, but access to this is limited, particularly in settings where TBM is common. CT imaging is limited in its ability to detect new infarcts in particular those that are acute, small (e.g. lacunar), or located in the posterior fossa, which must be considered within the analyses. The finding that radiological changes occurred in the absence of clinical deterioration in the aforementioned study, also supports the need for pre-specified imaging timepoints despite clinical course.

This meta-analysis provides welcome stimulus for discussion on the potential benefit of aspirin in TBM, however also highlights the lack of consensus on its use. Results from RCT underway (NCT03927313, NCT04145258) will shed light on this, in particular optimal dosing, and may in turn increase what is currently a weak armoury of host directed therapies for patients with TBM.

### Under the radar-frequency, timing, duration, and trajectory of lower-grade adverse events in clinical trials of anti-cancer therapies [^a4350e01]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Undervaluing the impact of chronic lower-grade toxicity may impact optimal dose choice, which may reduce treatment outcomes

Understanding adherence patterns can inform dose optimization, with low adherence signaling the need for dose review and attempts to mitigate AEs. Recommended dosages for anti-cancer therapies are typically established in dose escalation early-phase trials. The maximum tolerable dose (MTD), a method developed for cytotoxic chemotherapy, is also used for newer classes of treatment, including oral targeted therapies and immunotherapy, despite a growing recognition that it may not be optimal for all anti-cancer drug classes. Given the MTD is usually determined by high-grade AEs and that early-phase trials have short follow-up period, the burden of chronic lower-grade AE is unlikely to impact the final drug dose determination. Additionally, classes of anti-cancer therapy, such as oral targeted therapies that have a wider therapeutic index than cytotoxic chemotherapy, may have clinical benefit at doses that are much lower than the MTD. Patients and advocates have proposed that for molecularly targeted treatments a minimum effective dose should be the goal.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^b7f6882f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on customising antibiotic treatment duration to meet individual patient needs is required in primary care

When evaluating a patient with an RTI, our primary objective is to determine whether antibiotic therapy is necessary. There is substantial evidence indicating that antibiotics have little to no impact on self-limiting infections or when a non-bacterial infection is suspected. If patients are taking antibiotics prescribed by another doctor, or if they started taking antibiotics on their own from leftover medications or pharmacy purchases, and the current doctor determines that the antibiotics are no longer needed, they should be stopped (Panel 2). For patients with RTIs in which antibiotic therapy is warranted, more evidence is needed to determine the optimal treatment durations. Traditional two-arm randomised clinical trials comparing fixed antibiotic durations have limitations, as they provide little insight into the minimal necessary duration for various infectionsand fail to account for the differing needs of individual patients. Based on clinical judgement made from patient history, examination, and precise diagnostic tests, doctors should be encouraged to prescribe first-line treatments at appropriate doses to optimise PK/PD properties, except when contraindicated. Unless the infection is deemed potentially serious, when managing patients with a prescribed fixed antibiotic duration, new studies should ascertain whether treatment cessation upon symptom resolution, prior to completing the antibiotic course, is feasible. In fact, one third of the patients already do that by themselves. Studies using medication event monitoring systems reveal that in real-life scenarios, only one-third of patients adhere to the prescribed antibiotic course. If the results of these studies align with expectations, patients could then be advised to discontinue medication once they feel better and are afebrile.

### Optimal dose of peginterferon and ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C [^2482d9f6]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C affects 170 million people worldwide, including up to 4 million people in the United States. The current standard of care therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) while highly successful in patients with genotype 2 and 3 infection, allows for sustained virologic response in 42–46% of treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients, comprising about 70% of cases of chronic hepatitis C in the USA. While awaiting approval of Specifically Targeted Antiviral Therapy for HCV (STAT-C) agents, which will require the completion of additional clinical trials, it is important to optimize the dose and duration of currently available treatment modalities, namely PEG-IFN and RBV, for treatment of CHC. Results of several recent trials evaluating optimal dosing of RBV and higher than standard dosing of PEG-IFN in treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients, as well as data from retreatment trials with "induction" doses of PEG-IFN or high-dose RBV in prior non-responders to IFN-based therapy will be reviewed here. The possibility of shorter duration of therapy for genotype 2 and 3 patients based on recent publications and presentations will be discussed as well.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^afc751d4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outstanding questions

It is hard to convince doctors not to prescribe antibiotics at all when they are in doubt or in the face of patient expectations. The limited to moderate impact in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in primary care observed in antimicrobial stewardship programmes necessitates the exploration of new strategies. We need to change the message to healthcare professionals, policymakers, and educators regarding the idea of always completing a full course of antibiotics. Several systematic reviews show that shorter antibiotic courses are as effective as standard durations for most RTIs. Studies focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and on tailoring antibiotic therapy, dose, and length of therapy to patients' needs, present a promising strategy in primary care. This can be encouraged based on randomised clinical trials indicating that patients most often recover within three days. In the end, we are not treating RTIs, we are treating patients with RTIs.

### Association between physical activity dose and mental health among stroke survivors [^a6e9f757]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal Physical Activity Dose

Significant and nonlinear relationships were observed between mental health burden and both exercise duration and frequency while controlling for the complete covariate set. These relationships were evident for both moderate and vigorous exercise intensities. Smoothed regression splines indicated that moderate‐intensity exercise durations ranging from 40 to 50 minutes, with an optimal duration of around 45 minutes, were linked to the lowest mental health burden (Figure 1). This pattern of optimal duration was broadly consistent with vigorous physical activity (Figure S2). Similarly, smoothed regression splines indicated that moderate‐intensity exercise frequency ranging from 4 to 6 sessions, with an optimal frequency of around 5, was linked to the lowest mental health burden (Figure 2). This pattern was consistent with vigorous physical activity (Figure S3).

### Interplay between duration of androgen deprivation therapy and external beam radiotherapy with or without a brachytherapy boost for optimal treatment of high-risk prostate cancer: a patient-level data analysis of 3 cohorts [^cc61a556]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the findings of this cohort study suggest that the optimal duration of ADT for patients receiving high-dose EBRT may be more than 18 months — implied by the findings in all 3 cohorts. A secondary conclusion, based on the retrospective data set, is that durations of less than 18 months may be sufficient for patients receiving EBRT+BT. Ongoing and future trials will help clarify whether predictive biomarkers can aid in selecting optimal ADT durations; in the interim, individual patient meta-analyses that consider ADT duration data from various relevant trials may be the best available guidance on optimal ADT duration.

### Clinical practice recommendations for management of lateropulsion after stroke determined by a Delphi expert panel [^7391b2bf]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous literature has not provided recommendations regarding education about lateropulsion to the patients and caregivers, the need for interdisciplinary team input, strategies to address fear of falling in affected people, positioning in lying, considerations relating to management of fatigue, and specific considerations for discharge planning. Although based on expert opinion only, the agreed recommendations from this Delphi panel addressing these gaps may guide more effective management of this prevalent condition and provide a foundation for future intervention studies.

Reported treatment duration and intensity of rehabilitation vary in previously published studies. Evidence that people with lateropulsion need longer-duration therapy exists, but the remaining domains of optimal therapy dose, are not described in the existing literature. Recently published interventional studies compared novel therapies for lateropulsion with 'usual care'. –, Future studies investigating novel therapies, such as robotic assistance and NIBS, will require dose-finding and dose-ranging, methodologies followed by studies using comparison groups, with well-described 'usual care'. An agreed best-practice 'usual care' approach to the rehabilitation of lateropulsion is not available from the current literature. Recommendations resulting from this process may provide a standard 'usual care', against which future interventional studies may be compared.

Prior studies have shown that a longer rehabilitation duration is needed for people with post-stroke lateropulsion, and a further increased duration may be needed for those with older age, severe lateropulsion, moderate or severe neglect, greater number of additional impairments, poorer overall functional status, and right-sided lesions.– The panel also recommended that rehabilitation is continued as long as a person with post-stroke lateropulsion has ongoing rehabilitation goals. The remaining domains of optimal dose of rehabilitation for those with lateropulsion (therapy days per week, sessions per day, session length, session density, session difficulty, and intensity) have not been addressed in previous studies. This expert panel was unable to agree on specific dose recommendations and demonstrated wide variation in opinion, but agreed on many factors that may influence optimal dose of rehabilitation. Further clarification of this area of rehabilitation for post-stroke lateropulsion is needed. In addition to the optimal therapeutic dose, recommendations regarding some rehabilitation strategies, considerations for rehabilitation, elements for inclusion in the explanation of lateropulsion, addressing fear of falling, and positioning failed to reach consensus, and further research is needed to guide clinical practice.

### Perioperative NSAIDs and long-term outcomes after cancer surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4967dbef]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Dose and Duration

Due to inconsistency between studies, it was difficult for this review to draw conclusions on optimal dose or duration. In ketorolac use, more favourable outcomes were seen in studies which looked at a single dose rather than multiple doses, where no effect was seen. However, the timings of these doses could be responsible for this trend, rather than dosage, as single doses were all intraoperative and multiple doses all postoperative. Dosage also appeared to be dependent on patient factors such as weight and renal function. Further research will be required to identify any dose-dependent difference in outcomes.

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^4226f795]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Resistant bacteria are developing worldwide, causing a serious and concerning threat to global health. The rise in resistance is associated with overuse and misuse of antibiotics, as well as the lack of new drug development. Primary care accounts for 71.4% of all antibiotic prescriptions in the UK. Uncertainty in the distinction between bacterial or viral infections has led to a large variability in the propensity to prescribe an antibiotic for various infectious conditions.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing is used to determine the appropriateness of particular antibiotics to bacterial infections and whether bacteria are displaying some resistance to treatment. Microbiology data in combination with clinical review are used to develop best practice recommendations for the treatment of bacterial infections by outlining when it is appropriate to treat an infection with an antibiotic, the specific antibiotic that should be prescribed, as well as the recommended dose and duration of the antibiotic course that is effective. However, recent evidence suggests that regular updates to guidelines have little effect on reducing antibiotic prescribing and a substantial amount of antibiotics prescribed still deviate from recommended guidelines. When the recommended antibiotic type is prescribed in the UK, antibiotic courses tend to be slightly longer than what is recommended. This is probably, in part, because it was taught that to prevent reinfection and reduce resistance it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course of antibiotics even when symptoms have surpassed, and that prolonged therapy was needed to avoid treatment failure, suggesting that shorter antibiotic courses were perceived as an inferior treatment to longer courses. These ideas were implemented decades ago when there was little concern about antibiotic overuse and, although over time shorter courses have shown to be comparable in efficacy to longer therapies, variability in the duration of prescribed antibiotics remains. Additional evidence suggests that prescribers feel more comfortable selecting a middle-range duration, or in some cases the longest duration specified, even if the intention of the specified range is that the shortest duration is adequate for most patients. Further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for optimizing duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients, taking patient characteristics into consideration when identifying the patients who fail to recover on shorter courses of antibiotics.

### Optimal dose of perineural dexmedetomidine to prolong analgesia after brachial plexus blockade: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 57 randomized clinical trials [^7742529d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the optimal dose of DEX as an adjuvant to prolong the duration of analgesia after BPB in adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery. Based on 58 RCTs, including a total of 3332 patients, our subgroup analysis and regression analysis suggest that 30–50 μg of DEX as an adjuvant represents an optimal dose and prolongs analgesia by 5 h, when combined with long-acting local anesthetics; higher doses may lead to DEX-related adverse events such as bradycardia and hypotension.

The first meta-analysis focused on DEX as an adjuvant, published in 2013, indicated that there are presently insufficient safety data to support the use of perineural DEX in the clinical setting. Four years later, in 2017, the same team in an updated meta-analysis confirmed that using perineural DEX improves BPB onset, quality, and analgesia. After that, four other meta-analysis further confirmed the efficacy of DEX as adjuvant. One of the them found that DEX, particularly at doses greater than 50 μg, holds a great potential for clinicians wishing to quicken the onset and prolong the duration of anesthesia. In our meta-analysis, the interaction between dose of perineural DEX and mean increase in duration of analgesia was explored by grouping every 20 micrograms of DEX. Regression analysis was used to predict the relationship between them. Finally, we come to our conclusion.

The quality of evidence for our primary outcome was rated as very low due to the lack of clear allocation concealment, high coefficient of heterogeneity, absence of consistent definition of the primary outcome and significant publication bias. This means that we have little confidence in the effect estimation, and the real effect is likely to be very different from the effect estimation.

Our review comes with several strengths and potential limitations. Firstly, ours is the first review to pool a large number of RCTs on this topic and provide greater insights into the optimal dose of DEX. While the prior review in 2018 just included 12 RCTs, we were able to include an additional 45. Secondly, there was a high consistency in the evaluation of each parameter in this meta-analysis. Finally, we successfully analyzed the influencing factors of DEX on duration of analgesia, including different doses, BPB approaches and positioning techniques; however, since these factors were not randomized in the included studies, there was an inherent risk of bias in this analysis.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e7dae1a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I² = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I² = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I² = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I² = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I² = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I² = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.

### Evidenced-based antithrombotic therapy for acute coronary syndromes [^086f496f]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

When used in combination with other platelet inhibitors in the setting of acute and long-term treatment in patients with ACS, stable coronary artery disease, or postpercutaneous coronary intervention with or without DM, the optimal dose of aspirin is still not clearly defined from data generated by large randomized controlled trials. The PLATO trial was not designed to evaluate aspirin therapy, and it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the optimal dose or duration of aspirin in any subgroup or nonrandomized treatment options. There is a need to reevaluate the use of aspirin and its optimal dose and duration in relation to whether it is used alone or in combination with other platelet or coagulation inhibitors. However, the totality of all studies support current guidelines stating that in patients with ACS independent of DM status, low-dose maintenance aspirin in combination with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is likely associated with the most favorable outcomes in the U.S. and elsewhere.

### Duration and cessation of antimicrobial treatment [^506a7cbd]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Shortening the duration of antimicrobial therapy is an important strategy for optimizing patient care and reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. It is best used in the context of an overall approach to infection management that includes a focus on selecting the right initial drug and dosing regimen for empiric therapy, and de-escalation to a more narrowly focused drug regimen (or termination) based on subsequent culture results and clinical data. In addition to reducing resistance, other potential benefits of shorter antimicrobial courses include lowered antimicrobial costs, reduced risk of superinfections (including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea), reduced risk of antimicrobial-related organ toxicity, and improved drug compliance. There have been relatively few randomized clinical trials that study the optimal treatment durations for such serious infections as pneumonia (community- and healthcare/hospital-acquired), complicated intra-abdominal infection, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Nonetheless, a growing number of studies have explored the possibilities of reducing the duration of antimicrobial therapy for at least certain patients with these infections, under certain circumstances. Professional organizations have compiled these data and used them to develop clinical practice guidelines to aid clinicians in choosing optimal treatment durations for individual patients. Many patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or healthcare-associated pneumonia can be treated for 7–8 days, while 4–7 days and 14-day treatment durations may suffice for many patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections and uncomplicated CRBSI, respectively. This article first provides a general background on the rationale and data supporting shortened courses of antimicrobial therapy, before using 3 case studies to explore the practical implications of current knowledge and treatment guidelines when making decisions about treatment duration for individual patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infection, and CRBSI.

### The schedule and duration of intravesical chemotherapy in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review of the published results of randomized clinical trials [^071f147f]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intravesical chemotherapy has been studied in randomized clinical trials for > 30 yr; however, the optimal schedule and duration of treatment are unknown. The objective is to determine the effect of schedule and duration of intravesical chemotherapy on recurrence in patients with stage Ta T1 bladder cancer.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted of the published results of randomized clinical trials that compared intravesical instillations with respect to their number, frequency, timing, duration, dose, or dose intensity.

Results

One immediate instillation after transurethral resection (TUR) is recommended in all patients. In low-risk patients, no further treatment is recommended before recurrence. In patients with multiple tumors, one immediate instillation is insufficient treatment. Additional instillations may further reduce the recurrence rate; however, no recommendations can be made concerning their optimal duration. A short intensive schedule of instillations within the first 3–4 mo after an immediate instillation may be as effective as longer-term treatment schedules (grade C). Instillations during ≥ 1 yr in intermediate-risk patients seem advisable only when an immediate instillation has not been given (grade C). Higher drug concentrations and optimization of the drug's concentration in the bladder may provide better results (grade C).

Conclusions

The optimal schedule and duration of intravesical chemotherapy after an immediate instillation remain unknown. Future studies should focus on the eradication of residual disease after TUR and the prevention of late recurrences.

### Guidance on the use of convalescent plasma to treat immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^d1dbedc9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Duration of Treatment

One to 2 units of CCP should be used to treat acute COVID-19 with continued dosing based on clinical response thereafter. In the case of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection with very high viral loads, multiple doses should be considered at defined intervals until viral clearance is achieved. The group's recommendation acknowledges that the ideal dosage and duration of CCP treatment remains uncertain. The timing and dosage (single vs multiple units) of CCP, should depend on the clinical situation (ie, acute symptomatic vs persistent [infection with few or no symptoms]) and response to previous treatment (eg, failure to clear the virus following treatment with mAbs and/or small molecule antivirals).

Most studies — independent of immune status — pertain to acute COVID-19 in which a dose of 1–2 units of CCP (200–300 mL per unit) has been used; that dose was based on experience with convalescent plasma prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two units are more likely to result in detectable antibodies in the recipient than 1 unit alone.

Specific to the IC patient population, there is no consensus regarding optimal dosing either in the number of units or dosing frequency. In a systematic review of reported use of CCP in IC patients, the median dose was 2 units (range 1–11 units). Several cases reports have used multiple units and repeated dosing in IC patients, but there are limited data to support this practice. In the case of dosing multiple units, the risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload should be considered if administered over short periods, given that IC patients may have concomitant comorbid disease (eg, cardiorespiratory disease and/or renal impairment); however, most patients are likely to tolerate dosages higher than 200 mL. In the case of viral persistence, there is more variability in practice whereby multiple and repeat doses may be administered at different intervals, in an attempt to achieve viral clearance.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^d7b0d877]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high‐certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long‐term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow‐up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment.

Main results

We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking.

There is high‐certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast‐acting form plus patch) results in higher long‐term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24‐hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16‐hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants).

Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants).

High‐certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast‐acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long‐term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants).

We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); or fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence).

Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

There is high‐certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single‐form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower‐dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher‐dose products. Using a fast‐acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^0b2e3ac7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

### Assessing dose-response relationships by cumulative exposures in epidemiological studies [^1c620d26]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

If the occurrence of disease monotonically increases with the degree of exposure in an epidemiologic study, a dose-response (or exposure-response) relationship is indicated and facilitates the interpretation that the exposure has a causal role. It is not uncommon, however, that there is some effect in terms of an overall increased relative risk but no clear dose-response relationship.

Methods

Models presented here show that cumulative exposure, as involving the duration of exposure, is not an adequate parameter when more recent exposure or the intensity of the exposure plays the greater role for the disease outcome.

Conclusions

In lack of a dose-response pattern by cumulative exposure, the interpretation of an overall increased risk might well be that there is no definite effect. The proper consideration should be, however, that the measure of exposure could be inadequate, suggesting a need for further analyses and evaluations of the material studied.

### Duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis [^8694a6a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Progressive lung damage from recurrent exacerbations is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient. The risk of systemic side effects such as allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with prolonged courses and the use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring to minimise some of their side effects. However, some organisms which infect people with cystic fibrosis are known to be multi-resistant to antibiotics, and may require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of previously published reviews.

Objectives

To assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 30 May 2019. We also searched online trials registries. Most recent search of the ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal: 06 January 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

No eligible trials were identified for inclusion. A trial looking at the standardised treatment of pulmonary exacerbations is currently ongoing and will be included when the results are published. MAIN RESULTS: No eligible trials were included.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should improve quality of life and adherence, result in a reduced incidence of drug reactions and be less costly. However, the shorter duration may not be sufficient to clear a chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it has important clinical and financial implications. The currently ongoing STOP2 trial is expected to provide some guidance on these questions when published.

### Curie medal lecture 2000. the optimization of delivered dose in radiotherapy: is it related to low dose rate? [^22d66a5d]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

From the beginning of the 20th century with Pierre and Marie Curie, it was found that the preparation of radium into needles and tubes results in a continuous low dose rate radiation in which the total time to give an optimal dose of 60 Gy is reduced to 5 or 6 days. Clinical results quickly followed, showing that tumour sterilization was better ensured by low dose rate radiation over several days than by fractionated high dose rate radiation over several weeks. In the light of my experience of very good results with modern 192 Ir endocurietherapy at an optimal dose rate of 0.6 Gy per h for very bulky tumours, I finally became convinced of the need to study low dose rate in teletherapy using telecobalt with low activity sources (1 Gy per h to achieve long duration sessions of 7–8 h per day over a short total duration of 5 or 7 days). I started in January 1970, at the Institut Gustave Roussy and, after my appointment, at the Henri Mondor Hospital in Creteil, a variety of cancer sites were treated but mostly advanced head and neck cancers. Finally I decided to do a trial of classical fractionated high dose rate radiation vs. subcontinuous low dose rate radiation of advanced breast cancers (T3). The results at 3 months were conclusive: 20% of the cancers treated by 45 Gy fractionated irradiation at high dose rate were sterilized while the proportion sterilized at low dose rate was 70% whether the patients received 45 or 35 Gy. This work opened the way to further study but my retirement loomed and I was not able to pursue it.

### Warfarin sodium [^4d3b0de1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Effect of dose and duration of reduction in dietary sodium on blood pressure levels: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^3d8d9583]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine the dose-response relation between reduction in dietary sodium and blood pressure change and to explore the impact of intervention duration.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE(R), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley) and reference lists of relevant articles up to 21 January 2019.

Inclusion Criteria

Randomised trials comparing different levels of sodium intake undertaken among adult populations with estimates of intake made using 24 hour urinary sodium excretion.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Two of three reviewers screened the records independently for eligibility. One reviewer extracted all data and the other two reviewed the data for accuracy. Reviewers performed random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression.

Results

133 studies with 12197 participants were included. The mean reductions (reduced sodium v usual sodium) of 24 hour urinary sodium, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 130 mmol (95% confidence interval 115 to 145, P < 0.001), 4.26 mm Hg (3.62 to 4.89, P < 0.001), and 2.07 mm Hg (1.67 to 2.48, P < 0.001), respectively. Each 50 mmol reduction in 24 hour sodium excretion was associated with a 1.10 mm Hg (0.66 to 1.54; P < 0.001) reduction in SBP and a 0.33 mm Hg (0.04 to 0.63; P = 0.03) reduction in DBP. Reductions in blood pressure were observed in diverse population subsets examined, including hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals. For the same reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium there was greater SBP reduction in older people, non-white populations, and those with higher baseline SBP levels. In trials of less than 15 days' duration, each 50 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium excretion was associated with a 1.05 mm Hg (0.40 to 1.70; P = 0.002) SBP fall, less than half the effect observed in studies of longer duration (2.13 mm Hg; 0.85 to 3.40; P = 0.002). Otherwise, there was no association between trial duration and SBP reduction.

Conclusions

The magnitude of blood pressure lowering achieved with sodium reduction showed a dose-response relation and was greater for older populations, non-white populations, and those with higher blood pressure. Short term studies underestimate the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure.

### Postnatal corticosteroids to prevent or treat chronic lung disease following preterm birth [^77d55ef8]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Postnatal dexamethasone (DEX) dose considerations: Literature for the 2010 AAP policy statement linked high daily doses (≥ 0.5 mg/kg) to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and called for additional studies of lower-dose DEX, while a 2017 Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concluded that optimal dose and timing recommendations could not be made and suggested that if late PCSs are used, both dose and duration should be minimized; no new RCTs have been published since that review.

### Dosage of preventive or therapeutic exercise interventions: review of published randomized controlled trials and survey of authors [^a16bb71d]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the dose components and choice justifications in exercise interventions in a convenient sample of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

We searched the following databases: PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in 2014.

Study Selection

We included published RCTs evaluating preventive or therapeutic interventions in people with clinical conditions or at risk to develop health problems.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated the adequacy of the justifications. We contacted and invited the trials authors to complete an online survey to ask for additional information on dose justifications and dose-effect relation.

Data Synthesis

We included 187 published RCTs. Of these, 68 (36%) reported a justification for the dose choice, and 135 (72%) reported 3 doses components. Most reported components were duration (96%) and frequency (93%). Sixty-six survey responders (response rate, 35%) provided additional information. When combining the publications and survey responses, 104 (56%) trials had a justification for the dose choice. We judged justifications adequate in 45 (43%) articles. From the survey responders, 39% indicated that intensity was the dose component that can have the greatest effect on their study results.

Conclusions

Most of the published RCTs adequately reported the dose components of their exercise interventions but only a small number provided sufficient justifications for dosage choices. Further studies are recommended to justify the exercise intervention dose choices.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^d78124c7]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria are increasingly able to resist antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity, deaths and costs worldwide. Antibiotic use is an important driver of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Selective pressure can be reduced by minimising antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics are often unnecessary. Moreover, the duration of antibiotic courses can often be reduced without significantly compromising cure rates. Shortening antibiotic duration can have a large impact on reducing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, including bacteria carried asymptomatically. Antibiotics are by far the most prescribed drugs for children, with more than 60 million systemic antibiotics dispensed annually in the US outpatient setting alone, and are amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs for adults.

An important challenge is that, for many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. Courses should be long enough to treat infections effectively, yet short enough to reduce the incidence of side effects and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The continued need for antibiotics can be assessed with daily reviews for inpatients; however, in practice, such reviews are not always performed or acted upon and antibiotics are often continued in order to complete currently recommended course durations. Further, in the outpatient or primary care setting, continued assessment of patients initiated on antibiotics is not feasible. Therefore, it is especially important to have strong evidence about optimal treatment durations in these settings.

Because observational studies comparing different antibiotic durations are potentially confounded by unmeasured patient factors influencing the need for prolonged treatment, evidence about the optimal treatment duration should, where possible, come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, antibiotic durations for several infections managed in primary care, such as prostatitis, are not guided by RCT evidence on optimal treatment duration. Where treatment durations have been compared in RCTs, in most cases, two treatment durations were selected for comparison, both of which lacked a clear scientific rationale. Whilst RCTs designed in this way can be useful, there are disadvantages to this approach.

Herein, we discuss the main issue with conventional two-arm trial designs, how to assess the 'optimal' antibiotic treatment duration, four alternative trial designs that can estimate much needed duration–response relationships (subsequently denoted duration–response curves), and which of these designs has the most desirable properties.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^e04fdc7a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate dosing and duration in psoriasis — Indicated for severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis not responsive to other therapy, methotrexate is administered as a weekly single oral dose with gradual increases until optimal response; total dose should not ordinarily exceed 30 mg/wk, doses should be reduced to the lowest possible amount, and a test dose of 2.5–5 mg is recommended. Treatment can be continued as long as necessary with adequate monitoring, and folic acid supplementation 1–5 mg daily by mouth, except for the day of methotrexate dosing, reduces the frequency of side effects.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^71f407d3]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic overuse contributes to antibiotic resistance, which is a threat to public health. Antibiotic stewardship is a practice dedicated to prescribing antibiotics only when necessary and, when antibiotics are considered necessary, promoting use of the appropriate agent(s), dose, duration, and route of therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the unintended consequences of antibiotic use. Because there are differences in common infectious conditions, drug-specific considerations, and the evidence surrounding treatment recommendations (eg, first-line therapy, duration of therapy) between children and adults, this statement provides specific guidance for the pediatric population. This policy statement discusses the rationale for inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs; essential personnel, infrastructure, and activities required; approaches to evaluating their effectiveness; and gaps in knowledge that require further investigation. Key guidance for both inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs are provided.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^36022556]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range and effect on serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I(2) = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in-range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I(2) = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in-range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I(2) = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in-range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation.

### Optimal dose of perineural dexmedetomidine to prolong analgesia after brachial plexus blockade: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 57 randomized clinical trials [^2d0e7266]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Peripheral injection of dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been widely used in regional anesthesia to prolong the duration of analgesia. However, the optimal perineural dose of DEX is still uncertain. It is important to elucidate this characteristic because DEX may cause dose-dependent complications. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the optimal dose of perineural DEX for prolonged analgesia after brachial plexus block (BPB) in adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery.

Method

A search strategy was created to identify suitable randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in Embase, PubMed and The Cochrane Library from inception date to Jan, 2021. All adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery under BPB were eligible. The RCTs comparing DEX as an adjuvant to local anesthetic (LA) with LA alone for BPB were included. The primary outcome was duration of analgesia for perineural DEX. Secondary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) in 12 and 24h, consumption of analgesics in 24h, and adverse events.

Results

Fifty-seven RCTs, including 3332 patients, were identified. The subgroup analyses and regression analyses revealed that perineural DEX dose of 30–50μg is an appropriate dosage. With short-/intermediate-acting LAs, the mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) of analgesia duration with less than and more than 60μg doses was 220.31 (153.13–287.48) minutes and 68.01 (36.37–99.66) minutes, respectively. With long-acting LAs, the mean differences (95% CI) with less than and more than 60μg doses were 332.45 (288.43–376.48) minutes and 284.85 (220.31–349.39) minutes.

Conclusion

30–50μg DEX as adjuvant can provides a longer analgesic time compared to LA alone and it did not increase the risk of bradycardia and hypotension.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9b5741e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^efea7306]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of JANTOVEN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Amoxicillin for 3 or 5 days for chest-indrawing pneumonia in Malawian children [^80e86e5b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 920,000 children die before age 5 from pneumonia annually. There is a critical need to provide greater access to appropriate and effective treatment. Treatment of bacterial pneumonia requires an effective antibiotic used in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. Determining optimal duration of antibiotic therapy is key to ensuring effective treatment while maximizing adherence and minimizing adverse drug effects, costs, and antimicrobial resistance.

A 5-day course of oral amoxicillin at least 40mg/kg/dose twice-daily (80mg/kg/day) is recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment for chestindrawing pneumonia among immune-competent children < 5 years old. However, it is unclear whether a 5-day course of amoxicillin is necessary or if a shorter duration of treatment would be as effective. Based on studies of 3-versus 5-day oral antibiotics for fast-breathing pneumonia, WHO recommends a 3-day course of oral amoxicillin for treatment of fast-breathing pneumonia among immune-competent children < 5 years old.- A Cochrane review found no qualifying randomized controlled trials comparing 2-3versus 5-day intravenous antibiotics for chest-indrawing or more severe pneumonia. Few data exist to inform optimal duration of treatment for pneumonia, and no study has looked at 3-versus 5-day oral antibiotics for chest-indrawing pneumonia. International and national pneumonia treatment guidelines rely on expert opinion and limited and weak evidence. In light of the global threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance, evidence-based recommendations are needed for the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. Given the paucity of African data, African-specific research in malaria-endemic settings is critical to establish optimal management of children with chest-indrawing pneumonia.

### Tocilizumab in giant cell arteritis: an update for the clinician [^edf2f8c4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recent approval of tocilizumab (TCZ) for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) has changed the landscape for management of this disease. Herein, we review recent literature addressing practical questions for the clinician regarding the use of TCZ in GCA. We evaluate efficacy of TCZ across different disease phenotypes, optimal dosing and formulation, treatment-related toxicity, recommendations for monitoring disease, and duration of therapy.

Recent Findings

Post-hoc analyses of a large clinical trial and real-world data suggest efficacy of TCZ across various disease phenotypes in GCA, and support use of weekly subcutaneous dosing over every-other-week dosing. More data are needed to guide duration of TCZ therapy, optimal disease activity monitoring in patients treated with TCZ, and to speak to efficacy in GCA with large vessel involvement.

Summary

TCZ has added valuably to the treatment arsenal in GCA, though more data are needed to guide optimal use of the drug.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^e6c039bd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The administration is determined according to the antibiotic half-life. For most frequently used antibiotics, such as cefazolin or cefoxitin, intravenous administration 30–60 min before incision ensures effective tissue concentrations at the time of incision. Redosing during surgery is required when the operative procedure lasts for more than 4 h or there is > 1.5 L blood loss. Vancomycin should be administered within 120 min before the incision, and given over 1 h for a 1 g dose (longer, if the dose is higher). Redosing is generally not required for antibiotics with a long half-life (e.g. fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, vancomycin).

Regarding empiric therapy before causative bacteria and susceptibilities are known, the optimal antibiotic choice should be based on the infection source, expected pathogens, the patient's clinical condition, local epidemiology, and individual patient risk factors for MDR bacteria. Knowledge of patients' risk factors for MDR bacteria is essential. Treatment guidelines informed by local epidemiology and resistance patterns should be developed and implemented consistently according to ASP principles. Identifying the correct antibiotic(s) for a particular patient can be complex. Although the susceptibility of bacteria involved in community-acquired infections is usually substantially higher and broader than those involved in HAIs, clinicians often recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics for severe community-acquired infections to avoid "missing anything". Whereas the spectrum of activity may be appropriate in doing so, the likelihood is over-treatment because narrow-spectrum antibiotics are equally effective in most cases. By contrast, for HAIs, the best course of action is empiric broad-spectrum therapy, including an antifungal agent in some circumstances, with later de-escalation to tailored therapy once microbiology data are available.

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone) [^014fa833]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment of Pain

Optimal methadone initiation and dose titration strategies for the treatment of pain have not been determined. Published equianalgesic conversion ratios between methadone and other opioids are imprecise, providing at best, only population averages that cannot be applied consistently to all patients. It should be noted that many commonly cited equianalgesia tables only present relative analgesic potencies of single opioid doses in non-tolerant patients, thus greatly underestimating methadone's analgesic potency, and its potential for adverse effects in repeated-dose settings. Regardless of the dose determination strategy employed, methadone is most safely initiated and titrated using small initial doses and gradual dose adjustments.

As with all opioid drugs, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. The following dosing recommendations should only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient. Prescribers should always follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.

In the selection of an initial dose of Methadone Hydrochloride Injection, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient had been taking previously, if any;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate an equianalgesic starting methadone dose, in particular, whether it is intended for use in acute or chronic methadone dosing;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent medications, particularly other CNS and respiratory depressants;
The type, severity and expected duration of the patient's pain;
The acceptable balance between pain control and adverse side effects.

Methadone Hydrochloride Injection may be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The absorption of subcutaneous and intramuscular methadone has not been well characterized and appears to be unpredictable. Local tissue reactions may occur.

Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Initiation of Therapy in Opioid Non-Tolerant Patients

When parenteral methadone is used as the first analgesic in patients who are not already being treated with, and tolerant to, opioids, the usual intravenous methadone starting dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours, slowly titrated to effect. More frequent administration may be required during methadone initiation in order to maintain adequate analgesia, and extreme caution is necessary to avoid overdosage, taking into account methadone's long elimination half life.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^f72020f7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^3cb1f7bb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### Treatment of the afebrile patient after catheter withdrawal: drugs and duration [^aebbe552]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Catheter-related infections constitute 10–15% of all nosocomial infections, and constitute a relevant and growing problem, with an impact that is far from irrelevant, especially in the intensive care unit. The most frequent pathogens implicated come from the skin flora; Gram-positive cocci are responsible for about two-thirds of the infections, and Candida has emerged as another important cause. Questions about drug, route of administration, dosage and duration of antibiotherapy for patients who have become apyretic and with no signs of sepsis after catheter removal are still under debate, and far from being definitively answered. Decisions regarding these questions are based on three main factors: namely, which is the microoorganism responsible for the infection, what was the time to response, and what kind of patient are we dealing with? However, the microorganism is clearly the main factor in making a decision. In summary, all catheter-related infections should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, regardless of the removal of the catheter, with parenteral drugs, using high doses and short courses, namely 1 week, and de-escalating to narrow-spectrum drugs on the basis of susceptibility tests as soon as possible. Staphylococcus aureus catheter-related infections constitute an exception, needing longer courses, as it is difficult to predict who will be high-risk patients.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^9391f5a4]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Pharmacodynamic optimization of β-lactams in the patient care setting [^094520ec]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In order to eradicate an infecting organism, it is necessary to achieve or maintain concentrations of an antibiotic in vivo that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the organism. Duration of exposure, or time above MIC, was recognized as being important for beta-lactam antibiotics more than 60 years ago. Continuous infusion regimens are associated with higher clinical response rates, improvement in surrogate markers of outcome, and lower cost of therapy compared with intermittent infusion regimens, because the MIC can be exceeded for an entire dosing interval. However, for carbapenem antibiotics, it appears that the MIC must only be exceeded for 40% of the dosing interval for bactericidal activity in vivo. Therefore, a promising strategy to optimize carbapenem use is to administer the same dose at the same frequency of administration but to extend the infusion time. Extended infusion regimens take full advantage of a drug's exposure potential within the context of in vivo potency without altering the dose or dosing schedule and with no increase in toxicity or cost. Administering higher doses by extended infusion allows one to manage organisms with high MICs. Optimizing the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of an antibiotic allows one to 'make good drugs better'.

### Updated joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for management of Helicobacter pylori infection in children and adolescents (2023) [^311bbeb4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric Helicobacter pylori infection — AST-guided triple therapy dosing and duration: We suggest AST-guided triple therapy using a high dosage of PPIs, a high dosage of AMO, and 14 days duration to maximize the eradication rate, with GRADE: conditional recommendation, quality of evidence: very low, and Agreement: 100%. Practice points state that drug dosages based on weight are indicated in Table 5 and that to enhance successful eradication the importance of adherence to the eradication treatment protocol should be explained to the patient/ family. Supporting discussion indicates that a 14-day duration is superior to 7 and 10 days, that the use of high dose PPIs twice daily increases the efficacy of the triple therapy, that the pharmacodynamics of this antibiotic justifies a dose given three times a day (TID), and that adherence to therapy is crucial to optimize eradication and reduce the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance.

### Efficacy of adjunctive inhaled colistin and tobramycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^12716c17]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While this study sheds light on the potential benefits of adjunctive inhaled colistin and tobramycin for VAP, further research is crucial to optimize their use and refine clinical practice. Several key areas demand exploration: 1. Dosing and Treatment Duration: The optimal dosing regimen and treatment duration for inhaled antibiotics remain unclear. Future studies should explore a wider range of doses and durations to identify the most effective and safe approach, considering factors like patient characteristics and pathogen susceptibility. 2. Subpopulation Analysis: The present analysis did not delve into potential differences in treatment response across diverse patient subgroups (e.g. specific pathogens, underlying comorbidities). Future research should stratify analyses by relevant subgroups to provide more nuanced insights on which patients benefit most from this intervention. 3. Delivery System Optimization: The impact of delivery systems on drug bioavailability in the lungs was not addressed. Investigating and optimizing delivery systems could significantly improve treatment efficacy and potentially reduce required doses, enhancing safety and minimizing antibiotic resistance concerns. 4. Long-Term Outcomes and Resistance: The long-term effects of inhaled antibiotics on lung function, antibiotic resistance development, and other relevant outcomes require further investigation. Additionally, exploring the potential for emergence of resistant strains specific to inhaled antibiotics is crucial for informing sustainable resistance management strategies.

### Suboptimal dosing parameters as possible factors in the negative phase III clinical trials of progesterone for traumatic brain injury [^31f16458]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2017). Low credibility.

We hope that this new information provides a clear strategic rationale for a return to Phase II to determine whether progesterone is really a safe and effective neuroprotective agent for use in both male and female patients with brain injuries. Such a trial should examine the variables of both dose and duration of treatment, and also make use of functional indexes more precise and relevant to measurement of quantitative recovery than the GOS-E, DRS, and FIM.

We advocate a study in which an empirically guided, adaptive dose and schedule optimization is performed. One plausible scenario would be to dose progesterone intravenously in parallel groups at 2 and 4 mg/kg/day, with each dose level subdivided into two longer dosing durations of perhaps 14 and 28 days, followed by a 1- to 2-day tapering of the dose as in Protect III. Patients could be followed monthly for the first 3 months to evaluate the kinetics of relative treated versus control healing during the primary 3-month human healing period; then at 6, 9, and 12 months to determine longer-term clinical tendencies. Finally, should this trial show clear efficacy and indicate an optimal dose/schedule combination such that no additional dose levels or schedules need be tested, we propose that one additional group be introduced, either in an adaptive design Phase II or in Phase III, in which a subgroup receives oral micronized progesterone (Prometrium ®; Catalent Pharma Solutions, St. Petersburg, FL) at modest doses giving PDLs of ∼25–50 ng/mL (the approximate PDLs accompanying efficacy in rat preclinical experiments), beginning at the end of the optimized intravenous infusion period/dose combination and extending out to 3 months. This would make it possible to determine whether the continued presence of moderately elevated blood and brain concentrations of progesterone over the duration of the primary healing period would help to facilitate even better functional and morphological recovery than the optimal intravenous dosing protocol we are advocating for the Phase IIB studies.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^2571af43]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^1bffc83c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS OF GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION

Table I provides a synopsis of recommendations regarding systemic oral antibiotics from several recently published guidelines: the International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR) 2021, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020, the Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Guideline (CSACSO) from 2020, the Clinical Practice Guideline (Update): Adult Sinusitis (CPGAS) from 2015, and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) update from 2014. Oral and topical corticosteroids are often recommended in combination with antibiotics.

Whereas earlier guidelines usually included antibiotics as a recommended treatment of CRS, more recent guidelines suggest antibiotics be regarded as an optional treatment for CRS, in association with topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, saline rinses and surgery.(,–) Whereas in 2007, long term macrolide therapy received a class A recommendation from the EPOS for the treatment of CRSsNP, 307 after subsequent publications by Wallwork et al. and Videler et al. the EPOS recommendation was downgraded from A to C (not including exacerbations) in 2012. The EPOS 2020 steering group made recommendations using the GRADE system, and their overall recommendation was "uncertain" due to the relatively low quality of the available evidence. EPOS 2020 called for studies with larger population sizes, and placebo-controlled randomized trials of long-term macrolides are currently underway.

ICAR 2021 recommended against non-macrolide antibiotics for CRSwNP, except in acute exacerbations. Macrolides were considered as an option for treatment of both CRSsNP and CRSwNP, but the optimal drug, dosage and treatment duration were not defined due to the limited published data.

The Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy for CRSsNP patients with neutrophilic inflammatory patterns and low IgE levels, but no antibiotics for CRSwNP patients. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy post-surgery was discussed to improve the subjective and objective symptom scores, reduce polyp size and delay polyp recurrence. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy was recommended for corticosteroid-resistant CRSwNP patients, neutrophil-dominant nasal polyps, persistent edema of nasal mucosa, and purulent nasal discharge.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^4db5541c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease erythema migrans — treatment duration: We recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5–10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States. Evidence notes that durations in clinical studies have varied from 5 to 10 days, that 5-day regimens have included 6 doses with 2 doses taken on day 1, and that no difference in outcomes has been associated with the duration of therapy, including trials showing equivalent efficacy of 10 days compared with 20 days of doxycycline and similar efficacy of 10 days compared with 15 days. Rationale states that shorter durations of antibiotic exposure may reduce adverse effects and cost.

### Self-rated health according to amount, intensity and duration of leisure time physical activity [^c05668b2]. Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the dose-response relationship between leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and self-rated health.

Methods

A survey (n = 18,058) representative of the population aged 18-64years of Madrid (Spain) conducted between 2000 and 2008. A questionnaire on the frequency and duration of numerous activities was used to assess the total amount, the intensity, and the duration of LTPA. Self-rated health was classified as optimal or sub-optimal (fair/bad/very bad). Analyses were performed using logistic regression.

Results

Compared with no LTPA, active people in the lowest quintile for total amount of LTPA showed an odds ratio (OR) of sub-optimal health of 0.69; a linear dose-response relationship (p < 0.001) was observed, with the OR gradually decreasing to 0.49 in the highest quintile of LTPA. There was an inverse gradient for LTPA intensity adjusted for energy expenditure, so that the OR of sub-optimal health was 0.69 for light LTPA, 0.60 for moderate, and 0.48 for vigorous (p linear trend < 0.001). For the same duration, the frequency of optimal health increases with the intensity of LTPA.

Conclusions

The total amount of LTPA shows a graded and continuous association with better self-rated health. The benefits of LTPA on self-rated health increase with the intensity of the activity.

### Determining the optimal dose in the development of anticancer agents [^cc48b83c]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Identification of the optimal dose remains a key challenge in drug development. For cytotoxic drugs, the standard approach is based on identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase I trials and incorporating this to subsequent trials. However, this strategy does not take into account important aspects of clinical pharmacology. For targeted agents, the dose-effect relationships from preclinical studies are less obvious, and it is important to change the way these agents are developed to avoid recommending drug doses for different populations without evidence of differential antitumour effects in different diseases. The use of expanded cohorts in phase I trials to better define MTD and refine dose optimization should be further explored together with a focus on efficacy rather than toxicity-based predictions. Another key consideration in dose optimization is related to interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. High variability in intra-individual pharmacokinetics has been observed for many orally-administered drugs, especially those with low bioavailability, which might complicate identification of dose-effect relationships. End-organ dysfunction, interactions with other prescription drugs, herbal supplements, adherence, and food intake can influence pharmacokinetics. It is important these variables are identified during early clinical trials and considered in the development of further phase II and subsequent large-scale phase III studies.

### Morphine sulfate (duramorph) [^ff6feb90]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 Initial Dosage

The starting dose of DURAMORPH must be individualized.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of DURAMORPH for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with DURAMORPH. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.3 Dosage for Intravenous Administration

Adult Dosage: The initial dose of morphine should be 2 mg to 10 mg/70 kg of body weight, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of DURAMORPH.

2.4 Dosage for Epidural Administration

Adult Dosage: Initial injection of 5 mg in the lumbar region may provide satisfactory pain relief for up to 24 hours. If adequate pain relief is not achieved within one hour, careful administration of incremental doses of 1 to 2 mg at intervals sufficient to assess effectiveness may be given. Do not administer more than 10 mg per 24 hours.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^619acffb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis — DMARD tapering after target attainment: Patients in remission for < 6 months should not routinely be considered for dose reduction or withdrawal, and the voting panel considered 6 months to be a reasonable minimal length of time to ensure stable disease control. "Dose reduction" refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD, and "Gradual discontinuation" denotes gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it. Continuation of all DMARDs at their current dose is conditionally recommended over a dose reduction of a DMARD, dose reduction is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of a DMARD, and gradual discontinuation is conditionally recommended over abrupt discontinuation of a DMARD for patients who are at target for at least 6 months.

### Scoping review of exposure questionnaires and surveys in interstitial lung disease [^ac0790b8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

It can be difficult to determine what constitutes a relevant exposure, that is, how much is required to contribute to disease. Only half of the questionnaires asked about a dose and duration of exposure, yet this is an essential component of exposure assessment and ideally would be included in all questionnaires. Some exposures only asked about exposures dating back to 3 years, which would be insufficient in long latency exposures (eg, asbestos). The exposure dose and duration should be specific phrases that are understandable to patients and not open to variable interpretation. While the dose and duration of exposure required are affected by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, understanding on average 'how much is too much' is essential to understand disease pathogenesis, and also to inform subsequent recommendations on exposure avoidance. This assessment may differ between current and past exposures. Furthermore, many ILDs have a long period of latency (eg, asbestosis) and this would be important to capture, enabling further assessment of the biological plausibility of a causal relationship between exposure and outcome.

This review found multiple exposures which were commonly included across many studies. These exposures should be considered for inclusion in future ILD exposure questionnaires. However, we do not wish to imply that common or frequently reported exposures are necessarily synonymous with relevant exposures, and these should be mapped to the literature to confirm relevance. There is also a differential risk between exposure and disease; bird exposure is common, but bird exposure associated with ILD is relatively rare, whereas the risk of ILD among stonemasons and miners is considerably higher, highlighting the importance of disease or process-specific questioning. In addition, different exposures may be contributory to different ILDs. Exposure to beryllium is almost exclusively related to chronic beryllium disease, whereas vapours and fumes may be related to several ILDs including HP, IPF, CTD-ILD and others. Geographical variation is also important to note, and locally adapted questionnaires may perform best to elicit exposures relevant to the target patient population in specific regional settings.

### Model-informed therapeutic dose optimization strategies for antibody-drug conjugates in oncology: what can we learn from US food and drug administration-approved antibody-drug conjugates? [^e1344f86]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosing frequency

Leveraging PK and PD information to inform dosing frequency and treatment‐free intervals are essential in maintaining efficacy and safety while simultaneously improving patient convenience. The ADC half‐life does not appear to be a main driver to determine the optimal dosing frequency. Across the majority of the nine ADCs reviewed, the dosing interval was substantially longer than would be predicted based on half‐life (Table 2). For an IV‐administered drug, a less frequent higher dosing regimen is generally preferred to a more frequent lower dose from the perspective of patient convenience; less frequent dosing of Q2W or Q3W is used for five of the nine ADCs. However, it is notable that four of the approved ADCs incorporate weekly dosing in the label for some or all doses within a cycle: gemtuzumab ozogamicin, inotuzumab ozogamicin, sacituzumab govitecan, and enfortumab vedotin. This suggests that for some of the ADCs the more frequent dose schedule provides an advantage by widening the therapeutic window, despite the potential inconvenience (Table 2). Additionally, while not a label dose schedule, brentuximab vedotin has also been tested in patients using a weekly dose schedule, as discussed later in this section.

When a single higher dose is divided into multiple lower doses that yield the same cumulative dose per cycle (e.g. 9 mg/kg every 3 weeks divided into 3 mg/kg weekly), the fractionated dose yields a similar cumulative AUC, lower C max, and a higher C trough compared with the higher single dose for ADCs with linear, time invariant PK. Thus, fractionated dosing may be expected to improve the therapeutic window for C max ‐driven toxicity and/or C trough ‐driven efficacy. Fractionated doses may be evenly distributed within a dosing cycle. Alternatively, higher dose levels may be followed by lower dose levels if target mediated drug disposition and/or strong initial efficacy is desired, or a dosing holiday may be incorporated at the end of the cycle to allow for recovery from toxicities. Given the correlation often seen between C max, AUC, and C trough, data from fractionated vs. nonfractionated regimens yielding the same cumulative AUC are often required in order to correctly identify the key exposure driver, which is important for selecting the appropriate exposure metric to characterize the exposure–response relationships.

### The proton pump inhibitor test for gastroesophageal reflux disease: optimal cut-off value and duration [^2d60736c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There is no accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Aim

To assess the optimal cut-off value and duration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) test in GERD patients with and without oesophagitis.

Methods

Prospective study of 544 patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy and treated for 2 weeks with PPIs at double dose, and for 3 additional months at standard dose. The status of the patient at end of treatment was used as an independent diagnostic standard, i.e. patients completely asymptomatic were considered as "true" GERD patients.

Results

PPI test was positive in 89.7–97.8% of the patients according to the cut-off or duration of test used. Test sensitivity ranged from 95.5% to 98.8%, whereas specificity did not exceed 36.3%. Positive predictive values ranged from 87% to 80%, negative predictive values ranged from 58% to 70%, respectively.

Conclusions

The PPI test is a sensitive but poorly specific test in GERD patients. Its optimal duration is 1 week, and the optimal cut-off value is a decrease of heartburn score ≥ 75%. The diagnostic yield is higher in erosive oesophagitis compared with non-erosive reflux disease patients, similarly to the symptomatic response to 3-month PPI therapy.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^fabeac07]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Prevention and management of adverse effects related to steroid use — pretreatment considerations emphasize baseline infection screening and optimization of comorbidities before starting glucocorticoids; dosing is individualized and the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used given dose- and duration-dependent toxicity. Baseline workup includes viral hepatitis B and C serology and consideration for latent or active TB testing, and in pre-existing HIV, HIV viral load and CD4 count testing are appropriate; comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, cataract, glaucoma, infection, or osteoporosis should be optimally managed before steroids, and steroid dosing and duration vary by patient, oncologic agents, and type of immune-related adverse event (irAE).

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate [^21fd6a44]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings].

### The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration [^0502a522]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Some studies are published more than once. Duplicate publications may be difficult to ascertain, and their inclusion may introduce bias. We advise authors to describe any steps they used to avoid double counting and piece together data from multiple reports of the same study (such as juxtaposing author names, treatment comparisons, sample sizes, or outcomes). We also advise authors to indicate whether all reports on a study were considered, as inconsistencies may reveal important limitations. For example, a review of multiple publications of drug trials showed that reported study characteristics may differ from report to report, including the description of the design, number of patients analysed, chosen significance level, and outcomes. Authors ideally should present any algorithm that they used to select data from overlapping reports and any efforts they used to solve logical inconsistencies across reports.

Item 11: Data items

List and define all variables for which data were sought (such as PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.

Examples "Information was extracted from each included trial on: (1) characteristics of trial participants (including age, stage and severity of disease, and method of diagnosis), and the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria; (2) type of intervention (including type, dose, duration and frequency of the NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]; versus placebo or versus the type, dose, duration and frequency of another NSAID; or versus another pain management drug; or versus no treatment); (3) type of outcome measure (including the level of pain reduction, improvement in quality of life score (using a validated scale), effect on daily activities, absence from work or school, length of follow up, unintended effects of treatment, number of women requiring more invasive treatment)."

### The clinical outcomes of different doses of rivaroxaban in patients with isolated distal deep vein thrombosis [^e32f4b7a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Standard-dose rivaroxaban showed a favorable balance between VTE recurrence and major bleeding compared with low-dose rivaroxaban. Dose reduction increased the long-term risk of VTE recurrence. For patients with IDDVT, an adequate duration of anticoagulant therapy should be ensured, and the duration for less than 6 weeks as recommended in some studies should not be an appropriate option. The presence of RVT could identify the patients at high risk for VTE recurrence. Further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal duration in patients with RVT.
