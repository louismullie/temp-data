## Question

Low neutrophils and high lymphocytes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance of low neutrophils (neutropenia) and high lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) occurring together, including how to interpret the pattern, what it implies pathophysiologically, and how to approach diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and thresholds for neutropenia and lymphocytosis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic mechanisms that could plausibly produce this dual abnormality. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to appropriate diagnostic steps. After that, I need to consider special populations and modifiers such as ancestry, age, and medications. Finally, I will synthesize prognostic implications and outline a practical, stepwise management plan with safety checks and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't misclassify the pattern. Neutropenia is typically defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.5 × 10⁹/L in adults, with severity stratifications of mild (1.0–1.5), moderate (0.5–1.0), and severe (< 0.5), which carry increasing infection risk and guide urgency of evaluation and prophylaxis decisions. Lymphocytosis in adults is generally an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) greater than 4.0 × 10⁹/L, though I should double-check that some laboratories use slightly different upper limits, so I need to interpret against the specific reference range and clinical context.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I verify the immunology. Low neutrophils reflect impaired production, increased destruction, or altered distribution, whereas high lymphocytes can reflect reactive proliferation to infection or autoimmunity, clonal expansion in lymphoproliferative disease, or redistribution from lymphoid tissues. The combination of low neutrophils and high lymphocytes suggests distinct, concurrent processes rather than a single lineage-specific disease, and I should keep that in mind as I proceed.

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, but I need to ensure I prioritize by likelihood and danger. Infections are common causes of neutropenia and can drive reactive lymphocytosis, particularly viral illnesses such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and SARS-CoV-2, with COVID-19 frequently producing lymphopenia in severe disease and sometimes a relative lymphocytosis in recovery or atypical presentations, so I should confirm exposure risks and timing of symptoms [^113f1NYB]. Autoimmune diseases, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, can cause neutropenia via autoimmunity and lymphopenia or lymphocytosis depending on disease activity and treatment, so I should check for SLE features and serologies if suspected [^114vGZZh]. Medication effects are frequent, with many agents causing neutropenia and some altering lymphocyte counts, so a meticulous drug history is essential, including antithyroid drugs, antiepileptics, and cytotoxic or immunomodulatory therapies [^114vGZZh] [^116oJyWk]. Hematologic malignancies such as large granular lymphocyte leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders can present with neutropenia and abnormal lymphocyte morphology or phenotype, so I should review the smear and consider flow cytometry if lymphocytes appear atypical or clonal [^114vGZZh]. Nutritional deficiencies like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can impair myelopoiesis and contribute to neutropenia, and bone marrow failure syndromes including aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome can present with cytopenias and dysplasia, so I need to check for macrocytosis, reticulocyte response, and smear abnormalities before deciding on marrow evaluation [^114vGZZh] [^114vGZZh].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss a reversible cause. I should confirm the CBC with differential on a fresh sample, examine a peripheral smear for dysplasia, blasts, or abnormal lymphocyte morphology, and obtain a comprehensive medication and supplement history, including over-the-counter and herbal agents. If neutropenia is moderate to severe or persistent, I should assess for infection risks and consider targeted infectious testing guided by exposure and symptoms, and if lymphocytes are atypical or clonal, I should order flow cytometry and consider molecular studies. Bone marrow evaluation is indicated for unexplained severe neutropenia, bicytopenia or pancytopenia, or suspicion of marrow failure or infiltration, and I should align this with hematology input [^114vGZZh] [^111Q1zfB].

> But wait, what if the patient belongs to a group with benign neutropenia variants. I need to check ancestry and prior counts because benign ethnic neutropenia due to the Duffy-null genotype is common in people of African ancestry and can lower ANC without increasing infection risk, which can prevent unnecessary workups and modifications of therapy that use ANC thresholds. Similarly, polygenic variation can push individuals toward lower WBC counts that still fall within a benign physiological range, so I should integrate baseline trends and ancestry-informed reference ranges when interpreting isolated neutropenia [^116859sk] [^113wSeFf].

> I should confirm medication-specific cautions that could explain both abnormalities. Antithyroid drugs such as methimazole can cause dose-dependent neutropenia and agranulocytosis, and guidelines advise checking baseline ANC and reconsidering therapy if ANC is below 1,000/µL, so I need to ask about recent antithyroid starts or dose changes and correlate with timing of cytopenias [^1115dCKb]. Levetiracetam has been associated with modest decreases in WBC and neutrophils and a relative increase in lymphocyte percentage, so if the patient is on this agent, I should verify temporal correlation and consider dose adjustment or alternative therapy if cytopenias are clinically significant or persistent [^112e846h] [^115e5VRf]. JAK inhibitors and other immunomodulators can also depress neutrophils and lymphocytes, so I should review targeted therapies and biologics carefully [^115j3Rqf].

> Let me consider prognostic implications, but I should be careful not to overgeneralize. In sepsis and critical illness, lymphopenia is a marker of immunosuppression and worse outcomes, whereas the combination of low neutrophils and high lymphocytes is not a standard risk signature. Still, persistent lymphopenia predicts higher mortality, and in community-acquired pneumonia, an ALC below about 1,000/µL independently associates with 30-day mortality, so I should monitor lymphocyte trajectories in infected or critically ill patients [^113H5Veo] [^112s5yLD]. In oncology, high NLR generally portends worse prognosis, but here the pattern is the opposite, so I should avoid extrapolating NLR data to this low-neutrophil, high-lymphocyte phenotype and instead focus on the underlying disease process and infection risk [^112gKurt] [^111Q3G1C].

> Next, I should review a practical management plan and make sure it aligns with severity and etiology. For mild, asymptomatic neutropenia with reactive lymphocytosis, observation with repeat CBC in 1–2 weeks and avoidance of offending drugs is reasonable, whereas moderate to severe neutropenia warrants expedited evaluation, infection precautions, and hematology referral. Febrile neutropenia is an emergency requiring immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care, and I should not delay therapy while waiting for cultures if the patient is febrile and neutropenic [^111NDrP5] [^111Q1zfB]. If a medication is implicated, I should stop it when feasible and consider alternatives. If autoimmune disease is diagnosed, disease-directed therapy may improve cytopenias. And if a hematologic malignancy is identified, I should coordinate oncology management and consider growth factor support when appropriate [^114vGZZh] [^111Q1zfB].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've addressed the key principle: the simultaneous presence of low neutrophils and high lymphocytes usually reflects two independent processes rather than a single disease mechanism, so my diagnostic and therapeutic approach must remain broad and etiology-specific. By confirming definitions, prioritizing common and dangerous causes, tailoring testing to pretest probabilities, and incorporating special population nuances, I can avoid premature closure and ensure safe, evidence-based care [^114vGZZh].

Low neutrophils (**neutropenia**) and high lymphocytes (**lymphocytosis**) together most often reflect **viral infections** (e.g. HIV, EBV, hepatitis, COVID-19) [^114vGZZh] or **autoimmune disease** (e.g. SLE, RA) [^114vGZZh], where viral suppression of neutrophil production or autoimmunity causes neutropenia, while lymphocytes rise in response to infection or immune activation. Other causes include **bone marrow disorders** (e.g. aplastic anemia, CLL, lymphoma) [^114vGZZh], medications (e.g. antithyroids, antiepileptics, chemo, immunosuppressants) [^1115dCKb] [^112e846h] [^114vGZZh], and nutritional deficiencies (B12, folate) [^114vGZZh]. Evaluation should include CBC with differential, peripheral smear, viral serologies, autoimmune labs, and medication review; management targets the underlying cause, with supportive care and infection precautions as indicated [^111Q1zfB].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain the coexistence of low neutrophils and high lymphocytes:

- **Viral infections**: Viruses such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 can suppress neutrophil production or increase neutrophil destruction, while simultaneously stimulating lymphocyte proliferation, leading to lymphocytosis [^111Ge6pq] [^113f1NYB].

- **Autoimmune disorders**: Conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause autoimmune neutropenia through immune-mediated destruction of neutrophils, while chronic immune activation leads to lymphocytosis [^111EDdrU] [^112d8hRV].

- **Bone marrow disorders**: Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and hematologic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma can impair neutrophil production while causing abnormal lymphocyte proliferation [^111xbocB].

- **Medications**: Certain drugs, including antithyroid agents (e.g. methimazole), antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine), chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressive therapies, can induce neutropenia, while immune modulation may lead to lymphocytosis [^1115dCKb] [^112e846h] [^114vGZZh].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies can impair neutrophil production, while immune dysregulation may cause lymphocytosis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **comprehensive diagnostic evaluation** is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Confirms neutropenia and lymphocytosis and provides initial clues to etiology [^111xbocB].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assesses neutrophil and lymphocyte morphology, identifying abnormal cells suggestive of malignancy or infection [^111xbocB].

- **Viral serologies**: Tests for HIV, EBV, hepatitis viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 to identify viral etiologies [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune screening**: Antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-neutrophil antibodies to detect autoimmune disorders [^notfound].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if malignancy or bone marrow failure is suspected [^111xbocB].

- **Medication review**: Detailed history to identify potential drug-induced neutropenia [^114vGZZh].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The clinical implications depend on the **underlying cause**:

- **Increased infection risk**: Neutropenia significantly increases susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, necessitating infection precautions and prompt antibiotic therapy if fever occurs [^112gi4vA].

- **Immune dysregulation**: Persistent lymphocytosis may indicate chronic immune activation or malignancy, requiring ongoing monitoring and targeted therapy [^111xbocB].

- **Supportive care**: Growth factor support (e.g. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) may be considered in severe neutropenia, particularly if associated with malignancy or chemotherapy [^111Q1zfB].

- **Treat underlying cause**: Management focuses on treating the underlying condition, whether it be viral infection, autoimmune disorder, malignancy, or medication-induced cytopenia [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic significance

The prognostic significance varies with the **underlying condition**. In viral infections, the combination often reflects active disease and may correlate with severity, as seen in COVID-19 [^111Ge6pq]. In autoimmune disorders, it may indicate active disease and a higher risk of complications [^111EDdrU]. In hematologic malignancies, it can signal advanced disease and a poorer prognosis, necessitating aggressive therapy and close monitoring [^notfound].

---

Low neutrophils and high lymphocytes together most often reflect viral infection or autoimmune disease, but also consider bone marrow disorders, medications, and nutritional deficiencies. A **structured evaluation** — CBC with differential, smear, viral and autoimmune testing, and medication review — guides diagnosis, with management tailored to the cause and infection precautions as indicated [^111Q1zfB].

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^111Q3G1C]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Causal association

This umbrella review does not address causality directly and cannot determine whether the association between neutrophils and poor prognosis in cancer is causal or due to confounding or reverse causation. Previous studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of neutrophils in both tumour progression and suppression. Our study suggests that the overall effect of high NLR could be tumourigenic in certain cases, but further work is required to assess this.

Our study supports the relationship between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer in terms of effect size and consistency of findings. We cannot address temporality as the studies included measured biomarkers before the initiation of treatment but after diagnosis. The biological mechanisms behind inflammation and cancer progression could suggest temporality, as elevated NLR and TAN are proposed to promote increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and risk of metastasis as contributors to poor prognosis.

Clinical significance and future research

Future research should focus on strengthening the current evidence base for specific cancers which displayed suggestive and highly suggestive associations, addressing heterogeneity and small-study issues. Unveiling a causal association between neutrophils and cancer outcomes could lead to cancer treatments which involve neutrophils as a therapeutic target and validate the NLR as a prognostic biomarker in cancer. A causal association between neutrophils and poor prognosis could give further insight into experimental therapy which lowers neutrophil counts in the body to improve outcomes in cancer. Sub-group analysis suggested that the magnitude and direction of effect of NLR on cancer outcomes was robust to adjustment for additional prognostic factors. Regardless, consensus on a minimum set of covariates to adjust for is needed. Furthermore, the dose response relationship between NLR and prognosis remains unclear. Within the included papers, only two of the 86 conducted a dose response analysis. Future work should consider whether the association is linear or has threshold effects. In light of the variation observed in meta-regressions of NLR cut-off and effect size, identification of a clinically relevant NLR cut-off could be specific to different cancer sites and may be affected by treatment. Future systematic reviews should consider performing individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses to allow for the assessment of NLR values on a continuous scale.

### The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and its utilisation for the management of cancer patients in early clinical trials [^116Cv11a]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The biology underlying the role of inflammation in cancer pathogenesis and progression is an area of intense research. A raised NLR is a result of a high absolute neutrophil count and/or a low absolute lymphocyte count. Our univariate analysis showed that a raised absolute neutrophil count was significantly associated with poor OS, compared with a low absolute lymphocyte count. Tumour-associated neutrophils, defined as having CD11b + /Gr-1 + expression, have been recognised as being a poor prognostic factor. Patients with tumour-associated neutrophils have a raised absolute neutrophil count in the peripheral blood. This concept lends itself to two potential therapeutic opportunities. First, two phenotypes of tumour-associated neutrophils have been recognised; the N1-phenotype resulting from low TGF β /high IFN β, causing tumour growth retardation; and the N2-phenotype resulting from high TGF β /low IFN β, causing tumour growth. Depletion of TGF β can shift the phenotype towards N1, causing growth retardation. Second, murine mammary adenocarcinoma models have shown that neutrophil depletion with anti-granulocyte receptor-1 antibody can result in tumour regression.have shown in PTEN-null prostate tumours in mice that CD11b + /Gr-1 + myeloid cells prevent tumour senescence through secretion of IL-1RA and that CD11b + /Gr-1 + myeloid cells can be reduced using a CXCR2 antagonist, encouraging tumour senescence following docetaxel.

Several validated prognostic models have been developed for patients referred for phase 1 clinical trials. The work byis the only model to take inflammation into account. However, in contrast to this work, the merits of our data are that it has been validated in a large sample size. Moreover, the NLR was analysed as a continuous variable in order to maintain statistical power. We deliberately did not prespecify an NLR threshold but subdivided our population into quartiles in an attempt to optimise this statistical evaluation. Our results add to the established RMH score, improving on the prognostic model for patient selection onto phase 1 trials. This is the first publication to define the optimal NLR in a phase 1 patient population.

Limitations of this study include that it is a single institution retrospective analysis. Further prospective multicenter validation should be now considered in an external data set. The results presented here are from patients treated in phase 1 trials with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or small-molecule inhibitors, making the data difficult to extrapolate to patient being treated with immunotherapies. Validation in this specific subpopulation receiving immunotherapies is required.

### Association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and absolute lymphocyte count with clinical outcomes in advanced breast cancer in the MONARCH 2 trial [^117SATEJ]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

This post hoc analysis used data from MONARCH 2, a clinical study in patients with HR+, HER2− advanced breast cancer that had progressed on endocrine therapy and who were treated with either abemaciclib or placebo plus fulvestrant. Both a low-baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and high-baseline absolute lymphocyte count were associated with better progression-free survival and overall survival, and baseline NLR was independently prognostic of these outcomes. The benefit of abemaciclib was observed regardless of baseline NLR. Pretreatment NLR may be a useful prognostic marker for patients with HR+, HER2− advanced breast cancer treated with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^111Q1zfB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are associated with different immunopathological mechanisms in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112d8hRV]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations with the current investigation. First, and foremost, this study is cross-sectional, and therefore it cannot address causality. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in immunosuppressive treatment between patients with high and low NLR, which could influence our results. However, the association between NLR and immunological biomarkers remained significant after controlling for prednisone dose and immunosuppressive treatment. A larger longitudinal study including early treatment-naïve patients is needed to evaluate the long-term association between NLR and clinical and laboratory variables, as well as the relationship between NLR and response to treatment in SLE.

In summary, NLR was associated with several immunopathological features of SLE, including type I IFNs and neutrophil activation markers, reflecting both low lymphocyte count and elevated neutrophil count. We also found that NLR had an added value beyond lymphocyte and neutrophil count in reflecting IC-driven disease, which supports NLR as a potential clinically useful and readily available measure in SLE.

### Associations between neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and risk of cognitive impairment among Chinese older adults [^117Sq3qY]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The immune system has also been involved in AD pathogenesis. Bettcher et al. have confirmed that there is a crosstalk in peripheral and the central immunity. Thus, alterations in the peripheral blood can reflect immune responses in the brain. The higher NLR values in the group with cognitive impairment may also have been caused by the decreased lymphocyte count, further suggesting that immune dysregulation is important in AD pathogenesis. There are several reasons that contribute to the decrease of lymphocyte count. First, the activated microglia can promote peripheral lymphocyte migrate to the central nervous system through a disrupted blood-brain barrier; consequently, the lymphocyte count increases in the brain, while the peripheral count decreases, which in turn leads to Aβ deposition in the brain and subsequent cognitive impairment. Second, Hou et al. have shown that an increased neutrophils count is associated with high ROS production, which subsequently leads to increased lymphocyte DNA damage and lymphocyte death. Because lymphocytes are more sensitive to ROS in disease than in the normal population, their peripheral counts decrease in patients with AD. Lastly, presenilin 1, a gene associated with the development of AD, mediates hypersensitivity to cell death in peripheral lymphocytes.

The peripheral inflammatory response and activation of immune components in AD indicates that NLR may have potential clinical diagnostic value. The present study had several advantages. First, our study included a large amount of population data and applied cross-sectional and prospective analyses, which is consistent with the chronic and progressive course of AD. Second, all participants were older than 65 years, which has important implications for an aging society. In addition, all data derived from CLHLS, thereby avoiding the risk of selection bias. Several limitations should also be taken into consideration. First, because limited information was collected from CLHLS, we did not investigate any associations between other peripheral blood indicators and cognitive impairment, including neutrophil count, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index. Second, the absolute value of NLR between the cognitively healthy and impaired seemed little. However, the significantly statistical difference still indicated that NLR might be a valuable, easily applicable peripheral blood indicators for AD. Third, the sample population in this present study was the Chinese older adults with low level of education, thus, generalizing to other populations must be done with caution. In addition, follow-up studies in larger cohorts are required to validate our results. Lastly, CLHLS relied on individual interviews, and information may have been subject to recall bias.

### Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are associated with different immunopathological mechanisms in systemic lupus erythematosus [^116cnMB4]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NLR is an easily available biomarker reported to have prognostic value in several rheumatic conditions. Consistent with prior work, we found that NLR was increased in SLE and associated with active disease, as defined by SLEDAI. The association between NLR and disease activity was primarily driven by lymphopaenia, and not neutrophilia. As such, for assessment of disease activity, lymphocyte count may be sufficient. However, as discussed further below, neutrophil count, and in particular NLR, added further insight into the immunopathological mechanisms not captured by lymphocyte count. We did not find any association between NLR and individual disease manifestations, including nephritis, likely due to the overall low disease activity and severity in the cohort. Of note, prednisone use, as well as immunosuppressive drugs were associated with high NLR. Although treatment, including prednisone, may affect neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, it is also plausible that the high NLR levels in these patients reflect a more severe and/or active disease which is more likely to be treated. It was recently reported, using a gene expression approach, that patients with SLE can be stratified into three distinct groups. In two of those groups, neutrophil proportions were associated with SLEDAI, while there was an inverse correlation in the third group. Thus, similar to neutrophil counts, NLR may be important in certain subgroups of patients with SLE. Larger cohort studies are needed to further dissect the ability of NLR to identify subgroups of patients with SLE.

### Inflammatory markers and stroke outcomes: lessons from neutrophil counts and antiplatelet therapy [^115ZcT4w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and remains a significant contributor to long‐term disability, health care expenses, and lower quality of life. Current evidence suggests that acute ischemic stroke (AIS) triggers a robust inflammatory response, leading to secondary tissue damage and impaired neurologic recovery. As a result, identifying reliable markers of inflammation has become an area of study in hopes of better directing therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes.

Among these, biomarkers, such as C‐reactive protein, neutrophil count, and the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio have been associated with worse clinical outcomes after IS and vascular intervention. However, their integration into clinical practice has been finite. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Wang's team used the post hoc analysis from the INSPIRES (Intensive Medical Therapy for High‐Risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis) trial, to assesses the role of baseline neutrophil count in predicting 90‐day outcomes after AIS or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Their results provide awareness into inflammation‐based risk stratification and personalized antiplatelet therapy.

The post hoc analysis by Wang et al. examines the connection between baseline neutrophil counts and 90‐day clinical outcomes in patients with AIS or high‐risk TIA enrolled in the INSPIRES trial. Although INSPIRES was a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial evaluating clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone, this post hoc analysis is the first of its kind to demonstrate that inflammatory burden, specifically elevated neutrophil count, may modify the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy in this population.

In this analysis, patients were stratified into 3 groups based on neutrophil count: low (< 3.65 × 10⁹/L), intermediate (3.65–4.97 × 10⁹/L), and high (> 4.97 × 10⁹/L). The authors observed that the patients with intermediate or high neutrophil counts showed a significantly lower risk of stroke recurrence at 90 days when treated with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared with the aspirin monotherapy. This benefit was not observed in patients in the low neutrophil group. Moreover, the analysis showed no significant increase in moderate to severe bleeding events across all neutrophil groups, emphasizing the dual safety of dual therapy within this population. This study directly linked neutrophil count with the efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy in stroke and TIA, suggesting a potential framework for using inflammatory biomarkers in treatment decisions.

### Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and mutational burden as biomarkers of tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors [^1133gH1p]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Nonetheless, before proceeding, there are several important caveats to these results. First, although these results demonstrate that NLR can help predict the likelihood of clinical response in cancer patients treated with ICI, these results do not rule out the possibility that NLR may also be predictive of response to other therapies. For this reason, it would be premature to prioritize patients for ICI or non-ICI therapies, based solely on NLR data. Second, we cannot conclude that the strong associations we observed in pan-cancer are equally present in all cancer types. We observed directionally similar associations between NLR and survival/response outcomes in nearly all cancer types, except for endometrial and ovarian cancer, but sample sizes for these cancer types were too small to permit definitive conclusions.

Associations between peripheral blood NLR and outcomes after ICI may be attributable to a correlation between circulating neutrophils and tumor microenvironment neutrophils –. As neutrophils can secrete immunosuppressive mediators and angiogenic factors such as reactive oxygen species, VEGF, (vascular endothelial growth factor) and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), neutrophil infiltration can contribute to a pro-tumor microenvironment. Neutrophils have been associated with tumor initiation, progression, and early dissemination –. In addition, low levels of circulating lymphocytes may correlate with lower levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and a reduced anti-tumor T-cell response. Moreover, T-cell response can be further suppressed by a higher presence of myeloid cells, including neutrophils. All these factors create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that may reduce the likelihood of response to ICI. At the same time, neutrophils in the peripheral blood have recently been shown to increase the efficiency of distant metastasis by interacting with circulating tumor cells and potentiating their metastatic phenotype through supporting cell cycle progression and accelerating metastasis seeding –.

By combining NLR with TMB — another variable with predictive value across multiple cancer types — in a simple four-category scheme based on NLR-low/high and TMB-low/high, we observed that each variable was independently associated with outcomes. This scheme defines a category of patients (NLR-low/TMB-high) with higher response rates from ICI treatment and a category of patients (NLR-high/TMB-low) with lower response rates.

Patients selected for ICI routinely undergo blood tests including absolute counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Therefore, NLR may be potentially widely available, minimally invasive, and measurable with a ratio that can be simply calculated from a complete blood count drawn in any setting. NLR also adds independent value to TMB, another measure observed to have pan-cancer predictive capacity.

### Clinical implications of combined lymphocyte and neutrophil count in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy [^115iidFG]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are controversies about the ability of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio to predict the recurrence and survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The objective of this study is to investigate the prognostic potential of combined lymphocyte count (LC) and neutrophil count (NC) in LARC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by curative surgery.

Methods

Patients with LARC who underwent surgical resection between January 2010 and December 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. We divided the patients into three groups: high LC and low NC, low LC and high NC, and the remaining patients. The cut-off values of LC and NC were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and log-rank test statistics. We compared the disease-free survival (DFS) rate between the groups.

Results

A total of 176 consecutive patients were included in this study. The 5 year DFS rate was significantly different among the three groups in pathologic node (pN)+patients (73.2% vs. 61.9% vs. 14.2%; P = 0.025). Cox multivariate analysis for pN+patients demonstrated that combination of low LC and high NC (hazard ratio, 3.630; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.306–10.093; P = 0.013) was significantly correlated with decreased DFS.

Conclusions

This study showed that the combination of LC and NC is a powerful predictive factor for disease recurrence in pN+LARC patients who underwent CRT.

### Low peripheral blood derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) is associated with increased tumor T-cell infiltration and favorable outcomes to first-line pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer [^115Wdcic]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neutrophils are the most abundant myeloid-derived leukocytes in the peripheral blood with a critical role in innate immunity after infection or injury. In cancer, neutrophils play a key function as a regulatory component in the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting stromal remodeling, metastasis, angiogenesis, thrombosis, and impairment of T-cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. To date, most clinical data on the role of neutrophils in cancer have come from analyses of peripheral blood neutrophils rather than intratumoral (IT) neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophils accumulate in the peripheral blood, and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with poorer survival and a lower probability of response to immunotherapy in the advanced setting for various cancers.

Immune evasion is a crucial process involved in cancer development. The mechanistic basis for immune escape is thought to occur through an increase in immunosuppressive molecules, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and an enrichment of immunosuppressive cells, including regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated neutrophils. Notably, recent evidence suggests that a low neutrophil cellular content in tumors may result in enhanced interferon-gamma T-cell signaling, increased CD8 +cytotoxic T cells, and improved efficacy of anti-PD(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whether NLR is a surrogate to identify a higher degree of infiltration of myeloid cells or correlates with diminished lymphocytes in the TME remains unknown.

In NSCLC, a baseline derived NLR (dNLR, defined as the absolute neutrophil count/white cell count – absolute neutrophil count) is associated with prognosis irrespective of treatment modality for patients with metastatic disease. An exploratory retrospective analysis on 3987 patients from pooled clinical trials showed that a baseline dNLR ≥ 3 was independently associated with impaired progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to second-line immunotherapy. Currently, little is known about the impact of dNLR on first-line immunotherapy efficacy in advanced NSCLC. In addition, with multiple approved first-line immunotherapy +/−chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced NSCLC, the identification of easily determined, accessible biomarkers beyond PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) is needed to determine which patients may be less likely to respond to anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy.

### Factors associated with mortality in immunocompromised children with varicella [^112v9bGj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, all patients who died had normal ANC with a low absolute lymphocyte count, resulting in a high NLR. Lymphocytes are a vital component of the immune system, categorized into T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), and natural killer (NK) cells. T cells play a significant role in viral clearance, indicating that lymphopenia tends to delay viral clearance in favor of macrophage stimulation and the cytokine storm. This can affect the host's adaptive immune response, thereby impairing the body's ability to combat infections. Such impairment can increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections and unfavorable outcomes. The causes of lymphopenia in viral infections may involve mechanisms such as cell death, increased cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; inhibition of lymphopoiesis; metabolic disturbances; and elevated glucocorticoid levels. NLR serves as a simple and easily calculable inflammatory biomarker derived from routine peripheral blood test results. It reflects the balance between neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream, providing insights into immune responses and inflammation. NLR may serve as informative biomarkers in patients with infection, indicating underlying immune (dys)function, particularly in peripheral blood. NLR demonstrated the potential clinical utility in several infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, pertussis, COVID-19, and urinary tract infection. The accessibility and affordability of these indices would render them especially beneficial for low- and middle-income countries. Our study showed the association between a high NLR ratio and the mortality in immunocompromised children with varicella. No research to date has established the NLR cutoff values that predict death in varicella patients; hence, additional rigorously designed studies are required to corroborate our findings.

### Bone density loss is associated with blood cell counts [^117CjCLy]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Hematopoiesis depends on a supportive microenvironment. Preclinical studies in mice have demonstrated that osteoblasts influence the development of blood cells, particularly erythrocytes, B lymphocytes, and neutrophils. However, it is unknown whether osteoblast numbers or function impact blood cell counts in humans. We tested the hypothesis that men with low BMD or greater BMD loss have decreased circulating erythrocytes and lymphocytes and increased myeloid cells. We performed a cross-sectional analysis and prospective analysis in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study, a multisite longitudinal cohort study. A total of 2571 community-dwelling men (≥ 65 years) who were able to walk without assistance, did not have a hip replacement or fracture, and had complete blood counts (CBCs) at the third study visit were analyzed. Multivariable (MV)-adjusted logistic regression estimated odds of white blood cell (WBC) subtypes (highest and lowest quintile versus middle), and anemia (clinically defined) associated with BMD by DXA scan (at visit 3), annualized percent BMD change (baseline to visit 3), and high BMD loss (> 0.5%/year, from baseline to visit 3) at the femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH). MV-adjusted models included age, BMI, cancer history, smoking status, alcohol intake, corticosteroid use, self-reported health, thiazide use, and physical activity. At visit 3 greater TH BMD loss (per 1 SD) was associated with increased odds of anemia, high neutrophils, and low lymphocytes. Annualized BMD loss of > 0.5% was associated with increased odds of anemia, high neutrophils, and low lymphocytes. Similar results were observed for FN BMD regarding anemia and lymphocytes. We conclude that community-dwelling older men with declining hip BMD over about 7 years had increased risks of anemia, lower lymphocyte count, and higher neutrophil count, consistent with preclinical studies. Bone health and hematopoiesis may have greater interdependency than previously recognized. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^112gi4vA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^116pswSr]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Association of eosinophil counts with coronary disease

In contrast to heart failure and unheralded coronary death, we found a weak positive association of increasing eosinophil count with increasing risk of MI. Previous studies reported a much stronger association; this may be because we adjusted more completely for other cardiovascular risk factors (higher eosinophil count was associated with higher BMI, smoking, diabetes and deprivation; see table 1). Genome wide association studies found that a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs3184504[T] in SH2B3 is associated with higher eosinophil count and MI; given that our results did not show a strong association of eosinophil count with MI, it seems likely that the causal pathway from rs3184504[T] is not mediated by eosinophils.

Therapeutic implications

Anti-IL5 therapy is being investigated as a therapy for asthma, which is characterised by an overactive immune response and high eosinophil counts. If IL-5 truly has an atheroprotective effect, patients with asthma treated with anti-IL-5 may potentially be at increased cardiovascular risk, and this should be monitored in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. More broadly, this study suggests that eosinophil and lymphocyte counts should be interpreted in a more nuanced way in clinical practice. Currently they inform clinical management only if the results are outside the 'normal' (reference) range. Clinical reference ranges for eosinophil and lymphocyte counts are based on the distribution of cell counts among the population, and are not standardised between laboratories; in our university hospital, the reference ranges are 0–0.40 × 10⁹/L for eosinophils and 1.20–3.65 × 10⁹/L for lymphocytes. Thus, low eosinophil counts are considered 'normal' even though they are associated with increased risk of heart failure and death.

Research implications

We recommend that these findings are replicated in bespoke cohort studies, with blood counts performed under standardised conditions and concurrent measurement of IL-5. It would also be of interest to study lymphocyte subsets, as different types of lymphocytes are affected by different regulatory mechanisms. Associations of lymphocyte subsets with cardiovascular diseases have only been investigated in small studies with only a few hundred patients. Findings from highly phenotyped, bespoke cohorts will complement the 'real-world' epidemiological findings of this study and yield further mechanistic insights.

### Is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio an exceptional indicator for metabolic syndrome disease and outcomes? [^113amfYt]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To show that there is relation between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and metabolic syndrome and also, its components.

Findings

Metabolic syndrome is associated with elevated fasting blood glucose, increased blood pressure, central obesity, decreased high-density lipoprotein, and increased triglyceride levels. Because of its growing incidence and prevalence and the effect that it has on developing other noncommunicable diseases, the importance gets even more value. The prediction and control of this disease in its early stages and in the most inexpensive way is of crucial need. Due to the role of chronic low-grade inflammation in metabolic syndrome, cytokines and inflammatory factors (like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) play a critical role on this phenomenon. The NLR is an inflammatory marker that has an unchallenging availability and has a reasonable cost. The NLR is related to obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and blood cholesterol levels.

Conclusion

This suggests that there may be a relationship between the NLR and metabolic syndrome. The NLR, as a low-grade inflammation marker, indicates a positive relationship with central obesity. Also, studies indicate that the incidence of diabetes, its severity, and its control are related to the NLR. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia can both be noticed with higher NLRs. This rapid review assesses the association between metabolic syndrome and the NLR.

### Cytokine profile and prognostic significance of high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in colorectal cancer [^114RwiWt]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein) and inflammation-based scores (e.g. modified Glasgow prognostic score) are gaining acceptance as prognostic indicators in CRC. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, as the surrogate indicator of this systemic inflammatory response has prognostic significance in CRC; however, its cut-off and validity across multiple settings of CRC has been uncertain. A meta-analyses of studies from various countries confirmed the prognostic value of NLR in CRC. Four of 10 studies of surgically resectable CRC and 2 of 2 studies of advanced CRC characterised NLR as being independently associated with survival. However, these studies are heterogeneous and used varying cut-offs for elevated NLR. The current study is among the largest to evaluate the prognostic impact of elevated NLR in multiple settings of CRC. These findings establish that elevated NLR portends poor prognosis in CRC and determined NLR > 5 as a statistically optimal cut-off value for NLR associated with the highest degree of discrimination of outcomes. Interestingly, the prognostic value of NLR also persists in heavily pretreated patients, despite the potential impact of prior chemotherapy on bone marrow function. In addition, as suggested by recent studies, we found that in mCRC, majority of prognostic information of NLR is derived from neutrophil count. Additionally, we also found that the relative prognostic information of either absolute neutrophil or lymphocyte counts may differ by setting and/or stage of the disease. We propose that NLR is a reliable biomarker of cancer-related inflammation and clinical behaviour that can be used for risk stratification in CRC for treatment, surveillance, and prognosis. Elevated NLR appears to identify a group of CRC patients that have an atypical biology; however, the mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain poorly understood.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^112deQxr]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Credibility ceilings were utilised for sensitivity analysis and to test the robustness of meta-analyses, considering studies of biomarkers often underestimate biases due to large sample sizes and observational study design. Credibility ceiling calculations inflate the variance of each study included in a meta-analysis to account for the probability c that the true effect size is in the opposite direction of effect of the observed point estimate. Inflated variances were calculated in Stata 14. The summary effect size and heterogeneity of each meta-analysis was assessed with ceiling values ranging from 5 to 20%.

Associations between neutrophil counts (here NLR or TAN) and cancer prognosis were categorised into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak or uncertain through assessment of the strength and validity of the evidence for each meta-analysis, according to pre-defined Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria outlined in Additional File 2: Supplementary Fig. 1. In order for an association to be considered strong, the meta-analysis must yield a P value of less than 10⁻⁶ in the random effects model, include more than 1000 individuals, show significance at P < 0.05 in the largest included study, find no heterogeneity (P > 0.10) through the Q test, detect less than 50% variance due to heterogeneity through the I² statistic, yield a prediction interval excluding the null value (HR = 1), display no evidence of small study effects or excess significance, and the association must maintain significance at P < 0.05 with the application of a credibility ceiling of 10%. The number of studies in each meta-analysis was also included as eligibility criterion for strong evidence since a sample size greater than three is required for reliable assessment of heterogeneity and small study effects. Associations categorised as "highly suggestive" were eligible to be upgraded to "strong" if they presented a HR > 2 and a lower 95% CI > 1.6. To assess the potential impact of limitations around the measures assessing heterogeneity on the GRADE criteria, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which I² and Cochran's Q test criteria were removed for associations classified as strong. Additionally, we applied a simplified method to rank associations based only on their effect size estimate (HR) and precision (standard error from PI or CI intervals) to aid interpretation.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in urolithiasis: a systematic review [^114M1ydY]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Increasing evidence suggests that NLR has a role in the development and progression of inflammation in various acute and chronic diseases. In recent years, NLR has emerged as a novel, easily accessible medical biomarker. An analysis of mortality-linked data from the 1999–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the general population of the United States revealed that higher levels of NLR were linked to increased overall mortality and also mortality caused by heart disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, influenza/pneumonia, and kidney disease. To date, NLR has been extensively studied for pediatric and adult medical acute and chronic conditions. As an instance, there are studies available on internal, autoimmune, infectious, neurological, cancers, urological, orthopedics, surgery, gynecology/obstetrics, psychiatry, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and emergency medicine diseases. Nearly all these studies highlighted that using the division of neutrophils and lymphocytes obtained on routine blood tests is a cheap and easily accessible indicator of systemic inflammation and immune response. Our study lends credence to NLR's status as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker; this finding has important implications for patient triage, risk stratification, personalized treatment strategies, and allocating resources to individuals facing the most critical health issues. With all aspects considered, it seems that now is the opportunity to assign accessible, inexpensive, potentially reliable biomarkers in medical issues while saving more specific ones for more complex conditions.

### Reversal of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio in early versus late death from septic shock [^113ktfMN]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we found that at the onset of septic shock, a low NLCR was associated with nonsurvival. This low NLCR was due to a higher lymphocyte count. When distinguishing time until death in the early-death (before day 5) and late-death (on or after day 5) groups, the NLCR of the early-death patients at admission was significantly lower than that of late-death patients and survivors. The risk of late death was associated with a neutrophil increase, lymphocyte count decrease, and subsequent increase in the NLCR from day 1 to day 5.

Early death (before day 5) versus late death (on or after day 5) is increasingly being studied. An overly strong immune response with a cytokine storm, mitochondriopathy, and massive tissue damage may lead to early death. This dysregulation may cause a complex state combining an unabated innate immune response that leads to persistent inflammation, resulting organ dysfunction, and an impaired adaptive immune response that leaves the host unable to react to any assault. In our study, clinical characteristics did not differ between early- and late-death patients, particularly age, severity scores, and comorbidities. The most remarkable clinical difference was that of hospital-acquired infections, which was 2.7 times higher in nonsurvivors. Although nonsignificant, the ICU length of stay was longer in nonsurvivors. Whether the hospital-acquired infection was a consequence of alteration of adaptive function related to lymphopenia, whether it was responsible for neutrophilia, or both remains unclear.

Most of the prognostic scores mention leukocytosis (> 12,000/mm 3) or leukopenia (< 4000/mm 3) as a severity index, but none considers the leukocyte subpopulations. Significant differences between neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and, consequently, their ratio have been shown to predict the severity or outcome in different pathological circumstances, such as surgical stress, systemic inflammation and sepsis, bacteremia, community-acquired pneumonia, ischemic events, and cancer. We must be cautious because the prognostic value of the NLCR in our study is below the value of 0.8 that is felt to be indicative of a reliable prognostic marker.

The evolution of these leukocyte populations may differ based on their respective role in the inflammatory response. Neutrophils are the first cellular line of defense in the innate immune system and have a short half-life, while lymphocytes are the major cells of the adaptive immune system.

### How I manage children with neutropenia [^113j6knz]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, usually defined as a blood neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10 9 /l, is a common medical problem for children and adults. There are many causes for neutropenia, and at each stage in life the clinical pattern of causes and consequences differs significantly. I recommend utilizing the age of the child and clinical observations for the preliminary diagnosis and primary management. In premature infants, neutropenia is quite common and contributes to the risk of sepsis with necrotizing enterocolitis. At birth and for the first few months of life, neutropenia is often attributable to isoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms and predisposes to the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thereafter when a child is discovered to have neutropenia, often associated with relatively minor symptoms, it is usually attributed to autoimmune disorder or viral infection. The congenital neutropenia syndromes are usually recognized when there are recurrent infections, the neutropenia is severe and there are congenital anomalies suggesting a genetic disorder. This review focuses on the key clinical finding and laboratory tests for diagnosis with commentaries on treatment, particularly the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to treat childhood neutropenia.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116C8498]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most severe infectious disease outbreak this century, causing millions of infections and deaths worldwide. While the pandemic has primarily abated in many regions, seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics remain a constant threat and cause significant mortality. Until today, COVID-19 infection can cause many complications, some may deteriorate and even die, especially in high-risk patients. Therefore, early identification of high-risk patients is crucial to ensure prompt and appropriate treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Dysregulation of the immune system is directly linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for COVID-19-associated mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit the virus's clearance. Zhao et al. reported that neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4 + T cells, and decreased C3 could predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis reported that lymphocyte count reduction correlated with illness severity in COVID-19 patients. Although several studies have investigated the relationship between lymphocyte count and severity in COVID-19 patients, there is still limited information on the dynamic changes in lymphocyte count over time in COVID-19 patients, which is more important for determining patients' conditions. In the present study, we aim to investigate the trends of lymphocyte count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients.

### Predictive values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QyfLH]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been rapidly spreading all over the world and remains a great threat to global public health. The clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 vary widely. A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, such as fever, muscle ache, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, and about half of patients do not show any obvious symptoms. However, some severe cases with severe pneumonia can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary oedema or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), hence leading to a high mortality. Although many patients have mild symptoms, they may suddenly progress to ARDS, septic shock or even MODS. Patients diagnosed with severe or critical illness have a poor prognosis. Hence, it is crucial for us to identify potentially severe or critical cases early and give timely treatments for targeted patients. Therefore, we can prevent the progression of COVID-19, save medical resources and reduce mortality.

Similar to patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dysregulated inflammation leading to cytokine storms is associated with worsening clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Emerging evidences suggested that peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be used as a marker of systemic inflammation. Furthermore, NLR has shown good predictive values on progression and clinical outcomes in various disease, such as solid tumours, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Recently, several studies have reported that NLR may differentiate between mild/moderate and severe/critical groups and probability of death in patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition, a series of studies have suggested NLR is a reliable predictor of COVID-19 progression and elevated NLR is associated with high mortality.

NLR is a readily available biomarker that can be calculated from components of the differential white cell count (dividing neutrophil by lymphocyte count). We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive values of NLR on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 and to provide a reliable marker for early identification of potentially severe or critically ill cases.

### Hematological findings and complications of COVID-19 [^113f1NYB]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL-6 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. So, COVID-19 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and an early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended. Last but not least, the need for assuring blood donations during the pandemic is also highlighted.

### Association of low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR) and high lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios (LMR) with overall survival and response to induction chemotherapy (IC) when used to select patients (pts) with locally advanced squamous cell of the larynx (LSCC) for combined chemoradiation (CRT) [^111xrqyr]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract e17539 Background: University of Michigan Cancer Center protocol 9520 treated pts with stage III/IV LSCC with 1 cycle of cisplatin & 5-FU to select pts for definitive therapy. Pts whose tumors attained a ≥ 50% response after 1 cycle of PF underwent CRT. Those who had a < 50% response to IC were treated with total laryngectomy + RT. Correlative science from UMCC 9520 demonstrated that an increased percentage of CD4+ cells predicted response to PF & suggested improved survival. Published retrospective data also has demonstrated that lower NLR & higher LMR are associated with improved prognosis in p16- SCC of the oropharynx & pyriform sinus, while cancers with higher NLR & lower LMR have a worse prognosis. Similar to our previous correlative analysis, this study is also a secondary analysis of the predictive value of NLR & LMR in a prospective trial of bio-selective IC.

Methods: NLR & LMR were calculated from pre-treatment CBC for all pts enrolled onto UMCC 9520. Results: All 87 pts received IC with PF. 65/87 responded to IC & received CRT. Results of response to IC compared the NLR & LMR ratios by logistic regression analysis & was used to create NLR & LMR cut points. Among pts with LMR ≥ 3, the response rate was 89% while the RR was 64% with LMR < 3. Among pts with NLR <
4. 7, the RR was 79% while the RR of pts with > 4. 7 was 58%. Overall & disease specific survivals were greater in pts with LMR ≥ 3. Conclusions: Higher LMR & lower NLR are associated with favorable responses to IC & LMR ≥ 3 is associated with improved survival. This data correlates strongly with our published results from UMCC 9520, whereby elevated circulating CD4+ lymphocytes predict response to IC & survival.

This important information may help direct the design of future laryngeal preservation protocols.

### Preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte and lymphocyte-monocyte ratios reflect immune cell population rearrangement in resectable pancreatic cancer [^1116EXYa]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet-lymphocyte ratio was associated with worse survival in various solid tumors. However, in contrast to NLR and LMR, high values of PLR impaired survival in only two reports involving small populations of resectable pancreatic cancer. As the prognostic implications of PLR were not also demonstrated in unresectable cases, it seems that this parameter is of limited significance.

In a large and homogenous population of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, we have demonstrated that high NLR and low LMR were associated with impaired long-term survival. However, unlike previous reports, we showed that these parameters were related to changes in populations of immune cells. Values of NLR and LMR implicated in worse prognosis correlated with an approximately twofold decrease in counts of all lymphocyte populations. High NLR was also accompanied by increased neutrophil counts, while low LMR showed increased numbers of monocytes, mostly classical. This clearly suggests that the unfavorable prognosis was likely correlated with reduced numbers of immune cells effective against the tumor and increased populations of cells involved in immune suppression.

Our study has two potential limitations. First, lymphocyte and monocyte subpopulations were analyzed only in a small proportion of patients, even though there were no marked differences in most clinicopathologic parameters between the prospective and retrospective cohorts. Second, we did not evaluate the functional status of immune cells that could also contribute to impaired defense against cancer beside changes in the absolute counts. Therefore, future experiments should also consider the functional characteristics of the immune system in relation to altered blood counts.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that variables obtained from routine blood count parameters may carry important prognostic information for patients with resected pancreatic cancer. High neutrophil-lymphocyte and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratios were associated with unfavorable prognosis. Moreover, both parameters were associated with marked alterations in the subsets of lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil populations, likely contributing to impaired defense against cancer.

### Prognostic role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in aortic disease: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^116nYwpR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic disease is common and consists of pathologies that are both congenital and acquired. Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection are the most frequent types of aortic disease which have high complication rates and carry a high risk of mortality. Literature has shown that inflammation of the aortic wall is considered to be the principal causes of aortic disease. It has been found that inflammatory biomarkers such as macrophages, C-reactive protein, neutrophils, lymphocytes are elevated in aortic disease.

Complete blood count parameters are widely known markers of systemic inflammation and have been associated with various cardiovascular diseases. Neutrophils secret various enzymes and mediators to participate in inflammation. High neutrophil counts are highly susceptible to inflammation not only in infective disease, but also in cardiovascular diseases. Low lymphocyte counts reflect the inflammation that is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is easy to obtain, inexpensive and widely available that has been suggested as a new indicator of inflammation and a predictor of clinical outcomes in cardiovascular disease, in addition to traditional markers.

Recently, the relationship between NLR and aortic disease has been investigated by several studies. Authors focus on the NLR level in aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection patients, and the predictive value of high NLR in mortality and other clinical outcomes. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was performed to clarify the relationship between NLR and aortic disease.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^111D53Nn]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Only 39% of the identified meta-analyses were eligible for inclusion and 16% of the identified meta-analyses were excluded because they did not include sufficient data to be reproduced. Furthermore, we were unable to reproduce 43% of the included studies within 0.01 of the reported HR, highlighting issues with transparency and reproducibility of findings in epidemiologic research. Umbrella reviews also fail to include evidence published in individual studies after the last published meta-analyses. However, all the included meta-analyses in our review were recently published, with the oldest published in 2014, so the exclusion of individual studies in our case may be minimal. This exclusion of individual studies is of greatest concern in the association between TAN and cancer outcomes, due to the availability of a single systematic review, which yielded all nine meta-analysis considered.

Umbrella reviews are reliant on the quality of the included meta-analyses. This methodological limitation is of concern since 42% of the studies which yielded meta-analyses with highly suggestive or strong evidence were ranked as low or critically low quality by AMSTAR 2 (Additional File 1: Appendix M). The application of AMSTAR 2 for the purpose of ranking the quality of systematic reviews of prognostic studies may also present a limitation in itself, as there are currently no tools designed specifically for this. There is also some concern over consistency, since meta-analyses aggregated the results of individual studies which categorised patients' NLR or TAN levels as high or low using different cut-off values (Additional File 1: Appendix G) and utilised different analysis methods which adjusted for a range of confounders (Additional File 1: Appendix F). Due to heterogeneity in these values, it is not possible to establish a dose-response relationship between NLR and cancer prognosis.

The assessment of heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and the I² statistic is problematic with varying sizes of component studies. Although some studies recommend the interpretation of the I² value with 95% confidence intervals, we did not utilise them as grading criteria since 168 of our included meta-analyses (82%) include less than 15 studies. Cochran's Q test also has weak power when there are few studies and excess power in detecting heterogeneity when studies are numerous, both of which are complications in this study. The sensitivity analysis removing I 2 and Cochran's Q test was conducted to assess the potential impact of these limitations, and the resulting reclassification of only a single association suggests the GRADE criteria are relatively robust.

### Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and mutational burden as biomarkers of tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115L385J]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has demonstrated clinical benefit for a wide range of cancer types. Because only a subset of patients experience clinical benefit, there is a strong need for biomarkers that are easily accessible across diverse practice settings. Here, in a retrospective cohort study of 1714 patients with 16 different cancer types treated with ICI, we show that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is significantly associated with poorer overall and progression-free survival, and lower rates of response and clinical benefit, after ICI therapy across multiple cancer types. Combining NLR with tumor mutational burden (TMB), the probability of benefit from ICI is significantly higher (OR = 3.22; 95% CI, 2.26–4.58; P < 0.001) in the NLR low/TMB high group compared to the NLR high/TMB low group. NLR is a suitable candidate for a cost-effective and widely accessible biomarker, and can be combined with TMB for additional predictive capacity.

### Predictive values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11315R3Y]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations in this meta-analysis. First, all but one of the studies were retrospective, meaning the data were prone to confounding factors. Second, the progression and prognosis of disease were influenced by many factors, such as age, sex and comorbidities, while we did not evaluate other factors. Finally, there was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. Although we conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses, the heterogeneity was not significantly decreased. That may be caused by different cut-off values, different conditions of patients or different comorbidities among the included studies. Additional high-quality studies are required to shed light on the role of NLR in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 and find the optimal cut-off value.

### Increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is a poor prognostic factor in patients with primary operable and inoperable pancreatic cancer [^114gcN2Z]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In comparison with other tumour entities, the incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is low and has not changed a lot during the last two decades. Although continuous progress in tumour-specific therapy or outcome could be reached in the majority of malignant diseases, PC management still stays unsatisfying, as hardly any breakthrough in PC therapy has been obtained up to now. Therefore, unfortunately the mortality of PC is nearly 100% after 5-year follow-up. The high mortality is linked to local tumour progression and complications of distant metastases. Limited potential of curative resection as the only measurement of cure results from non-specific symptoms up to asymptomatic illness for a long time – and despite tremendous advances – still unsatisfying imaging technology. Thus, at the time of diagnosis most patients have to rely on palliative chemotherapy, whose efficacy is unsatisfying. Consequently, intense research has to be performed towing to the lack of tumour-specific regimes available and insufficient early tumour detection. Currently, the prediction of tumour progression or recurrence is limited to the use of histopathological and clinical factors, such as tumour size, histological grade, histological subtype or age at diagnosis. The identification of novel prognostic factors might enable a better risk stratification for adjuvant treatment modalities after surgery or more aggressive treatment in patients with primary metastatic disease. External validation of prognostic risk assessment tools in independent cohorts of patients is paramount before the generalisation of the applicability of a prognostic marker or model. Changes in the systemic inflammatory response to tumour cell manifestation or systemic inflammation at all can be easily measured by blood-based parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) or different levels of white blood cells, with, for example, a better outcome for a high density of lymphocytes in tumour stroma than a lower one. Importantly, especially the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been assumed to be an easily available and trustable marker to predict patients' survival in different types of cancer. In the last years, these findings have been proven within several tumour entities regarding its role in prediction of cancer progression and prognosis. In PC, controversial data exist regarding NLR and tumour outcome, but most of these studies included rather small numbers of investigated cases (n < 100) and differ in terms of inclusion criteria and clinical end points. Therefore, the aim of our study was to externally validate the value of NLR as a prognostic parameter in a large cohort of 371 PC patients. For this purpose, we tested the prognostic relevance of NLR with regard to cancer-specific survival (CSS), stratified for (A) patients who underwent surgical resection (group 1) and (B) patients who were inoperable at the time of diagnosis (group 2).

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^112s5yLD]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphopenia is also hypothesized to be a potential cause or consequence of CAP, potentially associated with chronic illnesses, critical illnesses, lymphocyte adherence to vascular endothelium, or extensive migration to the lungs. A lymphocyte count below 1,000/µL may be an independent biomarker for a 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients. For patients in the L-CAP study, a lymphocyte count under 724/mm³ doubled the risk of in-hospital death within 30 days. Therefore, lymphopenia markedly correlates with higher ICU admission risks and in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates in CAP patients compounded with sepsis. Early identification of lymphopenia may facilitate pinpointing CAP septic patients who are in urgent or impending need of intensive care. A significant correlation was observed between a lymphocyte count below the usual lower limit and the mortality rate in a study involving 3099 COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the lymphocyte count was exceedingly low (less than 5% of white blood cells) in deceased individuals. In contrast, it remained within normal ranges (more than 20% of white blood cells) in survivors with moderate illness.

L-CAP is characterized by CD4 depletion, a higher inflammatory response, and low IgG2 levels that correlate with greater severity at presentation and worse prognosis. Earlier, both reduced T-lymphocyte counts and reduced IgG levels were reported to be associated with the poor prognosis of severe CAP. In addition, the researchers also found that the severity of CAP was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulin levels (including total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2) and that low levels of immunoglobulins were independently associated with ICU admission and 30-day mortality. Lymphopenia leading to reduced immunoglobulin levels is predictable. A recent study found that TNF-α was significantly lower in gradable lymphopenia compared to non-lymphopenia and that a lower TNF-α baseline may lead to a reduced number of B-cells and immature B-cells, which can result in lower immunoglobulin levels. Immunoglobulin deficiency is also an indicator of severity in COVID-19 patients, and i.v. administration of IgG can mitigate virus-induced immunosuppression and provide passive immune protection against a broad range of pathogens.

The results of the above studies collectively show that lymphopenia is strongly associated with higher mortality rates, substantiating its role as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients. Notably, in studies significantly correlated with the probability of death on day 28, over 30% of patients exhibited lymphopenia, correlated with aggravated prognosis associated with profound T-cell lymphopenia.

### Clinical laboratory tests and dementia incidence: a prospective cohort study [^113wNaCn]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a major public health issue and a heavy economic burden. It is urgently necessary to understand the underlying biological processes and to identify biomarkers predicting risk of dementia in the preclinical stage for prevention and treatment.

Methods

By using the data of the 367,093 white British individuals from UK Biobank, we investigated the relationship between 56 laboratory measures and 5-year dementia incidence using logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios for dementia incidence with values below or above the 95% confidence interval (< 2.5th or > 97.5th percentile) on each of clinical laboratory tests were computed.

Results

We observed that markers of endocrine dysregulation: elevated hemoglobin A1C (AOR = 2.01 [1.35, 2.88]) was associated with increased dementia incidence. Indicators of liver dysfunction: elevated gamma glutamyltransferase (AOR = 2.28 [1.49, 3.32]), and albumin (AOR = 2.01 [1.15, 3.25]), indicators of renal impairment: high urea (AOR = 1.69 [1.15, 2.40]), and cystatin C (AOR = 1.89 [1.30, 2.67]), and some immune markers, like elevated neutrophill count, low lymphocyte count, and indicators of anemia were also observed to be associated with increased dementia incidence. Both low and high concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 were found to be risk factors for dementia.

Limitations

This is an observational study.

Conclusion

Several systemic biomarkers were associated with dementia incidence. These results implicate a contributory role of diverse biological processes to dementia onset, and enrich our understanding of potential dementia prevention strategy.

### Association of baseline and longitudinal low neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and high lymphocyte counts (LCs) with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in real world advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients (pts) treated with nivolumab (nivo) or pembrolizumab (pembro) [^113NMeFU]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract e21020 Background: High baseline neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is associated with inferior OS for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC pts treated with nivo or pembro. This study evaluates potential relationships between baseline and longitudinal NLR and absolute LCs with PFS and OS in aNSCLC pts on nivo or pembro. Results: The study included 162 aNSCLC pts. Median age 68 yrs, male/female 40. 1%/59. 9%. NLR > 5. 0 was associated with inferior PFS longitudinally. Median PFS values were: baseline NLR > 5/ < 5 = 2. 1/3. 9 mos, at 6 wks NLR > 5/ < 5 = 
2. 6/6. 1 mos, at 12 wks NLR > 5/ < 5 = 
3. 8/7. 1 mos. NLR > 5. 0 was similarly associated with inferior OS at the same intervals. In time-dependent analyses, NLRs as a continuous variable were associated with inferior PFS and OS.

Longitudinal analyses of LCs as a continuous variable showed that higher LCs over time were associated with superior PFS and OS. Conclusions: Low baseline and longitudinally lower NLRs are associated with longer PFS and OS in aNSCLC pts on nivo or pembro. High baseline and longitudinally higher LCs were associated with superior PFS and OS in the same group. While NLRs and LCs may merely be prognostic indicators, it's possible that they reflect a patient's ability to mount an immune response. They may also be useful in guiding strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1115dCKb]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — baseline laboratory assessment before starting antithyroid drugs (ATDs) should be considered, with thresholds that should prompt serious reconsideration of initiating therapy. Low white blood cell (WBC) counts are common, including in African Americans (10% of whom have a neutrophil count under 2000), and the task force states that a baseline absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm³ or liver transaminase enzyme levels elevated more than 5-fold above the upper limit of normal should prompt serious reconsideration of initiating ATD therapy.

### Association between the immune-inflammation index and the severity and clinical outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nQVws]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

NLR and PLR are simple biomarkers of subclinical inflammation and can be easily obtained through a complete differential blood count. They are shown to be connected with the prognosis and clinical outcomes of various pathological conditions, including infections, immune-mediated diseases, and malignancies. NLR and PLR are derived from the counts of neutrophils, platelets, and lymphocytes. These ratios are more reliable in reflecting disease changes compared to the individual components. The underlying mechanisms of this association were not elucidated; however, a high NLR is thought to be the consequence of intricate interactions between neutrophils and lymphocytes, which raise the levels of several cytokines in the blood and finally cause inflammation. Neutrophils, as important infiltrating and regulatory cells of innate immunity, are critical in the immune response. Their accumulation in the gut may enhance the recruitment of neutrophils and promote apoptosis of damaged cells. This response can be mediated by the secretion of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-1, which contribute to the activation of nonspecific inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, impaired neutrophil function may lead to a reduced capacity to eliminate intestinal bacteria, thereby promoting the development of chronic inflammation. Lymphocytes and their subgroups are essential in the pathogenesis of IBD. In CD, this is associated with an increase and persistence of interferon-γ-induced Th1 cells, which, through the activation of dendritic cells by Th1, trigger localized chronic inflammation. Therefore, lymphocyte count can indicate how well the immune system reacts to inflammatory events. Furthermore, studies on BD patients have demonstrated that lymphocyte function is abnormal at mucosal and peripheral levels. A study has suggested that peripheral lymphocytes in UC and CD patients exhibit reduced lymphocyte responses to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^113H5Veo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection damages host tissues and organs, imposes a substantial global pathological burden. Recent estimates suggest that sepsis affects nearly 50 million people worldwide each year, leading to high mortality rates and huge healthcare costs. Despite substantial advances in medical science, sepsis continues to represent a significant public health challenge, necessitating innovative strategies to mitigate its global impact.

Lymphopenia, alternatively termed lymphocytopenia, delineates a pathological state characterized by a diminished concentration of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The etiology of lymphopenia encompasses a range of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, pharmacological interventions, and exposure to radiation therapy. The relationship between lymphopenia and sepsis has been extensively studied, and in particular, sepsis-induced lymphopenia is gradually being recognized as an essential factor in the prognosis of sepsis. Sepsis-induced lymphopenia is usually defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of less than 1,000 cells/µL. Several studies have also provided individualized threshold data, e.g. the persistence with the lymphopenia cut-off value (< 760 cells/µL) > 3 days in non-viral infection-related sepsis indicates a higher 28-day mortality rate, and severe lymphopenia in sepsis was previously defined as an ALC of less than 500/µL. However, despite the significant progress in this field, numerous unresolved issues still require urgent attention (Table 1). In addition, altering myeloid cell numbers during sepsis is a relatively complex and diverse process. This issue has been discussed by others and is beyond the scope of this review.

Table 1
Established knowledge and unanswered questions about sepsis-induced lymphopenia

Notably, sepsis-induced lymphopenia has been associated with worse outcomes, including increased risk of secondary infections, multiple organ failure, and death. Given the widespread role of lymphopenia in sepsis, there is a growing recognition of the potential practical significance of treatments that address lymphopenia. The main controversies and challenges faced by the medical community in addressing these questions include the complexity of the immune response in sepsis, the difficulty of distinguishing cause and effect in observational studies, and the lack of specific treatments. Moreover, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the scenario, resulting in an increased incidence of sepsis cases. This rise is coupled with the pandemic's tendency to cause lymphopenia, which merits additional investigation to unravel the intricate pathophysiological pathways in sepsis.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^111NDrP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities

Neutropenia

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000 cells/mm³).

Evaluate neutrophil counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation and interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e. ANC less than 1000 cells/mm³) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lymphopenia

ALC less than 500 cells/mm³were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate lymphocyte counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm³) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Anemia

Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8 g/dL were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate hemoglobin at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 8 g/dL) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lipids

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, and thereafter according to the clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

Liver Enzyme Elevations

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations compared to treatment with placebo.

Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.

### Predictive values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117PX3iV]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the treatments for mild cases and severe cases are greatly different. For mild cases, there is no need to intervene too much. Some patients can even recover without any treatments. However, for severe cases, even we take many kinds of measures, such as mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the mortality is still high. Therefore, if the potentially severe cases were identified early and effective treatments were taken to prevent the progression of those patients, more patients' lives may be saved.

The current criteria for classifying mild cases and severe cases are mainly based on RR, oxygen saturation and PaO2/FiO2. These indicators are important but lack specificity for COVID-19. In laboratory examination of patients with COVID-19, the absolute value of peripheral white blood cells is usually normal or low, and lymphopenia is common. However, in severe or non-survival patients with COVID-19, the lymphocytes count decreases progressively, while the neutrophils count gradually increases. This may be due to excessive inflammation and immune suppression caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the one hand, neutrophils are generally regarded as pro-inflammatory cells with a range of antimicrobial activities, which can be triggered by virus-related inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. On the other hand, systematic inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 significantly depresses cellular immunity, leading to a decrease in CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-infected T cells may also cause cytopathic effects on T cells. Therefore, NLR, a cost-effective marker, can be easily calculated from peripheral blood routine tests and may be associated with the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. To date, four meta-analyses have reported that patients with severe COVID-19 infection had a higher NLR than those with non-severe COVID-19 infection. However, none of them evaluated the predictive values of NLR on disease severity and mortality.

### Tumour-associated neutrophils in patients with cancer [^111MXNw2]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

The role and importance of neutrophils in cancer has become increasingly apparent over the past decade. Neutrophils accumulate in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer, especially in those with advanced-stage disease, and a high circulating neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a robust biomarker of poor clinical outcome in various cancers. To date, most studies investigating the role of neutrophils in cancer have involved animal models or investigated the function of circulating human neutrophils. Thus, only limited information is available on the roles of intratumoural neutrophils (also known as tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs)) in patients with cancer. In this Review, we initially describe the evidence correlating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with prognosis, followed by a discussion on the predictive value of TANs, which remains debatable, with conflicting data from different cancer types, including variations based on neutrophil location within and/or around the tumour. We then explore available data on the implications of TAN phenotypes and functions for cancer development and progression, highlighting the reported effects of various treatments on TANs and how neutrophils might affect therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we examine the various compounds capable of modulating neutrophils and suggest future research directions that might ultimately enable the manipulation of TANs in patients with cancer.

### Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are associated with different immunopathological mechanisms in systemic lupus erythematosus [^111EDdrU]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Neutrophils contribute to the SLE pathogenesis. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is reported to correlate with disease activity in SLE. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether NLR reflects underlying immunopathogenic activity in SLE, as well as to determine the contribution of each component of NLR, neutrophil and lymphocyte count.

Methods

Data were obtained from a cohort of patients with SLE (n = 141) recruited at Lund University, Sweden. NLR levels were compared between patients with SLE and healthy controls (n = 79). The relationship between NLR and clinical and immunological markers was examined using Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis. High NLR was defined as above the 90th percentile of healthy individuals.

Results

Patients with SLE had elevated neutrophil count (p = 0.04) and reduced lymphocyte count (p < 0.0001), resulting in elevated NLR as compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Patients with high NLR had more active disease, and were more frequently on prednisone use and immunosuppressive medicines. High NLR was associated with immune complex (IC)-driven disease with presence of antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies (p = 0.006), circulating ICs (p = 0.02) and type I interferon (IFN) activity (p = 0.009). Further, high NLR was associated with neutrophil abnormalities, including enrichment for low-density granulocytes (LDGs) (p = 0.001), and increased levels of the serum neutrophil activation marker, calprotectin (p = 0.02). Assessing the individual components within NLR, that is, neutrophil and lymphocyte count, high neutrophil count was associated with neutrophil activation markers (p < 0.0001), whereas low lymphocyte count was associated with type I IFN activity and elevated numbers of LDGs (p = 0.006and p = 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

NLR is elevated in patients with SLE as compared with healthy individuals, and is associated with key immunopathological events, including type I IFN activity and neutrophil activation. Neutrophil and lymphocyte count reflected different aspects of the pathogenesis of SLE. Further studies are needed to determine the causality of the associations.

Panel recommendations — general management of lymphoma are as follows: There was consensus that clinical trials should be strongly considered as a treatment option at each stage of therapy for eligible patients with lymphoma. There was consensus that all patients newly diagnosed with lymphoma should receive initial imaging via FDG-PET/CT. There was consensus that patients should be routinely screened for hepatitis B and C serologies, and patients with decreased neutrophil and absolute lymphocyte counts from CBC tests, as well as low levels of serum IgG. There was consensus that all patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma should receive assessment of their cardiovascular history and risk factors prior to receiving potentially cardiotoxic therapies (including some forms of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapies). These patients should be examined and routinely monitored through methods such as transthoracic echocardiogram and ECG based on risk assessment.

### The prognostic impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with small-cell lung cancer [^113d744L]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

A high NLR indicates an increased neutrophil count and/or a decreased lymphocyte count, as well as relative lymphopaenia. Lymphocytes have a crucial role in tumour defence by inducing cytotoxic cell death and inhibiting tumour cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, large numbers of neutrophils affect the cytolytic activity of lymphocytes or natural killer cells and could negatively affect tumour growth. In addition to the TANs described above, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are fibres composed of chromatin and neutrophil proteins, are known to be associated with cancer. TANs are more prone to NETs than their normal counterparts. An experimental study demonstrated that widespread deposition of NETs induced by sepsis sequesters circulating tumour cells and promotes metastasis. NETs may protect circulating tumour cells by adhering to them and recruiting platelets. These theoretical considerations support the role of NLR, reflecting the extent of neutrophilia in malignancy.

NLR is an easily measurable and repeatable parameter and thus clinically useful. However, several problems exist. NLR may occasionally not be a tumour-specific marker because other inflammatory conditions and steroid treatments could be confounding factors. Some authors have suggested that NLR should be assessed together with other inflammatory markers such as CRP. In addition, numerous articles have reported on NLR using different cutoff levels that require validation. In a study that showed a significant correlation between the NLR and survival in patients with stage IV gastric cancer, the authors used a NLR level of 2.5 and median survival was significantly longer in the group with a low-NLR level. Other studies reported a correlation between NLR and survival, using various cutoff values.

This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, which limits generalising our findings. Second, as with all retrospective studies, there are several limitations inherent to its design, including the retrospective data collection. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest the usefulness of NLR and investigate the prognostic role of NLR in SCLC patients.

In conclusion, NLR at the time of diagnosis is a readily available and effective measurement that reflects the prognosis in SCLC patients. NLR determination during treatment and monitoring may help in assessing the treatment response and predicting recurrence. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate cutoff values and confirm our results.

### Low peripheral blood derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) is associated with increased tumor T-cell infiltration and favorable outcomes to first-line pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer [^1143xcFm]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

An elevated peripheral blood derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) is a negative prognostic marker for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Whether dNLR is also associated with clinical outcomes to first-line pembrolizumab among patients with NSCLC and a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥ 50% is uncertain. How dNLR relates to the tumor immune microenvironment is also unclear.

Methods

In two participating academic centers, we retrospectively analyzed the dNLR (defined as the absolute neutrophil count/white cell count - absolute neutrophil count) prior to initiation of first-line pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%and lacking genomic alterations in EGFR and ALK. An unbiased recursive partitioning algorithm was used to investigate an optimal dNLR cut-off with respect to objective response rate (ORR). Multiplexed immunofluorescence for CD8+, FOXP3+, PD-1+, and PD-L1 was performed on a separate cohort of NSCLCs to determine the immunophenotype associated with dNLR.

Results

A total of 221 patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab were included in this study. The optimal dNLR cut-off to differentiate treatment responders from non-responders was 2.6. Compared with patients with a dNLR ≥ 2.6 (n = 97), patients with dNLR < 2.6 (n = 124) had a significantly higher ORR (52.4% vs 24.7%, p < 0.001), a significantly longer median progression-free survival (mPFS 10.4 vs 3.4 months, HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66, p < 0.001), and a significantly longer median overall survival (mOS 36.6 vs 9.8 months, HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.49, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, tobacco use, performance status, histology, serum albumin level, oncogenic driver status, and PD-L1 distribution (50%-89% vs ≥ 90%), a dNLR < 2.6 was confirmed to be an independent predictor of longer mPFS (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.67, p < 0.001) and mOS (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.49, p < 0.001). Among advanced NSCLC samples with a PD-L1 TPS of ≥ 50%, those with a dNLR < 2.6 had significantly higher numbers of tumor-associated CD8+, FOXP3+, PD-1 +immune cells, and PD-1 +CD8+T cells than those with a dNLR ≥ 2.6.

Conclusions

Among patients with NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, a low dNLR has a distinct immune tumor microenvironment and more favorable outcomes to first-line pembrolizumab.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

5.4 Bone Marrow Effects/Immunosuppression Potential/Infections

Bone Marrow Effects

A mean decrease compared to baseline in white blood cell (WBC) count of approximately 15% (mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes) and in platelet count of approximately 10% was observed in placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with 7 mg and 14 mg of teriflunomide. The decrease in mean WBC count occurred during the first 6 weeks and WBC count remained low during treatment. In placebo-controlled studies in adult patients, neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10⁹/L was observed in 12% and 16% of patients receiving teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 7% of patients receiving placebo; lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 10⁹/L was observed in 10% and 12% of patients receiving teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 6% of patients receiving placebo. No cases of serious pancytopenia were reported in premarketing clinical trials of teriflunomide but rare cases of pancytopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported in the postmarketing setting with leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cases of thrombocytopenia with teriflunomide, including rare cases with platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) within 6 months before the initiation of treatment with teriflunomide. Further monitoring should be based on signs and symptoms suggestive of bone marrow suppression.

### Evaluation of optimal threshold of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and its association with survival outcomes among patients with head and neck cancer [^116B62vS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Given the role of inflammation in cancer progression, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) from peripheral blood has been suggested as a readout of systemic inflammation and a prognostic marker in several solid malignant neoplasms. However, optimal threshold for NLR in US patients with head and neck cancer remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the optimal NLR threshold as a potential prognostic biomarker for survival outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single institution. Participants included 496 patients with nonmetastatic head and neck cancer who underwent chemoradiation from April 2007 to March 2021. Statistical analysis was performed from September to December 2021.

Exposures

High vs low NLR.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).

Results

A total of 496 patients (411 male patients [82.9%]; 432 White patients [87.1%]; 64 patients with other race or ethnicity [12.9%]; median [IQR] age, 61 [55–67] years) were identified. Median (IQR) follow-up was 44.4 (22.8–74.0) months. Thresholds of NLR for both OS and CSS were 5.71. High NLR above 5.71 was associated with worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.26–3.09; P = 0.003) and CSS (aHR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.38–3.95; P = 0.002). On logistic multivariable analysis, patients were more likely to have high NLR if they had higher T and N staging (T3-4: aOR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.92–9.16; P < .001; N2: aOR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.04–9.17; P = 0.049; N3: aOR, 11.21; 95% CI, 2.84–46.97; P < .001), but less likely if they had a good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status 90–100: aOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14–0.59; P < .001). Among 331 patients (66.7%) with available human papillomavirus (HPV) data, high NLR was not associated with OS (HPV-negative: aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 0.96–6.31; P = 0.06; HPV-positive: aHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.38–3.56; P = 0.78) and CSS (HPV-negative: aHR, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.81–7.99; P = 0.11; HPV-positive: aHR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.44–4.76; P = 0.54).

Conclusions and Relevance

High NLR was associated with worse survival. Patients with substantial disease burden and poor performance status were more likely to have high NLR. These findings suggest that further studies would be warranted to investigate the role of such prognostic marker to identify patients at risk to tailor interventions.

### Critical COVID-19 is associated with distinct leukocyte phenotypes and transcriptome patterns [^113bDB3P]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has rapidly spread across the world and caused a global health emergency. Although patients usually present with mild disease, the condition may progress to pneumonia, ARDS and death. The clinical deterioration that often leads to hospitalization occurs typically one week after onset of symptoms and suggests that host immunity drives the propagation to severe coronavirus disease (COVID)‐19.

The systemic cytokine profile in severe COVID‐19 resembles cytokine release syndromes, such as macrophage activation syndrome, with high plasma levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Notably, pro‐inflammatory cytokine levels seem to be lower in SARS‐CoV‐2‐ than in sepsis‐induced ARDS. COVID‐19 is also associated with lymphopenia, with a more pronounced depletion of CD8 T cells, and lymphocyte count is inversely correlated with severity, an association also demonstrated in sepsis. The lymphopenia in COVID‐19 may be more prolonged than in other viral infections. Little is known about the cause of lymphopenia and whether T‐cell responses are helpful or harmful in COVID‐19. Interleukin 7 (IL‐7) known to restore lymphocyte counts and repertoire in lymphopenia may be a potential target for therapeutics in COVID‐19.

### Possible association of 16p11.2 copy number variation with altered lymphocyte and neutrophil counts [^115V1fnB]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated leukocyte differential counts and disease, particularly lymphopenia and neutropenia, in 16p11.2 CNV carriers as some genes mapped to the rearranged region have known roles in leukocyte biology. Lymphopenia is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count < 1.5 × 10⁹/L in adults and < 2.0 × 10⁹/L in children. Neutropenia is defined by a decrease in the number of neutrophilic granulocytes circulating in the blood and may be mild (count between 1.0 and 1.5 × 10⁹/L), moderate (count between 0.5 and 1.0 × 10⁹/L), or severe (count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L). Among white British control individuals from UKB, 0.35% (1163/335789) have a neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10⁹ cells/L of blood and 1% (3221/335789) received a diagnosis of neutropenia, similar to the prevalence of 0.5% previously reported for adult white individuals. Congenital neutropenia, i.e. chronic neutropenia caused by a constitutional genetic defect, is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disease with a prevalence of ~1/100,000 people. Whereas mutations in 24 different genes were shown to be associated following a dominant, recessive, or X-linked inheritance pattern, more genes need to be identified as the genetic origin remains unknown in 30% of congenital neutropenia cases.

### Preoperative lymphocyte to monocyte ratio as a predictive biomarker for disease severity and spinal fusion failure in lumbar degenerative diseases patients undergoing lumbar fusion [^1131imwx]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Research has recently focused on the importance of leukocyte proportions in various inflammatory conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and their complications. The inflammatory indexes, ie, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and LMR, are calculated based on the neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts that are routinely tested in most clinical settings worldwide. Lymphocytes and monocytes are also key immune cells in the inflammatory response. A low lymphocyte count and a high monocyte count may be relevant to inflammation and oxidative stress, associated independently with the prognosis of various diseases. For example, the most frequent abnormal blood tests among cancer patients were high inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP) or ESR), high monocyte count, low lymphocyte count, hypo-albuminaemia, and high alkaline phosphatase. The multivariate regression models of this study indicate that high monocyte count and low lymphocyte count are independent risk factors for fusion failure. Our findings echo with reports in the literature. The lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is another inflammatory marker, reflecting the balance of change between innate and adaptive immunity and offering a simple indicator of immune status and inflammation level. Therefore, the potential of LMR as a prognostic biomarker is demonstrated by high lymphocyte count and low monocyte count. LMRs that are lower are associated with higher levels of systemic inflammation and vice versa. To our knowledge, this may be the first study to examine the relationship between preoperative LMR and the degree of intervertebral disc degeneration and spinal fusion rate. In the current study, LMR correlated independently with the degree of degeneration. Furthermore, patients with severe disc degeneration have a lower LMR (ie, a higher systemic inflammatory state) in comparison to people with mild to moderate disc degeneration. A possible explanation for our results is that as a composite indicator of the state of the systemic inflammatory response, low LMR means that high levels of local chronic inflammation and production of inflammatory factors may promote the progression of disc degeneration. Meanwhile, in model 1, LMR was a highly reliable predictor of severe degeneration, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and ROC curve of the prognostic model indicated that the model has effective discrimination and calibration. Additionally, the ROC curve of LMR prediction of severe degeneration showed that patients with LMR < 3.16 had severer degeneration. On the other hand, in this study, we also found that LMR is associated with the prognosis of spinal fusion, ie, those with higher LMR have a higher chance of fusion. It is possible that low levels of LMR (high inflammatory state) inhibit osteogenic differentiation and new bone formation, thereby slowing the fusion rate. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, LMR may significantly affect spinal fusion rate through the protective effect of high lymphocyte and low monocyte levels. Multivariate regression model 5 demonstrated that a high level of LMR protects against spinal fusion failure, and the model also had acceptable calibration and discrimination. Monocyte count is also a risk factor for spinal fusion failure in other regression models, but lymphocyte count is a protective factor. This may be related to the immune response regulated by the monocyte-macrophage system as described above. At the same time, the ROC curve of LMR prediction of spinal fusion failure showed that patients with LMR > 3.90 had a higher rate of spinal fusion. LMR > 3.90 is associated with mild to moderate degeneration as well as a greater likelihood of spinal fusion. There was a higher rate of disc degeneration and poor spinal fusion rate in patients with LMR < 3.16. Patients with LMR greater than 3.16 but less than 3.90 also had mild to moderate degeneration but poor fusion. Further, we should note that although the AUC of LMR in this study did not reach more than 0.7 in predicting severe disc degeneration and fusion failure, correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis have shown that low LMR is significantly associated with severe disc degeneration and fusion failure. It is clinically significant to a certain extent that this correlation exists. The identification of risk factors for intervertebral disc degeneration and spinal fusion failure that are related to their disease progression and their long-term prognosis will allow patients to avoid or reduce the possibility of bearing a substantial economic burden.

### Prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in septic patients with liver cirrhosis: a cohort study [^115xCjiN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The NLR, integrating neutrophil count and lymphocyte count, has greater predictive power than either of them alone, consistent with our ROC analysis. Wu et al. supported that NLR had the greatest accuracy than high neutrophil counts and low lymphocyte counts in predicting mortality risk for septic patients or those at high risk. Tapadia et al. found that mortality in patients with cirrhosis was closely related to NLR, which represented the relative balance between neutrophils and lymphocytes. Notably, although the AUC of NLR was lower than that of SAPS II, its Youden index was higher, and the AUC was higher than that of SOFA scores. SOFA and SAPS II are clinical severity scores that have been applied to critically ill patients. Nevertheless, these scores contain several indicators and the assessment is time-consuming. When these scores cannot be calculated, NLR might assist in guiding clinical practice, offering clinical value for patients with cirrhosis and sepsis due to its availability, simplicity, and capability to predict mortality.

This is the first paper to evaluate the prognostic implications of NLR in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis. NLR outperformed SOFA scores in predicting mortality and was an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis. There are inevitably some limitations. First, it is a single-center retrospective observational study, and the inherent biases should not be overlooked, necessitating. Second, the MIMIC database lacks detailed information on the etiology of cirrhosis, the severity of septic shock, and other factors, which may influence the association between NLR and the risk of all-cause mortality. Lastly, NLR was only documented at the initial ICU admission. Further multicenter research with larger sample sizes is warranted to assess the dynamic NLR value during ICU stay, which might yield different results.

### Congenital neutropenia syndromes [^1167cm79]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia syndromes comprise a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders. Hereditary conditions associated with low neutrophil counts are persistent and need to be differentiated from neutropenia secondary to autoimmune processes or other pathologic conditions, such as myelodysplasia or leukemia. Clinically, congenital neutropenia is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections. Recently, several novel genetic defects were described in patients with congenital neutropenia, shedding light on the pathophysiology of these rare diseases.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases — MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) — for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte)". We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Adults

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 × 10⁶/mm³), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in KEPPRA-treated patients.

A total of 3.2% of KEPPRA-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 10⁹/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of KEPPRA-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 10⁹/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the KEPPRA-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

In a controlled study in pediatric patients age 4 years to < 16 years, statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in KEPPRA-treated patients, as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the KEPPRA-treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo-treated patients (statistically significant).

More KEPPRA-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of KEPPRA-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients); however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% on KEPPRA versus 4.2% on placebo). No patient was discontinued because of low WBC or neutrophil count.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), 5 patients (8.6%) in the KEPPRA-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7 × 10⁹/L).

### Understanding neutropenia secondary to intrinsic or iatrogenic immune dysregulation [^1173fsN6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

As a key member of the innate and adaptive immune response, neutrophils provide insights into the hematopoietic and inflammatory manifestations of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and the consequences of immunotherapy. The facile recognition of IEI presenting with neutropenia provides an avenue for hematologists to facilitate early diagnosis and expedite biologically rationale care. Moreover, enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving neutropenia in IEI-decreased bone marrow reserves, diminished egress from the bone marrow, and decreased survival-offers an opportunity to further dissect the pathophysiology driving neutropenia secondary to iatrogenic immune dysregulation, eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

### Is it possible to predict the severity of acute appendicitis? Reliability of predictive models based on easily available blood variables [^111yRwvD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study on a relevant number of cases was aimed at identifying any prognostic factor with significant predictive value among the most common variables easily available from any laboratory at the admission of the patient. Although several variables were associated with histopathology findings at univariate analysis, multivariate analysis confirmed that only lymphocyte count and CRP/Albumin ratio were independently associated with the degree of inflammation. Both variables' odds ratios are below 1, which means they both have an inverse correlation. In other words, it looks like low lymphocyte count and low CRP/Albumin ratio can be predictive of the severity of inflammation. However, only 8% of the variability of severity of inflammation can be predicted by this model.

Low lymphocyte count is often associated with high neutrophil count; therefore it would seem logical that in acute appendicitis, neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio should be increased. In actual facts, neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio showed a positive correlation with the degree of inflammation at univariate analysis, but this was not confirmed at regression analysis. In other terms, our study showed that neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio may not be reliable to select patients with gangrenous appendicitis who may need an emergency surgical operation.

On the contrary, low lymphocyte count has been identified as an independent prognostic variable who significantly correlates to the degree of inflammation.

Similarly, while CRP per se did not qualify as a diagnostic tool in our study, the CRP to Albumin ratio is significantly and independently associated with severity of appendicitis. CRP is a well-known marker of inflammation, but it is not specific. Albumin is often erroneously considered a nutritional marker but, on the contrary, it has been demonstrated to be much more reliable as an inverse inflammatory marker. Therefore, CRP/Albumin should be directly correlated with the degree of inflammation, as high CRP and low Albumin are both linked to inflammation. In fact, our simplified predictive model considers only low lymphocyte count and high CRP to albumin ratio to significantly correlate with the presence of gangrenous appendicitis. This model has high accuracy (81%) and high specificity (98%).

### Prognostic role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112gKurt]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation may play an important role in cancer progression, and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported to be a poor prognostic indicator in several malignancies. Here we quantify the prognostic impact of this biomarker and assess its consistency in solid tumors.

Methods

A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of blood NLR and clinical outcome in solid tumors. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome, and cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were secondary outcomes. Data from studies reporting a hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) or a P value were pooled in a meta-analysis. Pooled hazard ratios were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

One hundred studies comprising 40559 patients were included in the analysis, 57 of them published in 2012 or later. Median cutoff for NLR was 4. Overall, NLR greater than the cutoff was associated with a hazard ratio for OS of 1.81 (95% CI = 1.67 to 1.97; P < .001), an effect observed in all disease subgroups, sites, and stages. Hazard ratios for NLR greater than the cutoff for CSS, PFS, and DFS were 1.61, 1.63, and 2.27, respectively (all P < .001).

Conclusions

A high NLR is associated with an adverse OS in many solid tumors. The NLR is a readily available and inexpensive biomarker, and its addition to established prognostic scores for clinical decision making warrants further investigation.

Interpretation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) differential cell counts — abnormal thresholds and patterns — states that "A BAL fluid cell differential count with greater than 15% lymphocytes, greater than 3% neutrophils, greater than 1% eosinophils, or greater than 0.5% mast cells indicates BAL lymphocytosis… BAL neutrophilia… BAL eosinophilia… or BAL mastocytosis, respectively", and that "A lymphocyte differential count greater than or equal to 25% suggests granulomatous lung disease". The text also notes that "An increased number of nucleated immune cells and abnormal proportions of immune cell types may suggest or support specific types of ILD" in the absence of infection.

### Association of the prognostic model iSEND with PD-1 / L1 monotherapy outcome in non-small-cell lung cancer [^114joxWo]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inexpensive, universally accessible and minimally invasive method that can be obtained by a simple peripheral blood draw. Many clinical studies support the negative prognostic value of high NLR in immunotherapy.– High NLR has been suggested to represent the immunosuppressive phenotypes from circulating neutrophils more than the lymphocytes. Moreover, the reactive increase of neutrophils in tumour microenvironment in immunotherapy-resistant patients as suppressive myeloid cells was suggested as a resistance mechanism, which was modelled as positive delta NLR (DNLR). – The on-treatment increase of neutrophil in peripheral blood in human and mouse models has shown the resistance in multiple preclinical immunotherapy models, and reversing high NLR to low NLR with c-MET inhibition showed enhanced immunotherapy outcome in mice.

Our group previously reported the development of multivariate risk prediction model called the iSEND model (immunotherapy Sex, ECOG, NLR [Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio], Delta NLR). The model was developed from retrospective analysis by using aforementioned variables of the advanced NSCLC patients from the University of Miami treated with post-platinum nivolumab monotherapy. The iSEND model was designed to reflect the highest weighting coefficient from the composite score of NLR and DNLR to better identify more resistant patients to nivolumab, which identifies the patients with high baseline NLR and its subsequent increase after the first dose of nivolumab. Here, we show the independent validation as well as pooled cohort analysis, which were compared with chemotherapy-only-treated cohort. Also, we show performance comparison of the iSEND groups with different PD-L1 expression-level groups to discuss potential clinical implications of the iSEND model in advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/L1 monotherapy.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and overall survival in all sites of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [^116ozSWG]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current prognostic criteria are insufficient in predicting outcomes in head and neck cancer, necessitating new, readily available biomarkers.

Methods

Pretreatment neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and their ratio (NLR) were retrospectively investigated for correlation with overall survival while controlling for demographic and clinical confounders.

Results

Patients in the highest tertile of neutrophil counts and those in the lowest tertile of lymphocytes experienced shorter survival than the rest of the population. Patients in the highest tertile of the NLR were at a higher risk compared with those in the lowest tertile after multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.39; p = .0001). Additionally, NLR was lower in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tumors compared to HPV-negative tumors and predicted survival in both tumor types.

Conclusion

Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are strong biomarkers with opposing prognostic significance and the NLR is a robust predictor of overall survival in oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1068-E1074, 2016.

### Pre-treatment lymphopenia and indication of tumor-induced systemic immunosuppression in medulloblastoma [^114j3EWr]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of tumor-induced systemic immune suppression, including lymphopenia, has been recognized in adult patients with glioblastoma for several decades, and pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) is associated with inferior clinical outcome in patients with glioblastoma. Whether tumor-induced systemic immune suppression is also present in children with malignant brain tumors is not known. We performed a retrospective analysis of pretreatment neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in pediatric patients with medulloblastoma (MB) compared to a control group of children with posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). Compared to the control group, we observed statistically significantly lower absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) and higher NLCRs in the medulloblastoma group. Our findings suggest the presence of tumor-induced systemic immune suppression in MB patients already present at the time of diagnosis, with potential implications for the development of immune therapies in this population.

### Clinical associations with a polygenic predisposition to benign lower white blood cell counts [^113wSeFf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The ability of genetic variation associated with benign biomarker variation to systematically disadvantage an identifiable subset of individuals is exemplified by the rs2814778-CC genotype, which is predominantly carried by individuals of African ancestry and underlies the clinical phenomenon of benign neutropenia. The current study demonstrates that common polygenic variation associated with a diagnostic biomarker can push individuals toward the same clinical endpoints as a genotype with a large effect size.

Like WBC counts, many of the biomarkers that are used to guide clinical decision-making have a significant heritable component. While polygenic variation impacts biomarker levels across the distribution, it is important to demonstrate that it can contribute to values that cross clinical decision thresholds, which typically lie near the tails of the distributions. We found that the PGS WBC was not only associated with an increased likelihood of having WBC counts below the lower limits of the standard lab reference ranges but was also associated with diagnostic ICD codes, indicating that the counts came to the attention of clinical providers and were prompting clinical actions.

Similar to the benign neutropenia genotype, a tool like the PGS WBC may prevent futile diagnostic odysseys or unnecessary alterations in clinical care. However, as compared to a discrete genotype, translating a measure of benign polygenic risk to the clinical setting is more nuanced, as the exposure is continuous. Furthermore, the approaches to clinical translation will vary by clinical scenario.

The bone marrow biopsy example highlights a scenario where WBC counts are used as a biomarker of occult hematological disease. In this scenario, it is important to know the expected ranges of WBC counts that a non-diseased individual fluctuates within. Genotype-informed reference ranges (such as those presented in Fig. 2a) could be informative for this purpose. As a simple proof-of-concept, we showed that applying reference intervals based on the PGS WBC identified more individuals without underlying bone marrow disease who fell within the expected WBC count range, as compared to individuals with underlying disease. Though only a modest proportion of individuals fell within expected ranges, it is important to note that each reclassification avoids an expensive and painful diagnostic procedure. An alternative approach could be to generate prior probabilities based on PGS WBC values that a given diagnostic workup (such as a bone marrow biopsy) will identify pathology when performed for an indication of a low WBC count (such as presented in Fig. 3b).

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114SvMrj]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential diagnosis by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP (eg, infection), but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP, the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and as a result adds little additional diagnostic information. In the appropriate clinical context, a history of clinically relevant exposure to a compelling IA with a typical high-resolution CT pattern allows for a confident diagnosis of HP. Lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in patients with fibrotic HP, and BAL fluid lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of fibrotic HP; however, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may increase diagnostic confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT findings are compatible with HP and should be considered when the exposure history and imaging data are discordant, and may exclude common alternative diagnoses, such as IPF, when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

### Immunity and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116ewbsF]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clinical syndrome caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Patients can be asymptomatic or present respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and even multiple-organ failure which can lead to death. The balance between an effective antiviral response and dysregulated immune response is the key factor determining the severity of COVID-19 progression. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI-PubMed database to find the articles related to COVID-19 immunity and inflammatory response published from 1 December 2019 to 15 April 2020. Haematological, immunological and biochemical parameters were extracted and correlated with disease severity, age and presence of comorbidities. Twelve articles were analysed comprising a total of 1042 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 95 different parameters. Total lymphocyte count and levels of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells were decreased in severe and critical cases. Neutrophilia was found in patients who progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interleukin-six (IL-6) was high in mild and severe patients regardless of comorbidities. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased regardless of disease severity or presence of comorbidities. High levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase were present in diabetic patients and patients who developed ARDS. Procalcitonin levels were elevated to varying degrees in severe and critical patients. We conclude that the total lymphocyte count, CD3+ and CD4+ T cells are low, especially in severe and critical COVID-19 patients; ESR, CRP and IL-6 were elevated, independent of the severity of disease. Understanding the inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients is essential for the development of better therapeutic and management strategies.

### Validation of the pre-treatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic factor in a large European cohort of renal cell carcinoma patients [^116WEFyX]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite recent progress in the identification of genetic, epigenetic and common molecular alterations in RCC has been made, the routine diagnostic and prognostic assessment of RCC currently relies on pathological tissue examination and traditional clinicopathological prognostic variables. The complexity of these molecular changes, as well as high costs of analyses, the time-consuming preparation required and the lack of evidence demonstrating how these newly discovered molecular markers influence diagnostic or therapeutic decisions have rendered none of the markers available for routine testing. Regularly used blood-based parameters, such as the neutrophil or lymphocyte count and the resultant-derived NLR, are relatively easy to assess without additional laborious efforts, making them attractive parameters for patients' improved individualised risk assessment in RCC.

detected 11.7% of patients with an increased blood neutrophil count (i.e. cutoff value defined as greater than the upper limit of normal range) and showed that the blood neutrophils only represent an independent prognostic factor in metastatic RCC patients. However, in our study we only could identify 15 (2.2%) patients with an increased blood neutrophil count only (i.e.g.reater than the upper limit of normal range), which represents a too low number of patients to perform a reliable multivariate prognostic analysis.

### The duffy-null genotype and risk of infection [^116859sk]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

The findings from this study could have widespread implications for the clinical treatment of individuals with an African ancestry living in Europe and the United States, whose neutrophil count should be interpreted in the light of genotype at rs2814778. The current threshold for a 'normal' neutrophil count in the UK and United States is based on available normative data rather than an association with pathology or adverse effects, and is based on patients with a European ancestry. In this study, we found that 21% of individuals with the Duffy-null genotype had a neutrophil count below the currently accepted range (< 2.0 × 10⁹/L) at any one time in contrast to 1.1% of those with the TC/TT genotype. Thus, these thresholds will not be appropriate for individuals with the Duffy-null genotype. Neutropenia is a contra-indication to many treatments, for example certain types of chemotherapy, immunosuppressant therapy, organ transplantation and treatment with the antipsychotic drug clozapine. Our findings suggest that it is likely that many individuals with an African ancestry seeking treatment in countries where they are a minority could be denied access to treatment because of a benign neutropenia caused by the Duffy-null genotype. This has important consequences; previous research shows that individuals of African ancestry living in Europe and the United States have poorer clinical outcomes and access to medications for which neutropenia is a barrier such as chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that ANC thresholds could be lowered to 1.5 × 10⁹/L in individuals with the Duffy-null genotype without an increased risk of infection.

### Predicting disease severity and outcome in COVID-19 patients: a review of multiple biomarkers [^116B9DEw]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed.

Objective —

To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.

Data Sources —

A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed, including 54 peer-reviewed papers and 18 non-peer-reviewed preprints.

Conclusions —

Although the markers are considered nonspecific, acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin, were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated white blood cell count; marked lymphopenia; decreased CD3, CD4, or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts; high neutrophil count; thrombocytopenia; and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization, including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements, were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated interleukin 6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, or COVID-19 Severity Score, may be used to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality. Interpretation of the data reported in the studies reviewed here is limited because of the study design (mostly retrospective), limited sample size, and a lack of defined clinical criteria.

(G) Model describing how NLR change across surgery may contribute to decreased survival. Starting from the far left, tumor initiation may begin reprogramming bone marrow neutrophils on a small scale. This reprogramming creates neutrophils with oncogenic properties. As the tumor progresses, the neutrophil reprogramming signal becomes more pronounced with some mostly anti-oncogenic neutrophils infiltrating the tumor and localizing to the necrotizing core. Shortly after surgery and with disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), GBM-reprogrammed neutrophils may invade the resection site and serve to promote the growth of residual tumor cells, escalating tumor growth and reducing patient survival.

Non-symmetrical predictive values of clinical diagnosis using median split (high vs low levels) of each haematological parameter. A 'median split' was used to divide each quantitative parameter into categorical variables by the median value (calculated as a mean of nMI and UM or SM median value shown in Table 2). The predictive values are calculated from contingency tables (Additional file 2: Table S3). a The percentage predictive value in predicting nMI from low levels. b Percentage predictive value in predicting SM or UM using the low levels. c Percentage predictive value in predicting nMI using high levels. d Predictive values of UM or SM using high levels

Additionally, we determined whether the levels could predict whether an individual has UM or SM using odds ratios. First, we predicted UM, and majority of the parameters were associated with clinical diagnosis of UM and nMI (P < 0.001), except mean cell volume, lymphocyte percentage, mixed cell counts, and neutrophil counts (Additional file 1: Table S4). The parameters that were not associated for nMI–SM category were lymphocyte counts, mean corpuscular Hb, lymphocyte percentage, mixed cell counts, and neutrophil counts (Additional file 1: Table S4). Furthermore, some of the haematological parameters had a 95% confidence interval that included the null value (1) when evaluating the odds ratios, which signifies that they are not significantly associated with clinical diagnosis (Additional file 1: Table S4).

### Correlation between vitamin D, inflammatory markers, and T lymphocytes with the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and its effect on the risk of acute exacerbation: a single cross-sectional study [^116kZk2Z]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will become the fourth largest cause of death of chronic diseases in the world in 2030. The incidence of COPD ranked top among chronic diseases in the world. At present, there is a lack of simple and effective drugs for the treatment of COPD and for slowing the progression of the disease. The application of vitamin D as a drug in clinical treatment has been a research hotspot. In this study, we investigated the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), inflammatory markers, and T lymphocytes with the severity of COPD and its effect on the risk of acute exacerbation.

Methods

In this study, we recruited hospital inpatients and outpatient clinic patients with COPD. Their levels of 25(OH)D, inflammatory markers, and T lymphocytes were assessed. We built a nomogram model to evaluate the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD.

Findings

The inflammatory mediators were higher in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) than those in patients with COPD, but 25(OH)D showed the opposite phenomenon. In logistic regression analysis, high levels of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide and low levels of vitamin D, partial pressure of oxygen, and forced expiratory volume in the first as a percentage of predicted were regarded as independent risk factors for AECOPD. These variables were used for the construction of the nomogram model. The AUCs of the model were 0.971 (95% CI, 0.952–0.989), and 0.981 (95% CI, 0.959–1.000) in the training and testing set respectively, demonstrating that the model exhibited high accuracy for the prediction of the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD. The calibration curve of the nomogram found a high degree of consistency between the expected and actual values. The decision curve analysis and clinical impact curve indicated that the nomogram has clinical applicable for patients with COPD.

Implications

A considerable percentage of patients with COPD were found to have insufficient vitamin D levels. Patients with AECOPD reported more symptoms than those with COPD. The variables neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 25(OH)D, partial pressure of oxygen, and forced expiratory volume in the first as a percentage of predicted can be used for the prediction of AECOPD. Accordingly, this study provided experimental rationales for the role of 25(OH)D in the prevention and the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms involved in the control of the COPD process.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response in advanced bladder cancer… [^1127KpeG]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16586 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a novel and promising agent for treating muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, there is a need for further understanding of which patient factors or biological markers can be used to help identify patients who will have a successful response to ICI therapy. We hypothesized that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio could be predictive of response to ICI therapy as this ratio has previously been reported to correlate with a higher number of myeloid derived suppressor cells. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who were treated with ICI therapy at a single institution between 2015–2020. Information on survival, disease recurrence, and patient characteristics was gathered. Neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers were recorded at time of ICI administration and a ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes was calculated.

The median of these values was calculated and used to divide the cohort into low NLR and high NLR. Tissue samples from a subset of these patients were collected and sent for multiplex immunohistochemistry with a myeloid and T cell staining panel. Results: In a cohort of 115 patients with advanced bladder cancer treated with ICI, the mean time to last follow up or event was 375. 78 days. 35 patients had either a complete or partial response to ICI therapy. A Kaplan Meier survival analysis shows a significant difference in survival between the low and high NLR group, with lower NLR having a longer event free survival. Multiplex IHC showed variable tumor and adjacent microenvironmental distributions of myeloid and lymphoid marker positive populations in ICI responders and non-responders.

Conclusions: In an effort to better predict which patients may benefit from ICI therapy, we have studied NLR at the time of ICI administration and its association with event free survival. Our results suggest that a lower NLR could be associated with a longer event free survival. Further research is being conducted to study the immune microenvironment as it relates to bladder cancer response to ICI therapy.

### Reversal of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio in early versus late death from septic shock [^111Fwrtx]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

An increase in the NLCR from day 1 to day 5, with an increase in the neutrophil count and a smooth drop in the lymphocyte count, was associated with late death in our study population. Interestingly, in other studies researchers have found that late mortality, at 6 months or 12 months after emergency abdominal surgery, was associated with a persistent high neutrophil count. Increased neutrophils might indicate that the site of the infection has not been eradicated and that there is still pus or abscess in the peritoneal cavity or other nidus. Thus, the bone marrow continues to produce large amounts of neutrophils to fight the infection. We also suggest that the neutrophils might not become apoptotic. In contrast to lymphocytes, neutrophil apoptosis is beneficial in sepsis. The apoptosis of these cells initiates and facilitates the resolution of inflammation, tissue repair, and reestablishment of homeostasis. Apoptotic neutrophils are cleared by macrophages and prompt the macrophages to switch from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. This neutrophilic pattern could reflect a nonresolving inflammation.

Finally, while some studies have indicated that the source of infection is important to consider because the immune response differs according to the site, we did not find any significant differences between the abdominal and extra-abdominal sepsis groups concerning lymphocytes, neutrophil counts, or the NLCR in the early- or late-death groups. However, the size of the extra-abdominal sepsis group was quite small compared with the abdominal sepsis group.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^111t6zFG]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study that included 77 sepsis and 23 non-sepsis adult patients, the daily lymphocyte count of the patients was calculated until discharge or death. Lymphocytes exhibited a high diagnosis of sepsis with an area under the curve value of 0.971 (95% CI = 0.916–0.994). The diagnostic efficacy of lymphocytes was more significant than other biomarkers, such as white blood cells, neutrophil count, and procalcitonin. The results also showed that the 28-day mortality rate was 39.66% in patients with persistent lymphocyte counts below 0.76 × 10^9/L, significantly higher than in patients without persistent lymphopenia. ALC is a promising, low-cost, rapid, and readily available biomarker for diagnosing sepsis. High vigilance is required for sepsis when a non-viral infection is suspected and lymphopenia levels are below the optimal threshold (0.76 × 10^9/L) value. In another single-center retrospective cohort study of 335 adult patients with bacteremia and sepsis, complete blood cell counts were recorded for the first four days following the diagnosis of sepsis. On Day 4, the median ALC was significantly higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (1.1 × 10^3 cells/µl [IQR 0.7, 1.5] vs. 0.7 × 10^3 cells/µl [IQR 0.5, 1.0]). ALC was also found to be independently associated with 28-day survival (adjusted OR 0.68 [95% CI 0.51, 0.91]) and 1-year survival (adjusted OR 0.74 [95% CI 0.59, 0.93]). Thus, persistent lymphopenia on the fourth day after sepsis diagnosis predicts early and late mortality and may serve as a biomarker for sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

### Validation of the pretreatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of overall survival in a cohort of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^112ffD7X]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The circulating neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be a prognostic factor for a variety of tumors. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of NLR in a large cohort of Chinese patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs).

Methods

A total of 381 patients with PDAC who underwent potentially curative surgery were recruited from 2 centers in Shanghai, China, between January 2004 and September 2011. Analysis of overall survival (OS) was performed using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests and the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Results

The most optimal cutoff of NLR was NLR 2.0 or greater, and the NLR was divided into 2 groups: high (≥ 2.0) and low (< 2.0). The high NLR (≥ 2.0) was associated with advanced UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) stages, p T stage, lymphoid node invasion, and poorer tumor differentiation. Multivariate analysis identified increased NLR as an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio = 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–1.99; P = 0.003). Furthermore, neutrophil counts rather than lymphocyte counts were associated with OS of PDAC.

Conclusions

The pretreatment NLR is a simple and useful potential biomarker for OS in patients with PDAC after curative resection.

### On the improper use of the term high-density neutrophils [^112n9AVg]. Trends in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have revealed that neutrophils exhibit an unsuspected heterogeneity. In this context, the term high-density neutrophils (HDNs) has recently gained ground to define nothing more than neutrophils displaying an unaltered normal density. Therefore, as discussed here, we argue that the HDNs term must be avoided, as it is confounding and scientifically inappropriate.

### Baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and derived NLR could predict overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma treated with nivolumab [^117CpU12]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Improved understanding of cancer and the role of the immune response has resulted in the development of new therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA)-4 (e.g. ipilimumab) and programmed death (PD)-1 receptors (e.g. nivolumab and pembrolizumab). These agents have revolutionized the treatment and outcomes of various cancers, in particular melanoma, with improved long-term disease control and prolonged patient survival.

Nivolumab (Opdivo®, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the PD-1 receptor, a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 expressed on antigen-presenting cells and on tumor cells results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, potentiating T-cell responses. Nivolumab has demonstrated clinical activity in previously treated and treatment-naïve patients with advanced melanoma, with overall response rates (ORR) ranging between 20 and 40% in patients treated at various dose levels. Nevertheless, a significant portion of patients do not benefit from nivolumab treatment. Given that immunotherapy can be associated with significant toxicity as well as high treatment costs, it is important that those patients most likely to respond to treatment are better identified. To achieve this involves the recognition and validation of novel biomarkers predictive of treatment outcomes. Any such biomarkers should ideally be simple and easy-to-use, inexpensive and readily available.

In recent years, it has become evident that cancer-related inflammation responses, such as increased and defective myelopoiesis, and both local and systemic inflammation, have an important role in tumorigenesis, disease progression and patient prognosis. Therefore, predictive biomarkers that reflect the inflammatory response to treatment may help clinical decision making in the management of patients with melanoma. Systemic inflammation is associated with alterations in peripheral blood leukocytes that can be captured by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Several studies have demonstrated that NLR predicts outcomes in patients with a variety of solid cancers. In melanoma, raised leukocyte, neutrophil and monocyte counts, as well as high NLR have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with advanced melanoma, most of whom were receiving immunotherapies. Furthermore, in a recent Italian study, elevated NLR and derived (d) NLR were independently and significantly associated with an increased risk of death and disease progression in melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage cellular analysis in interstitial lung disease [^112pJa7y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — recommendations for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD) state: for patients with suspected ILD in whom it has been decided that a BAL can be tolerated and will be performed, we suggest that the BAL target site be chosen on the basis of a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) performed before the procedure, and in routine clinical practice, we perform the HRCT within 6 weeks of the BAL; for patients who undergo BAL, we recommend that a differential cell count be performed on the BAL fluid with macrophage, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil cell counts, and the remaining sample may be used for microbiology, virology, and/or malignant cell cytology laboratory testing if clinically indicated; for patients with suspected ILD in whom BAL is performed, we suggest that lymphocyte subset analysis NOT be a routine component of BAL cellular analysis.

Further, the prognostic value of combination of lymphocyte and monocyte for gastric cancer patients were evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups according to the levels of lymphocyte and monocyte: Group 1: patients with high lymphocyte and low monocyte; Group 2: patients with high lymphocyte and high monocyte, or low lymphocyte and low monocyte; Group 3: patients with low lymphocyte and high monocyte. As the prognosis of patients with high lymphocyte and high monocyte and that with low lymphocyte and low monocyte were comparable, these patients were all assigned to group 2. The overall survival of the three groups were shown in Fig. 4. The results showed that combination of lymphocyte and monocyte count could increase the predictive value for the prognosis of the entire cohort. Moreover, we found that combination of lymphocyte and monocyte count could only predict the prognosis of stage II/III gastric cancer patients, but not stage I gastric cancer patients.

### How I manage inpatient consultations for quantitative neutrophil abnormalities in adults [^115NMcU8]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutrophilia and neutropenia commonly lead to inpatient hematology consultation. Quantitative neutrophil abnormalities have a broad differential and include diagnoses that are important to recognize because they may be associated with increased mortality. Neutrophilia can reflect etiologies such as infection, medications, inflammation, splenectomy, and congenital disorders. Neutropenia can arise from infection, medications, autoimmune destruction, sequestration, nutritional deficiency, malignancy, and congenital neutropenia syndromes. In the evaluation of all abnormalities of neutrophil number, the timing of the change, and the patient's historical neutrophil count are crucial.

### The utility of peripheral blood leucocyte ratios as biomarkers in infectious diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114etGpJ]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the utility of the neutrophil:lymphocyte (NLR), lymphocyte:monocyte (LMR) and platelet:lymphocyte ratios (PLR) as infection biomarkers.

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched to identify eligible articles. Studies of diagnosis, severity or outcome were included. PROSPERO systematic review registration CRD42017075032.

Results

Forty studies were included, reporting on bacterial and viral infections, malaria, and critical illness due to sepsis. Ten studies reported an association of higher NLR with bacteraemia, supported by meta-analysis of patient-level data (five studies, n = 3320; AUC 0.72, p < 0.0001) identifying a cut-off of > 12.65. Two studies reported an association with lower LMR and diagnosis of influenza virus infection in patients with respiratory tract infection. Meta-analysis of patient-level data (n = 85; AUC 0.66, p = 0.01) identified a cut-off of ≤ 2.06. The directionality of associations between NLR and outcomes in heterogeneous cohorts of critically ill adults with sepsis varied. Potential clinical utility was also demonstrated in pneumonia (NLR), pertussis (NLR), urinary tract infection (NLR), diabetic foot infections (NLR) and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (PLR). Longitudinal measurement of LMR during respiratory virus infection reflected symptoms and NLR during sepsis and bacteraemia predicted mortality.

Conclusions

Peripheral blood leucocyte ratios are useful infection biomarkers, with the most evidence related to diagnosis of bacteraemia and influenza virus infection. In critical illness due to sepsis, a signal towards an association with NLR and outcomes exists, and NLR should be evaluated in future stratification models. Longitudinal measurement of ratios during infection could be informative. Overall, these biomarkers warrant further recognition and study in infectious diseases.

### New monogenic disorders identify more pathways to neutropenia: from the clinic to next-generation sequencing [^114ZVGru]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are the most common type of leukocyte in human circulating blood and constitute one of the chief mediators for innate immunity. Defined as a reduction from a normal distribution of values, neutropenia results from a number of congenital and acquired conditions. Neutropenia may be insignificant, temporary, or associated with a chronic condition with or without a vulnerability to life-threatening infections. As an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, neutropenia may be associated with transformation to myeloid malignancy. Recognition of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome may be delayed into adulthood. The list of monogenic neutropenia disorders is growing, heterogeneous, and bewildering. Furthermore, greater knowledge of immune-mediated and drug-related causes makes the diagnosis and management of neutropenia challenging. Recognition of syndromic presentations and especially the introduction of next-generation sequencing are improving the accuracy and expediency of diagnosis as well as their clinical management. Furthermore, identification of monogenic neutropenia disorders is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of granulopoiesis and myeloid malignancies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113qk953]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Neutropenia and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — urinary source frequency and screening implications: With current management strategies for high-risk neutropenia patients, the urinary tract is an infrequent source for bacteremia. In a retrospective review of hospitalized febrile neutropenia, patients with ANC ≤ 1500 cells/mm³ within 4 weeks of chemotherapy had low urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, with only 2.8% overall, including 2.9% in those with ANC ≤ 100 cells/mm³, and only 1 of 109 had bacteremia from a urinary source. While no studies specifically address screening, screening for bacteriuria with specific antimicrobial treatment, if present, has not been reported to provide important additional benefits. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (< 7 days, clinically stable, ANC > 100 cells/mm3) have a lower risk of infection and are assumed to have risks similar to nonneutropenic populations.

### Levetiracetam (LEVETIRACETAM solution) [^115e5VRf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam-treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo patients (statistically significant).

In the controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients), however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo-treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In the controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7 × 10⁹/L).

5.9 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.10 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.
