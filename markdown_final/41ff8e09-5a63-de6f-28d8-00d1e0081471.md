## Question

When to be concerned for obstructice uropathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to be concerned for obstructive uropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts that raise suspicion, including acute presentations and chronic risk states. Then, I should verify the key red flags that mandate urgent action. Next, I will review imaging triggers and their limitations. After that, I need to consider special populations and atypical presentations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight what not to miss, anchoring on guideline-level sources and high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that should heighten concern for obstructive uropathy. Acute presentations include flank pain with reduced urine output, anuria or oliguria with rising creatinine, sepsis or urosepsis, and acute kidney injury in the setting of suspected urinary obstruction, all of which warrant prompt evaluation for obstruction as a reversible cause of AKI [^a166eb11] [^a7594ac9]. Chronic or subacute contexts include recurrent UTIs, progressive hydronephrosis on surveillance imaging, known malignancy with retroperitoneal disease, and congenital urinary tract anomalies, where obstruction may be silent but progressive and damaging to renal function [^c3705aa7] [^773c7cef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the red flags that demand immediate concern and intervention. I need to ensure I prioritize sepsis or suspected infection behind obstruction, because obstructing stones with infection require urgent decompression plus antibiotics to prevent deterioration and death, and this is a strong recommendation in contemporary AUA guidance [^8c70abe6]. I should also flag anuria or rapidly rising creatinine with flank pain, as well as bilateral hydronephrosis or a solitary kidney with obstruction, because these scenarios carry high risk of irreversible renal injury and mandate emergent drainage decisions [^a166eb11] [^e8b664f1]. But wait, what if the patient has no flank pain? Obstruction can be painless in diabetics, the elderly, or those with neurogenic bladder, so I must maintain a low threshold to image when urine output drops or creatinine rises unexpectedly [^notfound].

> Next, I should review imaging triggers and their limitations. Ultrasound is the first-line test to detect hydronephrosis and estimate postvoid residual, yet I need to remember that early or high-grade obstruction can paradoxically show minimal dilation, especially in dehydrated patients or with retroperitoneal fibrosis or malignancy, so a normal ultrasound does not exclude obstruction when clinical suspicion is high [^145ef219]. Let me consider functional imaging: diuretic renography helps distinguish obstructive from nonobstructive dilation and quantify relative renal function, which guides whether to intervene or observe, and it avoids ionizing radiation, though availability and patient factors matter [^6e5b308f] [^c08fa00c]. I should double-check that CT is reserved for equivocal cases or when precise anatomic definition will change management, given radiation and contrast risks, but it can localize stones, strictures, or extrinsic compression when ultrasound is nondiagnostic [^notfound].

> I will now examine special populations where my threshold for concern should be lower. In pediatrics, antenatal hydronephrosis and congenital anomalies like posterior urethral valves or ureteropelvic junction obstruction carry risks of renal scarring and dysplasia; persistent or high-grade dilation warrants timely postnatal ultrasound and, when indicated, VCUG or diuretic renography to detect obstruction or reflux and prevent long-term renal damage [^92022ad1] [^773c7cef]. In pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, constipation-related fecal impaction can rarely cause obstructive uropathy and post-obstructive diuresis; I need to check for this when postpartum patients present with anuria or AKI, and manage with decompression and careful fluid-electrolyte monitoring because physiologic shifts can worsen outcomes [^7607782c] [^b287caa8]. In patients with advanced malignancy, ureteral obstruction is common and often signals poor prognosis; early urinary diversion improves quality of life, so I should not delay palliative decompression when indicated [^19b77a57].

> Let me consider atypical etiologies that can masquerade as other conditions. Urogenital tuberculosis can cause strictures and silent obstruction with advanced renal failure; I should suspect it in patients from endemic regions or with sterile pyuria and consider urine PCR when cultures are negative, because early recognition changes management and prevents irreversible damage [^e87a6b6e] [^730ce82b]. Endometriosis can cause intrinsic ureteral obstruction and chronic kidney injury in reproductive-age women with recurrent UTIs or flank pain; MRI and ureteroscopy with biopsy may be needed to confirm and plan definitive therapy, including stenting or surgery [^a7e43de9]. Even hernias can entrap ureters and cause obstruction; if I see unexplained hydronephrosis, I should trace the ureter on cross-sectional imaging to avoid iatrogenic injury during hernia repair [^f1dbdfad].

> I should confirm the practical decision framework so it is actionable. Concern for obstructive uropathy escalates with the convergence of suggestive symptoms, risk factors, and objective findings: reduced urine output or anuria, flank pain, rising creatinine, sepsis, bilateral hydronephrosis, solitary kidney with obstruction, or high-risk populations such as pediatrics, pregnancy/postpartum, or malignancy should prompt urgent imaging and consideration of decompression [^a166eb11] [^8c70abe6]. If ultrasound is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, I need to escalate to diuretic renography or CT based on patient factors and local expertise, and I should involve urology early when drainage is anticipated [^6e5b308f]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering CT; reserving it for equivocal cases or when anatomy will change management helps balance diagnostic yield with radiation and contrast risks [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure I do not miss reversible causes of AKI. Obstructive uropathy is one of the few potentially reversible etiologies of acute kidney injury, and delays in decompression can convert a recoverable insult into permanent renal loss, so I should act decisively when the pretest probability is high even if initial imaging is not confirmatory [^a166eb11] [^e8b664f1]. Let me reconsider any case where I initially attributed AKI to prerenal azotemia or ATN; if urine output fails to recover with volume repletion or if the clinical trajectory worsens, I should re-evaluate for obstruction and proceed to drainage without undue delay [^a166eb11].

Be concerned for obstructive uropathy when there is **acute flank pain with anuria/oliguria** or **acute kidney injury** [^a166eb11], especially with hydronephrosis on ultrasound [^94d68f32]. Other red flags include **sepsis** [^a7594ac9], **bilateral obstruction**, or a **solitary kidney** with obstruction [^notfound]. In children, **prenatal hydronephrosis** [^92022ad1], **recurrent UTIs** [^f525ca38], or **poor growth** warrant evaluation [^notfound]. Chronic concerns include progressive hydronephrosis, rising creatinine, or refractory hypertension [^notfound]. Prompt imaging (ultrasound first) [^94d68f32] and urgent decompression are critical when obstruction threatens renal function or causes sepsis [^8c70abe6].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting immediate concern

### Acute presentations

- **Acute flank pain with anuria or oliguria**: Sudden onset of severe flank pain accompanied by a significant reduction or cessation of urine output suggests acute obstruction, such as a ureteral stone or blood clot [^notfound].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Rapidly rising serum creatinine levels, especially in the context of known or suspected urinary tract obstruction, necessitate urgent evaluation and intervention [^a166eb11].

- **Sepsis or systemic infection**: Obstructive uropathy complicated by infection (urosepsis) is a medical emergency requiring immediate decompression and antibiotic therapy [^8c70abe6].

- **Bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney obstruction**: These scenarios pose a high risk of permanent renal damage and require immediate intervention [^notfound].

---

### Chronic presentations

- **Progressive hydronephrosis**: Increasing dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces on serial imaging indicates worsening obstruction and potential renal impairment [^notfound].

- **Rising serum creatinine**: Gradual elevation in creatinine levels may signal chronic obstruction leading to renal insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Refractory hypertension**: Difficult-to-control hypertension can result from chronic obstructive uropathy due to renal parenchymal damage [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patient populations are at **higher risk** for obstructive uropathy and warrant heightened vigilance:

| **Patient population** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Elderly patients | - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^ec65f38a] <br/> - Prostate cancer [^c3705aa7] <br/> - Urethral strictures [^df06919b] |
| Patients with malignancy | - Pelvic or retroperitoneal tumors [^19b77a57] <br/> - Metastatic disease [^5ae2f2f7] <br/> - Radiation-induced strictures [^notfound] |
| Pediatric patients | - Congenital anomalies (e.g. posterior urethral valves, ureteropelvic junction obstruction) [^773c7cef] <br/> - Vesicoureteral reflux [^notfound] <br/> - Neurogenic bladder [^notfound] |
| Patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) | - Chronic inflammation <br/> - Stricture formation <br/> - Calculi [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential. The following diagnostic steps are recommended:

- **Ultrasound**: First-line imaging to detect hydronephrosis, renal size, and bladder abnormalities [^94d68f32].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful for identifying calculi, strictures, or extrinsic compression [^629d8563].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Alternative to CT, particularly in patients with contrast allergies or when detailed soft tissue assessment is needed [^8dc5186f].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum creatinine, electrolytes, and urinalysis to assess renal function and detect infection [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of delayed recognition

Failure to promptly recognize and treat obstructive uropathy can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Permanent renal damage**: Chronic obstruction can cause irreversible renal parenchymal injury and end-stage renal disease [^e8b664f1].

- **Sepsis and septic shock**: Obstruction with infection can rapidly progress to life-threatening sepsis [^8c70abe6].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and other electrolyte imbalances can occur [^09251874].

- **Hypertension**: Chronic renal damage can result in secondary hypertension [^cafa4d8b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of early recognition and intervention. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends **immediate imaging and intervention** for acute obstructive uropathy, particularly when accompanied by renal failure or sepsis [^a166eb11]. The American Urological Association (AUA) advises **urgent renal drainage** for obstructing stones with suspected infection, followed by definitive management once the patient is stabilized [^8c70abe6].

---

## Summary of key indicators for concern

- **Acute flank pain with anuria or oliguria**.
- **Acute kidney injury**.
- **Sepsis or systemic infection**.
- **Bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney obstruction**.
- **Progressive hydronephrosis**.
- **Rising serum creatinine**.
- **Refractory hypertension**.
- **High-risk patient populations** (elderly, malignancy, pediatric, recurrent UTIs).

---

Obstructive uropathy requires a **high index of suspicion** in the right clinical contexts, with **prompt imaging and intervention** to prevent irreversible renal damage and life-threatening complications [^a166eb11].

Acute obstructive uropathy is a medical emergency, which often is accompanied by acute renal failure or sepsis. Treatment options to resolve the acute obstructive process include conservative medical management, retrograde ureteral stenting, or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy or nephroureteral catheters. It is important to understand the various treatment options in differing clinical scenarios in order to guide appropriate consultation. Prompt attention to the underlying obstructive process is often imperative to avoid further deterioration of the patient's clinical status. A summary of the data and most up-to-date clinical trials regarding treatment options for urinary tract obstruction is outlined in this publication. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Obstructive uropathy from locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer: an old problem with new therapies [^c3705aa7]. Journal of Endourology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite stage migration to more organ-confined disease in the era of prostate-specific antigen, the complications of advanced prostate cancer are still relatively common. Urinary tract obstruction in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer can have a varied presentation, because it may occur in multiple anatomic locations at any point in the natural history of the disease. In all cases, management depends on the current stage of disease, technical feasibility of potential therapeutic interventions, and overall prognosis of the patient. This review highlights a practical approach to the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of obstructive uropathy from prostate cancer.

### Prenatal therapy for obstructive uropathy [^64f65fef]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The increasing use of routine prenatal imaging and diagnosis has provided a better understanding of the natural history of obstructive uropathy. Fortunately, most disorders portend little clinical significance prenatally, although a select subset can incur irreversible renal injury and pulmonary hypoplasia depending on the onset, duration, severity, and level of obstruction. In these cases, timely antenatal evaluation and prenatal intervention can provide an optimal postnatal outcome. The natural history, evaluation, and management of fetal obstructive uropathies are discussed.

### Upper urinary tract: when is obstruction obstruction? [^55ac7d4d]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obstruction can either be defined as a condition that hampers optimal renal development, or, more conservatively, as a restriction to urinary outflow that, when left untreated, will cause progressive renal deterioration. Currently, management is mostly based on the latter definition, but still remains controversial. Relevant work published before 2002 is considered because of a lack of recent literature.

Recent Findings

Almost all reports comparing the primary conservative treatment of suspected obstruction versus early surgical intervention show comparable results, but there are different interpretations. The approach of 'watch and wait' for a unilateral hydronephrotic kidney with normal function is usually quite safe, with a very low risk of the permanent loss of renal function when accompanied by close monitoring, but it is certainly not without risk. At this time, the main underlying problems are that all currently applied diagnostic methods only detect effects secondary to obstruction, and the currently used definition of obstruction is based on a longitudinal observation period. The most relevant publication in the observation period was an in-depth report on a workshop in which the need for valid prospective markers for renal maldevelopment and 'significant' obstruction was expressed.

Summary

The optimal management of infants with congenital hydronephrosis and suspected obstruction will remain controversial until new diagnostic methods are able to discriminate between 'harmful' and 'harmless' obstruction. Most experts currently advocate primary conservative management, with close follow-up and surgical intervention only if there are signs of reduced function of the obstructed kidney.

### Standards of reporting for interventional radiology treatment of renal and pancreatic transplantation complications [^7c457453]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Obstructive uropathy and nephropathy/ureteral obstruction — ureteral obstruction causing hydronephrosis is termed obstructive uropathy, and if an anatomic correlate is lacking as the cause of the obstruction, the term "functional obstruction" applies. For grading of hydronephrosis, the traditional mild/moderate/severe classification may be used, and obstructive uropathy is more specifically referred to as obstructive nephropathy when structural, biochemical, and functional renal alterations ensue.

### Obstructive uropathy: an important cause of chronic renal failure in children [^2b930c17]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Care of individuals with renal failure continues to impose a tremendous burden on our national health care budget. Chronic renal failure is the final common denominator of a multiplicity of pathologic processes, some of which progress silently over years. Of these, obstructive uropathy is a prominent cause of kidney failure, accounting for 16.5% of all pediatric renal transplants in 1997. The pathophysiology of obstructive uropathy is reviewed as the basis for a differential diagnosis. In view of the significant role played by obstructive uropathy in the development of renal failure, early and definitive treatment of this clinical entity is imperative.

### Nephrostomies in obstructive uropathy; how should hormone resistant prostate cancer patients be managed and can we predict who will benefit? [^c2df1312]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Current opinion advocates the use of nephrostomies in hormone naive patients with obstructive uropathy while hormone resistant patients require an individual approach. Patients undergoing a nephrostomy for uropathy were retrospectively analysed, with particular interest in hormone status and blood levels. Over a 46-month period, 26/112 nephrostomies were performed for prostate cancer induced uropathy. Survival was 226.5 days for hormone naive patients, 114.3 days in the responsive group and 100.2 days if resistant. Bilateral cases survived 72.1 days versus 157.6 days for unilateral patients. All patients should be considered for nephrostomy despite their hormone status.

### Patient centred care for the medical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic obstruction: a key point to improve patients' care-a systematic review [^95f0bf49]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In the last decades Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) has been the cornerstone of the clinical practice. Physicians' personal experience and expertise are often limited by several knowledge biases and gaps, thus EBM intends to ameliorate the decision-making process by collecting and summarising evidence from well-designed and well-conducted clinical trials, developing and updating international, widely-accepted guidelines. Following this approach, a safer, more reliable, and more cost-effective clinical practice may be achieved.

Conversely, critics were concerned that the emphasis on EBM could undervalue the tacit knowledge that physicians may accumulate with clinical experience. In addition they questioned whether results from designed research could apply strictly about real patients, who often differ significantly from those included in clinical trials. Lastly EBM frequently ignores patients' preferences and values, theoretically reducing their adherence to the proposed treatment.

### Standards of reporting for interventional radiology treatment of renal and pancreatic transplantation complications [^d81cd7c8]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Obstructive uropathy in renal transplantation — diagnostic and interventional reporting should specify the imaging modality used (CT, MR imaging, or CT/MR urography) and clearly categorize the cause of obstruction; because BK virus reactivation can cause strictures, serologic results for BK viral proteins and BK viruria should be reported, and interventions usually commence with antegrade nephrostography with presentation of treatment rationale including initial nephrostomy versus nephroureteral stent, timing of conversion, catheter dwell duration, performance of catheter trials and stent internalization, and procedural complications with outcomes; balloon ureteroplasty reporting requires balloon type/length/diameter, sizing methodology, inflation pressures/times, postprocedural care, and technical/clinical success definitions with follow-up, and ureteral strictures occurring earlier than 3 months from transplantation are defined as early, and those occurring afterward are defined as late.

### From clinical trials to routine practice: are urodynamics still useful? [^050a74a4]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The UPSTREAM and FUTURE trials found no added benefit from routine urodynamics (UDS) in men with presumed benign prostatic obstruction or women with overactive bladder symptoms unresponsive to initial therapy. However, these population-based studies were not powered to evaluate specific subgroups for which a higher degree of diagnostic certainty could have led to better outcomes. This consensus paper argues that UDS is essential in selected cases for which comprehensive clinical assessment alone may be insufficient. A selective approach to UDS will ensure that patients receive the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### A rare presentation of urogenital tuberculosis leading to obstructive uropathy and renal failure: a case report [^9a005778]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with atypical urological symptoms and unexplained renal dysfunction, even in the absence of classical TB risk factors or symptoms. The case demonstrates that early detection, appropriate imaging, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are crucial for timely diagnosis. This case further emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and clinical vigilance in managing patients with atypical manifestations of extrapulmonary TB, as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irreversible renal damage.

### Evaluation of obstructed voiding in the female: how close are we to a definition? [^b64d622a]. Current Opinion in Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The difficulties of defining and evaluating bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in the female patient have been described for several years. This review aims to examine recent literature to summarize progress in the area.

Recent Findings

Within the last 2 years, functional causes of female BOO have been summarized, new nomograms proposed, several case reports of different causes of BOO have been published and work on surgical outcomes and possible diagnostics reported.

Summary

Women complain of voiding dysfunction because of different reasons. For clinical decision-making, and to evaluate different surgical procedures, finding a way of detecting and quantifying infravesical obstruction is immensely helpful. This review aims to clarify questions concerning definitions of BOO in women and provide an update on recent advances.

### Pyelonephritis and obstructive uropathy: a case of acute kidney injury [^145ef219]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a man in his late 50s with a history of metastatic prostate carcinoma requiring bilateral ureteric stenting. He was admitted with increasing confusion and lethargy. He was diagnosed with sepsis and an acute kidney injury (AKI). Clinical suspicions of an obstructive component to his AKI were not confirmed by an ultrasound scan, which showed a unilateral hydronephrosis unchanged from a scan 1month previously. A nephrostomy was performed, and frank pus aspirated. The patient's clinical state improved steadily thereafter. Patients who are dehydrated, or who have suffered from malignant or fibrotic processes affecting the retroperitoneum, may present with urinary obstruction without a corresponding increase in urinary tract dilation. Additionally, there must be a suspicion of pyonephrosis in a symptomatic patient with known hydronephrosis. Clinicians should be aware that clinical suspicions of urinary obstruction not demonstrated on ultrasound scanning require further investigation.

### Prognostic significance of obstructive uropathy in advanced prostate cancer [^627eb735]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report the incidence and prognostic implications of obstructive uropathy (OU) in patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy and to define the impact initial local therapy has on the development of OU in patients with prostate cancer who develop recurrence and begin androgen deprivation therapy.

Methods

From a population of 260 patients with advanced prostate cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 2003, OU was identified in 51 patients. The OU treatment options included ureteral stent, percutaneous nephrostomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, Foley catheter placement, and urinary diversion. Overall survival and the factors that influenced survival were calculated using standard statistical methods.

Results

OU was diagnosed in 15 (16%) of 80 patients who received local therapy with curative intent and in whom local therapy subsequently failed and in 36 (19%) of 180 patients who had never received local therapy (P = 0.7, chi-square test). Of these 51 patients, 39 had bladder neck obstruction and 16 had ureteral obstruction. Overall survival was significantly worse for the men with OU compared with those without OU (41 versus 54 months). OU was associated with tumor stage and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.

Conclusions

OU results in significantly reduced survival in men with prostate cancer. In a select group of patients with prostate cancer with progression after local therapy (primarily radiotherapy), no statistically significant reduction in the development of OU was observed relative to patients matched for stage, grade, and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level treated with androgen deprivation therapy alone. Aggressive advanced stage and hormone-insensitive disease are variables associated with OU.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^f1de40cd]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for congenital hydronephrosis, more specifically with respect to voiding cystourethrography, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain voiding cystourethrography if renal and bladder ultrasound reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings suggesting either high-grade vesicoureteral or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^1ba93588]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Definitions — obstruction is defined as a level of resistance to urine outflow that, if untreated, will lead to loss of function; an obstruction may be high, intermediate, or low grade; a high-grade obstruction is usually acute, often presents with persistent parenchymal uptake and an empty pelvis, and rapidly leads to loss of function; the intermediate and low grades of obstruction are much more common and lead to a more gradual loss of renal function; and the term partial obstruction does not have a uniformly accepted meaning and should be avoided; in particular, this term should not be used to express uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of obstruction.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® antenatal hydronephrosis-infant [^92022ad1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antenatal hydronephrosis is the most frequent urinary tract anomaly detected on prenatal ultrasonography. It occurs approximately twice as often in males as in females. Most antenatal hydronephrosis is transient with little long-term significance, and few children with antenatal hydronephrosis will have significant obstruction, develop symptoms or complications, and require surgery. Some children will be diagnosed with more serious conditions, such as posterior urethral valves. Early detection of obstructive uropathy is necessary to mitigate the potential morbidity from loss of renal function. Imaging is an integral part of screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of children with antenatal hydronephrosis. Optimal timing and appropriate use of imaging can reduce the incidence of late diagnoses and prevent renal scarring and other complications. In general, follow-up neonatal ultrasound is recommended for all cases of antenatal hydronephrosis, while further imaging, including voiding cystourethrography and nuclear scintigraphy, is recommended for moderate or severe cases, or when renal parenchymal or bladder wall abnormalities are suspected. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Case report of ureter obturator hernia and literature review analysis [^af55b99c]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Once unexplained hydronephrosis or ureteral obstruction is found, you need to be alert to the possibility of ureteral hernia. Early urography can improve the possibility of accurate diagnosis. When a patient has impaired renal function, early surgical intervention is effective.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^e8b664f1]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

SNMMI/EANM diuretic renal scintigraphy — introduction notes that obstruction to urinary outflow may lead to obstructive uropathy (dilatation of the calices, pelvis, or ureters) and obstructive nephropathy (damage to the renal parenchyma). The goal of intervention in patients with suspected obstruction is to preserve renal function because a high-grade obstruction to urine outflow can rapidly lead to a nonfunctional kidney.

### Obstructive uropathy as the etiology of renal failure in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^87c25052]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To make people aware that there is potential for obstructive uropathy to complicate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and cause renal impairment.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Hospital.

Patient(S)

A 28-year-old Caucasian female presenting with acute severe OHSS.

Intervention(S)

Bilateral JJ stenting.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Resolution of renal impairment.

Result(S)

Successful treatment of renal failure.

Conclusion(S)

Patients with severe OHSS and renal impairment should be evaluated with renal ultrasound to rule out hydronephrosis and therefore an obstructive uropathy. Patients potentially at risk for such a complication from OHSS may include those with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery.

### A rare presentation of urogenital tuberculosis leading to obstructive uropathy and renal failure: a case report [^16dfffee]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, is preventable and curable disease. However, it is also second most leading cause of death by a single infectious agent after Coronavirus disease. Amongst the total population, a quarter is estimated to be infected. TB typically infects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also infect other sites, extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB).

Urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) is a rare form of EPTB, accounting for 15–20% of cases, primarily affecting the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. It typically affects the kidneys first, followed by downward spread to the ureters, bladder, prostate, epididymis, or genital tract. Infections may remain clinically silent for years due to the slow progression of renal and urological damage, often leading to diagnostic delays (5,6). Nevertheless, diagnosis is often challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms — such as dysuria and hematuria — that mimic more common urological conditions like urinary tract infections.

TB involving the urologic system has two forms, the most common presentation involves the urinary collecting system (renal pelvis, calyces, ureters and bladder) and the less common one involves kidney lesions (ulcers, abscess formation, perinephric spread, caseating necrosis and calcification). The onset of UGTB is insidious, the average time period from pulmonary infection and clinical manifestations of UGTB is 22 years with a male to female ratio 2:1.

Patients without traditional risk factors of TB, physicians often face the challenge of delayed recognition, as they have to go through advanced diagnostic techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and imaging to confirm the diagnosis.

Early diagnosis and initiation of anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) with full compliance are critical as it ensures favorable outcomes. This case underscores the importance of considering UGTB in the differential diagnosis for patients with atypical presentation and unexplained urological symptoms.

### EAU guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [^af72f490]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bladder outlet obstruction, more specifically with respect to urodynamic studies, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain urodynamic studies when considering invasive treatment in male patients unable to void > 150 mL.

### The SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for renal scintigraphy in adults [^6e5b308f]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Medium credibility.

Renal scintigraphy indications — optimal assessment of obstructive uropathy usually requires diuretic renography, and this test is very useful in differentiation of obstructive or non- obstructive causes of a dilated renal pelvis; this test is the subject of a separate guideline devoted to obstructive uropathy. In suspected renovascular hypertension, it is recommended to perform an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) renogram, although in the era of CT angiography, MR angiography and Doppler vascular sonography the role of ACE (captopril) renography has diminished. In renal transplant recipients, differential diagnosis between rejection and ATN is emphasized, with the latter characterized by images showing relatively preserved renal perfusion in comparison to function.

Conclusions

Constipation is aggravated by hormonal, anatomical and lifestyle practices in pregnancy and puerperium, which can lead to debilitating sequalae. Although not essential or recommended to medically manage constipation in pregnancy and puerperium, intervention maybe necessary for more severe cases, which is to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Constipation leading to obstructive uropathy with resultant post-obstructive diuresis is not well documented in the pregnancy or puerperium. However, it is crucial to have a high index of suspicion, in a patient with postpartum obstructive uropathy for timely intervention and involvement of a multidisciplinary team in case of developing post-obstructive diuresis. Since the physiology is altered in pregnancy and has yet to return to normal adult physiology in the puerperium, it is essential to account for the altered standards for laboratory values and clinical evaluation. Therefore, postpartum women undergoing this disease progression may need earlier intervention than in other adults, which can further make the waters murkier for the diagnosis and management of these patients.

### Treatment of obstructive uropathy in one of three young brothers suffering from Gorlin-Cohen syndrome: a case report [^b156a070]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with Gorlin-Cohen syndrome deserve special care in diagnosis and treatment of their urological manifestations. A thorough urogenital search should be conducted at the time of delivery and in the first years of life to prevent major kidney complications. With synchronous cooperation with other specialties, it should be possible to improve both the outcome and quality of life of these patients.

### A rare presentation of urogenital tuberculosis leading to obstructive uropathy and renal failure: a case report [^730ce82b]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) is a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) affecting the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Its nonspecific symptoms often mimic common urological conditions like urinary tract infections (UTIs), leading to delayed diagnosis. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges and emphasizes the need for timely intervention to prevent irreversible renal damage.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old south-Asian female presented with sudden decreased consciousness and severe renal impairment, requiring emergency dialysis. Despite the absence of typical tuberculosis symptoms or risk factors, imaging revealed obstructive uropathy with hydronephrosis. Urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed UGTB. Early interventions, including percutaneous nephrostomy, J-stent placement, and anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT), resulted in significant clinical improvement.

Conclusions

UGTB should be considered in patients with unexplained urological conditions, particularly in tuberculosis-endemic regions. Early diagnosis and management are crucial to avoid irreversible complications and improve outcomes.

### MR urography: technique and results for the evaluation of urinary obstruction in the pediatric population [^9300d31a]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

MR urography has the potential to revolutionize imaging of the urinary tract in both adults and children, because of its ability to provide an unprecedented level of anatomic information and quantitative functional evaluation of each kidney. MR urography can now provide useful assessment of obstructive uropathy and may provide predictive information about which children will benefit from surgery. It has the potential to identify parameters that indicate a significant obstruction as opposed to self-limited hydronephrosis. Further technical developments in the field will produce greater insights into the pathophysiology of not only urologic disorders but also disorders of the kidney itself.

### A rare presentation of urogenital tuberculosis leading to obstructive uropathy and renal failure: a case report [^e87a6b6e]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case report highlights several important diagnostic and management considerations for the clinically heterogenous syndrome that is UGTB. Our patient, who's already been suffering multiple mild sequelae of undiagnosed UGTB prior to her presentation, was brought to medical attention because of reduced level of consciousness, leading to the diagnosis of very distinct extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis.

An understanding of the pathogenesis is essential for comprehension of range of clinical manifestations of UGTB. Initially UGTB is not associated with specific symptoms; pyuria or hematuria maybe detected as incidental finding. After the disease has progressed to involve the bladder, symptoms of dysuria, urgency and nocturia occurs in half the cases and gross hematuria, low back pain occurs in one-third of the cases. Long standing parenchymal involvement may result in tubular proteinuria, which is in subnephrotic range. Systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss are rare. Manifestation of advanced disease is end stage renal disease (ESRD). In our patient, the likely insidious progression of UGTB led to chronic inflammation, resulting in ureteral narrowing and obstructive uropathy, which progressed to CKD. This asymptomatic presentation with advanced obstructive damage is atypical for UGTB and highlights its diagnostic difficulty. In most reported cases, patients present earlier with dysuria, frequency, or systemic features. The absence of these signs in our case delayed clinical suspicion until the disease reached a critical stage.

The diagnosis of UGTB should be suspected in patients with relevant clinical manifestations (urinary frequency, dysuria, hematuria and/or sterile pyuria) and relevant epidemiologic factors (history of TB, possible exposure, residence or travel to TB endemic areas). But our patient had neither of the reported symptoms or etiology that could lead to its definitive diagnosis. A series of radiological imaging and PCR of bodily fluids are essential to rule out broader differential diagnosis. Therefore, we collected the urine samples from our patient for Acid fast bacilli- PCR (AFB-PCR), to establish the diagnosis of UGTB, because AFB-PCR has sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 93–98% out of 100 to find mycobacterium tuberculosis.

TB causes urinary tract inflammation which may lead to obstruction of the collecting system, bladder contraction and development of renal function impairment. There is not much literature for similar clinical presentation of disseminated TB with lower genitourinary tract obstruction, complicated with chronic renal failure while being asymptomatic earlier.

### Urological manifestations of sarcoidosis [^3b937e3d]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We describe the urological manifestations of sarcoidosis and how the disease may affect the management of multiple urological conditions.

Materials and Methods

We performed a PubMed® search using the query sarcoidosis and multiple urological terms.

Results

Sarcoidosis is a disease that has variable manifestations. There is often genitourinary involvement that is clinically silent. However, sarcoidosis may cause symptoms, such as nephrolithiasis, which are sometimes the first manifestation of the disease. Renal function may be affected, and appropriate recognition and treatment may avert progressive functional decline. The presence of sarcoidosis may also confound the diagnosis and staging of various urological malignancies, particularly renal and testicular carcinoma.

Conclusions

Urologists should be aware of the urological manifestations of sarcoidosis to avoid misdiagnoses and the over staging of urological cancers, and to identify when it is an underlying cause of nephrolithiasis or obstructive uropathy.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^b287caa8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The terms postnatal period and postpartum period are interchangeably used to refer to the first 6 weeks (42 days) following childbirth and is further subdivided as immediate (first 24 h), early (day 2 – day 7) and late (day 8 – day 42) phases of the postpartum period. During this time, physiological changes of pregnancy are slowly reverting to the pre-pregnancy state. This period is riddled with a myriad of maternal illnesses. While most of these conditions may present during the first 1–2 weeks, among the scores of postpartum morbidities such as postpartum infection, anemia, perineal tears, urinary tract infection, and depression, are numerous and complex pathologies with onset, severity and duration of illness varying vastly.

Early detection and adequate and timely management are crucial in these conditions to reduce the risk of developing acute life-threatening conditions that may fall into obstetric near-miss category as well as serious long term sequalae which may lead to lifelong co-morbidities.

Constipation during the postpartum period is not an uncommon disorder. It is defined as low frequency and difficulty in passing stools which can be diagnosed following the criteria of less than 3 bowel movements a week, hard stools and/or difficulty in passing stools. Causing symptoms such as pain or discomfort on defecation, straining, hard lumpy stools, and a sense of incomplete bowel evacuation, constipation can be severe and may affect the quality of life of the woman significantly while also diverging her attention from the newborn who needs constant care.

While obstructive uropathy has been described as a complication of chronic constipation across literature, it is rare to find constipation leading to obstructive uropathy outside of the extremes of age. However, constipation following delivery, leading to obstructive uropathy and severe post obstructive diuresis during the postpartum period is an extremely rare set of sequalae. It's rarity if such that there are no cases of development of pathological POD upon relieving the constipation during pregnancy or in the postpartum period reported in the literature. This unreported consequence of constipation in pregnancy warrants the attention of the obstetrician not only to enlighten him/her regarding this interesting and complex phenomenon in the context of pregnancy but also to warn him/her to have a high degree of suspicion to diagnose and to take careful measures and precautions when dealing with such clinical situations such as lowering threshold for intervention considering the altered physiology of post-partum period and early involvement of the nephrology team.

### Patient centred care for the medical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic obstruction: a key point to improve patients' care-a systematic review [^173a2a2c]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 2 shows a possible suggestion of a patient centred approach in LUTS/BPH patients. Evidence based medicine includes etiology, diagnosis, current medications and guidelines/algorithms which should be integrated with patient illness, social context and partner. All the actors of a clinical consultation (GPs, urologist and patients) should participate together and actively communicate to achieve an integrated evidence based/patient centered approach. The disease and the patient are to be treated as a whole.

Fig. 2
On the top, the traditional model of LUTS/BPH management and treatment, centred on disease's characteristics and based on international guidelines and algorithms, derived by an Evidence Based Medicine approach. On the bottom, we suggest an implementation of the traditional model, through a strong collaboration between GPs and Urologists and a patient-centred model, with active participation of the patient during diagnostic evaluation and decision-making process. This novel model takes in account not only the disease's characteristics but also the psychological dimensions of the illness experience

### Obstructive uropathy secondary to metastasis from carcinoma of the breast [^5ae2f2f7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive uropathy secondary to malignant ureteral strictures is rare, with carcinoma of the breast accounting for less than 2% of cases. We present the case of a woman in her late 50s with a history of breast cancer who developed bilateral ureteral obstruction. She presented with bilateral flank pain, vomiting, fever and reduced urine output, with a serum creatinine of 12mg/dL. Imaging showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis leading to percutaneous nephrostomy placement. Further investigation confirmed metastatic breast cancer causing ureteral strictures. The patient was treated with palliative radiotherapy. This case highlights the importance of considering malignant causes in patients with a history of cancer presenting with obstructive uropathy, emphasising the need for thorough diagnostic workup, including fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans, to guide appropriate management and avoid unnecessary surgical interventions. Early urinary diversion and targeted therapy are crucial for symptom relief and disease control.

### An update on classification and management of urosepsis [^a7594ac9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The urinary tract is the infection site in severe sepsis/septic shock in 10–30%.

Recent Findings

There is a new Sepsis definition focusing on severe sepsis. Urosepsis is mainly due to obstructed uropathy of the upper urinary tract. The pathogenesis of sepsis is complex and is driven by the innate immune system. In the further course immunosuppression is developing. Management of urosepsis includes early diagnosis, early initiation of treatment such as identification and control of the complicating factor in the urinary tract and the specific sepsis therapy. As part of early diagnosis the value of the new defining criteria is still to be known. The management bundles are regularly updated according to the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines.

Summary

Sepsis has still a high morbidity and mortality rate. Although definition and diagnosis of sepsis has been recently updated, its translation into urosepsis management requires validation.

### Obstructive diseases of the urinary tract in children: lessons from the last 15 years [^97a1fba3]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Imaging urinary tract obstruction is a common query in paediatric uroradiology. With the advent of a more conservative treatment approach, the task of imaging today is to distinguish as early as possible those kidneys that do not require surgery, from those that will deteriorate and lose function and/or growth potential and thus benefit from surgery. At present, in spite of significant advancements in imaging and the introduction of diuretic paediatric MR-urography, there is still no reliable a-priori pro-futuro assessment. Thus, repeated follow-up imaging is often necessary for monitoring. Imaging usually starts with US; the major additional complementary and more function-oriented tools are diuretic renal scintigraphy and MR-urography. The frequency and timing as well as the detailed protocol vary within institutions, partly because of differences in the criteria that are used for indicating surgery. Intra-venous urography (IVU) for obstruction has practically vanished apart from for a few exceptions, and the "Whitaker" test is today seldom performed, being reserved for complicated cases.

### Ultrasound detection of obstructive pyelonephritis due to urolithiasis in the ED [^629d8563]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Identifying acute pyelonephritis (APN) with early obstructive uropathy is clinically important in the emergency department (ED) because obstructive urolithiasis is an independent risk factor for inpatient death, prolonged hospitalization, and failure of outpatient APN therapy. Furthermore, diagnosis of an early obstructive uropathy can be difficult when based solely on clinical findings. Clinicians may assume the cause of the patient's symptoms to be APN alone, without considering the concurrent presence of an obstructing stone. A feasible screening test to detect early obstructive uropathy in cases of APN has not been previously identified. Plain film radiographs are insensitive in locating a suspected calcified stone. Computed tomography is readily available in most EDs and clearly defines urologic anatomy, but delivers unnecessary ionizing radiation, can prolong ED length of stay, and is not cost-effective as a screening test for all patients diagnosed with APN. We report a case in which a bedside ultrasound identifying hydronephrosis prompted confirmatory computed tomography imaging and emergency consultation of a patient with APN. In this case, hydronephrosis on bedside ultrasound examination was an indirect marker of a distal ureteral obstruction. By detecting the presence of hydronephrosis in patients with APN, emergency physicians may dramatically increase their ability to identify those patients that need further radiographic investigation and ultimately decrease the rate of outpatient treatment failure. Further surveillance data are needed to determine the statistical characteristics of this novel screening test and if routine renal evaluation of all patients with APN is warranted.

PET scan demonstrates increased metabolic activity in the right renal, consistent with pyelonephritis

Differential diagnoses considered include pyelonephritis, disseminated tuberculosis (TB), urogenital strictures, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases. Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative. However, urine PCR for acid-fast bacilli was positive, confirming the diagnosis of urogenital TB. PCR was chosen for its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cases with nonspecific clinical and imaging findings, especially when conventional cultures are negative. A double J stent was inserted to relieve the narrowing of the ureteral stricture and to facilitate drainage of the right kidney. The stent was placed successfully without the need for ureteral dilatation or surgical intervention, as the stricture was traversable with guidewire assistance. The patient was diagnosed as UGTB with advanced CKD. She was initiated on anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) for 6 months with follow-up urine PCR. She has since shown significant improvement and continues to do well under treatment.

### Improving the care of children with urinary tract infection: use of a clinical decision proforma [^cafa4d8b]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

UTI is a common and important clinical problem in children. Around 1 in 10 girls and 1 in 30 boys will have had a UTI by the age of 16 years. Early recognition and appropriate management can prevent deterioration and reduce the incidence of long-term sequelae. Aside from satisfactory resolution of the acute infection, an important consideration in the management of UTI is the use of imaging to visualise the kidneys and urinary tract. The primary purpose of this imaging is to identify anatomical abnormalities such as obstructive uropathies or vesicoureteric reflux. Early identification of such abnormalities allows management such as surgery or antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent renal damage. Preventing renal damage in these situations may reduce the subsequent development of serious conditions relating to renal scarring including hypertension and renal failure.

Due to the large numbers of children who are diagnosed with UTI, follow up imaging is not indicated in all cases in order to reduce the burden this would place on imaging services and the unnecessary radiation exposure that would be involved. Balancing the importance of identifying abnormalities against the clinical risk of imaging and economic burden is clearly a delicate task. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced a guideline to support clinicians in this area. The NICE clinical guideline 54: Urinary tract infection in children (CG54) was issued in 2007 and provides an imaging strategy which takes into account the age of the child, and defines recurrent and atypical UTI which require different imaging follow up.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^ac01029d]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) obstruction assessment — if the patient's condition is not sufficiently suggestive of obstruction (e.g., peak urinary flow [Qmax] > 10 mL/sec), pressure flow studies should be considered as treatment failure rates are somewhat higher in the absence of obstruction, and a sensitivity of 47% for BOO is reported; if interventional therapy is planned without clear evidence of the presence of obstruction, the patient needs to be informed of potentially higher failure rates of the procedure.

### Hydronephrosis: a view from the inside [^a199d563]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common prenatally detected disease leading to hydronephrosis. The obstructive anatomic lesion leads to varying degrees of hydronephrosis, ranging from no apparent effect on renal function to atrophy. Furthermore, the natural course of hydronephrosis varies from spontaneous resolution to progressive deterioration and may take upwards of 3 years for a kidney to declare itself. The objectives of this article are to update our knowledge regarding the evaluation and management of UPJO in depth and to discuss the emerging value of urinary proteome analysis to the clinical arena.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on obstructive voiding symptoms secondary to prostate disease [^ec65f38a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Obstructive voiding symptoms are most commonly due to prostatic hyperplasia, but other causes include bladder neck contractures, prostatic carcinomas, neurogenic bladder, and urethral stricture. Symptoms include hesitancy, dribbling, decreased force of stream, and postvoid fullness. Imaging is useful in evaluating the presence and degree of hydronephrosis, estimation of renal function, evaluation of the bladder and prostate, and detection of incidental upper tract malignancies or stones. Various modalities have been used for evaluation of the cause of obstruction. Literature on the indications and usefulness of these radiologic studies for obstructive voiding symptoms in different clinical settings is reviewed.

### The learning curve of resident physicians using emergency ultrasonography for obstructive uropathy [^94d68c32]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Given the time, expense, and radiation exposure associated with computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) is considered an alternative imaging study that could expedite patient care in patients with suspected obstructive uropathy. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding bedside US for obstructive uropathy in the emergency department (ED), and it is unknown how much experience is required for competency in such exams.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the learning curve for the detection of obstructive uropathy of resident physicians training in ED bedside US (EUS) during a dedicated EUS elective.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of residents participating in an EUS elective. Patients presenting with acute abdominal or flank pain suggestive of an obstructive uropathy were enrolled and underwent EUS prior to noncontrast CT. Physicians who had previously performed at least 10 EUS exams for obstructive uropathy recorded results on a standardized data sheet, which was subsequently compared to the results of noncontrast CT read by board-certified radiologists blinded to the results of the EUS. In addition to an unadjusted chi-square test for trend, a multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for stone size and operator, was performed. Finally, generalized estimating equations were used to describe test characteristics while accounting for potential clustering between exams by operator.

Results

Twenty-three resident physicians participated and enrolled a convenience sample of 393 patients. A total of 157 patients (40%) were diagnosed with an obstructing ureterolith, and three (1%) were diagnosed with nonobstructing ureterolithiasis. An unadjusted chi-square test for trend demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both sensitivity (χ² = 11.4, p = 0.02) and specificity (χ² = 6.4, p = 0.04) for each level of increase in number of exams. On multivariable regression analysis, when adjusting for size of stone and operator, for every five additional exams after the first 10 EUS exams, the odds ratio for a true positive for obstruction increased by 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2 to 2.5, p = 0.003). After accounting for clustering of exams by operator, overall EUS sensitivity and specificity for obstructive uropathy were 82% (95% CI = 77% to 87%) and 88% (95% CI = 85% to 92%). Stratifying by number of exams, the sensitivity was 72% (95% CI = 62% to 80%) for the 11th through 20th exams, 90% (95% CI = 83% to 96%) for the 21st through 30th exams, and 95% (95% CI = 91% to 99%) for the 31st through 43rd exams. Likewise, specificity was 82% (95% CI = 75% to 89%) for the 11th through 20th exams, 90% (95% CI = 85% to 95%) for the 21st through 30th exams, and 92% (95% CI = 86% to 98%) for the 31st through 50th exams.

Conclusions

Physicians training in EUS may be able to accurately assess for obstructive uropathy after 30 exams.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^8f689214]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Action statement 7 — After confirmation of urinary tract infection (UTI), the clinician should instruct parents or guardians to seek prompt medical evaluation (ideally within 48 hours) for future febrile illnesses, to ensure that recurrent infections can be detected and treated promptly (evidence quality: C; recommendation). Early treatment limits renal damage better than late treatment, and the risk of renal scarring increases as the number of recurrences increases; all infants who have sustained a febrile UTI should have a urine specimen obtained at the onset of subsequent febrile illnesses, so that a UTI can be diagnosed and treated promptly. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes, and ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation. Routine VCUG after the first UTI is not recommended; VCUG is indicated if RBUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG also should be performed if there is a recurrence of febrile UTI.

### Management of ureteral obstruction due to advanced malignancy: optimizing therapeutic and palliative outcomes [^19b77a57]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Treatment of ureteral obstruction due to advanced abdominal or pelvic malignancy is a clinical challenge. We discuss improvements and modern day outcomes in the palliative treatment of patients with ureteral obstruction by antegrade or retrograde ureteral decompression. Also, potential areas of clinical investigation involving ureteral stent improvement and pharmacological management of relief of symptoms resulting from ureteral obstruction are discussed.

Materials and Methods

A literature search was performed using the Entrez-PubMed(R) database. All relevant literature on ureteral obstruction, advanced malignancy and nephrostomy, ureteral stent and associated topics concerning palliative care and quality of life were reviewed and analyzed.

Results

Presenting symptoms are varied and depend on the acuity of the underlying problem. Mechanisms underlying the pain and symptoms of extrinsic ureteral compression have not fully been explored but they may include prostaglandin and renin-angiotensin pathways with medical interventions potentially directed at such therapeutic targets. Progressive obstructive uropathy may likely lead to clinical manifestations, such as uremia, electrolyte imbalances and persistent urinary tract infections, if obstruction is not bypassed. New approaches to antegrade and retrograde stenting, and the evaluation of new stent materials may help minimize the complications and side effects of such procedures. Unfortunately the finding of ureteral obstruction due to malignancy carries a poor prognosis with a resulting median survival of 3 to 7 months. This prognosis highlights the importance of maintaining quality of life in these patients.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with symptoms of ureteral obstruction due to advanced malignancy should be informed of the therapeutic options in the context of the poor prognosis. In the meantime research is needed to find methods of urinary diversion and pharmacological intervention for symptomatic relief without compromising quality of life in patients at the end of life.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^7607782c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Constipation during pregnancy is not uncommon. Usually, this does not warrant extensive evaluation and settles with minor interventions or lifestyle modifications. Severe fecal impaction in chronically constipated patients can rarely lead to obstructive uropathy. Relief of obstruction can result in a diuretic phase which may be self-limiting or pathological. However, occurrence of pathological post-obstructive diuresis as a result of severe constipation is an extremely rare complication during pregnancy and puerperium which can even be fatal if not promptly diagnosed and adequately monitored and timely intervened. We describe the management of a pathological post-obstructive diuresis which occurred in the immediate postpartum period after treatment of severe constipation and obstructive uropathy.

Case Presentation

A woman who had undergone an emergency caesarean section due to deep transverse arrest 1 week ago, presented with fecal impaction and anuria. On relief of urinary obstruction which had developed secondary to fecal impaction, she developed pathological post-obstructive diuresis. Careful and timely monitoring with exact fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte imbalances and multidisciplinary care ensured complete recovery of the patient.

Conclusions

Despite obstructive uropathy being uncommon in obstetric practice, clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion to monitor and promptly manage the potentially life-threatening condition of post-obstructive diuresis in pregnant and puerperal women undergoing urinary tract decompression. Due to unreliability of laboratory cutoff values in pregnancy and puerperium, a more vigilant and multidisciplinary approach with lower threshold for intervention is more prudent in the management of these patients.

### Obstructive uropathy as initial presentation of genitourinary tuberculosis and masquerading as a postsurgical complication [^3437185f]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old woman who had a recent total abdominal hysterectomy presented with a 1month history of lower abdominal pain, 1week of nausea and vomiting as well as decreased urinary output preceded by a year of significant unintentional weight loss. On renal imaging, she was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureters in the setting of bilateral distal ureteric obstruction complicated with acute kidney injury and severe hyperkalaemia requiring haemodialysis. The initial concern was for ureteric injury, a known complication of abdominal hysterectomy procedures, however, a urological intervention, performed 9months later to relieve the ureteric obstruction, revealed purulent material within the left ureter that was smear positive for acid fast bacilli. A GeneXpert test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis She was diagnosed with genitourinary tuberculosis and responded well to antitubercular treatment and haemodialysis was discontinued after the surgery relieved her ureteric obstruction.

### Intrinsic ureteric obstruction secondary to endometriosis: a rare clinical entity causing obstructive uropathy and renal failure [^a7e43de9]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Ureteral endometriosis is rare and can be a silent clinical entity, which can potentially lead to serious complications such as obstructive uropathy, sepsis and renal failure. A high clinical suspicion is required especially in childbearing age groups due to non-specific presentation such as renal colic, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), renal failure or asymptomatic hydronephrosis. A woman in her 40s presented with febrile UTI and flank pain. She reportedly suffered from recurrent UTIs in the past. Initial workup revealed an infected, obstructed left renal collecting system with gross hydronephrosis and hydroureter to the distal ureter on a significant gynaecological background of severe endometriosis requiring hysterectomy in the past.CT showed chronic obstructive changes and soft tissue nodules within the renal pelvis with no radio-opaque stones. She underwent emergent ureteric stent insertion. Functional imaging demonstrated only 1% contribution of the left kidney with a preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate of 65mL/min/1.73 m 2 Endoscopic evaluation of ureters found extensive soft tissue lesions throughout the dilated left collecting system with biopsy-confirmed endometriosis. Subsequently, she underwent laparoscopic nephroureterectomy due to extensive ureteric involvement and chronically obstructed non-functioning kidney. Histopathology demonstrated completely obstructing ureteral endometriosis. Ureteric obstruction secondary to endometriosis can be due to extrinsic or intrinsic disease. In addition to initial assessment with CT urogram MRI may be helpful to evaluate soft tissue thickening. Endoscopic assessment with ureteroscopy and biopsy is required for tissue diagnosis. Surgery is often the treatment of choice, ranging from ureteroureterostomy, ureteroneocystostomy or nephroureterectomy in severe cases. Ureteral endometriosis is a rare clinical entity, clinicians should remain vigilant about common presentations of this rare entity, early diagnosis and prompt treatment is crucial to prevent progression to renal failure.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: an analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^3852cfc4]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms supposed secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO) are among the most prevalent conditions in older males. Surgical treatment is usually recommended if pharmacotherapy fails, is not well tolerated, or when BPO-related complications arise. Surgical options can also be used at an earlier stage after a thorough joint decision has been made. As established surgical therapies have drawbacks and the threshold for surgical treatment seems to have become much lower with the implementation of minimally invasive treatments (MITs), LUTS/BPO surgery has become an economically significant area. Consequently, novel therapeutic devices and procedures are being developed at an unprecedented rate.

The rapid adoption of new surgical techniques is influenced by a range of factors, including patient demand, competitive healthcare dynamics, and regulatory pathways that are often less stringent than those applied to pharmaceuticals. Consequently, some interventions may enter clinical use before a comprehensive evidence base is available. A comprehensive understanding of the array of procedures, including their benefits and risks, safety profiles, and ideal indications, is essential for successful, individualized treatment. However, for physicians not deeply specialized in the field, staying abreast of these developments can be challenging. Clinical guidelines provide critical support in this context.

Nonetheless, guidelines are not without their limitations. The required level of evidence for recommending novel treatments is not uniformly defined. Furthermore, while guidelines should rely on robust evidence, they also need to remain relevant and not withhold potentially beneficial novel treatments from patients. Consequently, the same body of evidence might receive varying interpretations by different guideline bodies.

The objective of this study was to analyze existing guidelines for the surgical treatment of LUTS/BPO, compare their recommendations for various surgical methods and treatment scenarios, and assess where further data could unify recommendations where discrepancies exist.

### Perinatal urinary tract dilation: recommendations on pre-/ postnatal imaging, prophylactic antibiotics, and follow-up: clinical Report [^773c7cef]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Etiologies of antenatal urinary tract dilation and impact — Diagnosing the precise etiology of UTD on antenatal imaging can be difficult, and causes are diverse, including transient/physiologic dilation, VUR, and obstructive uropathy such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves, ureterocele, ectopic ureter, and ureterovesical junction obstruction. The impact on the renal unit and the patient ranges from no effect to increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI), renal scarring, and dysplasia of the kidney.

### Down the tube of obstructive nephropathies: the importance of tissue interactions during ureter development [^0cf54dd8]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital obstructive malformations of the ureter are amongst the most common human birth defects. To date, the etiology of these diseases has remained largely unexplored, which has preempted any rational approach for therapeutic intervention. Here, we describe that obstructive ureter defects can arise from genetic insults affecting various subprograms of ureter development including formation and patterning of the ureteric bud, differentiation of tissue compartments of the ureter, and junction formation with the bladder and pelvis. New experimental findings have highlighted the importance of epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions in all of these subprograms and provided unique insights into the molecular nature of the transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways involved.

### Patient centred care for the medical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic obstruction: a key point to improve patients' care-a systematic review [^6dcc0630]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

If the patients agree, family members and in particular the partners should always be involved in the decision-making, as they are the main actors in the social context that surrounds the patients.

In fact, partners play a specific role in patient's life as well as in in LUTS/BPH treatment. Sells and co-workers evaluated 90 partners using a dedicated questionnaire to assess partners' morbidity associated with BPH/LUTS management. Almost all partners experienced some morbidity as a consequence of the patients' condition, with the most common issues being sleep disturbance, fear of cancer and surgery and limitations in social life including sexual life.

In conclusion, during this process, the clinician should not focus exclusively on the disease, but he should consider the whole person and the social context that surrounds him. In particular, in the case of LUTS/BPH, the clinician should evaluate carefully the sexual functions of the patient, involving as much as possible the partner in the decision-making.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was performed to rule out a stroke. Additionally, a CT scan of the urinary tract revealed extensive right hydroureteronephrosis with cortical thinning and scarring, predominantly affecting the upper pole of the kidney, suggesting a chronic obstruction. There was prominent thickening of bladder walls (Fig. 1). To relieve the obstruction, a right-sided percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube was placed. Due to concerns about contrast-induced nephropathy, a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis could not be performed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was performed which revealed right nephrostomy placement with a small right perinephric hematoma, diffuse wall thickening of the right renal pelvicalyces and ureter suggestive of pyelonephritis. The left kidney showed a tiny simple cyst with no evidence of hydronephrosis or focal lesions. The ureteral narrowing was most prominent in the proximal to mid-right ureter, with contiguous inflammatory thickening extending from the renal pelvis downward (Fig. 2). As the MRI findings remained nonspecific and could not definitively exclude other causes such as malignancy or atypical infections, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed to further characterize renal involvement and rule out occult malignancy or systemic disease involvement. PET scan demonstrated increased metabolic activity in the right renal parenchyma and perirenal stranding, consistent with pyelonephritis. PET scan was negative for any malignancy (Fig. 3).

### Do current scientific reports of hydronephrosis make the grade? [^8d530976]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In December 2014, Nguyen et al. introduced the Upper Tract Dilation (UTD) classification scheme, hoping to unify multiple disciplines when describing ultrasound imaging of congenital hydronephrosis. We hypothesized that the academic community has been slow to adopt its use in publications.

Primary Aim

To evaluate which hydronephrosis grading systems were currently preferred in publications.

Study Design

A PubMed® search for hydronephrosis was performed, and abstracts between May 2017 and May 2019 were reviewed. The following data points were collected from the 197 manuscripts meeting inclusion criteria: journal, first and senior author specialty, country, type of article, primary pathology, and classification of hydronephrosis when present. Differences between use of classification system, and author specialty, manuscript type, and pathology were evaluated.

Results

First and/or senior author specialties were most commonly pediatric urology, urology, pediatric surgery, and pediatric nephrology. The manuscripts were comprised of retrospective studies (48.2%), prospective studies (25.4%), case reports (15.7%), review articles (9.1%), and systematic reviews (1.5%). The most common pathologies were hydronephrosis (36.5%) and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (21.3%). Over 20% of manuscripts did not categorize hydronephrosis at all. The UTD classification was used by 5.6%, while Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) grading was used by 37.1% and Anterior-Posterior Diameter (APD) measurements by 32.5%. The Summary Table presents grading system by manuscript type, specialty, and pathology.

Discussion

There is great variability in hydronephrosis grading. One potential weakness of our study is that sufficient time may not have passed for the UTD system to be adopted. Researchers may need more time to complete and publish their studies, or could be awaiting further validation of UTD utility. They could also be hesitant to change systems when it is unknown if one classification schema is superior to another, either in general or for specific diagnoses. Another weakness is that this study does not quantify what, if any, systems are used clinically. Some attempt to provide objective classification would help clarify the implications of the manuscript for research or clinical applications. Reviewers should ensure that where possible, adequate descriptions of hydronephrosis are included. Education outreach to other specialties may help increase objective grading in research.

Conclusions

The UTD system is not commonly utilized in the literature. SFU grading is applied most commonly, followed by APD measurements. Over one third of manuscripts used no classification system or descriptive terminology.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^9875bfe2]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — states that diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50 000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. This Clinical Practice Guideline was retired May 2021.

### Urethrolysis [^d7127604]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Urethral obstruction is a potential risk following surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The diagnosis can be difficult due to wide variations in patient presentation, timing, and severity. The true incidence is likely underreported due to this variance. Current literature reports 2.5% to 24% of patients experience obstruction following anti‐incontinence procedures, with 50% to 75% of those receiving surgical correction to relieve the obstruction.

Surgeons performing procedures for SUI should be competent in recognizing the signs of urethral obstruction and counseling patients on treatment. Surgeons who are not comfortable performing surgical treatment for obstruction should refer to a specialist for treatment. Timely recognition and treatment of urethral obstruction can lead to significant symptom relief, and more importantly, prevent long‐term deterioration of the lower urinary tract. This review will discuss the unique considerations of presentation, diagnosis, intervention, and outcomes associated with urethral obstruction following anti‐incontinence surgery.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: an analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^ae2b893b]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, guidelines are criticized for having various methodological and structural issues that could influence their recommendations. These include widespread conflicts of interest from sponsors that support the guidelines. Conflicts of interest, both professional and financial, are also prevalent among guideline authors and boards. Such conflicts, along with industry influence on guideline panels and "panel stacking" (biased selection of panel members), can impact the integrity of the guidelines. The lack of independent peer review before guideline publication is another concern that could compromise the reliability of the recommendations.

Our study builds on the work by Enikeev et al. which compared recommendations using the AGREE II tool for the AUA, EAU, and NICE guidelines. Our analysis includes updated guidelines from both the DGU and CUA and excludes outdated NICE guidelines, providing a more current and comprehensive perspective. The consensus algorithm developed through our analysis (Fig. 1) not only integrates the most accepted and recent guidelines but also offers a detailed and balanced interpretation of these guidelines, independently assessed by four authors. We want to emphasize that our presented algorithm provides a structured overview of current guideline recommendations, it is not intended as a validated clinical decision-making tool. Rather, it serves to illustrate areas of agreement and divergence between established guidelines and to support clinicians in navigating an increasingly complex therapeutic landscape. A formal validation of the algorithm would require a separate prospective study, which is beyond the scope of this work.

The limitations of our study have already been addressed and predominantly arise from inconsistent classifications and categorizations within and across various guidelines. Furthermore, despite our structured and comprehensive search strategy, it is possible that some relevant guidelines were missed, particularly if they were not listed via SIU membership or not publicly available online. This represents a potential source of selection bias. In addition, by limiting inclusion to guidelines published in English or German (Table 1), some documents in other languages may have been excluded. While this was necessary for practical reasons, it may have reduced the global representativeness of our sample.

In addition, the clarity of the consensus flow-chart may be affected by the numerous footnotes. However, given the complexities outlined above and the fact that most guidelines include only vague statement on factors such as patient-preferences, therapy under anticoagulants, preservation of ejaculatory function, such intricacies were inevitable. Therefore, further simplification would have likely led to a loss of precision.

### Prenatal diagnosis of a rare form of congenital mid-ureteral stricture: a case report and literature revisited [^20d62917]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

There are many etiologies involved in obstructive uropathies. Rare causes of hydronephrosis are congenital mid-ureteral strictures. The ureteral strictures are narrowing of the lumen of the ureter. Strictures are the decrease of ureteral lumen diameter by 60%. These obstructions are usually due to valves. The ureteral valves are transverse folds of ureteral mucous involved in the strictures. Besides, these strictures can be due to anomalous organization of the ureteral musculature, which may be caused by alterations in the fetal canalization process or consequently to insufficient vascular supply. These ureteral tracts have a reduction of smooth muscle cells. In severe strictures, the smooth muscle layer should be replaced by fibrous tissue and associated with other abnormalities of the urinary tract.

Unfortunately, obstructive uropathies may result in both tubular damage and decreased number of nephrons already during fetal life. For the appropriate management, it could be interesting to obtain the exact localization of the ureteral tract obstruction as soon as possible. Therefore, US performed during pregnancy are not usually able to characterize the exact cause of hydronephrosis. In our subject, fetal MRI was able to detect/suspect a ureteral obstruction. However, only postnatal MRI pyelography of the urinary tract confirmed the obstruction at ureteral level. This case of both severe ureteral obstruction and reduced kidney function did not show a very informative radionuclide renography by Tc-MAG3. Notwithstanding the successful pyeloplasty, only minimum function recovery can be expected in kidneys with poor function and hydronephrosis diagnosed during pregnancy. This may be because a chronic renal failure frequently occurs if the neonate at birth has got significant kidney damage from chronic prenatal obstruction. Finally imaging techniques, in particular MRI pyelography, could rapidly and accurately describe the morphological features of a dilated urinary tract with information as well as to the level of obstruction.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^3a580528]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Diuretic renal scintigraphy — interpretation of equal renal uptake and suspected obstruction notes that patients with a high-grade acute obstruction may demonstrate equal uptake in the two kidneys with an empty pelvis and no transit into the collecting system, and that high-grade obstruction soon leads to a loss of function in the affected kidney; for suspected unilateral chronic obstruction, the likelihood of obstruction is reduced if relative renal function is the same in both kidneys even when T1/2 are abnormal, and in these cases it may be appropriate to observe the patient and repeat the study at a later date or to combine the study with sonography to determine whether the size of the renal pelvis is increasing with time.

### A rare case of herniated duplex collecting system causing obstructive uropathy [^f1dbdfad]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Uretero-inguinal hernias can potentially cause obstructive uropathy and in some cases lead to kidney failure if left undiagnosed. Further, if undiagnosed, iatrogenic ureteral injury can occur during hernia repair.

Obesity as well as deficiency in collagen synthesis are risk factors for ureteral hernias. These hernias are more frequent on the right side compared to the left due to differences in fascia of Toldt morphology.

Ultrasound is the ideal first line imaging modality to assess the upper urinary tract as it can identify hydronephrosis as well as the integrity of the proximal ureter. However, ultrasound of the urinary tract does not routinely include assessment of the inguinal orifices making the tracking of the ureter in the retroperitoneal space a challenge. Cross-sectional imaging (CT scan or MRI) are more reliable for identification of the site and etiology of urinary tract obstruction and can allow identification of the site of herniation as well as anatomical classification with CT remaining more easily accessible between the two modalities.

Herniorrhaphy is considered the treatment modality for uretero-inguinal hernias causing obstructive symptoms. If during imaging, an obstructive uropathy is observed, a nephroureteral stent or nephrostomy tube can be inserted to protect the ureter as well as relieve the obstruction, respectively.

A uretero-inguinal hernia is a rare condition that can potentially lead to obstructive uropathy. CT is currently the modality of choice for identification, diagnosis as well as anatomical classification of the hernia and its possible complications. In this case report, we describe a unique uretero-inguinal hernia involving a duplicated ureter causing obstructive uropathy. Recognizing such an entity is important in identifying causes of acute kidney injury and preventing surgical complications.

Discussion

The multitude of guidelines for the treatment of benign prostatic obstruction underscores the complexity and diversity of this medical issue. However, many of these guidelines are either not current or lack specific recommendations for particular procedures or treatment scenarios for individual patients. The greatest consensus among guidelines was observed for the oldest and most established procedures, attributable to the robust body of evidence supported by numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Particularly regarding newer and less evaluated procedures, there are relevant discrepancies in the recommendations among the analyzed guidelines. These recommendations exhibit a wide variation in the levels of evidence and, occasionally, a notable lack of consensus across the guidelines. This is particularly evident with procedures such as iTIND™, PAE, and RASP as presented in Table 2. For instance, PAE is endorsed by the DGU and the EAU, backed by a relatively substantial level of evidence, in contrast to the more conservative positions of the AUA and CUA, which assign it an evidence level of Grade C. Thus, it is anticipated that forthcoming research will substantially improve the evidence landscape, compelling corresponding updates to the recommendations.

Several factors contribute to the observed discrepancies between guidelines. These differences may be due to the guidelines being drafted at different times with varied underlying bodies of evidence. Additionally, the interpretation of available evidence can differ significantly, particularly when the evidence base is limited. Moreover, not all current guidelines have clearly defined rules specifying which exact level of evidence is necessary, including aspects such as study size, treatment effects, and duration of follow-up, which can lead to inconsistencies. In this context, the efforts of the EAU Guidelines should be positively emphasized. Their description of the required body of evidence and the definition of meaningful follow-up periods represents an important step towards transparency and consistency.

In addition, grouping similar surgical procedures may lead to a better overview. However, if the entire group of operations is then recommended for a very specific scenario, this recommendation may no longer be adequately covered by the available evidence. An example of this is the joint recommendation of enucleation procedures (AEEP) in the CUA guidelines for patients on anticoagulation, despite the fact that there is only evidence for HoLEP, but not for B-TUEP.

Common clinical indications — there are several common clinical indications for diuretic renal scintigraphy: to measure the relative function of a possibly obstructed kidney in order to determine whether renal function is compromised and establish a baseline for monitoring any future loss of function that might require intervention; to determine whether renal obstruction is present in a patient who has signs or symptoms of obstruction; and to determine whether renal obstruction is present in an asymptomatic patient for whom hydronephrosis was detected on prior imaging.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part II: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^8c70abe6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA guideline — obstructing kidney and/or ureteral stones with suspected infection management — For adult patients with obstructing kidney and/or ureteral stones and suspected infection, clinicians should initiate urgent renal drainage (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For adult and pediatric patients with obstructing kidney and/or ureteral stones and suspected infection undergoing urgent drainage of the collecting system, clinicians should obtain a urine sample from the collecting system for culture, when possible (Expert Opinion). Attempting to surgically remove an obstructing stone in the presence of an untreated urinary tract infection (UTI) can lead to life-threatening sepsis, and treating the infection with antibiotics alone without addressing an obstruction is unlikely to resolve the infection and may allow continued clinical deterioration; in these cases, it is essential that patients receive both culture-directed antimicrobial therapy and undergo urgent renal drainage via a ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube. Once the kidney has been decompressed, definitive surgical stone removal should be delayed until the infection is fully treated and all signs of sepsis or infection-related complications have resolved.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA GUIDELINE PART II-surgical evaluation and treatment [^3ba6f511]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Surgical therapies for symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are many, and vary from minimally invasive office based to high-cost operative approaches. This Guideline presents effective evidence-based surgical management of male lower urinary tract symptoms secondary/attributed to BPH (LUTS/BPH). See accompanying algorithm for a detailed summary of procedures (figure[Figure: see text]).

Materials/Methods

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible studies published between January 2007 and September 2020, which includes the initial publication (2018) and amendments (2019, 2020). The Team also reviewed articles identified by Guideline Panel Members. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table[Table: see text]).

Results

Twenty-four guideline statements pertinent to pre-operative and surgical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to direct urologic providers towards suitable and safe operative interventions for individual patient characteristics. A re-treatment section was created to direct attention to longevity and outcomes with individual approaches to help guide patient counselling and therapeutic decisions.

Conclusion

Pre-operative and surgical management of BPH requires attention to individual patient characteristics and procedural risk. Clinicians should adhere to recommendations and familiarize themselves with criteria that yields the highest likelihood of surgical success when choosing a particular approach for a particular patient.

### Diagnostic value of diuretic-enhanced excretory MR urography in patients with obstructive uropathy [^8dc5186f]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ultrasonography and conventional intravenous urography are most common methods in diagnosis of obstructive uropathies. The disadvantage of ultrasonography is inability of visualizing middle and lower one thirds of ureter, while intravenous urography is using radiation, also functionally extra loading effect on kidneys. In this study, the diagnostic value of MR urography on obstructive uropathy were investigated.

Materials and Methods

Forty five patients who were suffered from obstructive uropathy examined by ultrasonography, intravenous urography and diuretic-enhanced excretory MR urography by using MR-contrast-agent.

Results

MR urography established accuracy rate of 92.8% for stone diseases which formed the largest group in this study, however, in other causes of obstructive uropathy, MR urography provide 100% correct diagnosis.

Conclusion

MR urography provide high quality images for diagnosing and determining causes of urinary obstruction defining position and severity of dilatations as well as showing localization of the pathology. We think that MR urography should be a primary investigation in patients with obstructive uropathy who have contrast agent and X-ray contrindication.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^23b8d041]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pregnancy is a physiological phenomenon characterized by numerous multisystemic anatomical and physiological changes. Such gastrointestinal changes in pregnancy contribute to constipation, seen in as many as 10–40% of pregnant women. In our patient, pregnancy associated hormonal and anatomical changes, dietary habits and a more sedentary lifestyle during pregnancy and puerperium would have all contributed to worsening her pre-existing constipation leading to fecal impaction.

We believe that undiagnosed constipation may have contributed to the deep transverse arrest of labour that resulted in the patient undergoing caesarean section. Cochrane review concludes that routine treatment with enema in labour should be discouraged. However, that should not preclude us from careful history taking and mindful evaluation that could prompt caregivers to intervene if significant constipation is identified.

Post-operative period in this patient would have exacerbated the constipation she experienced in pregnancy leading to fecal impaction, compounded by poor fluid intake, inadequate mobilization and medication such as opioid analgesics and iron supplements.

This patient presented with obstructive uropathy complicated by peritoneal free fluid. Exact mechanism of peritoneal free fluid accumulation in this patient is unclear but can be a complex pathophysiology including acute renal failure and pregnancy related lymphatic drainage obstruction all would have played a role.

Fecal impaction causing obstructive uropathy is described in literature in elderly and in paediatric age groups. In adult females, pelvic tumors, gravid uterus, gynaecological malignancies and uterovaginal prolapse are several aetiological factors for obstructive uropathy. However, there are no documented cases of fecal impaction leading to obstructive uropathy and consequently post-obstructive diuresis, in the post-partum period.

With the relief of the obstruction as many as 0.5–52% of patients may experience post-obstructive diuresis which can be potentially life threatening. Post-obstructive diuresis can be defined as urine output of more than 200 ml/hour over more than 2 consecutive hours immediately following relief of the obstruction or a urine output of more than 3000 ml/24 h.

### The SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for renal scintigraphy in adults [^ac1b0a5f]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Medium credibility.

Renal scintigraphy in adults — overview and indications — states that renal scans are safe and widely available tests that provide information about kidney morphology and function using radiopharmaceuticals with high renal clearance. Radiopharmaceuticals used to perform renal scans can be divided into three major categories: filtered by the glomerulus, secreted by the tubules, and retained in the tubules via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Functional agents (filtered by the glomerulus and/or secreted by the tubules) are used in the dynamic renal scan (renography), and morphological agents (retained in the tubules) are used in the static (cortical) renal scan. Dynamic scans elucidate the uptake and drainage of the radiopharmaceutical and allow the generation of time-activity curves by selection of regions of interest, while static scans image the functional renal tissue and provide useful morphologic information. Purpose of this guideline is to provide practitioners with a summary of radiopharmaceuticals, techniques and clinical indications for performing renal scintigraphy in adults, will not deal with radiopharmaceuticals or indications currently under investigation or used for clinical trials or research, and is only advised where the needed technology and radiopharmaceuticals are available and licensed. Major indications include, but are not limited to, acute and chronic renal failure, unilateral/bilateral renal disease (space occupying lesions included), obstructive uropathy, renovascular hypertension, and status post renal transplantation.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^d8568e20]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology in order to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group therefore was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature in order to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

Methods

Extensive reviews of the literature together with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics, by a working group including of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

Results and Conclusions

Recommendations are given for the management of patients with acute stone colic and for active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, the principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

### Indications and outcomes of fetal cystoscopy for lower urinary tract obstruction: a comprehensive review [^95d475ea]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Indications

The careful selection of cases with severe LUTO requiring fetal cystoscopy remains the foremost difficult point to be established. Procedural success hinges upon meticulous patient selection, technical proficiency, and ongoing advancements in fetal medicine. It's essential to note that not all LUTO cases are suitable for this intervention, and considerations regarding the obstruction's severity and type are paramount together with the exclusion of associated non‐renal anomalies suggestive of chromosomal abnormalities or syndromic forms of LUTO. The process of considering fetal intervention commences with the prenatal diagnosis of suspected LUTO in a fetus that presents without additional anomalies or chromosomal disorders. This typically starts with evidence of a distended bladder ("megacystis") accompanied by hydronephrosis, progressing to renal dysplasia with abnormal renal parenchymal appearance on ultrasound (US) examination and eventually resulting in severe oligohydramnios. Apart from abnormal kidney appearance in the US that can be predictive of kidney dysplasia and, therefore, postnatal function, another important factor is amniotic fluid volume as a proxy for kidney function. Some studies have shown that normal amniotic fluid volume is associated with improved perinatal survival and renal function. Furthermore, the US can screen for other anatomic defects suggestive of genetic syndromes that might preclude intervention. Beyond the US, genetic studies are needed as the presence of an abnormal karyotype in a fetus with urinary obstruction can alter decision‐making for intervention. Overall, it is accepted that patients most likely to benefit from invasive procedures have a normal karyotype, no other developmental anomalies, oligohydramnios/anhydramnios, and favorable urinary biochemistry. Fetal urine samples, obtained via vesicocentesis, are typically tested for urinary sodium, chloride, calcium, osmolality, and β‐2‐microglobulin. Favorable urinary indices sampled between 18 and 30 weeks of gestation and associated with better renal outcomes include sodium < 100 mEq/L, chloride < 90 mEq/L, osmolality < 200 mOsm/L, and β‐2‐microglobulin < 6 mg/L. However, there is a debate over their use as prognostic markers. A recent systematic review found that urinary calcium > 95% and sodium > 95% for gestational age were the most predictive of poor postnatal renal function. Other studies suggest that various combinations of fetal urinary markers can provide either positive or negative prognostic value for renal outcomes. β‐2‐microglobulin is particularly noteworthy; while a systematic review found it had little predictive value, an earlier study indicated that levels > 13 mg/L were nearly 100% predictive of neonatal death, and levels > 6 mg/L were negatively associated with renal survival but positively correlated with benefit from intervention.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the management of female non-neurogenic lower urinary tract symptoms. part 2: underactive bladder, bladder outlet obstruction, and nocturia [^88ed02b3]. European Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Female lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a common presentation in urological practice. Thus far, only a limited number of female LUTS conditions have been included in the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines compendium. The new non-neurogenic female LUTS guidelines expand the remit to include these symptoms and conditions.

Objective

To summarise the management of underactive bladder (UAB), bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), and nocturia in females.

Evidence Acquisition

The literature search was updated in September 2021 and evidence synthesis was conducted using modified GRADE approach as outlined for all EAU guidelines. A new systematic review on BOO was carried out by the panel for purposes of this guideline.

Evidence Synthesis

The important considerations for informing guideline recommendations are presented, along with a summary of all the guideline recommendations.

Conclusions

Non-neurogenic female LUTS are an important presentation of urological dysfunction. Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and management should be carried out in a structured and logical fashion on the basis of the best available evidence. This guideline serves to present this evidence to practising urologists and other health care providers in an easily accessible and digestible format.

Patient Summary

This report summarises the main recommendations from the European Association of Urology guideline on symptoms and diseases of the female lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) not associated with neurological disease. We cover recommendations related to the treatment of underactive bladder, obstruction of the bladder outlet, and nighttime urination.

### Transcaval ureter: a rare embryological anomaly causing obstructive uropathy [^91af63bb]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 21-year-old woman presented with a longstanding history of episodic right flank pain related to fluid consumption and recurrent urinary tract infections. On examination, there was right costovertebral angle tenderness. Renal tract ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrosis and CT urography confirmed transcaval ureter. The patient's clinical presentation was likely due to obstruction associated with the right ureter passing through the opening created by the duplicated segment of the inferior vena cava. While asymptomatic transcaval ureter can be managed conservatively, severe symptoms or complications of ureteric obstruction may require surgical treatment. In this case, treatment comprised a laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy with an end-to-end anastomosis between the proximal and distal sections of the right ureter. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful and she reported resolution of the flank pain during the one year of follow-up.

### Treatment of obstructive uropathy in one of three young brothers suffering from Gorlin-Cohen syndrome: a case report [^3e777b60]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Frontometaphyseal dysplasia, also called Gorlin-Cohen syndrome, is a rare hereditary X-linked syndrome initially described in 1969. It encompasses cranial hyperostosis, abnormal tubulation of cylindrical bones, and other skeletal and extraskeletal abnormalities. Obstructive uropathy is a feature of the syndrome in some patients. Although several authors have commented on the presence of this urological complication, no specific evaluation of the symptoms or their treatment has been reported. We herein describe a male patient with typical frontometaphyseal dysplasia and the approach for treatment of his urinary tract malformations.

### Nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction: conservative and medical management [^01111fd6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), management goals include reduction of outlet resistance to increase urinary outflow and improve bladder voiding to prevent or reduce lower and upper urinary tract (LUT and UUT) function deterioration. It also aims to reduce the patient's symptoms and to achieve a descent quality of life (QoL). After proper identification of BOO subtype (anatomical vs. functional) and/or diagnosis, treatment choices will differ accordingly. The aim of management is correction of the underlying etiology. Since significant progress has recently been achieved in the field of female BOO, the purpose of this article is to review and summarize the current literature.
