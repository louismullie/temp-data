## Question

Antibiotic of choice for epididymitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the antibiotic of choice for epididymitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and likely pathogens by age and risk factors. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guideline recommendations and how they differ by scenario. Next, I will check dosing details, including weight-based adjustments and duration. After that, I need to consider special populations and what to do if first-line therapy is not available. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, partner management, and when to escalate care, and then synthesize a concise, scenario-based answer with caveats about resistance and stewardship.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and etiologies, because treatment hinges on this. In sexually active men under about 35 years, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae predominate, whereas in men over 35 or those with urinary tract instrumentation, obstructive uropathy, or immunocompromise, enteric gram-negatives such as Escherichia coli are more likely; Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging pathogen in some settings, and tuberculosis or brucellosis should be considered in the right epidemiologic context [^d14a1c9c] [^4daabd5b] [^169cfb60].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the highest-credibility guidance. The CDC 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines provide the most authoritative, scenario-based regimens and are the primary source I will rely on, with EAU 2025 and IUSTI 2017 as supportive references for consistency and European practice patterns [^84576b38] [^c92d01d8] [^909ecf5d].

> For sexually active men under 35 years, or when STI risk is high, I need to ensure dual coverage for gonorrhea and chlamydia. The CDC recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (use 1 g if body weight is ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days; this combination addresses rising gonococcal resistance and the frequent co-infection with chlamydia, and is echoed by EAU and IUSTI guidance to include an agent active against C. trachomatis with ceftriaxone when gonorrhea is suspected [^84576b38] [^46215beb] [^e7d71964] [^909ecf5d].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing nuance for ceftriaxone because I initially thought 500 mg was universal; I should correct that. For patients weighing 150 kg or more, the CDC specifies 1 g ceftriaxone IM to ensure adequate exposure, so I need to state that explicitly to avoid underdosing in larger patients [^84576b38] [^46215beb].

> For men who practice insertive anal intercourse, or when both STI and enteric organisms are suspected, I should confirm that broader coverage is advised. The CDC recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) plus levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days to cover gonorrhea, chlamydia, and enteric gram-negatives; this aligns with the principle of covering likely mixed pathogens in this risk group [^84576b38] [^a260a350].

> For men over 35 years, or when enteric organisms are most likely and gonorrhea has been reasonably excluded, I need to check whether monotherapy is acceptable. The CDC supports levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days as empiric therapy in this scenario, with the caveat to obtain urinalysis and culture to guide therapy and to avoid unnecessary fluoroquinolone exposure when STI risk is nontrivial; AAFP similarly endorses fluoroquinolone monotherapy in older men with low STI risk [^84576b38] [^7dd636c1] [^0542abca].

> But wait, what if ceftriaxone is unavailable or contraindicated? I should double-check alternatives. The CDC lists gentamicin 240 mg IM once plus azithromycin 2 g orally once as an alternative regimen for gonorrhea, with the note to treat for chlamydia if not excluded; however, this alternative is less preferred for epididymitis because doxycycline's tissue penetration and proven efficacy for chlamydia make the ceftriaxone–doxycycline regimen superior in this syndrome, so I should reserve the gentamicin–azithromycin option for situations where ceftriaxone cannot be used and coordinate with infectious diseases when possible [^adf84f24] [^84576b38].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In men with HIV, uncomplicated epididymitis should be treated the same as in those without HIV, though clinicians should remain vigilant for atypical pathogens; in children and adolescents, many cases are inflammatory or post-infectious rather than bacterial, so antibiotics should be reserved for those with pyuria or positive cultures, and routine empiric therapy is often unnecessary; in suspected TB or brucellosis, standard antituberculous or brucellosis regimens are indicated rather than routine urologic antibiotics [^a51258eb] [^e58939ee] [^45f0dbd6] [^0f330244] [^8a1f6581].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting. Patients should be instructed to return if symptoms do not improve within 72 hours; persistent pain or swelling after completing therapy warrants re-evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as abscess, tumor, infarction, or fungal infection; all patients with suspected STI-associated epididymitis should be screened for HIV and syphilis, and sexual partners within the prior 60 days should be notified, tested, and presumptively treated to prevent reinfection and transmission [^eada4d67] [^f092d4d0] [^0d3401dc] [^0f6d4a6e].

> Hold on, I should verify supportive care and counseling points. Bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs are recommended adjuncts until fever and local inflammation resolve, and patients should abstain from sexual activity until they and their partners have completed treatment and symptoms have resolved; I should also emphasize that complete resolution of discomfort may take weeks after antibiotics, which helps set expectations and reduce premature changes in therapy [^2f7da457] [^f092d4d0] [^c2f98726].

> I will now examine antimicrobial stewardship and resistance considerations. Given rising gonococcal resistance and the potential for fluoroquinolone resistance in enteric organisms, empiric therapy should be as narrow as the clinical scenario allows, with cultures guiding de-escalation; in regions with high fluoroquinolone resistance among uropathogens, levofloxacin monotherapy for presumed enteric disease may be less reliable, reinforcing the need to obtain cultures when feasible and to reassess if there is no early clinical response [^c9a713d1] [^b38324e7] [^84576b38].

> Let me synthesize a concise, scenario-based answer. There is no single "antibiotic of choice" for all-comers; treatment must be tailored: for sexually active men under 35 or with STI risk, use ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days; for men who practice insertive anal intercourse or when mixed STI and enteric infection is suspected, use ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) plus levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days; for men over 35 or when enteric infection is most likely and gonorrhea is excluded, use levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days, with urinalysis and culture to direct therapy and close follow-up if symptoms persist beyond 72 hours [^84576b38] [^46215beb] [^a260a350] [^7dd636c1].

---

The antibiotic of choice for epididymitis depends on the likely pathogen and patient risk factors [^d14a1c9c]. For **sexually active men under 35 years**, use **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** [^46215beb] plus **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days** to cover gonorrhea and chlamydia [^84576b38]. For **men over 35 years or with urinary tract abnormalities**, use **levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days** [^7dd636c1] to target enteric organisms [^84576b38]. For **men who practice insertive anal intercourse**, use **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** [^a260a350] plus **levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days** to cover both STI and enteric pathogens [^84576b38]. Adjust therapy based on culture results and clinical response [^2533a47c], and ensure partner treatment and follow-up if symptoms persist [^f092d4d0].

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** |
|-|-|
| Sexually active men < 35 years or with STI risk | Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once [^46215beb] + doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days [^84576b38] |
| Men > 35 years or with urinary tract abnormalities | Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days [^7dd636c1] [^84576b38] |
| Men who practice insertive anal intercourse | Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once [^a260a350] + levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days [^84576b38] |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Presumptive therapy**: Initiate antibiotics at the visit before lab results to prevent complications and transmission [^825591f0] [^09b03a6c].
- **Partner management**: Sex partners of patients with STI-associated epididymitis should be notified, tested, and treated [^0f6d4a6e] [^91bdd048].
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate if symptoms persist beyond 3 days or worsen [^eada4d67] [^f092d4d0].

---

## Special considerations

- **Fluoroquinolone resistance**: Increasing resistance limits use; reserve for appropriate cases and consider local resistance patterns [^c9a713d1] [^b38324e7].
- **Alternative regimens**: If ceftriaxone is unavailable, gentamicin 240 mg IM once plus azithromycin 2 g orally once may be used [^adf84f24].
- **Chronic epididymitis**: Manage differently, often requiring prolonged therapy and specialist referral [^5f20af2f] [^169cfb60].

---

The antibiotic of choice for epididymitis is **pathogen-specific**: ceftriaxone plus doxycycline for STI risk, levofloxacin for enteric risk, and combination therapy for mixed risk, with adjustments based on culture and clinical response [^84576b38].

Objective

Acute epididymitis is increasing in men aged 35 years or under due to sexually-transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis. This study examines whether Urological surgeons are following European guidelines for the management of acute epididymitis in these patients.

Methods

A postal questionnaire survey was conducted of specialists in Urology in two regions of the UK.

Results

Of 79 completed replies, 41 (52%) take a detailed sexual history but only 34 (43%) refer patients to a Genitourinary medicine clinic. Quinolones are the most commonly prescribed first-line antibiotic by 56 (71%) respondents, principally ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

The current management of acute epididymitis in young men must be improved. Ciprofloxacin is not the optimal antimicrobial for the treatment of urogenital chlamydial infection. We recommend that all such patients be referred to local Genitourinary medicine services for contact-tracing and treatment of their sexual partners.

### Epididymitis: an overview [^958d20ed]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the epididymis, or epididymitis, is commonly seen in the outpatient setting. Etiology and treatment are based on patient age and the likely causative organisms. Epididymitis presents as the gradual onset of posterior scrotal pain that may be accompanied by urinary symptoms such as dysuria and urinary frequency. Physical findings include a swollen and tender epididymis with the testis in an anatomically normal position. Although the etiology is largely unknown, reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts is considered the most common cause of epididymitis in children younger than 14 years. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common pathogens in sexually active males 14 to 35 years of age, and a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone with 10 days of oral doxycycline is the treatment of choice in this age group. In men who practice insertive anal intercourse, an enteric organism is also likely, and ceftriaxone with 10 days of oral levofloxacin or ofloxacin is the recommended treatment regimen. In men older than 35 years, epididymitis is usually caused by enteric bacteria transported by reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts secondary to bladder outlet obstruction; levofloxacin or ofloxacin alone is sufficient to treat these infections. Because untreated acute epididymitis can lead to infertility and chronic scrotal pain, recognition and therapy are vital to reduce patient morbidity.

### Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview [^3605ef6d]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Epididymitis and orchitis are commonly seen in the outpatient setting. Men between 14 and 35 years of age are most often affected, and Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most common pathogens in this age group. In other age groups, coliform bacteria are the primary pathogens. Men with epididymitis and orchitis typically present with a gradual onset of scrotal pain and symptoms of lower urinary tract infection, including fever. This presentation helps differentiate epididymitis and orchitis from testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Typical physical findings include a swollen, tender epididymis or testis located in the normal anatomic position with an intact ipsilateral cremasteric reflex. Laboratory studies, including urethral Gram stain, urinalysis and culture, and polymerase chain reaction assay for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, help guide therapy. Initial outpatient therapy is empirical and targets the most common pathogens. When C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae are suspected, ceftriaxone and doxycycline are recommended. When coliform bacteria are suspected, ofloxacin or levofloxacin is recommended.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^825591f0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute epididymitis — presumptive therapy and care setting: To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before laboratory test results are available, and selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen, and age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization.

### Diagnosis and management of epididymitis [^ef8e64f8]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common and morbid condition seen across a wide age range. There are multiple etiologies that may lead to inflammation of the epididymis, including infection, trauma, autoimmune disease, and vasculitis. Although there have been multiple advances in imaging of the scrotum and detection of urinary pathogens, a large portion of cases remain idiopathic. Management of epididymitis is often difficult, but relies on clinical expertise and the use of established clinical guidelines.

Treatment

To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g. infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g. torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization.

Recommended Regimens for Epididymitis
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose

Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex): Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Levofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and gonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Treatment should be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur for a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.

Other Management Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

### Acute epididymitis revisited: impact of molecular diagnostics on etiology and contemporary guideline recommendations [^53e95a56]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute epididymitis is a common infectious disease of unknown etiology in about 30% of cases with guidelines based on studies published > 15 yr ago.

Objective

To investigate the etiology of acute epididymitis using state-of-the-art methods and to provide rational data for antimicrobial therapy and clinical management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Between 2007 and 2013, 237 patients (150 antimicrobially naive and 87 antibiotically pretreated) with acute epididymitis underwent comprehensive investigation comprising microbiologic cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) analysis, and PCR detection of 23 viruses. Clinical management followed international guidelines.

Outcome Measures and Statistical Analysis

Etiology, clinical management, and outcome after 3 mo were assessed.

Results and Limitations

A causative pathogen, predominantly Escherichia coli (56%), was identified in 132 antibiotic-naive patients (88%) and 44 pretreated patients (51%); 16S rDNA analysis increased the detection rate by 10%. STIs were present in 34 cases (14%) (25 patients with Chlamydia trachomatis) and were not restricted to a specific age group. Enteroviruses were found in only two patients (1%). In naive patients, cultured bacteria were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and group 3 cephalosporins in > 85% of cases (preateted patients: 42% and 67%, respectively). Primary empirical therapy was continued in 88% of naive patients for 11 d and in 77% of pretreated patients for 13 d with indwelling urinary catheters, rendering patients as high risk for switching. Only six patients (2.5%) underwent semicastration. Prostate-specific antigen levels halved within 3 mo, except in patients who were antibiotic naive and without detected pathogens. Study limitations included a lack of susceptibility testing in cases of STIs.

Conclusions

Even in antimicrobially pretreated patients, acute epididymitis is mainly of bacterial origin. STIs are not limited to patients aged < 35 yr. Viral epididymitis seems a rare condition. Current guideline recommendations on empirical antimicrobial therapy are adequate.

Patient Summary

Patients with acute epididymitis should receive appropriate diagnostics and antimicrobial therapy for safe conservative management.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- acute epididymitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis lasting < 6 weeks

- sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis

- acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (such as C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma genitalium) or enteric organisms (such as E. coli)

- acute epididymitis caused by STIs is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic

- acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur in males who are the insertive partner during anal sex

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (such as BPH)

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis in older males is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^91bdd048]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute sexually transmitted epididymitis — management of sex partners: Men with acute sexually transmitted epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners during the previous 60 days before symptom onset for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment. If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated, and arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. Expedited partner therapy (EPT) is an effective strategy for treating sex partners when linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed, and partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are treated and symptoms have resolved.

### Are antibiotics necessary for pediatric epididymitis? [^e58939ee]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the percentage of cases of epididymitis in pediatric patients that is of bacterial cause and to identify factors that predict a positive urine culture.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis in 1 pediatric emergency department for 11 years. Charts were reviewed for historical, physical, laboratory, and radiologic data. A positive urine culture was used to identify patients with a bacterial cause of epididymitis.

Results

A total of 160 patient records were initially identified as having a diagnosis of epididymitis; of these, 20 met exclusion criteria or did not have records available for review and 140 cases of epididymitis were reviewed. Patients' age ranged from 2 months to 17 years, with a median age of 11 years. Of these patients, 91% received empiric antibiotic therapy. Also, of these patients, 97 (69%) had a urine culture sent, of whom 4 (4.1%; 95% confidence interval, 1.1%-10.2%) were positive. Of the 4 positive urine cultures, 3 had organisms not sensitive to usual empiric therapy for urinary tract infections. The boys with positive urine cultures were not significantly different from the other patients in age, maximum temperature, or number of white blood cells on urinalysis.

Conclusions

Given the low incidence of urinary tract infections in boys with epididymitis, in prepubertal patients, antibiotic therapy can be reserved for young infants and those with pyuria or positive urine cultures. Because it is difficult to predict which patients will have a positive urine culture, urine cultures should be sent on all pediatric patients with epididymitis.

### Common patterns and unique threats in antimicrobial resistance as demonstrated by global gonococcal surveillance [^c9a713d1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections cause substantial illness globally, and control is challenged by increasing antimicrobial resistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 82.4 million new N. gonorrhoeae infections worldwide among persons 15–49 years of age. In the United States, an estimated 1.5 million new cases of gonorrhea are reported each year.

Gonococcal urogenital tract infections can cause severe complications, especially in women, who are often asymptomatic and go undiagnosed. Untreated cervical infections can cause upper genital tract disease, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy, and also increases the risk for tubal infertility. Urethral infections in men can ascend to cause epididymitis or orchitis; however, unlike cervical infections, urethral infections are usually symptomatic. The resulting discharge and dysuria increase the likelihood that male patients will seek testing and treatment.

Effective infection control is challenged by underdiagnosis of asymptomatic infections, lack of point-of-care diagnostics, and increasing persistent antimicrobial resistance. N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all antibiotic drugs that have been used for routine treatment because of its ability to readily acquire genes through horizontal gene transfer or spontaneous mutations. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within N. gonorrhoeae strains has steadily increased across the antibiotic era, necessitating frequent changes in treatment recommendations. The initial emergence of high-level penicillin and tetracycline resistance was followed by the introduction of fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea treatment in the mid-1980s, which were subsequently removed from treatment in 2007. Dual therapy using extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) and azithromycin then became the primary recommended therapy for a decade. Azithromycin was removed in 2021 because of increasing resistance, leaving only ESCs for first-line treatment of gonorrhea. Globally, ceftriaxone is the sole remaining primary therapy for first-line treatment of gonorrhea in most guidelines. However, isolates with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone have proliferated worldwide, and multidrug-resistant, ceftriaxone-resistant strains have been reported in several countries, threatening simple outpatient therapy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^dcd34fa5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute epididymitis — diagnostic considerations and testing: For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available, and ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord; although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis and a negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following point-of-care (POC) tests: Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating ≥ 2 WBCs per oil immersion field, positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine, or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF. All suspected cases should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT, and urine is the preferred specimen for NAAT for men; urine cultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are insensitive and are not recommended, whereas urine bacterial cultures should also be performed for all men to evaluate for the presence of genitourinary organisms and to determine antibiotic susceptibility.

### Evaluating the necessity of antibiotics in the treatment of acute epididymitis in pediatric patients: a literature review of retrospective studies and data analysis [^45f0dbd6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This literature review and data analysis aims to evaluate the percentage of pediatric patients with acute epididymitis found to have bacterial etiology and the percentage of patients in these studies that were treated with antibiotic therapy versus conservative therapy.

Methods

A search of EBSCO through January 13, 2016, using the key words epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis and child, children, or pediatric, identified 542 potential studies. Twenty-seven retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria, containing patients aged 21 years or younger with acute epididymitis or epididymoorchitis. The number and age of patients, urine cultures and urinalysis results, number of patients treated with antibiotics, and incidence were extracted.

Results

A total of 1496 patients with acute epididymitis were identified. A urinalysis was obtained for 1124 patients, and 190 (16.9%) were positive. Aurine culturewas obtained for 670 patients, and 100 (14.9%) were positive. Fourteen studies addressed antibiotic administration wherein 652 patients were with acute epididymitis and 554 (85%) received antibiotics. Of 502 patients with urinalysis results, urine culture results, and antibiotic treatment rates, 54 (10.8%) were positive for a bacterial source. Antibiotics were administered to 410 (81.7%) of these 502 patients.

Conclusions

Practitioners should consider only prescribing antibiotics to patients with acute epididymitis if there is an abnormal urinalysis or urine culture.

2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients

● The usual dosage of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours.

● In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

● For certain selected specific indications, the recommended duration or dosage and duration of doxycycline hyclate tablets in adult patients are as follows:

Streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 7 days.
Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice-a-day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.
Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) caused by C. trachomatis and U. urealyticum: 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 7 days.
Syphilis - early: Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be treated with doxycycline 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 2 weeks.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults

The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

Pediatric Patients:

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g. anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.

When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS)

If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.

Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections in Adults (Except Anorectal Infections in Men)

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

Acute Epididymo-orchitis Caused by N. gonorrhoeae

### Clinical factors associated with accurate presumptive treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in men who have sex with men and transgender women [^c794cde1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) infection is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States, after Chlamydia trachomatis, contributes to serious health complications including epididymitis and increases the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) if left untreated.

The estimated N. gonorrhoeae case rate among MSM in the United States increased 375.5% between 2010 and 2018. Although trends are difficult to assess among transgender women due to lack of surveillance data inclusive of gender identity, recent studies demonstrate alarmingly high rates of N. gonorrhoeae infection among transgender women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend presumptive antibiotic treatment prior to a finalized laboratory result for patients with objective clinical evidence of N. gonorrhoeae infection, a known exposure, or those who are symptomatic and unlikely to follow up for treatment. These guidelines are based on the fact that presumptive N. gonorrhoeae treatment reduces the need for a patient to return at a later date for treatment, hastens symptom resolution, and prevents further transmission. Unfortunately, presumptive treatment faces growing concerns over antibiotic resistance. According to the CDC, more than half of all N. gonorrhoeae infections in 2018 were estimated to be resistant to at least one antibiotic. Overtreating uninfected patients may promote antibiotic resistance.

It is well established that antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat and that research and policies aimed at optimizing antibiotic treatment are needed. This study aims to provide data on presumptive N. gonorrhoeae treatment practices by identifying clinical factors associated with accurate presumptive treatment of N. gonorrhoeae among MSM and transgender women in STI testing clinics in California and Florida, 2 states that reported the highest and fourth-highest number of N. gonorrhoeae cases in 2018, respectively.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^84e54eca]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Follow-Up

Men should be instructed to return to their health care providers if their symptoms do not improve < 72 hours after treatment. Signs and symptoms of epididymitis that do not subside in < 3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and therapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that persist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, infarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.

Management of Sex Partners

Men who have acute sexually transmitted epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners during the previous 60 days before symptom onset for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT is an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who have or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for whom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are treated and symptoms have resolved.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

The risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, clinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such regimens are required.

HIV Infection

Men with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute epididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. Other etiologic agents have been implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV, including CMV, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima polymorpha.

Acute epididymo-orchitis caused by C. trachomatis: 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.

Inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): ADULTS: 100 mg of doxycycline, by mouth, twice a day for 60 days. CHILDREN: weighing less than 100 pounds (45 kg); 1 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg) of body weight, by mouth, twice a day for 60 days. Children weighing 100 pounds or more should receive the adult dose.

When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .) If gastric irritation occurs, doxycycline may be given with food. Ingestion of a high fat meal has been shown to delay the time to peak plasma concentrations by an average of one hour and 20 minutes. However, in the same study, food enhanced the average peak concentration by 7.5% and the area under the curve by 5.7%.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2be4e0aa]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^b471d2d1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following POC tests:

Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating ≥ 2 WBCs per oil immersion field (see Urethritis). These stains are preferred POC diagnostic tests for evaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethral inflammation and presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBC-containing intracellular gram-negative or purple diplococci on urethral Gram, MB, or GV stain, respectively.
Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.
Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF.

All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT. Urine is the preferred specimen for NAAT for men. Urine cultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are insensitive and are not recommended. Urine bacterial cultures should also be performed for all men to evaluate for the presence of genitourinary organisms and to determine antibiotic susceptibility.

### Gentamicin compared with ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea (G-ToG): a randomised non-inferiority trial [^fbe875cc]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Each year gonorrhoea accounts for over 40 000 infections in the UK and around 78 million infections globally, with a disproportionate burden in young adults, men who have sex with men, and specific ethnic groups. Infection leads to local inflammation causing genital pain and discomfort, and localised immune activation that facilitates the acquisition and transmission of HIV. For women, infection can spread to the fallopian tubes and ovaries causing pelvic inflammatory disease with resultant tubal scarring, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. For men, infection can spread to the testicles leading to epididymo-orchitis, and men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of proctitis, which can lead to abscess and fistula formation.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Two systematic reviews evaluated the efficacy of gentamicin for the treatment of gonorrhoea. They included randomised trials, quasi-randomised trials, and prospective studies with concurrent controls published between Jan 1, 1950, and June 2, 2014. We also searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 12, 2017, using the terms "gonorrhoea/gonorrhea/Neisseria gonorrhoeae" and "gentamicin". In total, six studies assessed single-dose gentamicin treatment, of which three were randomised trials, one was quasi-randomised, and two were non-randomised. Cure rates of 62% to 100% were reported with gentamicin treatment. Methodology was poorly described and there was a high risk of bias within most studies. The largest and best quality study was a non-comparative evaluation of 157 patients, which reported that gentamicin cured 100% of infections. This study used a relatively less sensitive culture technique to diagnose and assess cure, and included few extra-genital gonorrhoea infections (ten pharyngeal, one rectal). Gentamicin was administered with a 2 g dose of azithromycin. The combined regimen was poorly tolerated, causing nausea in 26% of patients and vomiting in 10%.

### Epididymitis after prostate brachytherapy [^9adf7f67]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To analyze the incidence, time-course, and potential predisposing factors for what was clinically diagnosed as postimplant epididymitis.

Methods

Of 517 patients randomized and treated on two treatment protocols, with a planned total accrual of 1200, 5 patients were identified who developed clinically diagnosed epididymitis after iodine-125 or pallidium-103 prostate brachytherapy. Implants were performed by standard techniques, using a modified peripheral loading pattern. Perioperative antibiotics (cefazolin and ciprofloxacin) were given to 258 patients, according to physician preference. Treatment-related morbidity was monitored by mailed questionnaires, using standard American Urological Association (AUA) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients who did not respond to the mailed questionnaires were interviewed by telephone. Although the patients were not queried specifically regarding epididymitis, its occurrence was noted when discovered in the course of follow-up examinations.

Results

Postimplant epididymitis occurred in 5 (1%) of 517 consecutive brachytherapy patients. None of the 5 patients had had a prior history of orchitis, epididymitis, vasectomy, or preimplant catheterization. The symptoms of epididymitis first appeared at 4, 7, 10, 150, and 300 days after implantation. Patients with epididymitis had prostate volumes, preimplant AUA scores, and ages typical of other implant patients. No association was apparent between postimplant epididymitis and the degree of implant-related prostate swelling or the number of seeds implanted. Only the preimplant AUA score predicted for epididymitis, but 2 of the 5 patients had low scores. Only 1 (0.4%) of the 258 patients who received perioperative antibiotics developed epididymitis, and 4 (1.5%) of the 259 patients with prophylactic antibiotics developed epididymitis.

Conclusions

Epididymitis is an uncommon postimplant complication occurring in 1% of a large patient cohort. That epididymitis patients had greater preimplant AUA scores is consistent with a retrograde infection route, at least in some cases.

### The challenges in diagnosing isolated epididymal tuberculosis (TB) in an adolescent male: a case report [^0f330244]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

The definitive diagnosis of epididymal TB is based on bacteriological confirmation and histopathology results of the lesions, but implementation in the clinical field has proven to be a challenge. The limitation of this case report is that we did not perform an open biopsy on this patient due to clinical consideration that there was an improvement after the intensive phase of ATT. In addition, urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) not performed following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommended the test for only HIV patients. TB should be suspected in cases of gradual chronic epididymitis that does not respond to antibiotics, specifically when the testicle US results support already established features. Treatment with quadruple ATT for 6–9 months should be the first choice in the management of simple epididymal TB. Complications can include infertility, sexual dysfunction, and renal failure, hence, long-term monitoring may be needed, specifically when among children.

### Gentamicin compared with ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea (G-ToG): a randomised non-inferiority trial [^77b94531]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

G-ToG was a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment with gentamicin to treatment with ceftriaxone for patients with gonorrhoea. The trial took place at 14 sexual health clinics in England. Ethics approval was obtained from the Health Research Authority South Central–Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (14/SC/1030). The study protocol is available online.

Adults aged 16–70 years were eligible for participation if they had a diagnosis of untreated genital, pharyngeal, or rectal gonorrhoea (ie, they had not received any antibiotic in the previous 28 days that could have treated gonorrhoea, either partially or completely). To reflect normal practice, all patients who had an initial positive test for gonorrhoea and presented for treatment were eligible for inclusion. Diagnosis was based on detection of intracellular Gram-negative diplococci by microscopy (urethral, cervical, vaginal, or rectal specimens), or by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from first void urine, urethral, endocervical, vulvovaginal, pharyngeal or rectal swabs. Any licensed NAAT test platform result was accepted for assessing eligibility for inclusion into the trial. Exclusion criteria were known concurrent bacterial sexually transmitted infections apart from chlamydia; known bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis infection; known contraindications or allergy to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, or lidocaine; complicated gonorrhoea infection, for example pelvic inflammatory disease or epididymo-orchitis; and patient weight being less than 40 kg. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were also excluded. Patients were only eligible to participate in the trial once. They provided written informed consent at their initial consultation.

### Chlamydia trachomatis infections: screening, diagnosis, and management [^80e1c5ff]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the columnar epithelium of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, as well as nongenital sites such as the lungs and eyes. The bacterium is the cause of the most frequently reported sexually transmitted disease in the United States, which is responsible for more than 1 million infections annually. Most persons with this infection are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can result in serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis and orchitis in men. Men and women can experience chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis. Treatment of uncomplicated cases should include azithromycin or doxycycline. Screening is recommended in all women younger than 25 years, in all pregnant women, and in women who are at increased risk of infection. Screening is not currently recommended in men. In neonates and infants, the bacterium can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Adults may also experience conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia. Trachoma is a recurrent ocular infection caused by chlamydia and is endemic in the developing world.

Epididymitis

Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting < 6 weeks. Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency.

Acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e. Escherichia coli). Acute epididymitis caused by an STI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men who are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g. Fournier's gangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.

Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥ 6-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently observed with conditions associated with a granulomatous reaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common granulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be suspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent exposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious epididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is broad (e.g. trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic conditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a urologist for clinical management.

### Scrotal masses [^7ce709e8]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^faa44a22]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Additional long-term postoperative complications — epididymitis after vasectomy shows variable rates and definitions. Rates of epididymitis varied across studies, with variability likely due to different definitions and the fact that most studies did not differentiate between infectious epididymitis and non-infectious "congestive" epididymitis. Bacterial epididymitis is often confused with pain caused by distention of the epididymal tubule due to back pressure below the vasectomy site or by epididymal sperm granuloma.

### The patient with chronic epididymitis: characterization of an enigmatic syndrome [^f4d5ab8d]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide a baseline description of men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, explore relevant associations that may be important etiological factors and suggest a classification system and specific symptom assessment tool.

Materials and Methods

Men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, described as symptoms of discomfort or pain at least 3 months in duration in the scrotum, testicle or epididymis localized to 1 or each epididymis on clinical examination, completed an extensive specific clinical inventory questionnaire. Evaluation included demographics, preceding and concurrent clinical history, duration since diagnosis, associated and previous clinical associations, frequency and severity of prostatitis, voiding and sexual symptoms, specific and general quality of life, and history of investigation and/or treatment for the condition. Volunteers with no past or concurrent history of chronic epididymitis completed similar clinical inventory questionnaires.

Results

A total of 50 consecutive men 21 to 83 years old (average age 46) diagnosed with chronic epididymitis who had an average symptom duration of 4.9 years (range 0.25 to 29) were enrolled in the study. The average pain score plus or minus standard deviation was 4.7 ± 2.1 (range 0 to 10). Of the men 16% were reasonably satisfied with their quality of life. Although 66% of the patients thought about the symptoms some or a lot, in only 30% did symptoms keep them from doing the kinds of things that they would usually do. The most common previous therapies recollected by the patients were antibiotics (74%) and anti-inflammatory agents (36%). At the time of the survey 26% of the men were on some type of pain medication. There were no significant epidemiological, sexual, medical or associated factors that differentiated patients with chronic epididymitis from the 20 controls. A chronic epididymitis classification system (inflammatory, obstructive and epididymalgia) and a symptom assessment index based on assessing pain and quality of life-impact was developed.

Conclusions

This comprehensive clinical survey of men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis is the first step for defining and characterizing this particular population. Development of a classification system and symptom assessment index may direct further studies in the etiology, epidemiology and management of chronic epididymitis.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^4a500706]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^0ed52347]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical symptoms include localized pain or palpable mass in the scrotal or inguinal region, some of them with leukocytosis or fever. Acute vasitis could be classification as three groups depending on involved site: scrotal, suprascrotal, and prepubic. It can be easily confused when there is isolated site involvement. The common differential diagnoses include orchitis, epididymitis, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernia. Correct diagnosis is essential because the treatment of vasitis is via antibiotics, and operation is not required.

The diagnosis of vasitis could be a challenge by its rarity and unclear image findings. We review past reports that suggest appropriate tools include ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound can be used to exclude orchitis, epididymitis, and testicular torsion by color Doppler. Acute vasitis often reveals heterogeneous, hypoechoic spermatic cord and echogenic fat surrounding the lesions. However, ultrasound is relatively challenging to differentiate from incarcerated inguinal hernia to vasitis. CT and MRI are more recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Spiral CT has high resolution and short scanning time. Acute vasitis typically reveals unilateral edematous spermatic cord without evidence of herniated bowel loop. MRI can provide more soft tissue detail, abnormal signal intensities of inflamed or ischemic structures, with the additional benefits of no radiation exposure.

Based on the available literature, the majority of the reported vasitis can be resolved with the use of anti-inflammatories and antibiotics alone. Some authors prescribed oral antibiotics while others started with intravenous antibiotics in combination with oral antibiotics. A reported pediatric vasitis case suggested only partial regression of the inguinal swelling symptoms with 7 days of oral antibiotic use, and the patient was later admitted and treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics. Surgical exploration and drainage may be necessary in more severe cases that are not responsive to antibiotic treatment. En bloc excision of the vas deferens is uncommon and is usually performed for the exceptionally rare cases of Tuberculous vasitis. For our patient, we prescribed empirical antibiotic treatment with 500 mg of Levofloxacin once daily for two weeks. The patient's symptoms improved drastically upon the scheduled weekly follow-ups.

In summary, we present a rare case mimicking incarcerated inguinal hernia, and although vasitis is very rare, physicians should keep in mind that patients might present with similar symptoms, especially when the patient has risk factors such as previous vasectomy and concurrent leukocyturia. CT or MRI scan can play an important role to prevent unnecessary surgery.

### Human tularemia epididymo-orchitis caused by Francisella tularensis subspecies holartica, Austria [^0376f144]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In Austria, antibodies against F. tularensis are found in 0.5% of healthy adults, and annual cases range between 0 and 58. In clinically apparent infections, the most frequent manifestations of human tularemia are ulceroglandular or glandular forms. The oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, or pulmonary forms have been less frequently reported. In the case we report, the patient did not report any direct animal contact or use of unprocessed water or food during his nature filming activities. However, initial examination showed a small ulcerative lesion on the lower left back, which presumably was the initial tularemia skin lesion.

Worldwide, tularemia orchitis has been reported in hares (including 1 case with epididymo-orchitis), a squirrel, and a marmoset. Infectious human epididymo-orchitis is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma spp. Mycoplasma genitalium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacteria, as well as Staphylococcus aureus in elderly persons. Granulomatous epididymo-orchitis is rare and usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Brucella spp. Other rare etiologic agents include fungi, Shistosoma spp. or Orientia tsutsugamushi. F. tularensis has not been previously reported as a causative microorganism for epididymo-orchitis.

Patients who have epididymo-orchitis typically have acute onset unilateral scrotal pain, swelling, and erythema, and treatment with ceftriaxone combined with doxycycline or levofloxacin is recommended. Tularemia is treated with fluorochinolones, doxycycline, or aminoglycosides depending on disease severity. Our patient empirically received piperacillin/tazobactam with moxifloxacin, but moxifloxacin was discontinued after 3 days. During piperacillin/tazobactam monotherapy, CRP levels decreased, but sonography and clinical status worsened, leading to unilateral orchiectomy. We assume that the empirical application of moxifloxacin for 3 days lowered systemic inflammatory parameters but was too short for improvement of the testicular infection. Ultimately, the etiology of epididymo-orchitis could be elucidated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, which in this case led to successful directed therapy with doxycycline and moxifloxacin. Because of impaired renal function, aminoglycosides were not considered. Furthermore, serologic analysis confirmed this unusual case of tularemia.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^d78124c7]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria are increasingly able to resist antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity, deaths and costs worldwide. Antibiotic use is an important driver of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Selective pressure can be reduced by minimising antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics are often unnecessary. Moreover, the duration of antibiotic courses can often be reduced without significantly compromising cure rates. Shortening antibiotic duration can have a large impact on reducing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, including bacteria carried asymptomatically. Antibiotics are by far the most prescribed drugs for children, with more than 60 million systemic antibiotics dispensed annually in the US outpatient setting alone, and are amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs for adults.

An important challenge is that, for many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. Courses should be long enough to treat infections effectively, yet short enough to reduce the incidence of side effects and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The continued need for antibiotics can be assessed with daily reviews for inpatients; however, in practice, such reviews are not always performed or acted upon and antibiotics are often continued in order to complete currently recommended course durations. Further, in the outpatient or primary care setting, continued assessment of patients initiated on antibiotics is not feasible. Therefore, it is especially important to have strong evidence about optimal treatment durations in these settings.

Because observational studies comparing different antibiotic durations are potentially confounded by unmeasured patient factors influencing the need for prolonged treatment, evidence about the optimal treatment duration should, where possible, come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, antibiotic durations for several infections managed in primary care, such as prostatitis, are not guided by RCT evidence on optimal treatment duration. Where treatment durations have been compared in RCTs, in most cases, two treatment durations were selected for comparison, both of which lacked a clear scientific rationale. Whilst RCTs designed in this way can be useful, there are disadvantages to this approach.

Herein, we discuss the main issue with conventional two-arm trial designs, how to assess the 'optimal' antibiotic treatment duration, four alternative trial designs that can estimate much needed duration–response relationships (subsequently denoted duration–response curves), and which of these designs has the most desirable properties.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^17a0c880]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — assessment, condom counseling and provision, presumptive treatment, and scope — are detailed as follows: Assessment of behavioral and biologic risk factors is recommended at initial and subsequent visits in clinical settings providing continuing care, and in clinical or nonclinical settings that provide one-time or episodic STD services, assessment is recommended at initial encounter and when clients seek follow-up services; recalling clients specifically for risk assessment may not be feasible. In this section, the term "assess" means eliciting information about behavioral and biologic risk factors for HIV transmission, including history of STD and STD symptoms, and the term "screen" means testing for STD pathogens in persons without symptoms. This section does not address screening persons with HIV for other conditions that have not been shown to facilitate HIV transmission to others, such as viral hepatitis and human papillomavirus infection. All source guidance advises providing information or counseling about condom use; guidance from the Health Resources and Services Administration advises providing condoms to patients in publicly funded clinics. According to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, immediate presumptive treatment (or immediate linkage to such treatment) is recommended for persons who report sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or have STD syndromes in order to reduce the risk of onward STD transmission; STD syndromes are conditions that can be caused by sexually transmitted pathogens and cause symptoms or abnormal findings (signs) on physical examination, such as genital ulcer disease, urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and proctitis. The cited source guidance describes the rationale for retesting for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection; the Evidence topic describes the rationale for retesting for trichomoniasis.

### Acute epididymitis in boys: evidence of a post-infectious etiology [^ef779d33]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We studied the etiology and management of pediatric epididymitis.

Material and Methods

We performed 1-year prospective study in children with epididymitis. All patients underwent an immediate sonographic study of the scrotum. Microbiological studies included throat and urine cultures as well as viral cultures of nasopharyngeal and stool specimens. Serological tests for group A streptococcus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as for enteroviruses, adenoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses in the appropriate seasons were performed in patients and controls.

Results

A total of 44 patients 2 to 14 years old (mean age 9.8 ± 3.2) were studied. Hospital admissions peaked during the summer and winter. The incidence of epididymitis was around 1.2/1,000 boys yearly. One patient had familial Mediterranean fever and another had Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Microbiological studies of the urine, throat, nasopharynx and stool yielded bacterial/viral growth in 9 patients (20.4%). Serological studies revealed significantly elevated titers to certain pathogens in patients with epididymitis compared with controls, including M. pneumoniae (53% vs 20%), enteroviruses (62.5% vs 10%) and adenoviruses (20% vs 0%). Most patients were treated with analgesics and 3 patients received antibiotics intravenously. Systemic and local signs and symptoms resolved gradually in 1 to 7 days.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that epididymitis in boys is not rare and it is mostly an inflammatory phenomenon (presumably post-infectious) with a benign course. The treatment of these patients is basically with analgesics with a little role for antibiotics.

### Case report: epididymo-orchitis due to… [^4d738845]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary tuberculosis (TB) is a rare but well-described form of extrapulmonary TB. We present a case of a 35-year-old man from Ethiopia with scrotal swelling and fever who was found to have epididymo-orchitis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient presented to the hospital multiple times before undergoing operative debridement with fine needle aspiration and tissue biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. He improved with antituberculous therapy. Patients with TB risk factors presenting with epididymitis that is refractory to empiric antibiotic therapy warrant consideration of TB epididymitis. Our case demonstrates the high index of suspicion required to establish a diagnosis of genitourinary TB.

### Epididymoorchitis due to Brucella mellitensis: a retrospective study of 59 patients [^8a1f6581]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Epididymoorchitis is a focal form of human brucellosis described in 2%-20% of patients with brucellosis. We assessed 59 cases of Brucella epididymoorchitis (BEO) between 1991 and 1999. The median age of patients was 34 years (range, 15–75 years). The onset of symptoms was acute in 46 patients (78%). Scrotal pain and swelling (100% of patients), fever (88%), and sweating (73%) were the most common symptoms. Brucella species was isolated from blood cultures in 41 patients (69%) and from epididymal aspiration in 4 patients. Treatment consisted of a combination of a doxycycline and an aminoglycoside (n = 39) or rifampin (n = 10); trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with rifampin (n = 3); or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as monotherapy (n = 7). The median duration of therapy was 45 days (range, 21–90 days). The infections of 9 patients (15%) failed to respond to therapy, and 15 patients relapsed (25%). Three patients with necrotizing orchitis whose infections were unresponsive to antibiotics required an orchiectomy. In general, classical brucellosis therapy is adequate for BEO.

### Acute epididymo-orchitis fromin Australia [^2e973d6c]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Brucellosis epididymo-orchitis (BEO) is extremely rare in non-endemic areas such as Australia. While epididymo-orchitis is relatively common in adolescent men, when presented with a significant travel history, consideration should be given to rare causes such as this. Here, we present a case of BEO in a young 18-year-old man who recently migrated from Greece, with symptoms of acute scrotal pain, swelling and persistent fever. Brucella melitensis was isolated in the blood culture and confirmed with PCR. We suspect transmission was related to ingestion of unpasteurised goat dairy products. He made a full recovery after 7days of intravenous gentamicin and 6weeks of oral doxycycline. BEO should be considered in those who present with acute scrotal pain and fever after a recent history of travel to or from a brucellosis- endemic area.

### Brucellosis in dogs and public health risk [^ada3d465]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Manifestations in Dogs

The clinical signs of B. canis infection are not pathognomonic. Dogs may be subclinically affected or may exhibit signs of reproductive failure. In male dogs, B. canis causes epididymitis, prostatitis, and orchitis; chronic testicular and epididymal inflammation can lead to unilateral or bilateral testicular atrophy and infertility.

The typical manifestation in females is mid- to late-term abortion (during days 45–59), followed by an odorless, brown-to-yellow vaginal discharge for 1–6 weeks. Another manifestation is embryonic death with resorption, which appears as conception failure after an apparently successful mating. It is possible for an infected bitch to abort and subsequently have normal pregnancies or intermittently experience reproductive failure; these dogs may serve as reservoirs for infection in B. canis –naive dogs. Aborted pups have nonspecific lesions, such as subcutaneous edema, hemorrhage, or congestion. Pups from infected bitches that survive may be infected in utero or through nursing and can be bacteremic yet appear healthy. It is possible for seemingly healthy puppies from an infected bitch to disseminate the bacteria to other dogs and to humans. Because B. canis infection is the most common cause of reproductive failure in dogs, it should be ruled out before investigating other causes of infertility or abortion. However, if reproductive failure is not documented, canine brucellosis can be difficult to diagnose.

Another well-recognized manifestation of infection with B. canis is diskospondylitis, which can occur in otherwise healthy dogs or in those with a history of reproductive failure that was treated with antimicrobial drugs. Infected dogs have a history of lameness, spinal pain, neurologic dysfunction, muscle weakness, or any combination of these signs, caused by vertebral osteomyelitis and intervertebral disc infection. Incidence of diskospondylitis is higher in male than female dogs, perhaps because of a reservoir of bacteria in the prostate that results in intermittent bacteremia even in castrated males.

Antimicrobial drug treatment alone after signs of reproductive failure is usually unsuccessful because of the ability of the bacteria to sequester intracellularly for long periods and cause episodic bacteremia. The recommended course of treatment is multimodal and includes surgical sterilization and antimicrobial drugs.

Evaluation of STD-Related Conditions

Genital ulcer disease can be caused by syphilis, HSV, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The more common sexually transmitted causes of male urethritis syndrome can include gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, trichomoniasis, and HSV. Diseases characterized by vaginal discharge as a result of vaginitis can include bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and candidiasis. The causes of epididymitis, pharyngitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can include gonorrhea and chlamydia. Most genital warts are caused by nononcogenic HPV types. However, on occasion, oncogenic types can be found in genital warts. Proctitis can be caused by gonorrhea, LGV serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, syphilis, and HSV. Ectoparasitic infections typically include pediculosis pubis and scabies. Systemic or dermatologic conditions compatible with or suggestive of an STD can include disseminated gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, condylomata lata, or palmar plantar syphilitic rash. STD-related conditions warrant prompt evaluation of signs and symptoms to make an accurate diagnosis and provide timely empiric treatment to prevent complications and onward transmission. Patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of an STD etiology (genital ulcer disease, urethritis, vaginal discharge, PID, epididymitis, pharyngitis, genital warts, proctitis, ectoparasitic infections, or certain systemic or dermatologic conditions) should be evaluated.

Recommendations for the STD-related conditions that should be evaluated are summarized (Box 5). Additional information on these recommendations is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

BOX 5
Evaluation of sexually transmitted disease–related conditions recommendations in primary care and sexually transmitted diseases specialty care settings*

Abbreviations: PID = pelvic inflammatory disease; STD = sexually transmitted disease.

* Primary care setting is defined as a place where patients are evaluated for various health conditions. STD specialty care setting is defined as a place where the focus is on providing patients with timely, comprehensive, confidential, and culturally sensitive STD care. STD care delivered in STD specialty care settings includes all care delivered in primary care settings.

† Evaluation for proctitis might include visual examination of the anus, anorectal examination with a rectal swab, digital anorectal exam, or anoscopy. For specialized STD care, high-resolution anoscopy might be included.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^ed6b41b6]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended — both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figs S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity. In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

### High prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant UTI among US emergency department patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection, 2018–2020 [^b38324e7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We conducted a multi‐center, retrospective observational cohort study at 15 geographically diverse, US hospital EDs, that participate in the Emergency Medicine PHARMacotherapy Research NETwork (EMPHARM‐NET) (see Figure 1 for full site listings). Patients were identified based on primary diagnosis of uncomplicated or complicated cystitis and uncomplicated or complicated pyelonephritis using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐10 codes: ICD‐10, N30.00, N30.01, and N39.0 between January 1st, 2018 – December 31st, 2020. All patients ≥ 18 years of age who had a primary or secondary diagnosis of UTI in the ED, reported symptoms of a UTI, and had a urine culture obtained in the ED were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy; suspected or confirmed acute bacterial prostatitis; orchitis, epididymitis; or chronic bacterial prostatitis as determined by history and/or physical examination; gross hematuria requiring intervention other than administration of antibiotics for UTI or removal or exchange of a urinary catheter; and urinary tract surgery within 7 days prior to ED presentation. Patients could only have one ED visit included in the study with subsequent visits being excluded in the study population.

Data Collection

All data variables were defined a priori and were available for abstraction from the electronic medical record (EMR). Data collected included patient‐specific characteristics (e.g. age, sex, past medical history, laboratory results), signs and symptoms (e.g. fever, dysuria, flank pain, frequency/urgency) of UTI, risk factors for antimicrobial resistance, ED disposition, and urine microbiological results and susceptibilities. Data were abstracted at each site by the principal investigator (PI) or by a trained data abstractor with an audit of a random sample of charts (~10%) completed to ensure that abstractor entries were accurate and complete. All site institutional review boards approved the study. The study is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. We used REDCap© electronic‐data capture tool (Version 6.18.1, 2019; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) hosted by the University of Iowa to manage all study data.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor-associated severe epididymo-orchitis [^ca842e78]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his late 50s, with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and morbid obesity, presented to the hospital with complicated epididymo-orchitis. The onset of symptoms (scrotal pain, erythema and swelling) occurred after the use of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, for 2months. His baseline antidiabetic medications were insulin, glipizide and metformin. Initially, he had failed treatment of epididymo-orchitis with oral levofloxacin for 3weeks, followed by 2weeks of doxycycline therapy. At the presentation to the hospital, an ultrasound of the scrotum revealed scrotal and right testicular abscess. The patient underwent right inguinal orchiectomy. Postoperatively, pus culture was positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Candida glabrata, and hence, he was treated with oral antibiotics including high-dose antifungal medications. Adequate wound care and regular follow-up demonstrated resolution of infection. This case highlights the risk of severe urogenital infection associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the setting of uncontrolled T2DM.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7aa8b999]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are among the most common sexually transmitted infections in the US. Infection rates are highest among adolescents and young adults of both sexes. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are usually asymptomatic and may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and its associated complications. Newborns of pregnant persons with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection in men may lead to urethritis and epididymitis. Both types of infection can increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

Population

Asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. (I statement).
