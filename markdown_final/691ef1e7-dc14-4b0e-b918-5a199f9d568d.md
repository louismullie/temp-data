## Question

Patient have diarrhea, which has mucus. What does that mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when a patient has diarrhea with mucus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal role of intestinal mucus and why it might increase in disease. Then, I should categorize the likely etiologies by pathophysiology and duration of symptoms. Next, I will review red flags and when to escalate testing. After that, I should outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach, including when to use stool testing and when to proceed to endoscopy. Finally, I will consider initial management principles and when empiric therapy is appropriate, while verifying where guidelines agree or diverge and correcting any missteps as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of mucus in stool. Mucus is normally produced by goblet cells to form a protective barrier over the intestinal epithelium; increased mucus in diarrheal stools typically reflects goblet cell hypersecretion and/or mucosal inflammation, and is commonly seen with colitis of infectious, inflammatory, or drug-induced etiologies, so its presence should raise suspicion for inflammatory diarrhea rather than purely secretory or osmotic processes [^114pSMHQ] [^117GapF2] [^111GRpsa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize by pathophysiology. Infectious inflammatory causes include bacterial pathogens such as Shigella, Campylobacter, and enteroaggregative E. coli, which can provoke mucosal injury and mucus production, and parasitic infections such as amebiasis; viral gastroenteritis is typically watery and non-mucoid, though some viruses can perturb mucus dynamics, so mucus still leans toward a bacterial or parasitic etiology rather than viral in most acute settings [^112XuboH] [^111GRpsa] [^111x76qh] [^116VQxuV].

> I need to check noninfectious inflammatory causes next. Ulcerative colitis classically presents with bloody diarrhea with mucus, urgency, and tenesmus, and mucus can persist even during remission; Crohn's disease can also feature mucus, though less consistently; immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis produces diarrhea with mucus and/or blood and can be severe; and medication-induced colitis, including with agents like clindamycin, can present with mucus-laden stools in antibiotic-associated colitis, so I should always review drugs carefully [^111GRpsa] [^112z53s3] [^111yTj1v] [^117XSP5Z].

> But wait, what if the diarrhea is chronic and watery with mucus and minimal inflammation? I should consider functional disorders. IBS with diarrhea can include passage of mucus and is a diagnosis of exclusion after alarm features are absent; microscopic colitis can present with chronic watery diarrhea and mucus and is more common in older adults, particularly women; and bile acid diarrhea can mimic these features, so I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on IBS without excluding these entities [^112Rbjc6] [^11232DYU].

> Next, I should review duration to refine the differential. Acute mucoid diarrhea under 14 days most often reflects infectious colitis. Persistent diarrhea 14–29 days warrants stool pathogen testing and consideration of early endoscopic evaluation if symptoms are severe or refractory. Chronic diarrhea beyond 30 days pushes me toward IBD, microscopic colitis, IBS, malabsorption, or medication effects, and mandates a more structured workup rather than empiric antibiotics [^1125KSJb] [^112XuboH] [^111FSJ4D].

> I will now examine red flags that should lower my threshold for aggressive evaluation. Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, severe abdominal pain, hematochezia, weight loss, nocturnal diarrhea, anemia, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, or cancer therapy all increase concern for serious disease; mucus plus blood, fever, and systemic toxicity should prompt urgent stool testing and consideration of early colonoscopy, especially if C. difficile or IBD is suspected [^112XuboH] [^111GRpsa] [^116Rc16C].

> Let me think about the initial diagnostic approach. I should confirm dehydration risk and hemodynamic stability, then obtain a targeted history of onset, pattern, exposures, travel, food, and medications. For labs, a CBC, electrolytes, and renal function are reasonable, and for stool, in the right clinical context I should order C. difficile testing and a multiplex PCR panel for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens rather than relying on fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin, which are not recommended for acute infectious diarrhea. I should also consider Giardia in prolonged or travel-associated cases [^115Ne5w9] [^113y3Eyo] [^116CuDrD] [^111KqN3n].

> Wait, I should verify when to escalate to endoscopy. Persistent symptoms beyond about 2 weeks with negative stool testing, alarm features, or suspected IBD should lead to colonoscopy with biopsies; terminal ileoscopy can increase diagnostic yield for Crohn's disease, and upper endoscopy is reserved for chronic diarrhea with negative lower GI evaluation or suspected small-bowel disease; I almost said endoscopy is never indicated in acute diarrhea — hold on, that overstates it — endoscopy is not routine in acute self-limited diarrhea, but it becomes appropriate when severe inflammatory features, immunocompromise, or refractory symptoms are present [^114XEN3o] [^115ZDpUC] [^116mJwBL] [^111FSJ4D].

> I should double-check medication-related etiologies because they are often overlooked. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis with mucus and mandate prompt steroid therapy; PI3K inhibitors like alpelisib and duvelisib frequently cause diarrhea and colitis with mucus and require dose interruption and steroid management; even topical clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis, so a meticulous drug history is essential before labeling a case as idiopathic [^116Rc16C] [^114fQDgG] [^115tDpPA] [^117XSP5Z].

> Let me reconsider initial management while I await results. For acute non-severe mucoid diarrhea, oral rehydration is first-line and antidiarrheals like loperamide can be used cautiously in noninflammatory cases. Empiric antibiotics are generally discouraged unless there are high-risk features or specific epidemiologic clues, and even in high-resistance settings, randomized data in children suggest no clinical benefit from empiric antimicrobials for bloody or mucoid diarrhea. For suspected IBD or ICI colitis, early corticosteroids are indicated, and for C. difficile, stop offending antibiotics and treat per guideline-directed therapy [^111anBNk] [^112XuboH] [^11611apZ] [^111GRpsa] [^116Rc16C].

> In summary, mucus in diarrhea signals mucosal inflammation or goblet cell hypersecretion and should steer me toward infectious colitis, IBD, drug-induced colitis, or microscopic colitis rather than purely secretory or osmotic processes. I need to integrate duration, severity, systemic features, exposures, and medications to choose between stool PCR testing, early endoscopy, or a functional diagnosis, and I should avoid reflex empiric antibiotics unless clear indications exist while ensuring timely rehydration and escalation for severe disease [^117GapF2] [^112XuboH] [^111GRpsa] [^116Rc16C].

Mucus in diarrhea signals **mucosal inflammation** [^notfound] from infection, IBD, or ischemia, and is a red flag for **bacterial pathogens** such as Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli, and C. difficile [^112XuboH] [^111GRpsa]. It can also occur with IBS, medication effects, or radiation [^112Rbjc6] [^111yTj1v] [^112mHNn8]. Evaluate with **stool studies** (culture, C. difficile, O&P) [^notfound], CBC, CRP/ESR, and colonoscopy if symptoms persist or alarm features are present [^111FSJ4D]. Management is cause-specific: rehydration, antibiotics only when indicated [^112XuboH], and urgent care for severe disease or immunocompromised patients [^112XuboH].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Mucus in diarrhea reflects **increased goblet cell secretion** and epithelial disruption from inflammation or infection [^111x76qh] [^1164tzM1]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Infectious inflammation**: Bacterial pathogens (Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli, C. difficile) damage the mucosa, causing mucus production and shedding [^111x76qh] [^111iKVde].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease cause chronic mucosal inflammation with mucus, blood, and leukocytes [^111GRpsa] [^112z53s3].

- **Ischemic colitis**: Reduced blood flow leads to mucosal injury and mucus shedding.

- **Functional disorders**: IBS can feature mucus without significant inflammation [^112Rbjc6].

- **Medication-induced colitis**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and other drugs can cause colitis with mucus [^111yTj1v] [^116Rc16C].

---

## Clinical significance and associated conditions

Mucus in diarrhea is clinically significant and associated with **multiple conditions**:

| **Category** | **Associated conditions** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Shigella <br/> - Campylobacter <br/> - Salmonella <br/> - E. coli <br/> - C. difficile <br/> - Giardia <br/> - Amebiasis [^111x76qh] [^11611apZ] [^117XSP5Z] |
| Inflammatory | - Ulcerative colitis <br/> - Crohn's disease <br/> - Microscopic colitis [^111GRpsa] [^112z53s3] |
| Ischemic | - Ischemic colitis |
| Functional | - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [^112Rbjc6] |
| Medication-induced | - Immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis <br/> - Antibiotic-associated colitis [^111yTj1v] [^116Rc16C] [^117XSP5Z] |
| Radiation-induced | - Radiation colitis [^112mHNn8] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured evaluation** is essential to identify the cause:

- **History and physical examination**: Onset, duration, severity, travel, diet, medications, and comorbidities; assess dehydration and abdominal findings [^112XuboH] [^115Ne5w9].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP/ESR, stool culture, C. difficile toxin, O&P, fecal calprotectin [^111GRpsa].

- **Endoscopy**: Colonoscopy with biopsies for persistent symptoms, alarm features, or suspected IBD [^114XEN3o].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Infectious diarrhea**: Rehydration; antibiotics only for specific pathogens or severe cases [^112XuboH] [^111anBNk].

- **IBD**: Anti-inflammatory therapy, immunosuppressants, biologics, and supportive care [^notfound].

- **Medication-induced colitis**: Stop offending drug; corticosteroids or immunosuppressants as needed [^111yTj1v] [^114fQDgG].

- **Functional disorders**: Dietary changes, antidiarrheals, and symptom management [^116UGKP7] [^113uFvCT].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Seek **urgent care** for:

- Severe dehydration (dry mucosa, oliguria, hypotension) [^115Ne5w9].

- Persistent bloody diarrhea with mucus [^112XuboH].

- High fever, severe abdominal pain, or peritoneal signs [^116Rc16C].

- Immunocompromised status or recent antibiotic use [^112XuboH].

---

Mucus in diarrhea indicates **mucosal injury or inflammation** and warrants a focused evaluation to determine the cause and guide targeted therapy.

### Fecal luminal factors from patients with irritable bowel syndrome induce distinct gene expression of colonoids [^1146tPii]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work we describe that components of fecal supernatants, a proxy for the intestinal microenvironment, regulate gene expression of colonoids. Hence, the microbiota and metabolite profiles of fecal supernatants from healthy subjects and IBS patients with predominant diarrhea differed substantially and induced distinct regulation of colonoid gene expression. This suggests that our experimental set‐up, adding patient‐derived fecal supernatants to colonoids established from a healthy donor, has the potential to facilitate studies of intestinal barrier cross talk and explore the impact of the intestinal microenvironment on the pathophysiology of IBS.

Although the recently developed approach of establishing colonoids from intestinal tissue from the individual of interest to create subject‐specific intestinal epithelium has provided a multicellular model system, the importance of luminal factors has been overlooked. In this study, we therefore exposed colonoids established from a healthy subject to patient‐derived fecal supernatants, to determine effects of luminal factors on the colonic epithelium, potentially involved in IBS pathophysiology. Similar to the commonly used CaCo‐2 cell platform that comes from a patient with colorectal adenocarcinoma, a single healthy donor of colonic tissue was used for this study. Whereas subject‐specific organoids are costly concerning both time and money, collection of fecal samples are non‐invasive and easy to obtain and allow us to investigate the importance of the intestinal microenvironment in IBS versus health. The colonoid monolayers in our study presented with similar features, that is, polarization and specialized cells as mucin‐producing goblet cells, to those previously described in the literature. The addition of fecal supernatants from IBS patients and healthy subjects induced different gene regulation of the colonoid monolayers, suggesting that the fecal supernatants reproduce the intestinal microenvironment of the donor who provided the fecal material. Importantly, sex or age of donors of fecal supernatants did not influence our results.

### Dose – volume effects on patient-reported acute gastrointestinal symptoms during chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer [^112mHNn8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Research on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in rectal cancer is limited. We examined whether dose-volume parameters of the small bowel and large bowel were associated with patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation treatment for rectal cancer.

Methods and Materials

66 patients treated at the Brigham & Women's Hospital or Massachusetts General Hospital between 2006 and 2008 were included. Weekly during treatment, patients completed a questionnaire assessing severity of diarrhea, urgency, pain, cramping, mucus, and tenesmus. The association between dosimetric parameters and changes in overall GI symptoms from baseline through treatment was examined by using Spearman's correlation. Potential associations between these parameters and individual GI symptoms were also explored.

Results

The amount of small bowel receiving at least 15 Gy (V15) was significantly associated with acute symptoms (p = 0.01), and other dosimetric parameters ranging from V5 to V45 also trended toward association. For the large bowel, correlations between dosimetric parameters and overall GI symptoms at the higher dose levels from V25 to V45 did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1), and a significant association was seen with rectal pain from V15 to V45 (p < 0.01). Other individual symptoms did not correlate with small bowel or large bowel dosimetric parameters.

Conclusions

The results of this study using PROs are consistent with prior studies with physician-assessed acute toxicity, and they identify small bowel V15 as an important predictor of acute GI symptoms during 5-FU-based chemoradiation treatment. A better understanding of the relationship between radiation dosimetric parameters and PROs may allow physicians to improve radiation planning to optimize patient outcomes.

Diagnostics — outbreak and public health coordination: A broader set of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents should be considered regardless of the presence of fever, bloody or mucoid stools, or other markers of more severe illness in the context of a possible outbreak of diarrheal illness. Selection of agents for testing should be based on a combination of host and epidemiologic risk factors and ideally in coordination with public health authorities.

### Astrovirus infects actively secreting goblet cells and alters the gut mucus barrier [^116zcXj6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

With an estimated 47.8 million cases worldwide, astroviruses are a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea. But their prevalence is actually underestimateddue to the lack of diagnostic methods that can detect all circulating strains. Similar to other enteric viruses, astrovirus infections can range from subclinical manifestations to severe diarrhea and even fatal encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompromised hosts. However, little is known about their cellular tropism or pathogenesis, except that unlike other enteric viruses, astrovirus infections in multiple host species, including mice, are characterized by minimal cell death, inflammation, or immune cell infiltration. Also, epithelial cells within the villi, but not the crypts, have been implicated as targets for human and turkey astroviruses, but a detailed analysis with respect to host responses to infection has not been performed.

We hypothesize that the lack of pathophysiology caused by astroviruses is related to their cellular tropism. Here we define their epithelial target in the gut and response to infection using the murine model for astrovirus. We show that astrovirus specifically infects the small intestine and replicates in a subset of goblet cells that are actively secreting mucus. We further demonstrate direct consequences of infection for the host, including a simultaneous increase in the mucus barrier and mucus-associated bacteria, which translates to reduced susceptibility to enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC).

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of fecal incontinence [^116X5XY3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Endoscopy for fecal incontinence (FI) should be performed according to established screening guidelines and triggered by concerning symptoms, rather than as a routine diagnostic test for FI. Endoscopy should be performed according to established screening guidelines and in patients presenting with symptoms that warrant further evaluation (ie, changes in bowel habits, bleeding). Although colonoscopy rarely contributes to the diagnosis and management of FI, diarrhea is commonly observed in women with late-onset incontinence, and endoscopic evaluation may be warranted under these circumstances to rule out other pathology. Other symptoms of concern include bleeding, urgency, tenesmus, and mucus drainage that may be because of incontinence, colorectal cancer, or other serious pathology, and general screening recommendations should be followed for all other patients to exclude concomitant colorectal pathology that might require attention.

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^1174bXkA]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

### Biostructure of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea [^115gsJVz]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Dysbiosis is a key component of intestinal disorders. Our aim was to quantitatively access the biostructure of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and evaluate the responses to Saccharomyces boulardii treatment.

Methods

We investigated punched fecal cylinders from 20 patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and 20 healthy controls using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fluctuations in assembly of 11 bacterial groups were monitored weekly for 3 weeks before, during, and after oral S boulardii supplementation.

Results

The structural organization of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects was stable and unaffected by S boulardii. The assembly of fecal microbiota in idiopathic diarrhea was markedly different, characterized by mucus depositions within feces; mucus septa and striae; marked reduction in concentrations of habitual Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups; suppression of bacterial fluorescence in the center of the feces; increased concentrations and spatial shift of mucotrop bacteria to the fecal core; and increased concentrations of occasional bacteria. Except for elevated concentrations of some occasional bacterial groups, all parameters typical for diarrhea improved significantly with S boulardii treatment and most changes persisted after cessation of therapy. The improvement of the fecal microbiota was accompanied by partial (40%) and complete normalization (30%) of the diarrheal symptoms.

Conclusions

The fecal microbiota is highly structured. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis allowed us to quantitatively study the dysbiotic changes. S boulardii significantly improved the fecal biostructure in patients with diarrhea but had no influence on the feces in healthy subjects.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117KGzrT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Vomiting or Severe Diarrhea While Using COCs

Certain steps should be taken by patients who experience vomiting or severe diarrhea while using COCs (Figure 4).

FIGURE 4
Recommended actions after vomiting or diarrhea while using combined oral contraceptives

Abbreviation: UPA = ulipristal acetate.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Theoretically, the contraceptive effectiveness of COCs might be decreased because of vomiting or severe diarrhea. Because of the lack of evidence that addresses vomiting or severe diarrhea while using COCs, these recommendations are based on the recommendations for missed COCs. No evidence was found on the effects of vomiting or diarrhea on measures of contraceptive effectiveness including pregnancy, follicular development, hormone levels, or cervical mucus quality.

### Residual disease burden among European patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a real-world survey [^112evY19]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to initiation of current treatment, the majority of symptoms were reported by a similar proportion of patients who were later classified as being in remission or not in remission, across both UC and CD. At the time of consultation, patients with UC in remission and not in remission were both still reporting residual symptoms. Remission was generally associated with a significantly reduced probability of experiencing most symptoms compared with those not in remission, including bloody diarrhea, bowel movement urgency, and passing of mucus. However, some symptoms, including flatulence and abdominal distension, were not significantly less likely to occur in patients in remission compared with those not in remission. These symptoms reflect limitations of current treatments, and were associated with impaired generic and disease-specific HRQoL in this study. In patients with CD, there were even fewer differences in the proportion of patients reporting symptoms at the time of consultation between those in remission and not in remission compared with UC. Only 4 symptoms were significantly less likely to be reported by patients in remission than those not in remission: abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhea, fatigue/tiredness, and loss of appetite. Many symptoms, including those identified as bothersome and/or closely associated with impaired HRQoL, are not significantly impacted by achievement of remission. These symptoms include bloody diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal cramps. This may suggest insufficient disease control and residual disease activity among patients in remission, particularly in CD. These data may therefore suggest that a more comprehensive approach for the classification of disease activity should be employed, which better reflects patient experiences and considers additional factors such as extraintestinal manifestations and HRQoL.

### Prevalence of common diarrheagenic enterobacteriaceae in iran (2000–2023): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iKVde]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal infections caused by Shigella spp. (18.0%, 95% CI: 0.13–0.24) rank first in prevalence in Iran. Shigella species exclusively infect humans, causing acute shigellosis characterized by fever, watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, tenesmus, and stool containing abundant leukocytes, blood, and mucus. According to the Centers for Disease Control reports, approximately 80–165 million Shigella infections occur annually worldwide, resulting in about 6 million deaths, with the most severe forms being epidemic shigellosis caused by Shigella dysenteriae and endemic shigellosis caused by Shigella flexneri. While Shigella sonnei and Shigella boydii infections typically cause relatively mild gastrointestinal symptoms, they are still significant pathogens that can lead to morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable populations. Furthermore, the prevalence of Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii infections is rare, while infections caused by Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are more common in developing and developed countries, respectively.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^115ZDpUC]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Terminal ileoscopy and ileal biopsy — diagnostic yield and use in diarrhea are summarized: In a prospective evaluation of 138 patients, ileoscopy yielded incidental, conclusive diagnoses in 2.7% of asymptomatic surveillance colonoscopies, increasing to 18% in 22 non–human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with diarrhea; terminal ileal biopsy is most helpful in inflammatory diarrhea, and in one report microscopic terminal ileal lesions were found in 125 (49%) of 257 patients with diarrhea and suspected IBD, with ileal biopsies essential in 15 (6%) and contributory in 53 (21%); for normal-appearing mucosa, significant findings range from 0% to 4.2% of patients and the routine value is controversial and probably low yield.

### Pathogenesis of diarrhea in the adult: diagnostic challenges and life-threatening conditions [^1164xuvE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms that regulate ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract are complex. Disturbance of this homeostatic state by bile acids, bacterial enterotoxins and neoplasm-derived secretagogues, for example, can lead to diarrhea. Determining the causes of chronic diarrhea in individual patients may, therefore, represent a diagnostic challenge. The gastrointestinal tract has finely tuned mechanisms to maintain ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion. To achieve this homeostasis, various ionic transport proteins/complexes are targeted to the apical, basal or basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. Na, K and Cl ion transport proteins are regulated by endogenous activators (e.g. cAMP, PGE2, Ca), dietary-related factors (e.g. bile acids) and through post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). In certain pathophysiologic states, this homeostatic ionic/fluid exchange becomes dysfunctional as a result of failure of compensatory pro-absorptive/anti-secretory mechanisms. The excessive secretion of Na and Cl ions followed by the release of a large amount of H2O into the colonic lumen results in diarrhea, which may be acute or chronic, and can be life-threatening if not ameliorated. Diverse infectious organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoa, viruses) utilize different mechanisms to cause intestinal disease and diarrhea. These pathophysiologic mechanisms include alterations in ion transport, disruption of tight junctions and elicitation of inflammatory responses. Studies of patients infected with certain pathogens, those with ulcerative colitis and those harboring extra-colonic or colonic neoplasms have elucidated some of these pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea. Determining the etiology of chronic diarrhea in specific cases may be a diagnostic challenge for both gastroenterologists and primary care physicians.

### Epithelial transport and gut barrier function in colitis [^1164tzM1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that is confined to the colon and is characterized by a watery diarrhea that can also be accompanied by blood in the stool. The inflammation associated with colitis is generally confined to the mucosal and submucosal layers, although Crohn's colitis may be transmural. The principal functions of the colonic mucosa are to act as a barrier to the luminal contents of the intestinal tract and to facilitate the bidirectional transport of water and electrolytes. It is well established that barrier and transport defects occur in colitis and may be involved in pathogenesis. Consequently, this review discusses recent evidence of potential mechanisms that may be involved in the perturbation of mucosal transport and barrier functions in colitis and therapeutic advances to counteract these defects.

Recent Findings

Mechanisms responsible for transport dysfunction and barrier defects in colitis are discussed, including decreased activity of transport proteins such as CFTR, bacterial interactions with the epithelium, including understanding of the regulation and function of NOD-2, and altered expression of components of the intestinal barrier, such as mucins and multidrug resistance proteins.

Summary

Recent advances in our understanding of how changes in barrier and transport function occur in colitis may illuminate the pathophysiology of this condition. The work discussed may also identify novel targets that are functionally altered in colitis, which potentially can be modulated therapeutically either with existing medications or with newer agents that are in development.

### The gut commensal blautia maintains colonic mucus function under low-fiber consumption through secretion of short-chain fatty acids [^112J3MJb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Colonic mucus forms a crucial barrier between the intestinal epithelium and the great number of gut bacteria. During homeostasis, the most inner part of the mucus, which is adjacent to the epithelium ("inner layer"), is virtually sterile, while the more luminal part of this highly glycosylated gel network is intermixed with bacteria and intestinal content and is thus less defined. In addition to being a physical barrier, mucus has intrinsic expansion activity, likely due to a combination of continual baseline mucus secretion and swelling. This results in a constant luminal-directed flow toward the gut bacteria, thereby actively pushing microorganisms away from the host epithelium. This "mucus growth" is measured to be ~2 µm/min in mice and ~4 µm/min in humans.

While initially only being regarded as a lubricant for fecal material, accumulating evidence suggests that a compromised mucus layer is associated with several human diseases. For example, bacterial penetration and colonization of the mucus layer has been observed in metabolic diseaseand in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) –. In patients with ulcerative colitis, one of the two major forms of IBD, mucus defects even precede the onset of disease and may thus be an important contributing factor. Likewise, mice deficient in mucin-2 (Muc2), the structural scaffold protein forming the colonic mucus, or mice lacking the predominant O-linked oligosaccharides that decorate Muc2, develop severe colitis. thus causally linking mucus dysfunction to intestinal inflammation.

### No clinical benefit of empirical antimicrobial therapy for pediatric diarrhea in a high-usage, high-resistance setting [^11611apZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric diarrheal disease presents a major public health burden in low- to middle-income countries. The clinical benefits of empirical antimicrobial treatment for diarrhea are unclear in settings that lack reliable diagnostics and have high antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Methods

We conducted a prospective multicenter cross-sectional study of pediatric patients hospitalized with diarrhea containing blood and/or mucus in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Clinical parameters, including disease outcome and treatment, were measured. Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), and Campylobacter were isolated from fecal samples, and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined. Statistical analyses, comprising log-rank tests and accelerated failure time models, were performed to assess the effect of antimicrobials on disease outcome.

Results

Among 3166 recruited participants (median age 10 months; interquartile range, 6.5–16.7 months), one-third (1096 of 3166) had bloody diarrhea, and 25% (793 of 3166) were culture positive for Shigella, NTS, or Campylobacter. More than 85% of patients (2697 of 3166) were treated with antimicrobials; fluoroquinolones were the most commonly administered antimicrobials. AMR was highly prevalent among the isolated bacteria, including resistance against fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. Antimicrobial treatment and multidrug resistance status of the infecting pathogens were found to have no significant effect on outcome. Antimicrobial treatment was significantly associated with an increase in the duration of hospitalization with particular groups of diarrheal diseases.

Conclusions

In a setting with high antimicrobial usage and high AMR, our results imply a lack of clinical benefit for treating diarrhea with antimicrobials; adequately powered randomized controlled trials are required to assess the role of antimicrobials for diarrhea.

### Shiga toxin activatable by intestinal mucus in Escherichia coli isolated from humans: predictor for a severe clinical outcome [^113yWMgx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Some Escherichia coli produce Shiga toxin (Stx) in which cytotoxicity is increased (activated) by intestinal mucus and elastase (Stx2d(activatable)). These strains are highly virulent in mice, but their association with human disease is poorly understood. We investigated the prevalence of Stx2d(activatable) among Stx-producing E. coli (STEC) isolated from humans and the association between production of this Stx and the clinical outcome of infection.

Methods

A total of 922 STEC isolates obtained from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome or bloody or nonbloody diarrhea or from asymptomatic carriers were tested for the gene encoding Stx2d(activatable) by PCR and PstI restriction analysis. The toxin activatibility by human and mouse intestinal mucus and by an elastase was determined by quantifying the cytotoxicity using the Vero cell assay.

Results

The stx(2d-activatable) gene was identified in 60 (6.5%) of 922 STEC strains; in 31 of these strains, it was the sole stx gene. Thirty of these 31 strains produced Stx2d(activatable). All of them lacked the intimin-encoding eae gene. Among eae-negative STEC, which typically cause mild diarrhea or asymptomatic infection, production of Stx2d(activatable) was significantly associated with the ability to cause severe disease, including bloody diarrhea (P < .001), and with systemic complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (P < .001).

Conclusions

Production of Stx2d(activatable) by the infecting STEC may predict a severe clinical outcome of the infection, with progression to hemolytic uremic syndrome. A prompt and comprehensive subtyping of stx genes in STEC isolates is necessary to alert the treating physician that a patient is at risk of developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, even though the infecting STEC lacks eae.

### Clindamycin (Clindagel) [^117XSP5Z]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis, which may result in patient death. Use of the topical formulation of clindamycin results in absorption of the antibiotic from the skin surface. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin.

Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis. Stool culture for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.

When significant diarrhea occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Large bowel endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe diarrhea. Antiperistaltic agents, such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine, may prolong and/or worsen the condition.

Diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis have been observed to begin up to several weeks following cessation of oral and parenteral therapy with clindamycin.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Astrovirus infects actively secreting goblet cells and alters the gut mucus barrier [^116VQxuV]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Astroviruses are a global cause of pediatric diarrhea, but they are largely understudied, and it is unclear how and where they replicate in the gut. Using an in vivo model, here we report that murine astrovirus preferentially infects actively secreting small intestinal goblet cells, specialized epithelial cells that maintain the mucus barrier. Consequently, virus infection alters mucus production, leading to an increase in mucus-associated bacteria and resistance to enteropathogenic E. coli colonization. These studies establish the main target cell type and region of the gut for productive murine astrovirus infection. They further define a mechanism by which an enteric virus can regulate the mucus barrier, induce functional changes to commensal microbial communities, and alter host susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria.

Demographic and clinical parameters of patients with persistent and chronic diarrhea

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 199 patients are summarized in Table 1. One hundred ninety-nine stool samples were prospectively collected from 199 diarrheic children under 5 years of age (85.93%, 171/199), with a mean age of 12.93 ± 15.86 months. The percentage of boys (58.29%, 116/199) was slightly higher than that of girls (41.71%, 83/199). There were 163 persistent cases and 28 chronic cases of diarrhea. The majority were inpatients (88.44%, 176/199) during the study period, and no deaths were reported. Of the 199 stool specimens submitted to laboratories, watery/loose stool (n = 139, 72.78%) was the most common type, and mucus/bloody stool was less than 30.15% (60/199).

### Surgical management of rectal prolapse [^115fwDmt]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the pathogenesis, clinical presentation and surgical management of rectal prolapse. Full-thickness prolapse of the rectum causes significant discomfort because of the sensation of the prolapse itself, the mucus that it secretes, and because it tends to stretch the anal sphincters and cause incontinence. Treatment of rectal prolapse is primarily surgical. Perineal surgical repairs are well tolerated, but are generally associated with higher recurrence rates. Abdominal repairs involve fixing the rectum to the sacrum by using either mesh or sutures, and tend to have the lowest recurrence rates. If significant preoperative constipation is present, a sigmoid resection can be performed at the time of rectopexy. For many patients, diarrhea and incontinence improve after surgery. Laparoscopic repair of rectal prolapse has similar morbidity and recurrence rates to open surgery, with attendant benefits of reduced length of hospital stay, postoperative pain and wound complications.

### Factors that explain excretion of enteric pathogens by persons without diarrhea [^1168Hr8a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Other Nonspecific Host Factors That Affect Resistance to Diarrheal Pathogens

Various nonspecific but highly functional barriers protect the human intestine by impeding an enteric pathogen's ability to complete its pathogenesis that would otherwise result in clinical diarrheal illness. One consequence of these barriers remaining intact is that the pathogen may end up colonizing the human intestine for a variable (short or long) period of time without causing overt diarrhea; this may explain some randomly selected matched control subjects in case/control studies who harbor pathogens in the absence of diarrhea. Barriers that a diarrheal pathogen must overcome include the intestinal microbiota (normal flora), the mucus layer, the epithelial cell layer, and various innate immune responses. These will be briefly mentioned in the ensuing paragraphs and recent reviews will be cited, should readers wish to delve deeper into these topics.

Intestinal Microbiota

The intestinal microbiota refers to the complex ecosystem of resident microorganisms (overwhelmingly either strict or facultative anaerobic bacteria) found in the mucus layer along the mucosal surface; enormous numbers (approximately 10¹²–10¹⁴) of bacteria are found in the colon and terminal ileum. In addition to performing symbiotic physiological functions for the host (eg, assisting in digestion, producing vitamin K and biotin, and promoting maturation of the mucosal immune system), the microbiota constitute a formidable barrier that confronts pathogens. Besides competition for attachment sites on the epithelial surface and for nutrients, the end products of sugars metabolized by resident flora include short-chain fatty acids (eg, lactic, butyric, propionic) and other substances that are highly inhibitory for many bacterial enteropathogens such as V. cholerae O1, Salmonella, and Shigella.

Mucus Layer

The human intestine is covered by mucus, a product of goblet cells. The mucus covering of the colon, composed of the mucin Muc2, is double layered, with the outer mucus layer being loosely adherent and replete with microbiota. In contrast, the inner mucus layer is highly adherent to the epithelium and is free of microorganisms. A healthy intact outer mucus layer constitutes a potent protective barrier that impedes enteropathogens. Beneath the mucus layer resides another defense barrier, the epithelial glycocalyx, consisting of diverse glycoproteins and glycolipids on the apical surface of enterocytes and colonocytes. Both the mucus layer and the glycocalyx of the human intestine are continually replenished. The small intestine has only a single mucus layer. The mucus layer diminishes pathogen contact with the epithelium and carries bacteria distally.

### Incidence and management of toxicity associated with ibrutinib and idelalisib: a practical approach [^111bDFve]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Incidence and severity

Diarrhea can occur at any time after initiation of idelalisib and its incidence is higher in treatment-naïve patients (42%)than in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (4–18%). Diarrhea that occurs within the first 8 weeks of idelalisib use is usually grade 1–2 (i.e. an increase in stools of up to six stools per day over baseline).

Late-onset diarrhea is generally grade ≥ 3, with a median time to onset of 7.1 months and there are no accompanying symptoms such as cramps, blood or mucus. Colonoscopy shows macroscopic, in some cases ulcerative, colitis, and histology shows lymphocytic colitis in combination with characteristic epithelial cell apoptosis and neutrophilic cryptitis. Idelalisib-induced intestinal perforation is rare (< 0.5%).

Although a definitive underlying mechanism for idelalisib-associated diarrhea is unknown, PI3K δ inhibition has been associated with immune dysregulation resulting in inhibition of regulatory T cells and increased damage via CD8 + cytotoxic T cells.–

### Role of mucus layers in gut infection and inflammation [^115DGUc4]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The intestinal mucus is an efficient system for protecting the epithelium from bacteria by promoting their clearance and separating them from the epithelial cells, thereby inhibiting inflammation and infection. The function of the colon inner mucus layer is especially important as this explains how we can harbor the large number of bacteria in our gut. The major component of this mucus system is the MUC2 mucin which organizes the mucus by its enormously large net-like polymers. Pathogenic microorganisms, in turn, have developed mechanisms for circumventing this well-organized mucus protective system.

### Association betweenand irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea [^1162AnHS]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of IBS steeply increases following a gastroenteritis episode, suggesting a possible causative role for microbial perturbation. Still, previous investigations have not demonstrated consistent associations between intestinal microbiota and IBS symptoms.

Gut microbiota composition studies overwhelmingly rely on faecal material. However, these samples largely reflect the luminal microbial community, which is spatially separated from the colonic epithelium and underlying immune cells through a two-tiered mucus barrier. By contrast, certain species have found a niche in the outer mucus layer, feeding on the abundant mucin O -glycans. Thus, faecal and mucus-associated bacteria represent distinctive populations, with the latter more likely to influence the epithelium. In particular, bacterial presence in the inner mucus layer might result in epithelial stress and immune activation. Here, we performed a metaproteomic analysis of inner mucus layer samples from patients with IBS and healthy individuals, to investigate potential associations between mucus-resident microbiota and IBS symptoms.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis: an overview [^113wXyto]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as an integral component of the management of various cancers and have contributed to significant improvements in overall survival. Most available ICIs target anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4), and anti-programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD1/PDL1). Gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events remain a common complication of ICIs. The predominant manifestations include diarrhea and colitis, which often manifest concurrently as immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis (IMDC). Risk factors for developing these side effects include baseline gut microbiota, preexisting autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and type of neoplasm. The hallmark symptom of colitis is diarrhea which may be accompanied by mucus or blood in stools. Patients may also experience abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and nausea. If not treated rapidly, ICI-induced colitis can lead to serious life-threatening complications. Current management is based on corticosteroids as first-line, and immunosuppressants like infliximab or vedolizumab for refractory cases. Microbiota transplantation and specific cytokines and lymphocyte replication inhibitors are being investigated. Optimal patient care requires maintaining a balance between treatment toxicity and efficacy, hence the aim of this review is to enhance readers' comprehension of the gastrointestinal adverse events associated with ICIs, particularly IMDC. In addition to identifying the risk factors, we discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, workup, and management options of IMDC.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111GRpsa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) symptom evaluation and infection workup highlight that symptoms of bloody diarrhea, presence of mucus, bowel urgency, tenesmus, and abdominal cramping should trigger consideration of a diagnosis of UC, particularly in the absence of an alternate cause, and that history should assess extraintestinal manifestations including joint, skin, ocular, oral, and hepatobiliary involvement. Potential precipitants may include recent smoking cessation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and enteric infections. C. difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as complicating a significant proportion of patients with UC and is associated with increased risk of hospitalizations, colectomy, and mortality; among newly diagnosed or relapsing inflammatory bowel disease patients, CDI prevalence ranges from 5% to 47%, and concomitant CDI with UC has worse outcomes, including higher mortality. Testing for C. difficile is typically performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other enteric infections that could mimic UC include Escherichia coli (O157:H7), Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and parasitic infections like amoebiasis, so an infectious etiology should always be suspected and excluded at time of diagnosis and in the right clinical setting, with several institutions using comprehensive intestinal pathogen testing through PCR-based assays that may detect many bacterial and viral pathogens.

### Microalgae-based intestinal villi-targeting multistage biosystem for irritable bowel syndrome treatment [^116Jc4wy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex gastrointestinal disorder that affects ~10−15% of the global population. It is characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and alterations in bowel habits, significantly impacting the quality of life of patients and may encompass systemic manifestations involving the nervous and digestive systems. The symptoms of IBS are multifaceted, including intestinal motility disorders, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Current therapeutic approaches, such as antispasmodics, probiotics, neuromodulators, and dietary modifications, are poorly specific and often offer limited relief, and may give rise to adverse reactions. Moreover, the development of drugs and formulations for IBS is scarce compared to that of other diseases.

Diseases such as diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) pose unique challenges for oral drug delivery due to significant dynamics and microenvironment alterations in the intestinal tract, including compromised epithelial integrity, modified mucus layer, and accelerated transit time. Such physiological variations significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of oral drugs, compromising their absorption, distribution, and bioavailability, which could be a key underlying factor contributing to the poor reproducibility in IBS-D research and clinical trials. At this point, employing higher doses to achieve therapeutic efficacy may amplify side effects and reduces patient compliance. Distinct from common diarrhea, the manifestation of symptoms in IBS-D is chronic and unpredictable, which cautions us against disregarding this particularity and directly adopting some generalized dosage forms. Nowadays, numerous research efforts have concentrated on formulating advanced drug delivery system. However, relevant works specifically targeting IBS-D are extremely rare, and clinical options are highly limited. Further research on innovative and reliable drug delivery mechanisms is imperative.

### The gastrointestinal mucus system in health and disease [^117GapF2]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Mucins — large, highly glycosylated proteins — are important for the luminal protection of the gastrointestinal tract. Enterocytes have their apical surface covered by transmembrane mucins and goblet cells produce the secreted gel-forming mucins that form mucus. The small intestine has a single unattached mucus layer, which in cystic fibrosis becomes attached, accounting for the intestinal manifestations of this disease. The stomach and colon have two layers of mucus; the inner layer is attached and the outer layer is less dense and unattached. In the colon, the outer mucus layer is the habitat for commensal bacteria. The inner mucus layer is impervious to bacteria and is renewed every hour by surface goblet cells. The crypt goblet cells have the ability to restitute the mucus layer by secretion, for example after an ischaemic challenge. Proteases of certain parasites and some bacteria can cleave mucins and dissolve the mucus as part of their pathogenicity. The inner mucus layer can, however, also become penetrable to bacteria by several other mechanisms, including aberrations in the immune system. When bacteria reach the epithelial surface, the immune system is activated and inflammation is triggered. This mechanism might occur in some types of ulcerative colitis.

### An insight into patients' perspectives of ulcerative colitis flares via analysis of online public forum posts [^114Cyxib]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient-perceived initial symptoms of UC flares

In most of the posts related to flare management (60.2% [N = 4042]), patients monitored their symptoms (absence, presence, and severity) in an attempt to understand and manage their flares, while in the remaining posts (39.8%), patients placed additional importance on clinical tests. However, among posts related to identifying flares (N = 645), patients did not commonly make a distinction between initial (experienced at the start of a flare) or general (experienced throughout a flare) symptoms when discussing their perceived flare symptoms. Blood in the stool was the most frequently discussed flare indicator (experienced at the start of a flare; 57.8% of posts [N = 645]) and was often co-mentioned with mucus in the stool, followed by diarrhea and loose stools (19.1% of posts), and increased frequency of bowel movements (stool frequency; 18.6% of posts) (Table 1). Patients reported that they often confused blood in the stool with hemorrhoidal bleeding, and also reported diarrhea as a common symptom for gastrointestinal infections and dietary intolerances, which resulted in a delay in seeking medical advice for some patients (28.2% of posts from patients with blood in their stool and 83.4% of posts from patients with diarrhea).

### Functional diarrhea [^116UGKP7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.

### Immunological aspects of intestinal mucus and mucins [^114pSMHQ]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

A number of mechanisms ensure that the intestine is protected from pathogens and also against our own intestinal microbiota. The outermost of these is the secreted mucus, which entraps bacteria and prevents their translocation into the tissue. Mucus contains many immunomodulatory molecules and is largely produced by the goblet cells. These cells are highly responsive to the signals they receive from the immune system and are also able to deliver antigens from the lumen to dendritic cells in the lamina propria. In this Review, we will give a basic overview of mucus, mucins and goblet cells, and explain how each of these contributes to immune regulation in the intestine.

### Association betweenand irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea [^113UaeVu]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The incidence of IBS increases following enteric infections, suggesting a causative role for microbial imbalance. However, analyses of faecal microbiota have not demonstrated consistent alterations. Here, we used metaproteomics to investigate potential associations between mucus-resident microbiota and IBS symptoms.

Design

Mucus samples were prospectively collected from sigmoid colon biopsies from patients with IBS and healthy volunteers, and their microbial protein composition analysed by mass spectrometry. Observations were verified by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and real-time PCR, further confirmed in a second cohort, and correlated with comprehensive profiling of clinical characteristics and mucosal immune responses.

Results

Metaproteomic analysis of colon mucus samples identified peptides from potentially pathogenic Brachyspira species in a subset of patients with IBS. Using multiple diagnostic methods, mucosal Brachyspira colonisation was detected in a total of 19/62 (31%) patients with IBS from two prospective cohorts, versus 0/31 healthy volunteers (p < 0.001). The prevalence of Brachyspira colonisation in IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) was 40% in both cohorts (p = 0.02 and p = 0.006 vs controls). Brachyspira attachment to the colonocyte apical membrane was observed in 20% of patients with IBS and associated with accelerated oro-anal transit, mild mucosal inflammation, mast cell activation and alterations of molecular pathways linked to bacterial uptake and ion–fluid homeostasis. Metronidazole treatment paradoxically promoted Brachyspira relocation into goblet cell secretory granules — possibly representing a novel bacterial strategy to evade antibiotics.

Conclusion

Mucosal Brachyspira colonisation was significantly more common in IBS and associated with distinctive clinical, histological and molecular characteristics. Our observations suggest a role for Brachyspira in the pathogenesis of IBS, particularly IBS-D.

### Diarrhea in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases [^113EEk3p]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is a common clinical feature of inflammatory bowel diseases and may be accompanied by abdominal pain, urgency, and fecal incontinence. The pathophysiology of diarrhea in these diseases is complex, but defective absorption of salt and water by the inflamed bowel is the most important mechanism involved. In addition to inflammation secondary to the disease, diarrhea may arise from a variety of other conditions. It is important to differentiate the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the diarrhea in the individual patient to provide the appropriate therapy. This article reviews microscopic colitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, focusing on diarrhea.

### Intestinal barrier dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review [^11492yVJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic bowel disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain related to defecation and changes in bowel habits. Clinically, IBS patients are characterized by their predominant aberrant bowel pattern as diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), constipation-predominant (IBS-C) or mixed (IBS-M). Increasing evidence points toward the presence of pathophysiological disturbances in subsets of IBS. These include alterations in visceral sensitivity, gastrointestinal (GI) motility, intestinal permeability, the microbiome and the immune function. – Furthermore, several risk factors for the development of IBS have been identified, among which infectious gastroenteritis appears to the most predominant. However, the development of new therapeutics is hampered by heterogeneous presentation and difficulties in phenotypic characterization.

With a surface area of up to 40 m, the digestive tract presents a large interface from which to interact with the external environment while serving many critical homeostatic functions. The intestinal barrier protects the internal environment from a continuous exposure to pathogens and antigens, while at the same time being responsible for the uptake of nutrients and water. To fulfill these conflicting functions, the gut has evolved into a complex system of multiple defensive layers, consisting of physical, biochemical and immune components. First, intrinsic secretions of the GI tract as well as products of commensal microbes prevent the colonization of pathogens.– Second, the adherent mucus layer, a network consisting of mucin polymers produced by the goblet cells, coats the intestinal epithelium, providing a barrier between the host and the microbiome, while also entrapping pathogens. Third and perhaps most importantly, the epithelial barrier itself, consisting of a single layer of epithelial cells interconnected by tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes, provides the strongest physical defense against submucosal access of noxious luminal substances. Fourth, the immune cells in the mucosa and in the lamina propria (e.g. dendritic cells, mast cells or macrophages) mount protective responses through the production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and many other critical immunomodulators. In addition to physical and chemical components of the barrier, the propulsive motility of the gut also plays an important role in defending the internal environment.

### EnterotoxigenicDegrades the host MUC2 mucin barrier to facilitate critical pathogen-enterocyte interactions in human small intestine [^113kNrBd]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) isolates are genetically diverse pathological variants of E. coli defined by the production of heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) toxins. ETEC strains are estimated to cause hundreds of millions of cases of diarrheal illness annually. However, it is not clear that all strains are equally equipped to cause disease, and asymptomatic colonization with ETEC is common in low- to middle-income regions lacking basic sanitation and clean water where ETEC are ubiquitous. Recent molecular epidemiology studies have revealed a significant association between strains that produce EatA, a secreted autotransporter protein, and the development of symptomatic infection. Here, we demonstrate that LT stimulates production of MUC2 mucin by goblet cells in human small intestine, enhancing the protective barrier between pathogens and enterocytes. In contrast, using explants of human small intestine as well as small intestinal enteroids, we show that EatA counters this host defense by engaging and degrading the MUC2 mucin barrier to promote bacterial access to target enterocytes and ultimately toxin delivery, suggesting that EatA plays a crucial role in the molecular pathogenesis of ETEC. These findings may inform novel approaches to prevention of acute diarrheal illness as well as the sequelae associated with ETEC and other pathogens that rely on EatA and similar proteases for efficient interaction with their human hosts.

### Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners? [^112UA4wb]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in this review, we have covered different complementary aspects of the mucus barrier by covering the mucus chemistry, production, secretion and degradation, and the various factors involved in the modification of the mucus layer status. Although the mucus barrier remains a neglected component of gut barrier function in many studies, increasing attention has been paid to the different ways to approach it, ranging from a simple investigation of mucus thickness to an investigation of its detailed composition, turnover and penetrability as well as the regulation of the number of goblet cells and their differentiation. To have an overall and more accurate vision, researchers should not rely only on one factor characterising the mucus, such as its thickness, considering that, for example, its increase is often associated with a mucus barrier improvement, but it can also hide the beginning of pathogenic infections.

Moreover, the mucus layer not only acts as an important factor for protecting the host against microbial invaders but also contributes to the mutualism between the host and microbes. Many diseases are associated with the alteration of the mucus layer thickness, but it is still difficult to identify whether this effect is a cause or a consequence of the disease. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that specific gut microbes contribute to the regulation of the mucus barrier and eventually intestinal and host health (eg, A. muciniphila); however, there are still many gaps that need to be filled to understand the sophisticated mechanisms hidden behind these slimy neglected partners.

### Short-term and medium-term clinical outcomes of Campylobacter concisus infection [^115fpjpQ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

There are only sparse data on the short-term and medium-term clinical impacts of Campylobacter concisus infection. A clinical study was performed during a 2-year period to determine the clinical manifestations in C. concisus-positive adult patients. A case patient was defined as an adult patient (≥ 18 years) with a C. concisus-positive stool sample during the study period. Clinical data were obtained with use of a questionnaire supplemented with the patients' medical records, if any. The short-term and medium-term clinical manifestations in these patients were compared with those of patients with Campylobacter jejuni/Campylobacter coli infection. One hundred and seventy-four C. concisus patients and 196 C. jejuni/C. coli patients participated in the study. Patients with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease or microscopic colitis or enteric co-infection were excluded from review of the clinical manifestations. Comparison of the short-term clinical manifestations in 139 C. concisus patients with those in 187 C. jejuni/C. coli patients showed a significantly lower prevalence of fever, chills, mucus and blood in stools, and weight loss. However, 80% of C. concisus patients, but only 32% of C. jejuni/C. coli patients, had diarrhoea for > 2 weeks. After a 6-month follow-up period, 12% of C. concisus patients were diagnosed with microscopic colitis, whereas no C. jejuni/C. coli patients were diagnosed with non-infective colitis. Irritable bowel symptoms were common in both groups at follow-up. C. concisus infection seems to cause a milder course of acute gastroenteritis than C. jejuni/C. coli infection, but is associated with more prolonged diarrhoea.

### Symptoms and symptom clusters in patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease: results from the IBSEN III study [^112z53s3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic, recurrent inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In UC, inflammation is located in the colonic mucosa and varies in extent. However, in CD, inflammation may affect the entire gastro-intestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. The pathogenesis of IBD is not completely understood but is commonly regarded as a dysregulation of the immune response against the intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals. The course of IBD may be unpredictable, ranging from mild symptoms with rare relapses to serious intestinal inflammation, requiring long-term immunosuppressive medical treatment, hospitalization, and, in some cases, surgery.

Symptoms associated with IBD are predominantly diarrhea with or without mucus and blood, as well as abdominal pain, tenesmus, rectal urgency, rectal bleeding, weight loss, anorexia, and fever. Furthermore, fatigue, anxiety, sleep impairment, psychological distress, and depression are commonly reported in patients with IBD. Even though symptoms are more common during periods of active disease, they can also occur and persist when patients are in remission. A symptom can be defined as "a manifestation of disease apparent to the patient himself, while a sign is a manifestation of disease that the physician perceives". In IBD, symptom research has gained increased attention in the last decades, and studies have also shown a discrepancy between how patients and physicians view the impact of IBD on daily life.

### The patient with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms: when to investigate and how? [^11232DYU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder whose clinical presentation varies considerably between patients as well as within the same individual over time. Many of its symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating, may be manifestations of a host of other gastrointestinal diseases; some accompanied by increased mortality. This presents the clinician with a real dilemma: how to sensibly investigate the patient in which one suspects IBS but there is a nagging doubt that 'it could be something else'? Could one miss 'something serious'? This short review attempts to provide both an evidence-based response to these vexing questions and a practical guide to detecting alternative diagnoses in the subject with IBS-type symptoms.

Recent Findings

Clinical features, patient demographics and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with IBS-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of IBS. The advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. In the older, female diarrhea sufferer microscopic colitis should be considered. The role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant IBS is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS remain uncertain.

Summary

Attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with IBS-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation. Wherever indicated, widely available serological and fecal tests will serve to bolster the diagnosis by excluding other options. Proceeding to more invasive testing should be dictated by clinical presentation and scenario with the threshold for intervention being generally lower among those with prominent diarrhea.

### Effects of supervised aerobic exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness and patient-reported health outcomes in colorectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy-a pilot study [^117Hwkx7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Apart from fatigue, surgical resection in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy is often associated with other debilitating adverse effects that negatively affect QoL of CRC patients, such as pain, nausea, diarrhea, and mucositis. In our study, we observed a significant group effect for urinary frequency as well as blood and mucus in the stool following the supervised aerobic exercise program. Whether this is related to the exercise intervention requires further investigations. Notably, the blood and mucus in the stool scale of the EORTC-QLQ-CR29 has been shown to be only moderately reliable, and our results were driven by three patients who reported high scores (> 50) at baseline, two of which were in the CG and withdrew from the study for unrelated issues. Although we observed favorable within-group changes in abdominal pain and dysuria in the IG, while flatulence increased in the CG, preliminary data suggests that more specific exercise modalities, such as pelvic floor muscle training, may be more effective at improving some of the treatment-related side effects of CRC surgery, such as bowel function. Yet, combined aerobic and resistance programs have shown some promise in decreasing pain, nausea, and neurotoxicity symptoms in CRC patients undergoing adjuvant treatment. Given disease- and treatment-related side effects have shown to significantly impact physical activity levels and QoL in CRC patients undergoing adjuvant treatment, further investigations focusing on these outcomes would be worthwhile.

### Mucus and mucins in diseases of the intestinal and respiratory tracts [^113VvNDX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although mucus has often been considered passive and boring, recent understanding has proven mucus to be highly dynamic and to explain both normal physiology and several diseases. The complexity of the mucins building the structural skeleton of mucus explains the slow development of our understanding. However, we can now foresee a faster development in the molecular understanding of mucus paving the road for a number of novel therapies for both common and rare diseases of the lung and intestine. Examples of potential options for treating mucus related diseases are given in Table 2.

### Intestinal secretory mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea [^112KNuBn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Although diarrhea is the predominant bowel dysfunction in as many as one-third of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it is unclear whether there is a specific disorder of intestinal fluid or electrolyte secretion in IBS. Diarrhea is generally considered a result of accelerated colonic transit in patients with IBS. Although a primary secretory diathesis has not been well-documented in patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), several mechanisms that could potentially contribute to intestinal secretion have been reported. Some of these mechanisms also influence motor and secretory dysfunctions that contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS-D. We review the evidence supporting secretion in IBS-D caused by peptides and amines produced by enteroendocrine cells or submucosal neurons, enterocyte secretory processes, and intraluminal factors (bile acids and short-chain fatty acids). Understanding these mechanisms and developing clinical methods for their identification could improve management of patients with IBS-D.

### Dose-surface maps identifying local dose-effects for acute gastrointestinal toxicity after radiotherapy for prostate cancer [^112Advsm]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We evaluated dose distributions in the anorectum and its relation to acute gastrointestinal toxicities using dose surface maps in an image-guided (IG) IMRT and 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) population.

Material and Methods

For patients treated to 78 Gy with IG-IMRT (n = 260) or 3D-CRT (n = 215), for whom acute toxicity data were available, three types of surface maps were calculated: (1) total anorectum using regular intervals along a central axis with perpendicular slices, (2) the rectum next to the prostate, and (3) the anal canal (horizontal slicing). For each toxicity, an average dose map was calculated for patients with and without the toxicity and subsequently dose difference maps were constructed, 3D-CRT and IG-IMRT separately. P-values were based on permutation tests.

Results

Dose distributions in patients with grade ⩾2 acute proctitis were significantly different from dose distributions in patients without toxicity, for IG-IMRT and 3D-CRT. At the cranial and posterior rectal site, in areas receiving moderate dose levels (≈25–50 Gy), dose differences up to 10 Gy were identified for IG-IMRT. For pain, cramps, incontinence, diarrhea and mucus loss significant differences were found as well.

Conclusions

We demonstrated significant relationships between acute rectal toxicity and local dose distributions. This may serve as a basis for subsequent dose-effect modeling in IG-IMRT, and improved dose constraints in current clinical practice.

Methods

The active surveillance system

Between January 2009 and December 2018, active surveillance of patients with acute diarrhea was administered in 217 sentinel hospitals and 93 reference laboratories in all 31 provinces (autonomous regions or municipalities) on the Chinese mainland which was managed by the Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (China CDC) (Supplementary Fig. 6). The numbers of sentinel hospitals and reference laboratories were determined in proportion to the total population size within each ecological region and the sentinel hospitals were chosen after careful consideration for the capacities of surveillance and laboratory testing and the representativeness of geographical locations (Supplementary Methods). All participating hospitals and laboratories used a surveillance protocol that included guidelines for patient enrollment, specimen collection, laboratory testing, data management, and other related standard operating procedures that were developed by China CDC. A case of acute diarrhea was defined as the presence of ≥ 3 passages of watery, loose, mucus-, or bloody-stools within a 24-h period. Patients referred from other hospitals or patients not initially diagnosed in sentinel hospitals or patients with the non-infectious disease were excluded from this study.

Introduction

Gastroenteritis is a serious digestive tract condition characterized by inflammation within the digestive system. Gastroenteritis can be categorized based on symptom duration and severity. This condition manifests as either acute or chronic gastroenteritis, depending on the nature of the symptoms experienced by patients. Acute gastroenteritis, characterized by short-term symptoms, typically requires immediate medical attention. The primary treatment approach for this form of the illness is rehydration therapy, aimed at replenishing fluids lost due to diarrhea and vomiting. In cases of severe dehydration or when oral rehydration proves ineffective, intensive intravenous rehydration may be considered as a more aggressive treatment option. In contrast, chronic gastroenteritis is often caused by chronic inflammation that severely damages the stomach lining. These conditions present with a spectrum of symptoms which include diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, nausea, a fever, and abdominal discomfort. Diarrhea is a key symptom and is defined by the onset of loose or fluid stools that appear three or more times within a 24 h. Globally, acute infectious diarrheal diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is implicated in between 1.5 and 2.5 million deaths each year, making diarrhea the second foremost cause of death among children under the age of five. Acute gastroenteritis affects more than 350 million people each year, with nearly 48 million cases caused by foodborne bacteria, in developed countries such as the United States. Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections are the main causes of gastroenteritis, with viruses causing about 70–80% of cases. Bacterial infections account for about 10–20%, and parasites are also associated with acute infectious gastroenteritis. While bacterial gastroenteritis is generally not fatal in developed countries, it still claims about 300 lives annually. However, in more severe cases, bacterial pathogens assume greater importance. Viral gastroenteritis infections as the most common cause of gastroenteritis, are characterized by clinical diarrhea without blood or mucus. This condition typically resolves on its own within a few days, with treatment focusing on hydration replacement, often through oral rehydration solutions. Gastroenteritis related to parasites may persist until treated appropriately and may require supportive care or specific antiparasitic medications, depending on the organism involved. In contrast, bacterial gastroenteritis can lead to more severe outcomes, including severe bloody diarrhea, fever, and potentially life-threatening complications, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and those with compromised immune systems. Moreover, bacterial gastroenteritis is often associated with foodborne outbreaks, which can impact public health on a larger scale. Treatment for bacterial gastroenteritis frequently involves antibiotic prescription, though effectiveness may be limited due to antibiotic resistance. Given these factors, timely identification of bacterial gastroenteritis infections is crucial for optimizing outcomes and preventing long-term sequelae in patients. Interestingly, recent evidence also revealed the link between bacterial gastroenteritis (infectious diarrhea) and the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ranging from 4 to 32%.

### Pic, an autotransporter protein secreted by different pathogens in the enterobacteriaceae family, is a potent mucus secretagogue [^111x76qh]. Infection and Immunity (2010). Low credibility.

A hallmark of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) infection is a formation of biofilm, which comprises a mucus layer with immersed bacteria in the intestines of patients. While studying the mucinolytic activity of Pic in an in vivo system, rat ileal loops, we surprisingly found that EAEC induced hypersecretion of mucus, which was accompanied by an increase in the number of mucus-containing goblet cells. Interestingly, an isogenic pic mutant (EAEC Δpic) was unable to cause this mucus hypersecretion. Furthermore, purified Pic was also able to induce intestinal mucus hypersecretion, and this effect was abolished when Pic was heat denatured. Site-directed mutagenesis of the serine protease catalytic residue of Pic showed that, unlike the mucinolytic activity, secretagogue activity did not depend on this catalytic serine protease motif. Other pathogens harboring the pic gene, such as Shigella flexneri and uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), also showed results similar to those for EAEC, and construction of isogenic pic mutants of S. flexneri and UPEC confirmed this secretagogue activity. Thus, Pic mucinase is responsible for one of the pathophysiologic features of the diarrhea mediated by EAEC and the mucoid diarrhea induced by S. flexneri.

For most otherwise healthy adults with traveler's diarrhea (TD), "Formal ORS is not needed" because they can replace losses with salty soups, fruit juices, and carbohydrates to drive glucose–sodium cotransport. Travelers with diarrhea "should keep up with fluids and electrolytes" to pass urine regularly and maintain moist mucous membranes. In severe diarrhea, a balanced oral rehydration solution (ORS) available at pharmacies typically contains "sodium of 60–75 mEq/l and glucose of 75–90 mmol/l"; sports drinks "while not adequate alone to treat severe diarrhea can provide partial sodium and potassium replacement".

Figure 1.
Adjusted mean response to whether or not a symptom was experienced at the time of consultation (1 = yes, 0 = no) among patients in remission and not in remission in (A) patients with ulcerative colitis and (B) patients with Crohn's disease. Data are shown for patients with complete data for all outcomes and potential confounding variables (for ulcerative colitis, n = 271 and n = 147 for those in remission and not in remission, respectively; for Crohn's disease, n = 299 and n = 128 for those in remission and not in remission, respectively). The P values demonstrate the significance of differences in adjusted mean response between patients in remission and those not in remission; P values in bold indicate statistical significance (< .05). Data were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, time since inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis, time since the start of current treatment initiation, and disease severity at the time of current treatment initiation, using propensity score matching.

The proportions of patients who reported each symptom prior to initiation of current treatment are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. Among patients in remission at the time of consultation, the proportion who reported experiencing each symptom prior to initiation of their current treatment ranged from 0% to 68% (UC) and from 0.5% to 79.7% (CD). For those not in remission, the proportion who reported experiencing each symptom ranged from 0% to 72.8% (UC) and from 0.6% to 81.9% (CD). Among the symptoms experienced prior to the initiation of current treatment in patients with UC, 9 out of the 26 symptoms assessed were reported by a significantly higher proportion of those not in remission at the time of consultation compared with those who were in remission (bowel movement urgency, flatulence, night-time urgency, passing of mucus, rapid postprandial bowel movements, rectal bleeding, vomiting/nausea, fatigue/tiredness, and weight loss). Among the symptoms experienced prior to the initiation of current treatment in patients with CD, 2 of the 27 symptoms assessed were reported by a significantly higher proportion of those not in remission at the time of consultation compared with those who were in remission (fatigue/tiredness and night sweats). In addition, bloody diarrhea was reported by a significantly higher proportion of patients with CD who were in remission at the time of consultation compared with those not in remission at the time of consultation.

### Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli: an emerging enteric pathogen [^113ZuVNa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) represents an emerging pathogen that causes enteric and food-borne infectious diseases. Subgroups in many populations throughout the world are susceptible to EAEC infection. EAEC pathogenesis involves adherence to the intestinal mucosa; increased production and deposition of a mucus biofilm; and mucosal toxicity due to inflammation and cytokine release. Due to the heterogeneity of EAEC strains and differing host immune responses, not all EAEC infections are symptomatic. Recent data suggest that individuals with a homozygous genotype -251 AA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), in the IL-8 promoter region, are more susceptible to EAEC diarrhea. The HEp-2 cell adherent assay allows identification of EAEC's characteristic aggregative or "stacked brick" adherence pattern. Antimicrobial treatment of individuals who develop EAEC diarrhea should be individually based. Ciprofloxacin and rifaximin, compared to placebo, have been shown to significantly shorten the course of diarrhea in patients who developed EAEC infection. The objective of this review is to increase awareness of this important emerging pathogen and to discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen factors associated with EAEC infection.

### Mucin dynamics and enteric pathogens [^1143PhuG]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2011). Medium credibility.

The extracellular secreted mucus and the cell surface glycocalyx prevent infection by the vast numbers of microorganisms that live in the healthy gut. Mucin glycoproteins are the major component of these barriers. In this Review, we describe the components of the secreted and cell surface mucosal barriers and the evidence that they form an effective barricade against potential pathogens. However, successful enteric pathogens have evolved strategies to circumvent these barriers. We discuss the interactions between enteric pathogens and mucins, and the mechanisms that these pathogens use to disrupt and avoid mucosal barriers. In addition, we describe dynamic alterations in the mucin barrier that are driven by host innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.

5.3 Diarrhea or Colitis

Serious, including fatal (1/442; 0.2%), diarrhea or colitis occurred in 18% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). The median time to onset of any grade diarrhea or colitis was 4 months (range: 1 day to 33 months), with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The median event duration was 0.5 months (range: 1 day to 29 months; 75thpercentile: 1 month).

Advise patients to report any new or worsening diarrhea. For non-infectious diarrhea or colitis, follow the guidelines below:

For patients presenting with mild or moderate diarrhea (Grade 1–2) (i.e. up to 6 stools per day over baseline) or asymptomatic (Grade 1) colitis, initiate supportive care with antidiarrheal agents as appropriate, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, and monitor the patient at least weekly until the event resolves. If the diarrhea is unresponsive to antidiarrheal therapy, withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g. budesonide). Monitor the patient at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea, consider restarting COPIKTRA at a reduced dose.

For patients presenting with abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, peritoneal signs, or with severe diarrhea (Grade 3) (i.e. > 6 stools per day over baseline) withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g. budesonide) or systemic steroids. A diagnostic work-up to determine etiology, including colonoscopy, should be performed. Monitor at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea or colitis, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA. Discontinue COPIKTRA for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111KqN3n]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

In addition to improvements in IBS-SSS ratings, the number of bowel motions/day was significantly reduced from month 2 onwards in the multi-strain probiotic group compared with the placebo group (Table 2). In contrast the passing of excess mucus was similar in the two treatment groups.

At baseline all patients rated their symptoms as moderate to severe (Table 3). However, at the end of the follow-up period 52.5% of patients in the multi-strain probiotic group rated their symptoms as mild compared with 39.1% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Moreover, the number of patients symptom free at the end of the study was 33.7% in the multi-strain probiotic group compared with only 12.8% in the placebo group (p < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethics

Ethical approval for this study was provided by the ethics committees of all 3 participating local hospitals and the University of Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC No. 1045–13). Written consent from parents or legal guardians of all participants was obtained before enrollment.

Study Design and Enrollment

This study was a prospective, observational, multicenter cross-sectional study to evaluate the etiology, epidemiology, and outcomes in children (aged < 16 years) hospitalized for diarrhea. Study participants were recruited from 3 tertiary hospitals (Children's Hospital 1, Children's Hospital 2, and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from May 2014 to April 2016.

Children hospitalized with diarrhea, defined as ≥ 3 passages of loose stools within 24 hours with ≥ 1 loose stool containing blood and/or mucus, were recruited into the study. Based on characteristics of the diarrheal stools and the duration of illness, participants were classified into 3 groups: acute nonbloody diarrhea (diarrhea with mucus, < 14 days), acute bloody diarrhea (diarrhea with blood, < 14 days), and persistent diarrhea (diarrhea with mucus and/or blood, ≥ 14 days). Children were not eligible if they had suspected or confirmed intussusception at the time of enrollment. After enrollment, a short questionnaire was completed, and a fecal sample was collected and processed within 24 hours. All enrolled patients were provided with the routine standard-of-care practices at each hospital. Treatment and proxy outcomes, including patient recovery status at 3 days after enrollment and duration of hospitalization, were recorded by clinical staff at study sites. Patient status was recorded as "recovered" if the patient had < 3 passages of loose stools in the past 24 hours or "improved" if the patient had fewer episodes of diarrhea and/or less mucus and/or blood compared with status at enrollment.

### Impact of dose-escalated chemoradiation on quality of life in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer: 2-year follow-up of the randomized RECTAL-BOOST trial [^115ccxFx]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dose-escalated chemoradiation (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer did not result in higher complete response rates but initiated more tumor regression in the randomized RECTAL-BOOST trial (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01951521). This study compared patient reported outcomes between patients who received dose-escalated CRT (5 × 3 gray boost + CRT) or standard CRT for 2 years after randomization.

Methods and Materials

Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were participating in the RECTAL-BOOST trial filled out European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and CR29 questionnaires on quality of life (QoL) and symptoms at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after start of treatment. Between-group differences in functional QoL domains were estimated using a linear mixed-effects model and expressed as effect size (ES). Symptom scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

Patients treated with dose-escalated CRT (boost group, n = 51) experienced a significantly stronger decline in global health at 3 and 6 months (ES -0.4 and ES -0.4), physical functioning at 6 months (ES -1.1), role functioning at 3 and 6 months (ES -0.8 and ES -0.6), and social functioning at 6 months (ES -0.6), compared with patients treated with standard CRT (control group, n = 64). The boost group reported significantly more fatigue at 3 and 6 months (83% vs 66% respectively 89% vs 76%), pain at 3 and 6 months (67% vs 36% respectively 80% vs 44%), and diarrhea at 3 months (45% vs 29%) compared with the control group. From 12 months onwards, QoL and symptoms were similar between groups, apart from more blood/mucus in stool in the boost group.

Conclusions

In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, dose-escalated CRT resulted in a transient deterioration in global health, physical, role, and social functioning and more pain, fatigue and diarrhea at 3 and 6 months after start of treatment compared with standard CRT. From 12 months onwards, the effect of dose-escalated CRT on QoL largely resolved.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, CD-EG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain testing in the presence of alarm features, when the differential diagnosis can be effectively distinguished based on test results, or when the differential diagnosis remains broad and initial testing will limit the number of additional tests needed. Consider offering a therapeutic trial for disorders without definitive diagnostic tests.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis: an overview [^111yTj1v]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Gastrointestinal irAEs remain a common complication of ICIs with diarrhea and colitis among the most prevalent side effects. Their incidence is higher in patients receiving anti-CTLA4 compared to anti-PD1/PDL1. Risk factors for developing IMDC include baseline gut microbiota, preexisting autoimmune disorders such as IBD, and type of neoplasm. The hallmark symptom of colitis is diarrhea which may be accompanied by mucus or blood in stools. Patients may also experience abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and nausea. A comprehensive differential diagnosis involves a set of laboratory tests, analyzing drug history, temporal associations, specific histological features, and multiple organ involvement to ensure accurate identification. Treatment should be initiated promptly to avoid serious complications. Current management is based on corticosteroids as first-line, and immunosuppressants like infliximab or vedolizumab for refractory cases. Microbiota transplantation and specific cytokines and lymphocyte replication inhibitors are being investigated. However, existing data are primarily from case reports, and further studies to assess drug usefulness in IMDC are warranted.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis: an overview [^114TwNPJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

The primary symptom of colitis is diarrhea, which is often accompanied by blood, but the absence of diarrhea does not rule out colitis. Other symptoms include mucus in stools, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and nausea. Variants of colitis in the upper gastrointestinal tract include gastritis, gastric ulcerations, duodenitis, and esophagitis.

ICI-induced colitis can progress rapidly, leading to serious complications such as toxic megacolon, ileus, peritonitis, bowel perforation, and death. Historically, the classification of IMDC is based on a grading system from 1 to 5, established for oncology clinical trials called the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), although the clinical utility of this grading system has not been established. Briefly, grade 1 colitis is defined as asymptomatic, with pathologic or radiographic findings only; grade 2, as abdominal pain, with mucus or blood in the stool; grade 3, as additional fever or peritoneal signs; grade 4, as perforation, ischemia, necrosis, or toxic megacolon; and grade 5, as death. Grade 1 diarrhea is defined as an increase of less than four stools per day over baseline; grade 2, as an increase of 4–6 stools; grade 3, as an increase of 7 or more stools per day, with hospitalization indicated; grade 4, as life-threatening with urgent intervention indicated; and grade 5, as death.

IMDC typically manifests 5–10 weeks after the second or third dose of treatment, but studies suggest that IMDC can develop even 4 months after the last dose and potentially recur 1–2 years after treatment discontinuation.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of giardiasis in children include an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with presentations ranging from short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain to a more protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Stools can initially be profuse and watery then become greasy and foul smelling, with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent; malabsorption with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients and this syndrome may take several weeks to resolve, while asymptomatic Giardia infection is common. Extraintestinal features include invasion into bile or pancreatic ducts, long term extraintestinal symptoms in one third of patients, and subsequent development of reactive arthritis associated with giardiasis.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^116Rc16C]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

CTCAE version 5.0 gastrointestinal toxicity grading — diarrhea and enterocolitis defines diarrhea grade 3 by an increase of ≥ 7 stools over baseline with incontinence, hospitalization indicated, severe increase in ostomy output compared with baseline, and limiting self care ADL; grade 4 and grade 5 are labeled life-threatening consequences requiring urgent intervention and death, respectively. Diarrhea grade 1 is an increase of < 4 stools over baseline with mild increase in ostomy output compared with baseline. For enterocolitis, grade 1 is asymptomatic with clinical or diagnostic observations only and intervention not indicated; grade 2 includes abdominal pain plus mucus or blood in stool; grade 3 includes severe abdominal pain, fever, and peritoneal signs; and grades 4 and 5 mirror diarrhea with life-threatening consequences requiring urgent intervention and death.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^112XuboH]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

Cystoisosporiasis — diagnosis: Infection is typically diagnosed by detecting Isospora oocysts (dimensions, 23–36 μm by 12–17 μm) in fecal specimens; oocyst shedding may be intermittent and at low levels even with profuse diarrhea, so diagnosis can be facilitated by repeated stool examinations using modified acid-fast techniques (oocysts stain bright red) and UV fluorescence microscopy (oocysts autofluoresce), or by detecting oocysts in duodenal aspirates/ mucus or developmental stages in intestinal biopsy specimens, and extraintestinal infection has been documented in the biliary tract, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver in postmortem examinations of HIV-infected patients.

### Extent of disease affects the usefulness of fecal biomarkers in ulcerative colitis [^1148SovK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

It is important to be able to distinguish endoscopic remission as a surrogate marker for colonoscopy. In all cases, fecal biomarkers were able to distinguish not only MES 0, 1 and MES 2, 3 but also MES 0 and MES 1, 2, 3, although these assessments were varied among each disease extent group. Furthermore, the AUC tended to be lower in the proctitis group. These findings suggest that fecal biomarkers should be used in clinical practice by considering the following points: (1) in proctitis, a correlation with MES is lower, (2) estimating endoscopic remission is more challenging in proctitis compared with other disease types, and (3) the cutoff value may differ depending on disease extent.

The reason for the decreased correlation with fecal biomarkers and the MES in the proctitis group may be related to the shorter distance from the anus and stool retention time. Also, patients with proctitis often do not experience diarrhea, and blood and mucus adhere to the surface of stool resulting in variability in the measured values.

### Interactions of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms with the intestinal mucosal barrier [^113D2fo2]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The intestinal mucosal barrier is composed of epithelial cells that are protected by an overlying host-secreted mucous layer and functions as the first line of defence against pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms. Some microorganisms have evolved strategies to either survive in the mucosal barrier or circumvent it to establish infection. In this Review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of the complex interactions of commensal microorganisms with the intestinal mucosal barrier, and we discuss strategies used by pathogenic microorganisms to establish infection by either exploiting different epithelial cell lineages or disrupting the mucous layer, as well as the role of defects in mucus production in chronic disease.

Symptoms

The adjusted mean response to whether a symptom was experienced or not at the time of consultation in patients in remission vs those not in remission are shown in Figure 1 (1 = yes, 0 = no). Among patients in remission, this ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (UC) and from 0.00 to 0.30 (CD). Among patients not in remission, it ranged from 0.00 to 0.50 (UC) and from 0.01 to 0.48 (CD). In UC, patients not in remission were significantly more likely to experience 16 of the 23 symptoms assessed than patients in remission (all P < .05). In UC, the 3 symptoms with the largest difference in response between the remission and non-remission groups were bowel movement urgency, bloody diarrhea, and passing of mucus (all P < .001). The likelihood of experiencing the other 7 symptoms, including gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal distension and flatulence and non-gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, was similar between those in remission and those not in remission (all P > .05). In CD, 4 out of the 23 symptoms assessed (abdominal pain, fatigue/tiredness, loss of appetite, and non-bloody diarrhea) were significantly more likely in patients not in remission than those in remission (P < .05). The remaining symptoms, including gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramps, abdominal distension, and bloody diarrhea, and non-gastrointestinal symptoms such as anemia, arthralgia, and weight loss, were similarly likely to occur among those in remission and not in remission (all P > .05). All symptoms, other than anemia (UC), fever (UC and CD), and joint swelling (UC), had an adjusted likelihood of > 0 among patients in remission, indicating that they were experienced to some degree despite remission.

5.5 Diarrhea or Colitis

Severe diarrhea, resulting in dehydration and in some cases in acute kidney injury, can occur in patients treated with PIQRAY. Most patients (58%) experienced diarrhea during treatment with PIQRAY. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 7% (n = 19) of patients. Among patients with Grade 2 or 3 diarrhea (n = 71), the median time to onset was 46 days (range, 1 to 442 days).

In clinical trials, 63% of patients who experienced diarrhea required antidiarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide) to manage symptoms. Dose reductions of PIQRAY were required in 6% of patients, and 2.8% of patients permanently discontinued PIQRAY due to diarrhea.

Colitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with PIQRAY [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients for diarrhea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and mucus or blood in stool. Based on the severity of the diarrhea or colitis, PIQRAY may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Advise patients to start antidiarrheal treatment, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider if diarrhea occurs while taking PIQRAY.

Patients with colitis may require additional treatment, such as enteric-acting and/or systemic steroids.

### Bacteria penetrate the normally impenetrable inner colon mucus layer in both murine colitis models and patients with ulcerative colitis [^112fWuAq]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

We finally asked if the difference in mucus quality of the patients with active UC, which allowed beads to sediment down to the epithelium, reflected bacteria penetrating the inner mucus. Biopsy specimens taken from the same individuals as used for penetrability measurements were fixed to preserve the mucus, immunostained for MUC2, and counterstained for DNA to visualise cell nuclei and bacteria. These patients were all pretreated with oral laxative to clear the intestine for routine colonoscopy. This treatment affects the mucus and its turnover, and the fixed material shows a more voluminous and less well structured mucus in control patients also (figure 6 C-b, D-b). The amount of mucus that remained attached to the epithelial surface varied between the biopsy specimens, which excluded evaluation of all patients. In comparison with the laxative-treated control patients, the patients with inflammation had less attached mucus, and bacteria penetrated this mucus and reached the epithelium (figure 6 C-c, D-c).

### Diarrhea caused by circulating agents [^114StGZy]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Circulating agents cause intestinal secretion or changes in motility with decreased intestinal transit time, resulting in secretory-type diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea as opposed to osmotic diarrhea is characterized by large-volume, watery stools, often more than 1 L per day; by persistence of diarrhea when patients fast; and by the fact that on analysis of stool-water, measured osmolarity is identical to that calculated from the electrolytes present. Although sodium plays the main role in water and electrolyte absorption, chloride is the major ion involved in secretion.

### Ulcerative colitis patients in remission have an altered secretory capacity in the proximal colon despite macroscopically normal mucosa [^111Dr877]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Background

One of the hallmarks of acute colitis is loss of epithelial transport. For unknown reasons, many patients still suffer from GI symptoms during remission, indicating a sustained imbalance between absorption and secretion. We hypothesize that the colonic epithelium becomes more reactive to secretagogues to compensate for a failing barrier.

Methods

Biopsies from ascending colon and sigmoid colon of UC patients in remission and controls were mounted in Ussing chambers. Membrane current (Im) and epithelial capacitance (Cp) were used as markers for anion secretion and mucus exocytosis. Carbachol (1 mmol L(-1)) and forskolin (10 μmol L(-1)) were used to study Ca(2+) and cAMP-mediated secretion.

Key Results

Baseline values showed segmental patterns with higher Im in ascending colon and higher Cp in sigmoid colon of both UC patients and controls, but the patterns did not differ between the groups. The Im response to forskolin was increased (+35%) in the ascending colon of UC patients and the Im response to carbachol was decreased (-40%) in the same segment. No group differences were seen in the distal colon for either the forskolin or carbachol-induced Im responses. The Cp response to carbachol was instead up-regulated in the distal colon of UC patients, but remained unaffected in the proximal colon.

Conclusions & Inferences

The proximal colonic mucosa of UC patients in remission seems to shift its reactivity to secretagogues, becoming more sensitive to cAMP-dependent secretion and less sensitive to Ca(2+) -dependent secretion. This phenomenon may contribute to residual diarrhea in this patient group, despite resolution of inflammation.
