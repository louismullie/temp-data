## Question

In adult Jehovah's Witness patients presenting with neurogenic shock in the emergency department, how does the use of non-blood volume expanders compared to traditional blood transfusion strategies affect hemodynamic stability and overall outcomes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how non-blood volume expanders compare to traditional blood transfusion strategies for hemodynamic stability and outcomes in adult Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock in the emergency department. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of neurogenic shock and how it differs from hemorrhagic shock. Then, I should verify what the Jehovah's Witness literature actually provides for evidence versus what is extrapolated from hemorrhagic shock. Next, I will examine the comparative hemodynamic effects of crystalloids, colloids, and blood products, and I need to check for any direct head-to-head data. After that, I should review outcomes data in Jehovah's Witnesses across settings and consider applicability to neurogenic shock. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-aligned recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice if filled.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Neurogenic shock is a distributive shock after spinal cord injury with loss of sympathetic tone, bradycardia, and vasodilatory hypotension; the primary deficit is vascular tone and chronotropy rather than oxygen-carrying capacity, which distinguishes it from hemorrhagic shock where both volume and oxygen delivery are central problems [^f5f02b3d]. Wait, let me verify the implication: this means that restoring preload and afterload with fluids and vasopressors is the immediate priority, and increasing oxygen-carrying capacity with RBCs is secondary unless there is concomitant anemia or ongoing ischemia, so I should not overgeneralize transfusion strategies from hemorrhage to neurogenic shock without justification [^f5f02b3d].

> Next, I should review the evidence base specific to Jehovah's Witnesses. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: most robust data in Jehovah's Witnesses come from surgical cohorts and hemorrhagic shock contexts, not neurogenic shock, so I need to be cautious about extrapolation. Large cardiac surgery series show that with rigorous patient blood management, Jehovah's Witness patients can have outcomes comparable to controls without transfusion, supporting the feasibility of transfusion-free strategies in high-acuity settings, though this is not neurogenic shock-specific [^55718c39] [^2c3e819f]. Case series and reports in trauma and critical care Jehovah's Witness patients demonstrate survival with restrictive, blood-sparing approaches, but again, these are not neurogenic shock studies per se [^4151c515] [^bb692aad].

> I will now examine hemodynamic effects of non-blood expanders versus blood. Let me think about crystalloids versus colloids first. A small randomized trial in mixed shock (including neurogenic) showed that modified fluid gelatin produced greater increases in CVP and PAOP than lactated Ringer's over the first hour, suggesting more efficient intravascular expansion with colloid in the short term, though this is low-quality evidence and does not address oxygen delivery or outcomes [^37a1ab11]. But wait, what if I am overstating this? The study is underpowered and old, so I should treat it as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for practice change [^37a1ab11].

> Now, I should compare these to blood transfusion. Traditional transfusion increases oxygen-carrying capacity and intravascular volume, but in Jehovah's Witnesses this is not an option, so the question is moot for primary resuscitation in this population. I need to ensure I do not conflate hemorrhagic shock guidance with neurogenic shock: major trauma policies emphasize early balanced blood product resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock, which does not directly translate to neurogenic shock where the deficit is vasoplegia and relative bradycardia rather than anemia or coagulopathy [^f4928b5a] [^591108d9]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying transfusion would be first-line here; it would not be, given the patient's beliefs and the pathophysiology, so the practical comparison is among non-blood strategies rather than versus transfusion [^0fb6eb4d].

> Next, I should review outcomes data in Jehovah's Witnesses and consider applicability. Observational and comparative studies in Jehovah's Witnesses undergoing cardiac and complex surgery show mortality and major complications comparable to matched controls when blood conservation protocols are used, supporting the safety of transfusion-free strategies in selected high-risk patients, albeit not in neurogenic shock cohorts [^55718c39] [^2c3e819f]. Case series in life-threatening anemia report survival with HBOC-201 and other blood-sparing measures, but these are heterogeneous and not specific to neurogenic shock, so I should be cautious about inferring benefit in SCI [^4151c515] [^bb692aad]. Let me reconsider: while not definitive for neurogenic shock, these data reinforce that restrictive, blood-conserving care can be lifesaving in critically ill Jehovah's Witnesses when meticulously implemented [^55718c39] [^4151c515].

> I should confirm guideline direction for neurogenic shock management. Contemporary trauma and neurocritical care guidance emphasize early vasopressor support, particularly norepinephrine, to restore perfusion pressure while avoiding excessive crystalloid, and they do not position RBC transfusion as a therapy for neurogenic shock itself unless there is concurrent anemia or ongoing ischemia, which aligns with the pathophysiology and the constraints in Jehovah's Witnesses [^a449d745] [^82241dc1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought permissive hypotension might be acceptable here, but I should correct that: permissive hypotension is contraindicated in neurogenic shock because it worsens spinal cord perfusion; instead, a MAP target around 85–90 mmHg is commonly recommended to protect cord perfusion while source control and definitive care proceed [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-informed approach. In adult Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock, non-blood volume expanders are appropriate first-line therapy to restore preload and afterload, with crystalloids as the initial choice and colloids considered if crystalloids are insufficient or if rapid intravascular expansion is needed, recognizing the limited but supportive hemodynamic data for colloids in shock states and the absence of transfusion as an option [^37a1ab11] [^0fb6eb4d]. I should double-check that I am not overpromising colloid superiority; the evidence is weak, so clinician judgment and serial assessment are essential, and vasopressors should be initiated early to achieve MAP targets that protect spinal cord perfusion rather than relying on large-volume crystalloid loading [^a449d745] [^82241dc1].

> I need to ensure supportive measures are explicit. Minimize phlebotomy, use pediatric tubes, and employ antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid when indicated to reduce ongoing losses; consider erythropoietin and iron if anemia is present or anticipated, and use permissive strategies such as accepting lower hemoglobin thresholds consistent with restrictive transfusion principles in stable patients, while recognizing that neurogenic shock may warrant a more conservative approach to anemia tolerance if it threatens cord perfusion [^d3f66792] [^ebbef0ce]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying a fixed hemoglobin trigger in this setting; there is no neurogenic shock–specific trigger, so decisions should be individualized to symptoms, hemodynamics, and end-organ perfusion rather than a number alone [^notfound].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and future directions. There are no direct comparative studies of non-blood expanders versus transfusion in neurogenic shock, and no neurogenic shock–specific Jehovah's Witness cohorts; thus, current recommendations rely on pathophysiologic reasoning, indirect evidence from other shock states, and Jehovah's Witness cohorts in surgery and hemorrhage, with a very low certainty of evidence for this exact question [^f5f02b3d] [^55718c39]. I should confirm that our center documents shared decision-making, clarifies acceptable blood fractions and conservation techniques, and engages ethics early if conflicts arise, as this is standard in transfusion-free care and helps mitigate both clinical and moral risk [^0fb6eb4d] [^b4cf5240].

> Bottom line, after verifying the pathophysiology and the evidence gaps, non-blood volume expanders are the appropriate first-line resuscitation for neurogenic shock in Jehovah's Witnesses, with crystalloids first and colloids as adjuncts when needed, while early vasopressor support targets MAP to protect spinal cord perfusion. Transfusion is not an option and is not indicated for neurogenic shock itself in this population, and outcomes with restrictive, blood-conserving strategies in Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraging albeit indirect for this scenario [^f5f02b3d] [^a449d745] [^55718c39].

In adult Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock, **non-blood volume expanders (crystalloids and colloids) are effective for restoring hemodynamic stability** and are acceptable alternatives when blood transfusion is refused [^0fb6eb4d]. Crystalloids are first-line due to safety and availability, while colloids (e.g. albumin) offer greater intravascular retention and may be used when crystalloids are insufficient [^37a1ab11]. Outcomes depend on **early recognition, careful monitoring, and adherence to patient preferences**; mortality is higher when hemoglobin falls below 7 g/dL, but restrictive strategies and blood-sparing techniques can mitigate risk [^8b057185] [^a48ea723]. There is no direct comparative evidence versus transfusion in this specific population, so management should be individualized and guided by clinical judgment and patient values [^b4cf5240].

## Pathophysiology of neurogenic shock

Neurogenic shock results from **loss of sympathetic tone** after spinal cord injury, causing vasodilation, relative hypovolemia, and bradycardia [^f5f02b3d]. The key hemodynamic features are:

- **Hypotension**: Due to widespread vasodilation and reduced systemic vascular resistance.
- **Bradycardia**: From unopposed parasympathetic activity.
- **Relative hypovolemia**: Despite normal blood volume, venous pooling reduces preload and cardiac output.

Management focuses on restoring vascular tone and preload with fluids and vasopressors while minimizing blood loss and avoiding transfusion when refused [^a449d745].

## Non-blood volume expanders: options and mechanisms

Non-blood volume expanders include **crystalloids and colloids**, each with distinct properties:

| **Attribute** | **Crystalloids** | **Colloids** |
|-|-|-|
| Examples | Normal saline, lactated Ringer's | Albumin, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch |
| Mechanism | Rapid distribution into interstitial and intracellular compartments; ~20% remains intravascular | Larger molecules remain intravascular, providing sustained volume expansion |
| Advantages | Safe, inexpensive, widely available | Greater intravascular retention, less edema |
| Limitations | Risk of edema, larger volumes needed, dilutional coagulopathy | Cost, allergy, rare renal injury (with starches) |

---

## Clinical evidence on non-blood volume expanders in Jehovah's Witness patients

Direct evidence in Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock is limited; most data come from trauma, surgical, and critical care settings where transfusion was refused [^notfound]. Key findings include:

- **Crystalloids**: Effective for initial resuscitation; ATLS recommends 1–2 L boluses with reassessment of response [^notfound].
- **Colloids**: Albumin and gelatin provide sustained volume expansion and may reduce total fluid requirements; a randomized trial showed gelatin achieved greater hemodynamic improvement than lactated Ringer's in shock patients [^37a1ab11].
- **Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs)**: Case reports describe successful use of HBOC-201 in Jehovah's Witness patients with severe anemia, but availability and safety concerns limit routine use [^bb692aad] [^4151c515].

---

## Comparative outcomes: non-blood expanders vs. transfusion

There is **no direct comparative evidence** between non-blood expanders and transfusion in Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock. Indirect evidence suggests:

- **Restrictive transfusion thresholds**: In stable adults, restrictive thresholds (7–8 g/dL) are safe and may reduce transfusion-related complications; this supports using non-blood strategies when transfusion is refused [^a48ea723] [^ebbef0ce].
- **Jehovah's Witness cohorts**: Cardiac and trauma series show comparable or acceptable outcomes without transfusion when blood-conservation protocols are used, though these are not specific to neurogenic shock [^55718c39] [^2c3e819f].
- **Mortality risk with anemia**: In patients refusing transfusion, mortality rises as hemoglobin falls below 7 g/dL, underscoring the need for aggressive anemia prevention and management [^8b057185].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **patient blood management** and individualized care for Jehovah's Witness patients:

- **Crystalloids**: First-line for initial volume resuscitation; safe and effective in most settings [^d1c7f23d].
- **Colloids**: Consider when crystalloids are insufficient or when sustained volume expansion is needed; albumin is generally preferred when available [^notfound].
- **Vasopressors**: Norepinephrine is first-line for neurogenic shock to restore vascular tone and perfusion [^a449d745].
- **Patient preferences**: Document and respect individual beliefs regarding blood products and derivatives [^0fb6eb4d].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on available evidence and expert consensus, the following approach is recommended for adult Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock:

- **Initial resuscitation**: Use crystalloids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) in 1–2 L boluses, reassessing hemodynamics after each bolus [^notfound].
- **Escalation**: If crystalloids are insufficient, add colloids (preferably albumin) to achieve sustained volume expansion and reduce edema risk [^notfound].
- **Vasopressor support**: Start norepinephrine early to restore vascular tone and maintain perfusion, titrating to MAP targets based on clinical context [^a449d745].
- **Anemia management**: Use iron, folate, vitamin B12, and erythropoietin to optimize hemoglobin and minimize transfusion need [^d3f66792].
- **Monitoring**: Use invasive or noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy and avoid over-resuscitation [^a449d745].

---

## Limitations and knowledge gaps

Key limitations include the **absence of direct comparative studies** in neurogenic shock, the small size and heterogeneity of available cohorts, and limited access to colloids and HBOCs in some settings. Future research should include prospective studies comparing crystalloids, colloids, and vasopressors in Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock, and development of patient blood management protocols tailored to this population.

---

Non-blood volume expanders are effective for **hemodynamic stabilization** in adult Jehovah's Witness patients with neurogenic shock, with crystalloids as first-line and colloids as adjuncts when needed. Outcomes depend on **early recognition, careful monitoring, and adherence to patient preferences**; mortality risk rises with severe anemia, but restrictive strategies and blood-sparing techniques can mitigate this risk. There is no direct comparative evidence versus transfusion in this population, so management should be individualized and guided by clinical judgment and patient values.

### Management of adult jehovah's witness patients with acute bleeding [^478f2297]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Because of the firm refusal of transfusion of blood and blood components by Jehovah's Witnesses, the management of Jehovah's Witness patients with severe bleeding is often complicated by medical, ethical, and legal concerns. Because of a rapidly growing and worldwide membership, physicians working in hospitals should be prepared to manage these patients. Appropriate management of a Jehovah's Witness patient with severe bleeding entails understanding of the legal and ethical issues involved, and meticulous medical management, including treatment of hypovolemic shock, local hemostatic interventions, and administration of prohemostatic agents, when appropriate. In addition, high-dose recombinant erythropoietin in combination with supplemental iron may enhance the speed of hemoglobin synthesis.

Summary

Management of trauma patients who refuse blood products places additional restrictions on management options to care for patients in potentially life-threatening situations. Knowledge of alternative treatments, specific patient preferences, and multidisciplinary team management are vital in these cases.

3) Legal and Ethical Aspects of Non Transfusion

It has been suggested that patients who receive transfusions following cardiac surgery had twice the long-term mortality risk than patients who did not receive transfusions. The administration of blood transfusions therefore appears to be an independent factor of death. If these results attain factual status, then for both medical and legal reasons, all efforts must be made to avoid recourse to blood transfusion not only amongst Jehovah's Witnesses, but in all patients. A review of the existing literature on methods of blood transfusion indicates not only a discordance in practice amongst medical teams, but even amongst members of the same team: yet the morbidity-mortality rates are ubiquitous in the first 30 postoperative days. Therefore, it appears desirable to replace these highly unsystematic methods of transfusion with a protocol of blood conservation which involves all members of the caring team. To undertake such a protocol is both medically justified and feasible.

Jehovah's Witnesses — care approach and proscribed components for adult autonomous patients emphasize that surgeons should aim to respect and accommodate patient values, that proscribed blood components are red cells, leukocytes, platelets, and plasma, and that remaining hemotherapies are left to individual conscience; patient blood management (PBM) should be practiced in all patients regardless of personal beliefs, with specific attention to nuances such as cell salvage and acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH).

Conclusion

Cardiac surgery without transfusion may be performed with an equivalent risk to standard surgery. This has been made possible by the progress in methods of blood conservation employing pharmacological agents - namely aprotinin then EACA - and erythropoietin and improving the physical design of cardio-pulmonary bypass techniques. Nevertheless, patient selection remains extremely important to achieve these results.

Application to Other Patient Populations

The strategies described above can also be applied to other patients who may refuse blood products for nonreligious reasons, such as fear of contracting blood borne illness or transfusion reactions. It is critical to make sure the patient is informed of the true risks and benefits in these situations, although the right to refusal remains. These strategies are beneficial during times of blood shortages as well.

### Emergency transfusions [^f5ca6dd3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Successful emergency transfusions require early recognition and activation of resources to minimize treatment delays. The initial goals should focus on replacement of blood in a balanced fashion. There is an ongoing debate regarding the best approach to transfusions, with some advocating for resuscitation with a fixed ratio of blood products and others preferring to use viscoelastic assays to guide transfusions. Whole-blood transfusion also is a debated strategy. Despite these different approaches, it generally is accepted that transfusions should be started early and crystalloid infusions limited. As hemodynamic stability is restored, endpoints of resuscitation should be used to guide the resuscitation.

Proposed Approach to Management

Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols should always be followed. If Jehovah's Witness status is unknown, routine management should be followed. After confirming Jehovah's Witness status on arrival to the trauma facility, the patient's specific wishes should be clarified. If the patient is obtunded or intubated, the surrogate should be contacted. If no surrogate can be contacted, the hospital ethics committee should be consulted. In patients presenting in hypovolemic shock, one liter of crystalloid should be given in adults, or 20 mL/kg in patients under 40 kg, and response monitored.TXA should be given within 3 hours of the injury when possible. Proposed treatment protocol is reviewed in Figure 2.

Image illustrating Proposed Management Protocol for orthopaedic polytrauma with known Jehovah's Witness status. JW = Jehovah's Witness, TXA = tranexamic acid, rEPO = recombinant erythropoietin

It is important to note that wishes should be confirmed along the way as a patient's wishes may change as their prognosis changes. In their study on anemic trauma patients who were Jehovah's Witnesses, Olaussen et alnoted approximately 25% of patients elected for RBCs, FFP, or platelets. Patients should be counseled on increased mortality as hemoglobin decreases. In a study of 300 patients who refused blood transfusion based on religious beliefs, it was found that there was no increased mortality with or without cardiovascular disease with a hemoglobin level of 7.1 to 8.0 g/dL, but every gram per deciliter drop in hemoglobin below 7 led to a 2.5 increase odds of death. It must be remembered that hemoglobin will continue to decrease after admission to the hospital, with a nadir often occurring around hospital day 4.

A 79-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department after a ground level fall. On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically normal with an unremarkable primary survey. The secondary survey demonstrated pelvic tenderness to palpation. A pelvic radiograph and subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated left inferior and superior rami, sacral wing, and iliac bone fractures with pelvic hematoma and a focus of contrast extravasation. Approximately 1 hour after initial presentation, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 76 mm Hg. The trauma surgery team was consulted. On evaluation, the patient was alert with appropriate mentation. The abdominal examination was notable for tenderness in the lower abdominal quadrants. Radial arterial line confirmed SBP < 80 mm Hg, which was transiently responsive to intravenous fluid boluses. The patient carried a legal document and verbally stated that she was a Jehovah's Witness and declined transfusion of all blood products; however, she would accept autologous transfusion or cell salvage.

### Management of anemia in patients who decline blood transfusion [^88620d67]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Declining a treatment modality should not be considered the same as refusal of medical care as illustrated by the management of Jehovah's Witness patients who do not accept transfusions. Over the years, a comprehensive set of strategies have been developed to meet the specific needs of these patients and these strategies are collectively called "Bloodless Medicine and Surgery" (BMS). The focus in BMS is to optimize the patients' hematopoietic capacity to increase hemoglobin (Hgb) level, minimize blood loss, improve hemostasis, and provide supportive strategies to minimize oxygen consumption and maximize oxygen utilization. We present 3 case reports that illustrate some of the challenges faced and measures available to effectively treat these patients. Under BMS programs, patients with extremely low hemoglobin levels, not conducive to survival under ordinary conditions, have survived and recovered without receiving allogeneic transfusions. Additionally, the valuable experience gained from caring for these patients has paved the way to develop the concept of Patient Blood Management as a standard care to benefit all patients, and not only those for whom blood is not an option.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^e8875c4a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

No statistically significant difference was found between groups in the preoperative or postoperative period for hemoglobin and creatinine concentrations or platelet counts (Table 3). Among the control group, the mean preoperative hemoglobin value was significantly less in transfused patients (12.5 ± 2.1 g/dL versus 14.2 ± 1.3 g/dL for the non-transfused control group, p = 0.001, Fig. 1). This finding is indicative of the importance of "normal" preoperative hemoglobin levels to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Erythropoietin was administered to 4 Jehovah's Witnesses preoperatively for low hemoglobin and to 3 more during hospitalization for the same reason. Our center is especially interested in patient blood management strategies; therefore, we adopted a restricted transfusion policy for all the population we are taking in charge. In this study, only 17 of 62 (27.4%) patients in the control group were transfused with a total of 39 units of red blood cells. Eight of them received only 1 unit of red blood cells and four of them 2 units (Fig. 2). We can reasonably assume that some patients who received only one unit, were transfused to correct a possible hemodilution status frequently present at least until the 3rd postoperative day. These patients could have avoided blood transfusion if a more clinically-oriented approach had been used. Thus, although our transfusion rate is very competitive with regards to the literature, further improvement in blood saving is still possible.

### Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiogenic shock in a jehovah's witness patient [^0e6bb914]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) may support hemodynamics of patients experiencing cardiogenic shock refractory to medical management. We present a 62-year-old Jehovah's Witness female with a history of smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, and anemia presenting with acute myocardial infarction and ensuing cardiogenic shock that required V-A ECMO support due to persistent hemodynamic instability and hypoxemia. Meticulous care to blood saving strategies were employed contributing to the successful management of the patient. These strategies included minimizing frequency of laboratory testing, use of micro-pediatric tubes, meticulous tissue handling to minimize blood loss during decannulation and administration of supplementary agents (vitamin B12, folic acid, iron, and erythropoietin) in consideration with the ethical concerns of the patients and their family. During the patient's hospital stay, their hemoglobin decreased from 14.6 mg/dL to as low as 7.6 mg/dL 3 days after decannulation. To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of V-A ECMO support in a Jehovah's Witness patient and the first reported critical care case. In conclusion, employing a bloodless strategy and adhering to recommended practices can yield positive outcomes for patients who do not accept blood transfusions requiring V-A ECMO.

Supplements

Multiple case reports in managing Jehovah's Witness trauma patients recommend supplementation with iron, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. Multiple dosages and formulations are available. One recommended regimen for iron is intravenous iron sucrose given 100 mg daily until hemoglobin is over 7 g/dL. Vitamin B12 may be given in 1000 µg intravenous doses, and folate 1 mg orally per day.

Other Considerations

Blood draws should be minimized, and micro or pediatric tubes should be used when possible. As a general rule, thromboprophylaxis should not be held in the anemic Jehovah's witness trauma population as they remain at a high risk of thromboembolic events which could be fatal in an anemic patient with less physiologic reserve. This should be examined on a case-by-case basis. Anemic patients who refuse blood transfusion should be managed in the intensive care unit because of their increased mortality and need for close monitoring. Critically ill patients should be placed on proton pump inhibitors to reduce the risk of worsening anemia from peptic ulcers.

If a patient becomes hypotensive secondary to acute blood loss anemia and does not respond to the above measures, pressors may need to be started. If norepinephrine and vasopressin fail to improve blood pressure, methylene blue may be used as a last line effort.

Unlabelled

Complex cardiac surgery often requires blood transfusion. Some patients refuse transfusion, even when it is potentially life-threatening to do so. Although recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been used to reduce the need for blood transfusion, it has been considered ineffective in critically ill patients. The time course of hematological responses in a Jehovah's Witness patient with acute renal failure and severe cardiac disease suggests that a trial of rhEPO should be considered for salvage therapy in critically ill patients.

Implications

The authors describe successful treatment of life-threatening anemia using recombinant human erythropoietin in a critically ill Jehovah's Witness patient after cardiac surgery.

Anemia is a complication of severe burn injury. Burn patients who refuse blood transfusions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, present difficult challenges, and treatment paradigms need to be altered to reduce blood loss and increase red cell restoration. In this report the authors present a case of a 36-year-old Jehovah's Witness who suffered a 35% TBSA burn injury. In addition to standard burn injury treatment, the authors attempted to reduce blood loss with a combination of intraoperative (tranexamic acid) and perioperative (erythropoietin, intravenous iron) strategies.

### Jehovah's witness head and neck free flap reconstruction patient outcomes [^6db202ce]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian religious denomination that rejects the transfusion of whole blood and component blood products. Given new transfusion-free strategies, Jehovah's Witness patients are undergoing free flap reconstructions with increased regularity. However, outcome data remains limited. With this study, we sought to examine post-operative outcomes in Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing free flap reconstruction of the head and neck, compare their outcomes to non-Jehovah's Witness patients, and enumerate strategies to enhance the safety of transfusion-free surgery.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was carried out on 10 patients who identified as Jehovah's Witness and 63 patients who did not. Demographic information, pre-operative laboratory values, peri-operative resuscitative interventions, and peri-operative outcome measures were compiled. Descriptive data analysis, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square tests, and multivariate analysis were used.

Results

Jehovah's Witness patients were significantly older than non-Jehovah's Witness patients (p = 0.03) and had significantly higher ASA scores (p = 0.009). Head and neck cancer was the primary surgical indication in both groups (p = 0.71). Jehovah's witness patients have significantly less intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.011) and lower post-operative hemoglobin (p = 0.002) compared to non-Jehovah's Witness patients. While Jehovah's Witness patients had significantly higher rates of severe anemia (p = 0.014), there was no significant difference between the two groups in other post-operative complications and readmission rates even in a multivariate analysis accounting for age and ASA score.

Conclusions

Free flap microvascular reconstruction can be reliably performed on Jehovah's Witness head and neck patients without an increased risk of complication. Policies such as the use of non-blood volume expanders, albumin, Epogen, perioperative iron supplementation, cell saver and acute normovolemic hemodilution are key to ensuring good outcomes.

### Timing and volume of transfusion for adult major trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock: a registry-based cohort study [^e0a0c670]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In a mature adult trauma center, times to blood component therapy were short, and further reductions in times to transfusion are unlikely to be associated with a mortality benefit. Age, shock severity and TBI were identified as non-modifiable risk factors for hospital mortality. The need for high volume of blood product transfusion and the time to operative or angiographic hemorrhage control were potentially modifiable risk factors.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^54c30af5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Jehovah's Witnesses refuse the transfusion of blood products, based on Biblical passages citing to "abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood" (Acts 15:19–20). Before major surgery, these patients are confronted with the stress of both the operation and the potential need for transfusion. The role of the health care provider is to assure the physical and psychological welfare of patients while respecting their philosophical and religious beliefs. However, despite the important evolution of blood preservation techniques, there is still a great risk for transfusion in cardiac surgery. Transfusion rates during hospitalization for a cardiac surgery procedure vary from 25 to 95%. In this context, cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses represents a real challenge, necessitating a close collaboration between the surgical, anesthesiological, and medical teams. However, due to the Jehovah's Witnesses' "natural experiment of blood abstention", the overall need for transfusion during cardiac surgery should be reevaluated. Recent studies did not find any difference in terms of mortality between Jehovah's Witnesses and a control group after cardiac surgery. Moreover, the deleterious effects of blood transfusions in terms of postoperative morbidity and long term mortality after cardiac surgery, along with the cost and shortage of available blood products, suggest tighter transfusion protocols. In this context, the investigation of surgical outcomes in Jehovah's Witnesses helps to evaluate the limits of transfusion safety and cut off points for transfusion, while improving the hospital care of this challenging group of patients. The aim of this study was to document our center's experience with complex cardiac surgery, including reoperations and urgent operations, in a non-selected Jehovah's Witness group and to compare surgical outcomes with a matched control group.

This article addresses the challenges surrounding hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) treatment in Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs), focusing on the complexities arising from their refusal of blood products and transfusions. Acknowledging the heightened risk of blood loss anemia during joint replacement surgery, this review explores documented strategies that enable safe elective joint arthroplasty in JW patients, emphasizing comparable initial diagnostic methods and non-operative treatments up until the pre-operative stage. Special considerations should be taken in the perioperative and intraoperative stage. Despite these challenges, safe arthroplasty is feasible with satisfactory outcomes through a combination of careful preoperative optimization, blood saving protocols, and cultural sensitivity.

There was no significant difference in surgical outcomes. Hospital mortality was 3% for Jehovah's Witnesses versus 2% for control group, p = 0.548. The postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was similar between groups (p = 0.912). No stroke was observed in our series. One control patient had acute myocardial infarction but did not require a prolonged hospital stay. One Jehovah's Witness, who underwent surgery for an off pump coronary artery bypass, required 12 h of intra-aortic balloon pump support immediately after surgery. No significant differences were found in the lengths of the mechanical ventilation support (p = 0.218), the intensive care unit stay (p = 0.080), or the postoperative stay (p = 0.223, Table 4). Only 17 of the 62 (27.4%) control group patients were transfused with a total of 39 units of red blood cells concentrates (0.63 ± 1.5 units per patient, 2.3 ± 2.2 units per transfused patient). No Jehovah's Witness patient was transfused (Table 4, Figs. 1 and 2).

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^b4cf5240]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Specific consideration must be reserved to unemancipated minors and patients unable to understand and want. (Grade of recommendation: 1C)

There are patients who may decline blood transfusions for various reasons, most commonly due to religious beliefs. The most prominent group of patients in this category are the Jehovah's Witness (JWs) (Table 1). Some national well known health services and associations developed recommendations for surgeons caring for patients declining blood transfusion. In general surgeons highly value and respect patient autonomy and simultaneously desire to provide high-quality and effective treatment. On the other hand, exists necessity to contribute to prevent the death of a patient. This may be even more difficult to achieve in those patients whose death might be prevented by transfusing blood. To provide optimal care for patients who are JWs, surgeons should aim to respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. As this topic presents many different and articulated arguments, it is not possible to provide blanket guidelines or standards for the care of JWs and all those patients who may decline blood transfusion. The attempt to delineate precise recommendations about when and what to use blood product, especially in emergency setting, may bring serious unintended consequences. Each person declining blood transfusions, whether for religious or personal reasons, is unique, independent and possesses personal wishes, values, and beliefs about what is acceptable therapy. It is crucial that surgeons and patients accurately discuss what they may accept or not in term of blood product and also the circumstances and the criticalities that may present during emergency management of acute surgical or traumatic illness. It should be noted that many patients who decline blood transfusion (i.e. whole blood, red blood cells, white cells, platelets, plasma) for religious reasons will permit the use of cell salvage and many other blood conservation modalities. (See table below.) Moreover, many will accept derivatives of primary blood components ("blood fractions") (e.g. clotting factor concentrates, albumin, immunoglobulins). The community help is fundamental. In fact, many JW patients have already clarified their own beliefs regarding transfusions and usually have some documents outlying very clearly their preferences. Those patients declining blood transfusions very often present for treatment with relatives or other representatives of their faith helping them during the hospital admission and ensuring that their treatment instructions are respected. On the other hand, clinicians should conduct an informed consent discussion by offering information in language the patient will understand of the various therapeutic options and the risks and benefits of each option. Clinicians should avoid generalization and consult with individual patients as to what each one's religious conscience dictates. Some patients might accept products containing derivatives of either primary cellular components or plasma, or surgical or extracorporeal blood management methods, whereas others may refuse them. Such a discussion must be done without coercion. The right to privacy must be respected and the patient must have if needed the time to discuss alone with the doctors about their beliefs and requests. Physicians must respect each patient's will, but also explain the potential consequences of declining blood transfusion. During treatment, the patient is free to change his/her mind. In fact, some may very clearly state their preference to decline allogeneic blood transfusion in nonemergent and non-life-threatening situations but may change their mind if their life is a risk. All patients must be warranted the right to change their mind. It is the surgeon's responsibility to clarify, without any antagonism the patient's preference to decline transfusion is stable and would not change if there was a risk to life. In the emergency setting, whenever the patients may not have the capacity to express their will, the decisional process about if to proceed with transfusion or not may potentially delay the treatment and lead to the patient's death. Treatment delays can be avoided by reviewing an incapable patient's advance medical directive (Durable Power of Attorney), recent record of hospitalization, or speaking with the patient's appointed substitute decision-maker. If there is no clear indication of the patient's treatment instructions or relevant wishes, surgeons are on solid ground in treating the patient using all available modalities under the standard of presumed consent. When a patient has an advance directive clearly refusing allogeneic blood transfusion, that directive must be followed. In the case of unemancipated patients and or children the management must in general warrant the right of the patient to be cured. Legal tutors have limited right to manage certain life-threatening behaviours and it must be case-by case referred to the local country and state laws.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^922e2d9e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Current literature reports transfusion rates from 25% to 95%, with an average rate around 50%. Blood transfusion in cardiac surgery is associated with several adverse effects. A recent meta-analysis concerning the risk of red blood cell transfusions in cardiac surgery reported that transfused patients are at greater risk of developing postoperative infectious complications and acute myocardial infarction, have prolonged length of stay postoperatively in the intensive care unit and hospital, and have increased long term mortality. Moreover, red blood cell transfusion is associated with a significantly increased hospital cost. On the other hand, there are situations where a blood transfusion is lifesaving. It has been reported that hemoglobin levels < 7 g/dL in surgical patients who refused blood transfusion, regardless of type of surgery, is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. The same study reported a mortality of more than 40% for patients with hemoglobin levels < 5 g/dL. In our center, we try to respect a threshold of 7 g/dL of hemoglobin for blood transfusions. We accept a relative hemodilution state in the early postoperative period when most blood loss occurs, and we interrupt anti-aggregation therapy 7 days before surgery for planned operations. In addition, we pay major attention in controlling hypertension, especially in the early postoperative period. With this policy, we are able to limit blood transfusion rate after cardiac surgery to 25–30%.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^55718c39]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses may be challenging during the operation and postoperative period given their refusal of blood products. The aim of this study was to document our center's experience with Jehovah's Witnesses undergoing major cardiac surgery and to compare surgical outcomes with a matched control group.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the demographic, perioperative, and in-hospital postoperative data for 31 Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing surgery from 1991 to 2012 and compared findings with a control group of 62 patients of the same sex and age, who underwent the same type of operations in the same period. Early mortality, major in-hospital morbidity, laboratory findings, and hospital stays were compared between groups.

Results

Demographic data were similar between groups, except that more patients in the Jehovah's Witness group had extracardiac arteriopathy compared with controls (p = 0.04). There was no difference in predicted mortality, calculated by the Euroscore II, between groups (2.8 ± 3.3 in study group versus 2.4 ± 2.2 in control group, p = 0.469). For postoperative outcomes, there were no differences between Jehovah's Witnesses versus controls in hospital mortality (3% versus 2%, p = 0.548), total drain loss (847 ± 583 mL versus 812 ± 365 mL, p = 0.721), mechanical ventilation time (1.26 ± 2.24 versus 0.89 ± 0.55 days, p = 0.218), intensive care unit stay (4.3 ± 3.9 versus 3 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.080), and hospital stay (12.9 ± 7.6 versus 10.9 ± 6.6 days, p = 0.223).

Conclusions

Outcomes after cardiac surgery are similar between Jehovah's Witnesses and general population, in centers applying rigorous blood patient management protocols.

Surgical Considerations

Surgical Intervention

If the patient is severely anemic and has multiple nonorthopaedic injuries contributing to acute blood loss anemia (such as solid organ lacerations), it will likely be in the patient's best interest to proceed with damage control orthopaedics (DCO) until hemoglobin improves. For example, initial external fixation for lower extremity long bone fractures and splinting for the remainder of the extremity injuries. A treatment protocol for DCO is summarized in Figure 1. DCO was found to have markedly lower blood loss than early total care. Tourniquets should be used when possible. Topical hemostatic and vasoconstrictive agents should be used as well, although certain active hemostats, such as fibrin sealants, are derived from human fibrinogen and thus may not be considered acceptable by some individuals. Red blood cell salvage is more likely to be accepted if a closed circuit is used. Red blood cell salvage can be used from surgical drains as well, but this is often not accepted because it is not a closed circuit. Patient positioning can also affect intraoperative bleeding risk. If prone positioning is necessary, use positioning where the abdomen is free or Jack-Knife positioning. If supine, tilting the bed to the left will take pressure off of the inferior vena cava, therefore reducing venous bleeding from venous hypertension. Elevating the site of surgery will also help reduce blood loss.

Image illustrating systematic approach to Damage Control Orthopaedics in the Jehovah's Witness Population.

Anesthesia Considerations

Permissive hypotension, a strategy to reduce blood loss in certain elective surgeries, is often contraindicated in orthopaedic trauma patients. Increased mortality rates are seen in trauma patients with traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and blunt force trauma when permissive hypotension is used due to reduced organ perfusion.

Normovolemic hemodilution may be used. Hypothermia should be avoided as hypothermia leads to platelet dysfunction and further blood loss. Neuraxial anesthesia may be considered to reduce intraoperative blood loss.

Discussion

Two key factors led us in deciding to offer LT to JW patients. The first was our large experience in the procedure. In fact, we transplanted our first JW patient in 2007, 11 years and 930 procedures from the start of our LT program in 1996. The second was the rate of bloodless LT characterizing our activity in the years prior to that decision. In our experience, a careful selection of recipients was a key-player as we decided to admit JW patients to the pre-LT screening only if they did not show indicators of severe portal hypertension since bleeding in LT is predominantly linked to portal hypertension rather than primary coagulopathy. Thus, early referral and careful timing for listing is highly desirable in these patients. Predicting cases requiring peri-operative transfusions is very desirable, particularly in JW patients, but it remains a very difficult task in LT. In fact, despite several investigations have attempted to identify preoperative predictors of blood transfusion, their value remain inconsistent and weak. In recent years, models to predict blood utilization with preoperative variables have been proposed. However, their limitations and differences in the results highlight significant concerns about their generalizability and recognize that it may be very difficult to develop a single, reliable, and universally applicable model to predict transfusion requirements for patients undergoing LT. In our series, the use of techniques that minimize blood loss played a major role. The adoption of a fluid restriction policy and low CVP is important as it results helpful in decreasing blood transfusion requirements during LT. In fact, liberal volume loading in cirrhotic patients tends to pool in the splanchnic circulation with minimal improvement in cardiac preload or output but increased risk of surgical bleeding because of congestion of the portal circulation. Moreover, dilution of clotting factors and clot disturbance can result, particularly if colloids are used. Further, lowering the pressure in the central veins can help in minimizing blood loss also because it may augment venous drainage from the liver, encouraging flow of blood away from the surgical field. Other intra-operative blood conservation strategies can be important to achieve transfusion-free surgery. In our JW patients we performed ANH but only in selected patients in order not to excessively dilute clotting factors, including PLT. Finally, in the view of a multimodal strategy aimed at reducing blood loss, we used in all cases the veno-venous bypass to minimize the impact of mesenteric congestion and abdominal bleeding during portal and caval cross-clamping. In case of peri-operative coagulopathy, since JW will not accept fresh frozen plasma or platelets, the use of coagulation factor concentrates and/or tranexamic acid guided by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) or thrombelastography (TEG™) should be considered. Therefore, the use of fibrinogen concentrate (which can support fibrin clotting without transfusion of PLT), clotting factors concentrates and tranexamic acid should be explained and proposed to these patients in the consideration that acceptance of blood fractions by JW depends on patient's free will, apart from church doctrine. Regarding the use of recombinant erythropoietin to optimize red cell mass, it has a number of potential benefits. The most obvious is that patients will start LT with a higher blood Hb level that, besides enabling use of ANH, correlates with peri-operative low or no use of red blood cells transfusion. Since erythropoietin's use was associated to a possible risk of thromboembolism, we performed regular clinical and laboratory monitoring of LT candidates on erythropoietin treatment also in consideration that the waiting time for a suitable deceased donor is unpredictable. The use of ICS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma could be discussed because of the potential risk of infusing malignant cells into patients. To date, 4 studies have evaluated the oncological safety of using ICS in LT. One concluded that the device is effective in removing malignant cells from the aspirate, except in cases of tumor rupture whereas the other 3, evaluating clinical outcomes such as mortality and recurrence, did not demonstrate negative effects associated with the use of ICS. On the contrary, the use of cell salvage during LT for hepatocellular carcinoma has been found to reduce the exposure to allogeneic blood and to be cost-effective. In summary, also according to the most recent guidelines, despite theoretical risks and benefits, there is no conclusive evidence that ICS can induce metastases or affect cancer prognosis. The theoretical risk of inducing metastatic spread (unproven) is offset by reduced allogeneic transfusion and immunomodulation, which is proven. During the last decade, blood product requirements in LT patients have significantly decreased in most centres. This improvement was related to different factors including better surgical techniques, LT indication and liver graft preservation techniques. Also, experience of the surgical and anesthesiological team is important. In particular, surgical experience and skill during hepatic dissection and meticulous hemostasis has long been recognized as meaningful in determining the amount of intraoperative blood loss.

Surgical repair of congenital heart disease during cardiopulmonary bypass is common, and performing these complicated procedures in the absence of blood transfusions is especially challenging. A case of a Jehovah's Witness child who underwent surgical repair of a ventricular septal defect utilizing a new tetrastarch for autologous normovolemic hemodilution is reported. A successful operative repair was achieved without the need for non-autologous blood transfusion.

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^d8d3245a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Rao et al. performed a meta-analysis of three large international trials of patients with acute coronary syndromes to determine whether blood transfusion to correct anaemia in this setting was associated with improved survival. They found significantly higher mortality among patients who underwent transfusion compared with those who did not, prompting them to urge caution in the use of transfusion to maintain arbitrary hematocrit levels in stable patients with ischemic heart disease in an observational cohort study of 11,963 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery, each unit of red blood cells transfused was associated with an incrementally increased risk of adverse outcome (eg, mortality, renal injury, need for ventilator support, lengthened hospital stay, infection). The latter study found that transfusion was the single factor most reliably associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity

2) Techniques of Blood Conservation

In 2005 we reported our initial experience in 200 Jehovah's witness patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Since then, we have had to deal with the withdrawal of Aprotinin which we thought was an important weapon in our therapeutic armentarium. The change of protocol by 1 g at induction and 1 g at the end of bypass of EACA did not alter our final results and this change did not alter in our bleeding control in any way. Fifty years of research into the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic use of antifibrinolytics for cardiac surgical patients demonstrate that aprotinin and EACA reduce postoperative blood loss and consequently, the requirement for blood transfusions and reoperation for bleeding compared to placebo or treatment. Traditionally, evidence in favor of EACA is not compelling, but in head-to-head comparisons there is an increased risk of death among patients receiving aprotinin compared to those on lysine analog as indicated by the BART trial. All of these have been demonstrated on huge series including over 12,000 patients. These differences did not appear in our two small groups. The aim of all efforts to reduce the need of allogeneic blood transfusions is to avoid associated risks. There should particularly be a favourable effect according to the rate of transfusion-transmitted virus infections and immunological side-effects. The acceptance of an individually adjusted lowest haematocrit level and the minimisation of intra-operative blood loss by the application of optimal surgical techniques are among the most essential strategies to reduce or even avoid allogeneic blood transfusions

### Safety of cardiac surgery without blood transfusion: a retrospective study in jehovah's witness patients [^52accc50]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the utilisation of blood products and outcomes following cardiac surgery for 123 Jehovah's Witnesses and 4219 non-Jehovah's Witness patient controls. The study took place over a 7-year period at the Amphia Hospital in Breda, the Netherlands. A specific protocol was used in the management of Jehovah's Witness patients, while the control group received blood without restriction according to their needs. Patients' characteristics were comparable in both groups. Pre-operatively, the mean (SD) Euro Score was higher in the Jehovah's Witness group (3.2 (2.6) vs 2.7 (2.5), respectively; p < 0.02). Pre-operative haemoglobin concentration was higher in the Jehovah's Witness group (8.9 (0.7) vs 8.6 (0.9) g.dl(-1), respectively; p < 0.001). The total cardiopulmonary bypass time did not differ between groups. The requirement for allogenic blood transfusion was 0% in the Jehovah's Witness group compared to 65% in the control group. Postoperatively, there was a lower incidence of Q-wave myocardial infarction (2 (1.8%) vs 323 (7.7%), respectively; p < 0.02), and non Q-wave infarction (11 (9.8%) vs 559 (13.2%), respectively; p < 0.02) in the Jehovah's Witness group compared with controls. Mean (SD) length of stay in the intensive care unit (2.3 (3.2) vs 2.6 (4.2) days; p = 0.26), re-admission rate to the intensive care unit (5 (4.5%) vs 114 (2.7%); p = 0.163), and mortality (3 (2.7%) vs 65 (1.5%); p = 0.59), did not differ between the Jehovah's Witness and control groups, respectively.

### Open heart surgery in jehovah's witnesses: a propensity score analysis [^2c3e819f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) refuse allogeneic blood transfusions and therefore pose a unique challenge in case of major surgery. This retrospective study reviewed an experience with JW patients who were undergoing open heart surgery.

Methods

By using patient blood management strategies, 35 adult JW patients underwent cardiac surgery at Kepler University Hospital in Linz, Austria between 2008 and 2017. Outcomes were compared with patients who accepted blood transfusions (non-JW patients) by using propensity score matching.

Results

There were no significant differences in clinical and operative data between the groups. Twelve JW patients (34.3%) were pretreated with erythropoietin and iron, with a preoperative increase in mean hemoglobin of 2.0 g/dL. On admission, hemoglobin was 14.1 ± 1.1 g/dL in JW patients, compared with 13.2 ± 2.0 g/dL in non-JW patients (P = 0.022). The hematocrit in JW patients was higher throughout the hospital stay, even though 51.4% of non-JW patients received allogeneic red blood cell transfusions. The perioperative red blood cell loss was significantly lower in JW patients than in non-JW patients (619 ± 420 mL vs 929 ± 520 mL; P = 0.010). Major complication rates were not different between the groups. The hemoglobin at discharge was 11.5 ± 1.5 g/dL in JW patients compared with 10.3 ± 1.3 g/dL in non-JW patients (P < .001). In-hospital mortality was 2.9% in each group, and long-term survival was comparable.

Conclusions

By implementing patient blood management, open heart surgery in JW patients can be performed with low morbidity and mortality. Preoperative optimization of hemoglobin and minimization of perioperative blood loss are cornerstones in the prevention of blood loss, anemia, and transfusions.

None of these patients received transfusions regardless of the circumstances of the procedure. All benefited from treatment equivalent to what they would have received had they not been Jehovah's witnesses. This is particularly true for the choice of valve substitute or conduit graft in revascularization procedures which were again not influenced by the fact that they were Jehovah's witnesses.

The operative risk of these patients was assessed by a passable Euroscore of 4.1 ± 0.8 to 4.9 ± 1.3 (p < 0.05) in groups A and B respectively. In group B, we took into account two aortic dissections and one adult congenital heart disease, as well as patients who had previously underwent cardiac surgery. In group B, although the proportion of patients who were diabetic, female, or had low ejection fractions increased, and the number of patients over 70 years of age doubled, the incidence of massive bleeding (defined as leading to hypovolemia or shock) decreased.

Despite the increased risk associated with group B, operative mortality diminished, due to progress in surgical and medical techniques. We did not observe significant renal failure, mediastinitis or enzymatic increase indicative of myocardial suffering. Conversely we did not observe stents occlusion in the patients with drug eluting stents in whom antiplatelet therapy has been discontinued. Thus, recently-operated patients had a greater level of hemoglobin. The thoracic drain output was halved (515 mL ± 31 vs 350 mL ± 140, in groups A and B respectively) without major modification or a more minimally invasive surgical technique, as shown by the equivalent ischemic times. The perioperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were better controlled in group B (Figures 1 and 2). 223/250 of the patients in group B were treated with preoperative EPO due to insufficient hemoglobin levels (11 ± 2 g/l).

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^71364a50]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury

Current doctrine focuses on the reduction of secondary tissue injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Restoration of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in circulatory shock is critical to ensure oxygen delivery to the brain. Guidelines advocate in favor of an initial systolic blood pressure target over 110 mmHg in patients with severe TBI and advise against permissive hypotension strategies. Clinicians must therefore prioritize between two conflicting clinical strategies of either neuroprotection or hemorrhage limitation. Furthermore, in traumatology shock can arise from multiple causes that do not necessarily involve severe hemorrhage (tension pneumothorax, neurogenic hypotension, pericardial effusion). Such differential diagnoses highly complexify the clinician's dilemma if TBI is suspected.

The evidence underlying current guidelines in favor of increased blood pressure targets consists unfortunately of observational studies suggesting increased mortality rates among patients with prehospital or admission hypotension with TBI. Fuller et al. in 2013, estimated odds of death to be doubled for an admission SBP below 100 mmHg and tripled below 90 mmHg among a population of patients with AIS head scores above 2. Observational studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between prehospital blood pressure and in hospital mortality in TBI suggesting that hypertension could be also detrimental to survival. Recent observational data suggests that elderly patients could benefit from higher blood pressure levels highlighting the existence of potential high-risk subgroups. The body of evidence supporting the existence of a unique lower threshold defining critical hypotension is limited. Spaite et al. for instance observed a linear association between SBP and mortality. In their cohort, two patients with a SBP difference of 10 mmHg differed in their odds of death by 18.8%.

Despite the low level of evidence, hypotension appears to be a major secondary insult among patients with TBI that must be avoided at all costs. However, safe blood pressure levels as well as the definition of specific subgroups of patients at higher risk remain unclear and must be addressed by future RCTs.

Treatment of hypotension among patients with TBI can be achieved through fluid expansion strategies. Hypotonic crystalloids must be avoided as they maximize vasogenic oedema and have been shown to increase mortality. Hypertonic solutions have failed to show increased survival rates and improvements in neurologic outcomes after severe TBI. Current guidelines therefore recommend the use of 0,9% sodium chloride as it is easily accessible and more cost effective. The safety and efficacy of vasopressor use in combination to fluid expansion strategies in TBI remains uncertain and must be assessed by future RCTs.

### Outcomes in cardiac surgery in 500 consecutive jehovah's witness patients: 21 year experience [^18cbb6c5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Between January 1991 and January 2012, elective cardiac surgery was performed on 500 Jehovah's Witness patients, all of whom gave informed consent with emphasis on the risks of non-transfusion. During this period, 622 patients were referred to our team and 122 were excluded (Table 1). Until 1998, 37 patients were excluded because their hemoglobin level was below 14 g/l, which was no longer the case afterwards due to the systematic use of Erythropoietin. Consultation with local ethics committee established inclusion and exclusion criteria, thus we excluded emergency procedures, congenital heart disease, cardiogenic shock, patients in whom a prolonged EPO treatment did not produce a hemoglobin level of 14 g, patients with problems of hemostasis or those in whom coagulopathy was anticipated following the implementation of extra-corporal circulation (cold agglutinin coagulopathy, sickle cell disease) and patients with thoraco-abdominal aneurysms in which we could not reasonably avoid transfusion. Three patients suffering from aortic dissection were excluded due to initial preoperative hemoglobin levels below 15 g/l. Three patients could not be operated upon due to it being impossible to attain sufficient levels of hemoglobin prior to the scheduled procedure, despite a month of EPO treatment. One of these patients showed signs of an increase in the size of a type 1 aortic dissection which became chronic following his refusal of a transfusion despite the advice of the care team. The other patient could not be operated upon due to a reaction to EPO of unidentifiable cause.

The method of blood conservation utilized over the years has evolved, resulting in the adoption of the "Comprehensive Multimodality Blood Conservation Program" developed by Cornell University, detailed on Table 2. Aprotinin and EPO were used as dictated by protocol (Table 3). Aprotinin, which enhances erythrocyte hematopoiesis was used in all our patients according to Hammersmith Hospital protocol until its withdrawal in 2007, then aminocaproic acid is used in all cases. Prior to 1998, all patients with hemoglobin levels below 14 g/l were refused. After 1998, EPO was used systematically in all our patients with hemoglobin levels below 14 g/l prior to surgical intervention. The issue of cost did not arise as a factor as this medication was paid for by the patients. The relatively high level of hemoglobin was intended to extend the safety margin in these patients in whom postoperative transfusion was not an option.

### Fluid resuscitation and blood replacement in patients with polytrauma [^d1c7f23d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Hemorrhage is the most common cause of shock in patients with polytrauma, leading to cellular hypoxia and death. A large body of experimental and clinical research has greatly expanded our knowledge of cellular mechanisms and clinical outcomes in resuscitation of patients with hypovolemic shock. However, the fundamental principles of fluid resuscitation have not changed during the past few decades. Aggressive resuscitation to correct tissue hypoperfusion within 24 hours of injury is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Initial volume expanders of choice are crystalloid solutions, with blood and blood products used for patients who are hemodynamically unstable, patients with Class III and Class IV hemorrhage, and patients with ongoing uncontrolled sources of bleeding. The incidence of immunologic and infectious complications associated with blood transfusions in resuscitation of patients with polytrauma has not been shown to be any higher than in other clinical settings. Massive resuscitations, however, are associated with specific complications such as hypothermia, coagulopathy, and abdominal compartment syndrome. Novel blood substitutes, hypertonic saline, and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring techniques have the potential of optimizing fluid resuscitation in patients with polytrauma. Additional research using standardized animal models and randomized clinical trials is needed.

### Comparisons of cardiac surgery outcomes in jehovah's versus non-jehovah's witnesses [^41676d2f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian faith whose members will not accept blood or blood products under any circumstances on the basis of religious grounds. To date, no comparative studies have evaluated the outcome of open heart surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses compared with patients who accept the transfusion of blood products. The present study was conducted to systematically compare the operative mortality and early clinical outcome after open cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses versus non-Jehovah's Witnesses. From January 1990 to July 2004, 49 Jehovah's Witness patients underwent cardiac surgery, and their data were compared with those of a contemporaneous control group of 196 non-Jehovah's Witnesses. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare operative mortality, postoperative intensive care unit care, and hospital length of stay between the 2 groups, controlling for preoperative risk factors. The Jehovah's Witnesses were matched in a 1:4 ratio to the non-Jehovah's Witnesses using propensity scores. No significant differences were identified in unadjusted stroke (p = 0.5), acute myocardial infarction (p = 0.6), new-onset atrial fibrillation (p = 0.106), prolonged ventilation (p = 0.82), acute renal failure (p = 0.70), and hemorrhage-related reexploration (p = 0.59) rates between the 2 groups. On multivariate analysis, Jehovah's Witnesses had operative mortality (odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 3.59, p = 0.63), intensive care unit stay (odds ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 3.97, p = 0.58), and postoperative length of stay (odds ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 2.20, p = 0.16) comparable to those of the non-Jehovah's Witnesses, after controlling for preoperative risk factors through matching. In conclusion, cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses is associated with clinical outcomes comparable to those of non-Jehovah's Witnesses by adhering to blood conservation protocols.

### Outcomes from cardiac surgery in jehovah's witness patients: experience over twenty-one years [^1b19ea44]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the current study we presented the outcomes after cardiac surgery for a non-selected group of Jehovah's Witnesses (n = 31) operated in our cardiac surgery department from 1991 to 2012. Outcomes and demographic variables were compared with a matched control group (n = 62) as described above. No difference was demonstrated in terms of hospital mortality, in-hospital morbidity, or the intensive care or hospital length of stay. Hemoglobin levels remained similar between groups, both pre- and postoperatively.

Previous, non-comparative studies provided evidence that cardiac surgery can be safely performed in Jehovah's Witnesses, with acceptable outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity. Moreover, a literature search identified four retrospective comparative studies evaluating cardiac surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses in comparison to a control group of patients. Three studies compared outcomes after cardiac surgery between Jehovah's Witnesses and a control group of matched transfused patients and another one between Jehovah's Witnesses and a matched group regardless of blood transfusion. A comparison of the major demographic data and surgical outcomes between our study and previous comparative studies is shown in Table 5.

Our Jehovah's Witness group differed significantly from other studies regarding the type of cardiac surgery procedures. Patients underwent a variety of high risk surgical procedures, including urgent operations, reoperations, double valve surgery, combined valve and coronary surgery and ascending aorta procedures (Tables 2, 5). More precisely, in our group only 54% of all procedures were isolated coronary bypass surgery; whereas, El Azab et al. reported more than 90% coronary by-pass surgeries for the Jehovah's Witness group. In the other three studies, which compared Jehovah's Witnesses to a matched transfused group, coronary bypass surgery accounted for 51%, 65%, and 78% of all cases. Moreover, in our study, 10% of all procedures were reoperations, which were not reported in the other studies (Table 5).

Hemoglobin solutions

Modified hemoglobin solutions are not substitutes for blood as they do not possess the metabolic functions of erythrocytes. They act purely as oxygen carriers. Large-scale investigation and experimentation in this field has occurred, with uses not only limited to trauma patients but also general surgical patients, oncology patients and Jehovah's Witnesses suffering from severe anemia resulting from various reasons. The only product that was registered for use, in South Africa and later Russia, was Hemopure (R) (HbO2 Therapeutics LLC, South Africa), used in isolation as well as in combination with blood products, or as a bridge to blood transfusion. Hemoglobin solutions do not only help oxygen transportation, but also enhance the release of oxygen from native hemoglobin at tissue level with some of them having a positive inotropic effect that may be useful in shocked trauma patients. This positive inotropy is related to the rate of administration and if given slowly is negligible. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were rare with the most serious being fluid overload. A recent review of the literature highlights several flaws in Natanson's previous meta-analysis suggesting that although a small minority of HBOCs have had serious adverse events (myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents), this cannot be extrapolated as a class effect due to the vast differences among HBOCs with respect to their structure, hemoglobin concentration and nitric oxide scavenging effects. In light of this, there is renewed interest in the use of HBOCs, especially the Hemopure (R) (HbO2 Therapeutics LLC, South Africa) compound, which to date has had the most success with fewest serious adverse events. Further studies are required before these therapies become widely used.

### When blood is not an option: factors affecting survival after the use of a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier in 54 patients with life-threatening anemia [^4151c515]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In consenting Jehovah's Witness patients and others for whom blood is contraindicated or not available, hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC)-201 may enable survival in acutely anemic patients while underlying conditions are treated.

Methods

Survival factors were identified in a multicenter, unblinded series of severely anemic "compassionate use" patients receiving available standard treatment plus consultant-supported HBOC-201 administration by novice users. Predictors of outcome were sought and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. A compound variable, hemoglobin-duration deficit product was used to describe the interactive clinical effects of severity and duration of anemia. Mortality, correlations between patient characteristics, and survival to hospital discharge were determined from patient records.

Results

Fifty-four patients (median age 50 years) with life-threatening anemia (median hemoglobin concentration at time of request = 4 g/dL) received 60 to 300 g HBOC-201. Twenty-three patients (41.8%) were discharged. Intraoperative blood loss (45%), malignancy(18%), and acute hemolysis (13%) were the prevailing reasons for anemia. Time from onset of anemia (≤ 8 g/dL) to HBOC-201 infusion was shorter for survivors than nonsurvivors (3.2 vs 4.4 days, P = 0.027). Mean hemoglobin levels before HBOC-201 infusion in survivors and nonsurvivors were 4.5 and 3.8 g/dL, respectively (P = 0.120). No serious adverse event was attributed to HBOC-201. The hemoglobin-duration deficit product separated survivors from nonsurvivors. Cancer and renal disease were associated with nonsurvival.

Conclusion

Earlier, compared with later, administration by inexperienced users of HBOC-201 to patients with anemia was associated with improved chances of survival of acutely bleeding and hemolyzing patients. Survival was more likely if the duration and magnitude of low hemoglobin was minimized before treatment with HBOC-201.

Blunt hemorrhagic shock — FFP:PRBC ratio and outcomes (Sperry et al 2008; III for Q 3): Adults with blunt injury from 7 US institutions during a 3.5-year period who had prehospital or ED systolic hypotension < 90 mmHg or elevated base deficit ≥ 6 meq/L, a blood transfusion requirement within the first 12 h, and any body region exclusive of the brain with an AIS ≥ 2 were evaluated for associations between fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cells (PRBC) ratios and outcomes. Of 1,036 enrolled, 415 had a blood transfusion requirement of ≥ 8 units within the initial 12 h and constituted the study population; 39 received no FFP within the first 12 h (FFP: PRBC ratio = 0). Overall mortality was 33.5%, with complication rates for MOF, NI, and ARDS of 56.4%, 46.5%, and 29.6%, respectively. Patients who received an FFP:PRBC transfusion ratio ≥ 1:1.5, relative to patients who received < 1:1 FFP:PRBC ratio, had a significant lower risk of inhospital mortality, and this protective effect was most pertinent within the first 48 h after injury.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^a449d745]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Sims et al. investigated whether low-dose AVP supplementation decreased the need for blood product transfusions in patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock. Using low-dose AVP supplementation in patients presenting significantly decreased the need for blood products without increasing morbidity. All these studies were carried out on general population, without distinction of age.

In general, fluid resuscitation is the first-line therapy to restore intravascular volume and to prevent cardiac arrest. At this point of time, before source bleeding control, the main endpoint is to maintain arterial pressure to the bare minimum to minimize dilution of coagulation factors and complications of over fluid resuscitation, considering the severity of the hemorrhage. A target systolic arterial pressure of 80–90 mmHg is recommended until the control of hemorrhage in trauma patients without brain injury. Early vasopressor support may be required to restore arterial pressure and prevent excessive fluid resuscitation. It is crucial to find the best harmony between fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, to consider hemodynamic monitoring and to establish trauma resuscitative protocols. The administration of vasopressors to manage hypotension has to be decided in a case by case basis and carefully monitored by the trauma team.

Clinicians give vasopressors to avoid hypotension which can be exacerbated in hemorrhagic shock due to vasodilatation; however, excessive vasoconstriction and other effects associated with vasopressors — such as increased cardiac workload — could cause harm to critically ill patients. Invasive pressure monitoring is indicated in all patients receiving continuous infusion of vasopressors. The choice of vasopressor depends on the preexisting condition of the patient and the pathophysiology of each case of hypoperfusion. Invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring can aid the choice of vasopressor and its titration of an appropriate dosage.

There is no specific literature on vasopressors in the elderly population. Based on the evidence on general polytrauma patients, the use of vasopressors can be recommended in patients who do not respond to volemic filling in the context of damage control resuscitation and permissive hypotension. The vasopressor of choice is norepinephrine, which can be used in patients with hypotension refractory to volemic filling and patients with hypotension of neurogenic and septic origin. It is appropriate to consider the addition of an inotrope in case of nonresponse or in case of hypotension due to cardiac dysfunction. Focused resuscitative protocols tailored to geriatric trauma patients are lacking, and further prospective studies on this topic are needed.

Trauma transfusion ratios (1:1:1 vs 1:1:2) — clinical outcomes and delivered ratios are reported as follows: From 24 h through 30 d, the numbers of additional all-cause deaths were similar (32 for the 1:1:1 group vs 31 for the 1:1:2 group). Over 30 d, deaths due to exsanguination occurred in 10.7% of patients in the 1:1:1 group vs 14.7% in the 1:1:2 group, whereas deaths due to traumatic brain injury were 8.1% vs 10.3%, respectively; the median time to death due to exsanguination was 106 min (interquartile range [IQR], 54–198 min) and 96 minutes (IQR, 43–194 min), respectively. More patients achieved anatomic hemostasis in the 1:1:1 group (86.1% vs 78.1% in the 1:1:2 group, P = 0.006) with a median time of 105 minutes (IQR 64–179 min) vs 100 minutes (IQR 56–181 min), respectively (P = 0.44) in those who achieved anatomic hemostasis. During the intervention, patients received median ratios of plasma to RBCs of 1.0 in the 1:1:1 group and 0.5 in the 1:1:2 group, and the median ratios of platelets to RBCs were 1.5 for the 1:1:1 group and 0.4 for the 1:1:2 group. Directed catching up occurred in the 1:1:2 group with plasma and platelets approaching a cumulative ratio of 1:1:1, and this catching up after the completion of randomized blood product transfusion may have decreased the ability to detect differences in mortality at 24 h and 30 d or in the prespecified ancillary outcomes.

### Neurosurgical procedures in jehovah's witnesses: an increased risk? [^5ccbab94]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Because of the growing numbers of members worldwide in the sect of Jehovah's Witnesses, the refusal of blood and blood products due to religious reasons is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. As an alternative to blood transfusion, Jehovah's Witnesses accept blood-free volume substitution, and they sometimes accept the intraoperative reinfusion of autologous blood via a so-called cell saver. The aim of this study was to examine whether the refusal of blood transfusion affects the surgical indications for neurosurgery and whether morbidity and mortality rates are higher after neurosurgical interventions in Jehovah's Witnesses.

Methods

The pre-, intra-, and postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit values as well as coagulation parameters of a group of Jehovah's Witnesses (n = 103) were compared with those of a valid control group.

Results

The total intraoperative blood loss during spinal and intracranial surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses was often less than in controls, which suggests a less traumatic surgical procedure. Hemodynamically relevant blood loss occurred in two spinal and four intracranial interventions. The patients were managed without receiving blood transfusions or blood products, although increased time in the intensive care unit and increased convalescence days were necessary. Mean surgical times were 17.5 minutes longer for spinal interventions and 36.7 minutes longer for intracranial interventions than for patients in the control group. This may be attributed to a more careful and thus slower surgical technique and to longer and more extensive hemostasis. The length of hospitalization was 15% longer for Jehovah's Witnesses than for controls.

Conclusion

The morbidity and mortality rates for Jehovah's Witnesses undergoing neurosurgery were not higher than those of the control group. Thus, it can be concluded that Jehovah's Witnesses did not have a higher risk when microsurgical techniques and extensive anesthetic monitoring were applied during neurosurgery. Because the surgical success rate for Jehovah's Witnesses corresponded to that of the control group, the increase in costs because of longer treatment times is compensated in the long run by avoiding a lengthier illness, sometimes with more expensive conservative therapy.

Pediatric traumatic hemorrhagic shock — resuscitation recommendation and evidence: Among infants and children with hypotensive hemorrhagic shock following trauma, it is reasonable to administer blood products, when available, instead of crystalloid for ongoing volume resuscitation (COR 2a, LOE C-EO). Resuscitation guidance is evolving as crystalloid–then–blood paradigms are being challenged by protocols using blood products early in resuscitation, but the ideal resuscitation strategy for a given type of injury is often unknown, and these recommendations have not been updated for this edition of the Guidelines. There are no prospective pediatric data comparing the administration of early blood products versus early crystalloid for traumatic hemorrhagic shock; a scoping review identified 6 retrospective studies that compared patient outcomes with the total volume of crystalloid resuscitation received in the first 24 to 48 hours among children with hemorrhagic shock, with four studies reporting no differences in survival to 24 hours, survival at 30 days with good neurological outcome, or survival to discharge.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute blunt trauma [^f4928b5a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute blunt trauma — across observational cohorts and a randomized trial, higher plasma-to-red-cell ratios were associated with lower mortality, while overall mortality did not differ between 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 in one RCT. In a multicenter cohort, a high FFP:PRBC (≥ 1:1.5) ratio at 6 hours was independently associated with reduction in 6-, 12- and 24-hour mortality, and at 12 hours was independently associated with a mortality reduction at 12 and 24 hours; similarly, high platelets:PRBC (≥ 1:1.5) ratio was associated with an independent reduction in mortality. In a Japanese multicenter blunt trauma cohort, patients with an FFP:RBC ratio of 1 or more within the first 6 hours after admission had an unadjusted hazard ratio of about 0.4 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.74) and an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.29 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.62). In a massive transfusion cohort, a temperature lower than 34 °C was not a significant independent risk factor for mortality (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.35), whereas the low FFP:PRBC ratio group had a more than 2-fold higher risk of mortality (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2). In the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios trial, a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio had no significant differences in 24-hour mortality and 30-day mortality, although there was a higher rate of hemostasis in the 1:1:1 group and fewer deaths in 24 hours due to exsanguination. In a multicenter cohort of blunt injured adults with hemorrhagic shock, receiving an FFP:PRBC transfusion ratio ≥ 1:1.5 compared with < 1:1.5 was independently associated with lower mortality when adjusted for likely confounders (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8), with a dose-response such that as the FFP:PRBC ratio became smaller, patients who received minimal or no FFP had the highest early 24-hour mortality.

In critically ill patients, we recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, we recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients with acute coronary syndrome, we suggest against a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we suggest a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy during the perioperative period (Conditional Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients with isolated elevation of serum troponin without other evidence of cardiac ischemia, we suggest a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). In patients with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, we suggest against adding permissive RBC transfusion thresholds to usual care (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence).

### Intraoperative anemia and single red blood cell transfusion during cardiac surgery: an assessment of postoperative outcome including patients refusing blood transfusion [^1008e33b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Increasing evidence suggests benefits from restrictive red blood cell transfusion (RBC) thresholds in major surgery and critically ill patients. However, these benefits are not obvious in cardiac surgery patients with intraoperative anemia. The authors examined the association between uncorrected hemoglobin (Hb) levels and selected postoperative outcomes as well as the effects of RBCs.

Design

Cohort study with prospectively collected data from a cardiac surgery registry.

Setting

A major cardiac surgical hospital within the Netherlands, which is also a referral center for Jehovah's Witnesses.

Participants

Patients (23,860) undergoing cardiac surgery between 1997 and 2013.

Interventions

Comparisons were done in patients with intraoperative nadir Hb < 8 g/dL and/or an Hb decrease ≥ 50%. Comparison (A) between Jehovah's Witnesses (Witnesses) and matched non-Jehovah's Witnesses (non-Witnesses) transfused with 1 unit of RBC, and comparison (B) between patients given 1 unit of RBC intraoperatively versus matched non-transfused patients.

Measurements and Main Results

Postoperative outcomes were myocardial infarction, renal replacement therapy, stroke, and death. With propensity matching, the authors optimized exchangeability of the compared groups. Adverse outcomes increased with a decreasing Hb both among Witnesses and among non-Witnesses. The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ between Witnesses and matched non-Witnesses who received RBC (adjusted odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.63–3.29). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between patients who received a red cell transfusion and matched patients who did not (adjusted odds ratio 0.94, confidence interval 0.72–1.23).

Conclusion

Intraoperative anemia is associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery, and a single RBC transfusion does not seem to influence these outcomes.

### Timing and volume of transfusion for adult major trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock: a registry-based cohort study [^7336e0c7]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transfusion of blood components is vital for the resuscitation of injured patients in hemorrhagic shock. Delays in initiating transfusion have been associated with harm, as has excess transfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with hospital mortality, with a focus on the two modifiable risk factors- time to initiate transfusion and volume of blood components-with hospital mortality.

Methods

This was a registry-based cohort study, including all consecutive adult patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90mm Hg and transfusion of blood components) to a level 1 adult trauma center during a 5-year period (January 1, 2017-December 31, 2021). Associations with hospital mortality were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis, with final models developed using backward elimination.

Results

There were 195 patients included and there were 49 (25.1%) in-hospital deaths. The median time to first transfusion was 10 (IQR 6–16)minutes. Age (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.08), initial SBP (aOR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.98), intracranial bleeding or diffuse axonal injury (aOR 2.63; 95% CI: 1.11 to 6.23), and the volume of blood components in the first 4hours (aOR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.13) were associated with mortality. Time to transfusion was not associated with in-hospital mortality (aOR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.03). Among the 90 patients who underwent urgent transfer to the operating room or angiography suite, the median time to transfer was 2.38hours (IQR 1.5–3.7). In this subgroup, age (aOR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.18) and volume of blood components (aOR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.34) were associated with mortality.

Discussion

In this setting where times to transfusion are short, further reductions in the time to transfusion are unlikely to improve outcome. In our population, for every unit of blood component transfused, the adjusted odds of death increased by 8%. These findings suggest investigation into strategies to achieve earlier control of hemorrhage.

Complex cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass normally requires the transfusion of autologous blood components, particularly in neonates. This is predominately caused by the relatively high priming volume of the circuit with subsequent extreme hemodilution and the often extended and complex perfusions leading to progressive consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. We report on a strategy to minimize the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and adjust the perfusion technique that resulted in transfusion-free correction of tetralogy of Fallot with an absent pulmonary valve and an aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery in a 3.55 kg Jehovah's Witness neonate boy.

### Impact of a transfusion-free program on non-jehovah's witness patients undergoing liver transplantation… [^24864db0]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Results In comparing group 2 with group 1, the mean MELD score was statistically significantly higher, whereas the mean number of intraoperative PRBC and FFP transfusions was significantly lower. The number of preoperative and postoperative PRBC, FFP, and platelet transfusions between the 2 groups was not statistically different. Conclusion The development of a transfusion-free surgical program for JW patients has had a positive impact on reducing the overall blood use in non-JW patients undergoing OLT, despite the increase in MELD score. In adults, hemoglobin levels decrease 1 g/dL for each unit of blood removed. In our patient population, the lowest hematocrit value after ANH was 21%.

Hemodynamic monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, arterial blood gases, pulmonary artery pressures, central venous pressures, and transesophageal echo to monitor cardiac contractility and ventricular filling are routinely used during the ANH process as a measure of tolerance to the procedure. Ramos et al21 showed that even a moderate number of blood transfusions is associated with longer hospital stay and that transfusion of more than 6 U of PRBCs is associated with diminished survival. The Anemia and Blood Tranfusion in the Critically Ill studies by Corwin et al22 showed that in a setting of 284 intensive care units in the United States, patients who received transfusions had more complications and were at higher risk for mortality. Rapid development of novel drugs is also beginning to play a role in containing coagulopathy and increasing hemopoiesis.

Drugs such as human recombinant erythropoietin to increase the pretransplantation RBC mass, aprotinin, 25 tranexamic acid, 26, 27 or ε-aminocaproic acid to inhibit fibrinolysis have now become mainstream strategies. On the other hand, ANH preserves the integrity of the RBCs and clotting factors, ensuring the availability of safe, fresh, autologous blood. There are, however, a few contraindications to ANH, which include coronary heart disease, significant anemia, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Autotransfusion not only decreases some of the complications of homologous transfusions, such as transmission of unknown pathogens, metabolic derangements, and citrate toxicity, but also helps to preserve blood bank resources and consequently reduces the overall procedure cost.

Preoperative management

JW patients were evaluated as per our standard Institutional clinical protocol. For this particular class of patients, two or more indicators of severe portal hypertension (platelets < 50 × 10 3 μL, grade 3 esophageal varices, ascites, previous variceal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy) were considered contraindications for listing as well as INR > 2.5 and stage 2 kidney injury according to the AKIN classification. Patients were deactivated from the list if, due to worsening of their clinical condition, they fell outside these criteria. Patients with previous upper abdominal surgery and UNOS status 1 and 2 were also excluded. Once indicated to LT and provided that involved senior surgeons and anesthesiologists agreed to perform the procedure, patients were requested to attend two interviews: one in presence of the next of kin and a JW elder and one alone with our centre's clinical leadership. All patients were required to sign a consent form that reflected their wishes formally refusing the use of blood products even in case of life-threatening anemia and stating the accepted therapies. In fact, since acceptance of blood fractions by JW depends on patient's free will apart from church doctrine, there are some therapies that all JW refuse (whole homologous blood and its main fractions: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and preoperative storage of autologous blood for later use during surgery) whereas there are some other treatments that most, but not all, Witnesses accept (perioperative blood salvage; products derived from the main components of blood, such as albumin, clotting factors, antithrombin III, synthetic hemoglobin, autotransplantation of stem cells, transplant of solid organs, normovolemic hemodilution). Finally, some other therapies are accepted by all Witnesses: plasma substitutes, which are not derived from blood, erythropoietin and hemopoietic agents obtained from genetic recombination. Therefore, all of the JW candidate to LT received detailed and written information about each of the available therapies. Following admission to the waiting list, patients showing an Hemoglobin (Hb) level < 12 mg/dL underwent hematological consultation in the aim to optimize their red cell mass. We developed a preoperative protocol for JW candidates to LT which includes supplementation with iron or vitamin (vitamin B12, folic acid) and subcutaneous recombinant erythropoietin (40.000 IU weekly). The hematological package inserts also monthly laboratory checks and interviews in order to adjust treatments. Transplant candidates with Hb > 12 mg/dL were monitored with regular laboratory checks and, if necessary, they were included in the optimization protocol.

### Timing and volume of transfusion for adult major trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock: a registry-based cohort study [^8050a651]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among injured patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock to an adult level 1 trauma center, times to blood component transfusion were short and were not associated with hospital mortality. The volume of blood component therapy was associated with mortality and is potentially a modifiable risk factor. This study suggests that implementation and evaluation of strategies to reduce bleeding and the need for blood component transfusion during trauma resuscitation could improve outcomes.

The setting of this study and restrictions to the included population must be considered when interpreting these results. Mature trauma systems have achieved substantial improvements in outcomes through a system-based approach, resuscitation using trauma teams, and inpatient management using dedicated trauma services. In this mature adult trauma center, despite blood components requiring transport from the blood bank, times to transfusion were relatively short. This is likely associated with an established prehospital notification, an MHP that is frequently activated and audited, and a pneumatic tube that transports blood components directly to the trauma center. In such a setting, further incremental improvements in time to transfusion are unlikely to significantly improve patient outcomes.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^00821c5d]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests that in many clinical settings a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy is cost-effective, reduces the risk of adverse events specific to transfusion, and introduces no harm. Similarly, implementation of restrictive, Hb-based RBC transfusion practices in bleeding patients – or those at high risk for hemorrhage – may be hazardous. In patients with ischemic brain, spinal cord, or myocardium, or in debilitated patients requiring prolonged functional recovery, the optimal Hb transfusion trigger remains unknown, but may be higher than for a severe, restrictive algorithm. Until future studies further define the role of RBC transfusion in these specific clinical scenarios, a restrictive transfusion strategy should be recommended within the well-studied patient populations and clinical conditions, and the clinicians must continue to use their experience and bedside clinical judgment to advocate the best management for their patients.

### Hemodynamic response of modified fluid gelatin compared with lactated Ringer's solution for volume expansion in emergency resuscitation of hypovolemic shock patients: preliminary report of a prospective, randomized trial [^37a1ab11]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the cardiac and hemodynamic responses to a rapid infusion of 1000 mL of modified fluid gelatin (group A) or 1000 mL of lactated Ringer's solution (group B) in emergency room patients suffering from shock. This prospective, randomized, open, noncrossover study was performed at a medical center university hospital in a surgical resuscitation room in the emergency department. The subjects were 34 patients with either hypovolemic or neurogenic shock who were admitted to the emergency room. A resuscitation protocol according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) with an additional central venous line or Swan-Ganz catheters for hemodynamic monitoring was used. Physical parameters and hemodynamic variables were measured at baseline and 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour after the infusion of each fluid. In both groups the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), systolic and diastolic pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) increased significantly. The CVP and PAOP increased significantly more in the modified fluid gelatin resuscitation group. In patients with traumatic or neurogenic shock due to acute volume deficiency, there was significantly better hemodynamic improvement, judged by CVP and PAOP measurements using the modified fluid gelatin for volume replacement than with lactated Ringer's solution during the first hour of resuscitation.

Acute blunt trauma massive transfusion — Holcomb et al (2015) reports a pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial at 12 level I trauma centers in North America August 2012 and December 2013, enrolling patients with at least 1 U transfused prior to arrival or within 1 hour of admission and predicted need for a massive transfusion defined as = 10 U of RBCs within 24 h by an Assessment of Blood Consumption score of 2 or greater or physician judgment. No significant differences in mortality were detected at 24 h (12.7% in the 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in the 1:1:2 group; difference, −4.2% [95% CI, −9.6% to 1.1%]) or at 30 d (22.4% vs 26.1%; difference, −3.7% [95% CI, −10.2% to 2.7%]), and a range of intent-to-treat P values for all possible combinations of 30-d outcomes for the 4 patients with missing values did not change these results. Exsanguination, the predominant cause of death within the first 24 h, was decreased in the 1:1:1 group (9.2%) vs the 1:1:2 group (14.6%). Transfusing patients based on an empirical ratio rather than guided solely by laboratory data is considered controversial, the trial was not designed to study this question, and after the ratio-driven intervention clinicians treated patients based on local laboratory-guided standard-of-care practice.

### Live donor liver transplantation without blood products: strategies developed for jehovah's witnesses offer broad application [^a28fc3a7]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Developing strategies for transfusion-free live donor liver transplantation in Jehovah's Witness patients.

Summary Background Data

Liver transplantation is the standard of care for patients with end-stage liver disease. A disproportionate increase in transplant candidates and an allocation policy restructuring, favoring patients with advanced disease, have led to longer waiting time and increased medical acuity for transplant recipients. Consequently, Jehovah's Witness patients, who refuse blood product transfusion, are usually excluded from liver transplantation. We combined blood augmentation and conservation practices with live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to accomplish successful LDLT in Jehovah's Witness patients without blood products. Our algorithm provides broad possibilities for blood conservation for all surgical patients.

Methods

From September 1998 until June 2001, 38 LDLTs were performed at Keck USC School of Medicine: 8 in Jehovah's Witness patients (transfusion-free group) and 30 in non-Jehovah's Witness patients (transfusion-eligible group). All transfusion-free patients underwent preoperative blood augmentation with erythropoietin, intraoperative cell salvage, and acute normovolemic hemodilution. These techniques were used in only 7%, 80%, and 10%, respectively, in transfusion-eligible patients. Perioperative clinical data and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Data from both groups were statistically analyzed.

Results

Preoperative liver disease severity was similar in both groups; however, transfusion-free patients had significantly higher hematocrit levels following erythropoietin augmentation. Operative time, blood loss, and postoperative hematocrits were similar in both groups. No blood products were used in transfusion-free patients while 80% of transfusion-eligible patients received a median of 4.5 ± 3.5 units of packed red cell. ICU and total hospital stay were similar in both groups. The survival rate was 100% in transfusion-free patients and 90% in transfusion-eligible patients.

Conclusions

Timely LDLT can be done successfully without blood product transfusion in selected patients. Preoperative preparation, intraoperative cell salvage, and acute normovolemic hemodilution are essential. These techniques may be widely applied to all patients for several surgical procedures. Chronic blood product shortages, as well as the known and unknown risk of blood products, should serve as the driving force for development of transfusion-free technology.

### Hypovolemic shock resuscitation [^216c06cf]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Several changes in the way patients with hemorrhagic shock are resuscitated have occurred over the past decades, including permissive hypotension, minimal crystalloid resuscitation, earlier blood transfusion, and higher plasma and platelet-to-red cell ratios. Hemostatic adjuncts, such as tranexamic acid and prothrombin complex, and the use of new methods of assessing coagulopathy are also being incorporated into resuscitation of the bleeding patient. These ideas have been incorporated by many trauma centers into institutional massive transfusion protocols, and adoption of these protocols has resulted in improvements in mortality and morbidity. This article discusses each of these new resuscitation strategies and the evidence supporting their use.

American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy — scope and key questions: This policy is a revision of the 2018 clinical policy and an update of prior abdominal‑focused guidance, now expanded to address acute blunt trauma not limited to the abdomen. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review to derive evidence-based recommendations addressing four questions in adult or geriatric emergency department (ED) blunt trauma: whether whole-body computed tomography improves clinically important outcomes in hemodynamically stable patients, whether age-based, differential trauma triage reduces morbidity and/or mortality in geriatric patients, what the ideal blood product ratio is for patients requiring transfusion, and whether resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) reduces morbidity and/or mortality in arrested or peri-arrest patients compared with ED thoracotomy. Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data. The introduction notes that trauma is the fourth most common cause of death overall and the most common cause of death for ages 1 to 44.

Abstract

The past century has seen many advances in the field of resuscitation. This is particularly true in the subset of patients who sustain major injuries causing hemorrhagic shock (HS) and require massive transfusion of more than 10 U of blood within the first 24 hours. Controversies on how best to resuscitate these patients include the role of fresh whole blood, stored whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, colloid solutions, balanced electrolytes solution, vasopressors, and diuretics. This review summarizes the often-contradictory recommendations observed and studied by a single trauma surgeon working in a busy urban acute care center for 65 years.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^082bbe17]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite this weak level of evidence, permissive hypotension remains one the best studied components of trauma resuscitation. Guidelines advocate to aim for permissive hypotension until hemorrhage control is obtained. Retrospective data indicate an association between prolonged permissive hypotension and organ hypoperfusion and multiorgan failure. One retrospective study in patients with severe trauma found an association between the duration of hypotension in the resuscitation period and myocardial injury. Permissive hypotension seems to increase mortality in elderly patients and should be carefully considered. The safety of permissive hypotension among patients with chronic arterial hypertension remains to be investigated. Further randomized data is required to understand the maximum duration and the place of permissive hypotension.

### Role of the massive transfusion protocol in the management of haemorrhagic shock [^2c582b89]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

The concept of rapid delivery of multiple blood products to the bedside of a massively haemorrhaging patient seems to be a logical approach to the management of the massively bleeding patient. However, controversy exists in the use of fixed blood component ratios. Assessing the extent of the coagulopathy through point-of-care testing might provide patients with product administration as needed, and avoid excessive transfusion and its associated complications.

### Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts? The implementation and outcomes of a whole blood program in Ecuador [^2e9da902]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The HVCM is at the forefront of using WB transfusion in patients with hemorrhagic shock in Latin America. Our experience shows that WB transfusion represents a feasible strategy for achieving hemostatic resuscitation in patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock, especially in LMICs. Through the implementation of a WB program, we were able to establish a program where patients would receive balanced resuscitation. Prior to the implementation of a WB program, patients were resuscitated with whatever components were available in the blood bank, which included a varying and often scarce number of pRBCs and FFP. The products dispensed from the blood bank and administered were not reliably documented, making a comparison before and after the implementation of this program impossible. Of the patients resuscitated with WB, we do not describe any symptoms consistent with transfusion reactions.

The use of WB is not a new concept. Prior to the adoption of component therapy in 1970s, resuscitation of patients in hemorrhagic shock with WB was commonplace. Component therapy was popularized for logistical reasons and was never proven to be as efficacious as WB in hemorrhagic shock. Recent literature from the military suggests that WB may have superior or equivalent outcomes when compared with component therapy. Two retrospective combat casualty analyses compared the use of fresh WB with component therapy. One study described a mortality benefit in the WB group at 24 hours and 30 days, whereas the other found no statistically significant difference in mortality, death due to exsanguination, multisystem organ failure, or sepsis. Nessen et al showed that, in the experience with forward surgical teams in Afghanistan, use of Fresh whole blood (FWB) in addition to RBCs and FFP was associated with improved in-hospital survival compared with RBCs and FFP alone. Within the civilian sector, retrospective analyses suggest superiority or equivalence of WB with regard to mortality and overall blood product use. The only randomized control trial in trauma patients, to our knowledge, compared modified WB (leukoreduced WB with additional platelet transfusion) with component therapy. After excluding patients with traumatic brain injury, a decrease in the use of component therapy was demonstrated in patients who received modified WB.

### Are trauma centers penalized for improved prehospital resuscitation? the effect of prehospital transfusion on arrival vitals and predicted mortality [^c7ff71c7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prediction models for survival in trauma rely on arrival vital signs to generate survival probabilities. Hospitals are benchmarked on expected and observed outcomes. Prehospital blood (PB) transfusion has been shown to improve mortality, which may affect survival prediction modeling. We hypothesize that the use of PB increases the predicted survival derived from probability models compared with non-blood-based resuscitation.

Methods

All adult trauma patients presenting to a level 1 trauma center requiring emergency release blood transfusion from January 2017 to December 2021 were reviewed. Patients were grouped into those receiving PB or those who did not (no PB). Prehospital Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) and shock index were compared with those at presentation to hospital. Univariate and multivariate regressions were performed to identify factors associated with changes in survival probability at presentation.

Results

In total, 2117 patients were reviewed (PB, 1,011; no PB, 1,106). Patients receiving PB were younger (35 vs. 40 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have blunt mechanism (71% vs. 65%, p = 0.002), and more severely injured (Injury Severity Score, 27 vs. 25; p < 0.001) and had higher rates of prehospital hypotension (44% vs. 19%, p < 0.001) and shock index (1.10 vs. 0.87, p < 0.001). Upon arrival, PB patients had lower rates of ED hypotension (34% vs. 39%, p = 0.01), and significant improvements in arrival TRISS scores (+0.09 vs. -0.02, p < 0.001) and shock index (+0.10 vs. -0.07, p < 0.001) compared with prehospital. On multivariate analysis, PB was associated with a threefold increase in unexpected survivors (odds ratio, 3.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.23–4.60).

Conclusion

The use of PB was associated with improved probability of survival and an increase in unexpected survivors. Applying TRISS and shock index at hospital arrival does not account for en route hemostatic resuscitation, causing patients to arrive with improved vitals despite severity of injury. Caution should be used when implementing survival probability calculations using arrival vitals in centers with prehospital transfusion capability.

### Incidence and natural progression of neurogenic shock after traumatic spinal cord injury [^f5f02b3d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Neurogenic shock, a distributive type of circulatory shock after spinal cord injury (SCI), results in profound hypotension. The consequent hemodynamic instability complicates clinical management, delays surgical intervention, and impacts neurological outcome. Moreover, the reported incidence of this condition varies significantly. We establish the true incidence of neurogenic shock by comparing the most common clinical definitions used to diagnose the condition. Further, we characterize the acute progression and recovery of neurogenic shock. Daily blood pressure, heart rate, and fluid management as well as vasopressor therapy and neurologic status were collected over 30 days from 84 adults admitted to our tertiary trauma center after cervical (n = 56) and thoracic (n = 28) SCI. We found that the reported incidence of neurogenic shock varied greatly depending on which clinical definition was applied. By using a novel combination of hemodynamic and laboratory criteria to define neurogenic shock, the calculated incidence (29% cervical SCI) in our sample most appropriately reflects the true incidence, finding that hypovolemia was the primary factor responsible for the inconsistency in incidence reports between studies. In addition, we found a characteristic decline in blood pressure after the first week post-injury and that fluid management is not currently an integral aspect of clinical management (all persons were treated at a net fluid intake ≤ zero). The results demonstrate the need for accurate identification of neurogenic shock through consistent and appropriate criteria, which is not only important from a clinical point of view, but also in establishing accurate epidemiology to responsibly allocate resources to its management.

### Timing and volume of transfusion for adult major trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock: a registry-based cohort study [^84b23bbe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Providing timely transfusion therapy while simultaneously performing other life-saving interventions is a key challenge during the reception and resuscitation of critically injured patients. Major hemorrhage protocols (MHPs) are designed to provide standardized delivery of blood components and other products directed at hemostasis. Although the content of MHPs may vary between institutions, most prioritize red blood cells (RBCs) for the management of hemorrhagic shock, along with high volumes of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets. MHPs have become standard practice for most trauma centers, despite some controversies regarding their effectiveness.

In conjunction with other measures of hemorrhage control, the American College of Surgeon Trauma Quality Improvement Program guidelines advise a maximum interval of 10 minutes between activation of an MHP to delivery of an initial set of blood components. Delays to blood components have been associated with a 5% increase in odds of 30-day mortality for every minute in delay (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.09). Decreasing the time to delivery of blood components may therefore be a modifiable risk factor to improve outcomes.

In trauma centers, time to transfusion is associated with the location of blood component storage. For patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock, blood components are commonly stored in institutional blood banks and delivered after request, manually or through pneumatic chutes, usually after activation of the MHP. This is the practice in our center, with components sent from the blood bank through a pneumatic chute. An alternative is storage of a small supply of universal blood components in the trauma center.

A potential risk of enabling easier access to blood components is avoidable transfusions. Higher transfusion volumes have been associated with worse outcomes, after adjustments for injury severity and shock. A restrictive transfusion strategy could therefore be promoted, that is cost-effective, reduces the risk of adverse events specific to transfusion, and introduces no harm. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate, among adult patients with hemorrhagic shock after trauma presenting to a level 1 trauma center, the association of two modifiable risk factors — the time to blood component transfusion and volume of blood components — with hospital mortality. The hypothesis was that shorter time to blood component transfusion and lower volumes of blood components during acute resuscitation would be associated with lower mortality. This would inform strategies to reduce time to transfusions and to reduce transfusion volumes during trauma resuscitation.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute blunt trauma [^c5a020f7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute blunt trauma with hemorrhagic shock — multicenter cohort assessing hypothermia and mortality in patients requiring MT — enrolled adults across 7 institutions during a 6-y period (December 2003-January 2010) meeting inclusion criteria of out-of-hospital or ED systolic hypotension (< 90 mmHg) or an elevated base deficit (< 6 mEq/L), a blood transfusion requirement within the first 12 h, and an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 2 or higher outside the brain, while excluding patients < 16 y or > 90 years and those with cervical spinal cord injury. Of the 1,961 patients with blunt injury enrolled during the study period, 604 (31%) required 10 U or more of PRBCs in the first 24 h after injury and constituted the primary study population. Regression analysis revealed that temperature in an MT cohort (lowest 24-h measurement as a continuous variable) was associated with a significantly greater independent risk of mortality (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.7 0.9; P = 0.013), and an interpretation of this OR suggests that a greater independent risk of mortality of more than 18% is associated with every decrease in the temperature level (-C) in the first 24 h after injury. When stratified by the period of enrolment, a temperature lower than 34-C remained a significant independent predictor of mortality, and these associations were most robust on patients who received a low FFP/PRBC transfusion ratio and were negated in the recent enrolment period (2007–2010), in which a more aggressive blood component resuscitation strategy has been previously documented.
