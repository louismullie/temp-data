## Question

boys have higher incident of congenital genitourinary malformation, true or false

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether boys have a higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations compared to girls, and by how much that difference manifests in high-quality data. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which genitourinary malformations are typically captured in epidemiologic studies. Then, I should verify whether the highest-quality population data actually quantify sex-specific rates. Next, I will compare the male versus female rates and check if the magnitude is consistent across datasets. After that, I should consider whether ascertainment or biological explanations plausibly explain the disparity. Finally, I will reconcile conflicting statements in the literature and state a clear conclusion with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't conflate definitions. I need to ensure we're focusing on congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract and male genital anomalies such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, because those are the categories most consistently reported by sex in large cohorts; I should also keep in mind that CAKUT encompasses renal, ureteral, bladder, and urethral anomalies, whereas male genital anomalies like hypospadias are specific to boys and will inherently inflate male prevalence if included in "genitourinary" totals [^113p8MKG] [^112hsNFz].

> Now, I should verify the best-available evidence on sex-specific incidence. Wait, let me verify the figures from the large BMJ cohort because that's where the most precise sex-stratified rates are reported. In a population-based cohort of 1.2 million singletons, genital malformations occurred in 0.9% of boys versus 0.04% of girls, and urinary system malformations occurred in 0.5% of boys versus 0.2% of girls, indicating a roughly 22-fold higher rate for genital malformations and a 2.5-fold higher rate for urinary malformations in boys, respectively [^112hsNFz] [^113mAxNo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the directionality without anchoring it in mechanistic plausibility. The BMJ authors explicitly note higher risks of several malformation subtypes in boys and offer a biologic hypothesis that male embryos may be more vulnerable to developmental perturbations, with higher glucose metabolism and susceptibility to oxidative stress, which could increase malformation risk; I should acknowledge this as supportive but not definitive mechanistic reasoning for the observed sex disparity [^113mAxNo].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I could generalize "urinary tract anomalies occur more often in females" to mean the overall burden of CAKUT is higher in girls. But I need to correct that assumption. The urogynecology literature emphasizing female predominance is focused on upper-tract anomalies like ureteral duplication, ectopic ureter, and ureterocele, and it does not capture male-specific genital anomalies that drive a higher overall genitourinary burden in boys; so my earlier inference was too broad and the correct takeaway is that specific CAKUT phenotypes are more common in females, while the aggregate of congenital genitourinary malformations, particularly when male genital anomalies are included, is higher in boys [^116wQ9Ww] [^116t4jkg] [^112hsNFz].

> I should double-check consistency across complementary datasets. Large epidemiologic summaries of hypospadias document a birth prevalence around 6–7 per 1,000 male births in contemporary North American cohorts, and cryptorchidism remains the most common congenital anomaly of the male genital tract with population prevalence in the low single digits at birth, reinforcing that two major male genital conditions meaningfully elevate the male fraction of genitourinary malformations; in contrast, comparable high-prevalence female-specific entities like Müllerian anomalies do not fully offset this male excess in aggregate burden estimates [^116crdb4] [^116ErkPT] [^1158yn2N].

> Let me consider ascertainment and diagnostic detection as potential confounders. I need to ensure we're not overstating the gap due to easier detection of male genital anomalies at birth or during routine exams; however, the magnitude of the genital malformation difference (approximately 0.9% vs 0.04%) is so large that it is unlikely to be explained solely by ascertainment bias, and the urinary tract difference (0.5% vs 0.2%) still indicates a meaningful excess in boys even for non-genital CAKUT categories, supporting a true biological gradient rather than just detection effects [^112hsNFz] [^113mAxNo].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Based on high-quality population data, boys have a higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations than girls, driven largely by male-specific genital anomalies and with a smaller but consistent excess in urinary tract malformations. The best estimate places genital malformations about 20 times higher in boys and urinary tract malformations about 2–3 times higher in boys, with biological vulnerability hypotheses providing plausible mechanistic support for this disparity [^112hsNFz] [^113mAxNo].

---

Boys have a higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations than girls, largely due to **male-specific anomalies** such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and posterior urethral valves [^114ykyP3]. Large cohort data show genital malformations are **about 20 times more common in boys** (0.9% vs 0.04%) and urinary malformations are about 2.5 times higher in boys (0.5% vs 0.2%) [^112hsNFz]. This sex disparity reflects the greater complexity of male external genital development and its susceptibility to genetic and environmental perturbations [^111RtCGN] [^111hAbFY].

---

## Epidemiological evidence

Several large-scale epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate a **higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations in boys** compared with girls:

- **BMJ 2017 cohort study**: In a cohort of 1.2 million singletons, genital malformations were markedly higher in boys (0.9%) than in girls (0.04%), representing a 22-fold difference. Urinary system malformations were also more frequent in boys (0.5%) than in girls (0.2%) [^112hsNFz].

- **Global Burden of Disease Study 2021**: CAKUT prevalence and incidence are higher in males than in females globally, reflecting the greater burden of congenital genitourinary anomalies in boys [^notfound].

- **Hypospadias and cryptorchidism**: These male-specific anomalies are among the most common congenital anomalies, significantly contributing to the higher incidence in boys [^116ErkPT] [^116crdb4].

---

## Specific congenital genitourinary malformations more common in boys

Several congenital genitourinary malformations are **predominantly or exclusively observed in boys**, contributing to the higher incidence:

| **Malformation** | **Description** | **Incidence in boys** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypospadias | Abnormal ventral placement of the urethral meatus | 1 in 300 live male births [^116iXaCv] |
| Cryptorchidism | Undescended testis | 1–3% of full-term males; higher in preterm infants [^1147Vkwh] |
| Posterior urethral valves | Congenital obstruction of the posterior urethra | 1 in 5,000–8,000 male births [^notfound] |
| Epispadias | Abnormal dorsal placement of the urethral meatus | Rare, predominantly male [^notfound] |

---

## Biological and genetic factors

The higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations in boys is **attributed to several biological and genetic factors**:

- **Complexity of male genital development**: Male external genital development involves intricate hormonal regulation and morphogenetic processes, increasing susceptibility to developmental anomalies [^111RtCGN].

- **Genetic susceptibility**: Mutations in genes regulating testicular descent, urethral development, and hormonal signaling pathways have been implicated in male genital anomalies [^111RtCGN] [^112reaCL].

- **Environmental factors**: Maternal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, maternal smoking, and maternal obesity have been associated with increased risks of hypospadias and cryptorchidism in male offspring [^111hAbFY] [^113BCxXa].

---

## Clinical implications

The higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations in boys has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Early detection and intervention**: Regular screening and early surgical intervention are essential to prevent long-term complications such as infertility, testicular cancer, and renal impairment [^114UJgyX] [^1124ZPLM].

- **Long-term follow-up**: Boys with congenital genitourinary malformations require ongoing monitoring for potential complications, including reproductive and renal outcomes [^114ykyP3] [^116hEpua].

- **Psychosocial impact**: Congenital genitourinary malformations can significantly affect psychosocial well-being, necessitating comprehensive care and support [^113HXiye].

---

## Conclusion

Boys have a higher incidence of congenital genitourinary malformations than girls, primarily due to male-specific anomalies such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and posterior urethral valves. This disparity is supported by robust epidemiological evidence and reflects the greater complexity and susceptibility of male genital development to genetic and environmental influences.

### Epididymal anomalies in boys with undescended testis or hydrocele: significance of testicular location [^117RLoWT]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the associations between epididymal anomalies and testicular location or patent processus vaginalis in boys with undescended testis or hydrocele, specially focusing on severity of the epididymal anomalies according to testicular location in boys with undescended testis. The incidence of epididymal anomalies was significantly higher in boys with undescended testis (65.4%) than in boys with hydrocele (13.5%).

The estimated overall incidence of epididymal anomalies in boys with undescended testis and hydrocele was 46.1%, suggesting that testicular location contribute more to epididymal anomalies than patent processus vaginalis. Epididymal anomalies were found more frequently in boys with a higher testicular location. All boys with undescended testis located in intra-abdominal area had epididymal anomalies, 91.4% when the undescended testis was in the inguinal canal, and 39.3% when it was distal to external inguinal ring.

Controversies exist regarding the role of the epididymis in testicular descent, as epididymal anomalies have been found in 36–79% of boys with undescended testis. Most studies that have reported anatomical abnormalities of epididymis in boys with undescended testis have been sporadic and used different methods, and no recent data were found. Mollaeian et al. reported that epididymal and vas anomalies occur with an overall frequency of 36% in boys with undescended testis. Gill et al. reported that epididymal anomalies were detected in 43% of boys with undescended and vanishing testis. In the present study 65.4% of boys with undescended testis had epididymal anomalies. The reason for the discrepancy may be due to different evaluation tools used in the studies. We used the most recently reported and most widely used epididymal anomaly classification.

### 4.8 congenital malformations of genital organs hypospadias (Q54… [^115G5Nv5]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypospadias is characterized by an abnormal placement of the external urethral meatus in male infants. Normal placement of the urethral meatus is on the tip of the penis, whereas in hypospadias the meatus is ventrally and proximally displaced. The shortening of the ventral side of the penis found in hypospadias can result in a curvature of the penis, known as chordee. Chordee is common in severe cases of hypospadias, but it can also occur independently. Chordee by itself is considered a minor anomaly. Photograph source: 1, 2, 4, 5: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. Postnatal. A careful, systematic examination of the male newborn should allow a firm diagnosis of hypospadias. Note that the milder forms such as balanic hypospadias are easily missed at delivery and might be discovered during circumcision.

The surgical report might provide definitive detail of the urethral placement and whether chordee are present. Suggested non-genetic risk factors for hypospadias include advanced maternal age and environmental exposure to certain chemicals. The birth prevalence of hypospadias varies widely, between 2 and 39 per 10 000 births. Inclusions Q54. 0 Hypospadias, balanic Q54. 1 Hypospadias, penile Q54. 2 Hypospadias, penoscrotal Q54. 3 Hypospadias, perineal Q54. 8 Hypospadias, other Q54. 9 Hypospadias, unspecified. Bilateral renal agenesis occurs in 1 in 4000 births and is more common in stillbirths and in males. Unilateral renal agenesis is more common on the left side, is associated with an absent ureter on the same side, and at times with renal hypoplasia in the contralateral kidney. The frequency of unilateral agenesis is estimated as 1 in 3000 births but it is likely underdiagnosed.

Nongenetic risk factors include maternal pregestational diabetes.

### Urogenital abnormalities in adenosine deaminase deficiency [^112frdm9]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Currently, there are no studies in the literature evaluating genital development or pubertal progression in ADA-SCID patients. No abnormalities of the gonads, uterus, and vagina were detected in the female subgroup, even if these data should be taken with caution since only a minor proportion of female subjects was studied. Therefore, we cannot exclude the association of urogenital abnormalities in female ADA-SCID. Conversely, we identified a high proportion of congenital and acquired undescended testes. In particular, the incidence of congenital undescended testes was higher in our cohort (22%) compared with healthy full-term neonates (0.5–4%, few authors report incidence up to 9%). Moreover, while in the general population 70–80% of undescended testes resolve spontaneously with only 23% requiring orchidopexy, the proportion of ADA-SCID patients eventually requiring orchidopexy was higher, with 64% of finally requiring surgery.

A higher incidence of congenital undescended testes is detected in premature neonates (up to 45%) but all patients with cryptorchidism in our sample were born at term (Table 2). Congenital cryptorchidism is a manifestation of numerous clinical syndromes; the ratio of non-syndromic to syndromic cryptorchidism is described to be greater than 6:1. In our sample there is high percentage of consanguinity (54% of patients with congenital undescended testes have consanguineous parents, Tables 1 and 2). Given the high rate of consanguinity in our cohort we cannot rule out the possibility of an additional inherited defect accounting for this increased incidence. However, even in patients without consanguineous parents, the incidence remains high compared with the general population (5/51, 10%).

### The recommendations of the 2015 American Urological Association working group on genitourinary congenitalism [^111DiWNc]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop consensus recommendations for index congenital urological cases seen in adulthood and to generate discussion among providers who treat these patients across the lifespan. This manuscript reviews the proceedings and recommendations of the 2015 American Urological Association Working Group on Urological Congenitalism.

Methods

Index cases were selected to highlight controversies in the management of different congenital patients in adulthood. Cases were presented and participants were randomized to groups to avoid clustering of individuals of similar background and experience. Expert panelists (representing backgrounds in pediatric and adult care of congenital patients) also discussed the cases. After that, a facilitated discussion was held with the entire group in an attempt to develop consensus recommendations for the questions raised in each case.

Results

Recommendations were generated related to management of pregnancy in young woman with bladder exstrophy and one with reflux nephropathy, as well as a young man with spina bifida with chronic kidney disease seeking undiversion.

Conclusion

Given the lack of long-term data for patients with congenital genitourinary diseases, management of complex urological disease in these patients can be difficult. Consensus discussion with urological providers across the spectrum of the life course of these patients may help provide clinical guidance.

### Aphallia-congenital absence of the penis: a systematic review [^114zqMV3]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review shows that aphallia is a rare congenital anomaly, and all cases were associated with other genitourinary congenital abnormalities, especially fistulas between the genital tract and the rectum. Although often associated with other congenital abnormalities, most physical examinations and laboratory tests showed normal results except for the phallus. Initial management generally includes vesicostomy, and for advanced management, sex determination is recommended. Currently, male sex is preferred over female sex, possibly due to the predominance of male patients.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^1123SM47]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Radiation — female pelvis, spine (sacral, whole), or total body irradiation (TBI) exposure — lists uterine vascular insufficiency with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, neonatal death, low-birth weight infant, fetal malposition, and premature labor; periodic evaluation lists history of pregnancy and childbirth history yearly for women of reproductive age; potential considerations for further testing and intervention are high-level ultrasound evaluation of genitourinary tract after pubertal development as clinically indicated in patients contemplating pregnancy and high-risk obstetrical care during pregnancy; risk context indicates to consider patient and cancer/treatment factors that may increase risk, including Wilms tumor and associated Mullerian anomalies with prepubertal at time of treatment, and cancer/treatment factors including TBI and higher radiation dose to pelvis, radiation dose > 30 Gy; an additional note states 10% of girls with Wilms tumor have congenital uterine anomalies; classification is SYSTEM = Reproductive (Female), SCORE = 2B.

### Environmental, parental and gestational factors that influence the occurrence of hypospadias in male patients [^111hAbFY]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypospadias is a congenital defect, which affects normal development of the male urogenital external tract. In this malformation, the urethral orifice of the penis is positioned ventrally, thus interfering with normal urination and creating, in some adults, problems during sexual intercourse. Heritability of hypospadias has been shown in some reports, and the abnormality has been associated with the presence of mutations in one of the genes involved in urogenital development. However, even for patients who were born in families with a higher incidence rate of this defect, no evident genetic alteration could be identified in known genes, indicating that the list of loci involved is still incomplete. To further complicate matters, recent reports also underline that epigenetic changes, without any identifiable gene sequence mutation, may be involved in gene function impairment. Therefore, the inheritance of most hypospadias cases is not evident, suggesting that the genetic background is not the only cause of this malformation; indeed, the majority of hypospadias cases are classified as sporadic and idiopathic.

Materials and Methods

Evidence has accumulated highlighting the role of the environment and of its relationships with the genome in the etiology of this abnormality. In particular, the interaction between some chemicals, which are able to mimic endogenous molecules such as sexual hormones — for this reason called endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) — and specific receptors has been extensively investigated during the pregnancy. Additionally, several articles have shown that parental and gestational factors play a significant role too. Indeed, physiological alterations, such as body weight of the mother and/or of the newborn, mother's diabetes, impaired father fertility, and exposure of one parent to job-related pollutants, show in many cases a direct correlation with hypospadias incidence. The overall prevalence of this condition has been studied in many countries, suggesting that at least in some periods and/or in specific populations there are detectable fluctuations, probably mirroring the different natural environments. However, many articles present data that do not agree with these findings and, consequently, most causes of hypospadias are still highly debated.

Results

In this review, we summarize the developmental steps involved in urogenital tract formation, with a particular emphasis on the genes that most frequently are associated with this condition, or that are subject to environmental stress, or that may be the targets of hormone-like, exogenous molecules. Then, we make an overview of the identified factors able to impair the function of important genes, even in the absence of their mutations, including those for which contradictory reports have been published. Finally, we propose an explanation of sporadic cases of hypospadias that reconciles these contradictions and suggest some steps for moving forward in the research focused on this condition.

Conclusion

We hypothesize that most patients develop hypospadias because of gene-environment interactions acting on polymorphic genes that, in the absence of environmental stimuli, would otherwise cause no developmental anomaly during urogenital development.

### Adult care of children from pediatric urology: part 2 [^116HWKXZ]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We describe the outcomes of undescended testes and sex development disorders in adolescence and young adulthood. We reviewed the requirements for the long-term care of children born with these and other major congenital anomalies of the genitourinary system.

Materials and Methods

The current English language literature was retrieved with a PubMed® search for articles on these subjects. Only articles covering outcomes at ages past puberty were included in analysis. The material was supplemented from the database of the clinic for adults with sex development disorders at University College London Hospitals.

Results

An undescended testis has impaired spermatogenesis. In men in whom a unilateral undescended testis was corrected before puberty the incidence of paternity is normal at around 90% of those who attempt it. The equivalent rate for those with bilateral undescended testes is about 65%. If surgery for bilateral undescended testes is delayed until after puberty, fertility is unlikely. The risk of testicular neoplasms is overestimated and the relative risk is between 2.5 and 8. Children born with a sex development disorder receive multidisciplinary treatment throughout childhood and require the same care as adults. Males who are under virilized likely have a micropenis (greater than 2 SD below the mean stretched length) but they may have normal sexual function. Fertility depends on the underlying condition. Virilized females, who most commonly have congenital adrenal hyperplasia, currently present to adult clinics with an inadequate vagina after infantile surgery. Reconstruction is required to allow intercourse.

Conclusions

The care of adults born with abnormalities of the genitalia is complex. Early management may define upbringing in childhood but requirements for sexuality and fertility in adult life are different. Multidisciplinary care is essential and a case can be made to establish a subspecialty of urology to coordinate it.

### How boys and testicles wander to surgery: a nationwide cohort study of surgical delay in Sweden [^116ErkPT]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Cryptorchidism is the most common genital anomaly in boys, with a reported prevalence of 1.0%–10.7%, depending on population and risk group. Normal testicular descent is completed in the third trimester and there is limited advancement 6 months after birth. Cryptorchid testicles are associated with impaired semen quality, reduced fertility and increased risk of testicular malignancies later in life, and for these reasons most guidelines and screening programmes aim for diagnosis and treatment at 6–18 months of age. Risk factors include preterm birth, low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction, and genetic or environmental factors may explain some differences in prevalence in various populations. Recent studies have suggested that maternal smoking and obesity add to this risk, even if such studies have not considered the explanatory effect of prematurity-related risk factors on the common pathway to disease. A few epidemiological studies have claimed that socioeconomic background, rurality and insurance status are associated with delayed treatment. However, these studies were either based on population aggregates or averages for area of residence rather than individual-level data, or have not shown any clear association with the risk for delay.

In Sweden, like many other countries, neonatal surgery and anaesthesia are increasingly centralised to improve surgical outcomes for rare diseases and for the safety of anaesthesia to the youngest. Current guidelines for the Nordic countries recommend treatment for congenital cryptorchidism to be performed at specialised paediatric surgery departments at 6–12 months of age, but only a small minority of boys with cryptorchidism are treated at that age. It is unclear to what extent the centralisation of paediatric surgical care has become a barrier for children with less complicated conditions living far away, and if families tend to wait until their local hospital can help them. No study has investigated how travel time or distance to treatment impacts on delay and timing of surgery for cryptorchidism.

We performed a 14-year national register-based prospective cohort study for all boys in Sweden, with inclusion of individual-level medical and socioeconomic risk factors. The aim of this total population study was to determine incidence and risk factors for cryptorchidism, and to investigate the association between travel time to hospital and age at treatment, adjusted for medical and socioeconomic background.

### Worldwide prevalence of hypospadias [^112pcXxx]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias is a common congenital malformation. Surgical repair and management of the long-term consequences require a substantial amount of socioeconomic resources. It is generally accepted that genetic and environmental factors play a major role in the etiology of hypospadias. There have been contradictory reports on rising hypospadias rates, and regional and ethnical differences. The exact prevalence of hypospadias is of major interest for healthcare providers, clinical medicine, and research.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the worldwide prevalence of hypospadias.

Study Design

Pubmed, EMBASE and Google were systematically screened for: hypospadias, congenital malformation, anomaly, incidence, prevalence, and epidemiology. Exclusion criteria were surgical and risk-factor studies. To give an additional comprehensive overview, prevalence data were harvested from the Annual Report of the International Clearinghouse Centre for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research. Prevalence was reported as per 10,000 live births.

Results

Data were available from 1910 to 2013. The median study period was 9 years (range: 1–36 years). Approximately 90,255,200 births have been screened in all studies. The mean prevalence were: Europe 19.9 (range: 1–464), North America 34.2 (6–129.8), South America 5.2 (2.8–110), Asia 0.6–69, Africa 5.9 (1.9–110), and Australia 17.1–34.8. There were major geographical, regional, and ethnical differences, with an extreme heterogeneity of published studies. Numerous studies showed an increasing prevalence; on the other hand, there were a lot of contradictory data on the prevalence of hypospadias. The summary table shows contradictory data from the five largest international studies available.

Discussion

There was huge literature available on the prevalence of hypospadias. Most data derived from Europe and North America. Many methodological factors influenced the calculation of an accurate prevalence, and even more of the true changes in prevalence over time (no generally accepted and standardized definition of hypospadias, different monitoring systems, unclear efficiency of notification and data ascertainment, etc.). There was wide variation of prevalence according to countries and ethnicity, and there were conflicting data on the recent trends of prevalence. Moreover, there weren't any epidemiologic data available from many parts of the world.

Conclusion

True prevalence of hypospadias and trends were difficult to estimate. For the future, to be able to assess the true prevalence of hypospadias and changes in prevalence collaboration of national and international prospective registers is recommended.

### Müllerian anomalies [^115hBXbm]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The development of the Müllerian system and the female reproductive tract is a complex process involving an integrated series of events with significant potential for abnormal development and anomalies. Structural anomalies of the female reproductive tract may be isolated or occur in association with other congenital anomalies, including renal or bladder anomalies and anorectal malformations. Although rare in occurrence, it is important to be familiar with these conditions for appropriate diagnosis, management, and possible referral. The diagnosis, management, and surgical treatments of female reproductive tract anomalies in girls and young women have advanced with improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques, surgical and nonsurgical techniques and innovative instrumentation and developments.

### Prevalence and clustering of congenital heart defects among boys with hypospadias [^112xQySx]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Hypospadias is a common birth defect of the male urinary tract that may be isolated or may co-occur with other structural malformations, including congenital heart defects (CHDs). The risk for co-occurring CHDs among boys with hypospadias remains unknown, which limits screening and genetic testing strategies.

Objective

To characterize the risk of major CHDs among boys born with hypospadias.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used data from population-based birth defect surveillance programs on all male infants born in 11 US states from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2014. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2, 2020, to March 25, 2022.

Exposure

Hypospadias.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographic and diagnostic data were obtained from 2 active state-based birth defect surveillance programs for primary analyses, the Texas Birth Defects Registry and the Arkansas Reproductive Health Monitoring System, with validation among 9 additional states in the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN). Birth defect diagnoses were identified using the British Pediatric Association coding for hypospadias (exposure) and major CHDs (primary outcomes). Maternal covariates and birth year were also abstracted from the vital records. Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CIs for major CHDs within Texas and Arkansas and combined using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Findings were validated using the NBDPN.

Results

Among 3.7 million pregnancies in Texas and Arkansas, 1485 boys had hypospadias and a co-occurring CHD. Boys with hypospadias were 5.8 times (95% CI, 5.5–6.1) more likely to have a co-occurring CHD compared with boys without hypospadias. Associations were observed for every specific CHD analyzed among boys with hypospadias, occurred outside of chromosomal anomalies, and were validated in the NBDPN. An estimated 7.024% (95% CI, 7.020%-7.028%) of boys with hypospadias in Texas and 5.503% (95% CI, 5.495%-5.511%) of boys with hypospadias in Arkansas have a co-occurring CHD. In addition, hypospadias severity and maternal race and ethnicity were independently associated with the likelihood for hypospadias to co-occur with a CHD; boys in Texas with third-degree (ie, more severe) hypospadias were 2.7 times (95% CI, 2.2–3.4) more likely than boys with first-degree hypospadias to have a co-occurring CHD, with consistent estimates in Arkansas (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–5.3), and boys with hypospadias born to Hispanic mothers in Texas were 1.5 times (95% CI, 1.3–1.8) more likely to have a co-occurring CHD than boys with hypospadias born to non-Hispanic White mothers.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, boys with hypospadias had a higher prevalence of CHDs than boys without hypospadias. These findings support the need for consideration of additional CHD screening programs for boys born with hypospadias.

### Does intracytoplasmic sperm injection pose an increased risk of genitourinary congenital malformations in offspring compared to in vitro fertilization? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147GBAS]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

We systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of the genitourinary congenital malformation rate after conception by intracytoplasmic sperm injection compared to in vitro fertilization.

Materials and Methods

We systematically reviewed studies to compare perinatal outcomes between children conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection vs in vitro fertilization. Studies showing genitourinary congenital malformation rates were included. We assessed the risk of bias, focusing on the quality of genitourinary congenital malformation reporting and analysis targeted at singletons. Meta-analysis was done using a random effects model for 3 outcomes, including overall genitourinary congenital malformation, hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Sensitivity analysis was also performed in only studies at low risk for bias.

Results

The initial search yielded 1,482 articles. We performed a full text review of 111 of these studies, of which 22 met inclusion criteria for systematic review. Meta-analysis of intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro fertilization in 12,270 and 24,240 cases, respectively, revealed that intracytoplasmic sperm injection was associated with a significantly higher rate of overall genitourinary congenital malformation compared to in vitro fertilization (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02–1.59, p = 0.04). However, when including only 4 studies at low risk for bias with a total of 7,727 and 14,308 intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro fertilization cases, respectively, the difference was not significant (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00–1.64, p = 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of hypospadias (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.87–1.69) or cryptorchidism (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.97–2.00) between males conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection vs in vitro fertilization. On all analyses there was no significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 0).

Conclusions

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is associated with a slightly higher risk of genitourinary malformation in offspring than in vitro fertilization. However, when only higher quality studies were analyzed, the difference was not significant. The hypospadias and cryptorchidism rates in offspring are similar for the 2 conception methods.

### Global, regional, and national burden of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract from 1990 to 2021, with projections to 2036: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^113p8MKG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

Our study utilized data from the GBD 2021 study, which is the largest and most comprehensive global observational epidemiologic survey to date. The GBD 2021 study provides annual disease burden estimates of 371 diseases and injuries associated with 88 risk factors in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The detailed methodology used for GBD 2021 has been described previously. We focused on four key metrics associated with CAKUT: prevalence, incidence, mortality, and DALYs. The estimates of prevalence and incidence for CAKUT are produced using DisMod-MR 2.1 (Disease Modelling Meta-Regression; version 2.1), a Bayesian meta-regression tool developed by the GBD team, through an analytical cascade process. The estimates of mortality for CAKUT are generated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm). DALYs, a summary measure of overall health loss, were calculated by adding years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to CAKUT. YLLs are calculated by multiplying the number of deaths associated with CAKUT by the remaining life expectancy at the time of death, based on a standard life expectancy. YLDs are calculated by multiplying the number of cases with a certain health outcome by the weight of the specified disability. The data were accessed from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx,) and include annual statistics disaggregated by age, sex, and geographic location. To describe the burden of CAKUT in different geographic units, our analysis included 204 countries and territories, which were grouped into 21 GBD regions based on geographic proximity and further aggregated into seven super-regions according to similarities in cause-of-death patterns, as defined by the GBD framework. Additionally, all countries were categorized into five socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles to assess the global burden and trends of CAKUT.

Definition of CAKUT

The spectrum of CAKUT is broad and is collectively reported under urogenital congenital anomalies in the GBD 2021 dataset. In this study, CAKUT encompasses congenital anomalies of the genital and urinary systems present at birth, including malformations of the collecting system, ureter, bladder, and kidney; bladder exstrophy and epispadias; hypospadias; ambiguous or indeterminate sex; and other genital malformations, as defined by the GBD.

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^112ANA87]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Undescended testes (UDT) is the most common anomaly of the male genitourinary tract. The guidelines suggest that orchidopexy in congenitally UDT should be performed between 6 months and 18 months of age, while in acquired UDT, orchidopexy should be performed before puberty. Delay in treatment increases the risk of cancer and infertility. The main aim of this study was to determine whether we meet international standards in the treatment of UDT.

Methods

The present study included all boys who underwent orchidopexy either due to congenital or acquired UDT in 2019 (from January 1 to December 31). For each group, laterality, location, associated anomalies, premature birth and in how many cases ultrasound was applied were determined. Additionally, for each group, the types of surgery, the number of necessary reoperations, and in how many cases atrophy occurred were determined. Finally, ages of referral, of clinical examination, and of orchidopexy were determined.

Results

During this period, 198 patients with 263 UDT underwent orchidopexy. The median time of orchidopexy for the congenital group was 30 months, while that for the acquired group was 99 months. In the congenital group up to 18 months of age, orchidopexy was performed in 16 (16%) boys, while in the acquired group up to 13 years of age, orchidopexy was performed in 95 (96.94%) boys.

Conclusion

Given the well-known risks of late treatment of UDT, orchidopexy needs to be performed much earlier, especially in the congenital group.

### Spatial analysis of hypospadias cases in Northern France: taking clinical data into account [^114vi3zc]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypospadias is one of the most frequent malformations of the genital organs in boys with a prevalence of 18/10,000 births in Europe. A significant variation from one country to another is observed, and also over time. It appeared to rise in the 1970s and 1980s but has remained stable since then.

The suspected causal factors include genetic factors, iatrogenic factors (e.g. medications taken during pregnancy or conception via assisted reproductive technologies (ART)) and environmental factors (e.g. fetal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals or other chemical hazards). Hence, the collection of statistical data on all the potential genetic and environmental causal factors is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of hypospadias and, ultimately, for guiding public health measures capable of mitigating exogenous risk factors to the greatest extent possible. Given that many environmental factors are ubiquitous and not easily measurable, strong evidence for a causal role in a congenital anomaly is still difficult to produce. Spatial analysis has emerged as a relevant, efficient tool for epidemiological research, and has already been used to describe and evaluate spatial disparities in the occurrence of birth defects. Few studies have analyzed the spatial distribution of cases of hypospadias. The statistical methodology and the result of these studies varies. Most of the studies involving spatial analysis used massive administrative datasets from national registries; the latter did not contain much clinical information.

The aim of the present study was to (i) evaluate spatial variations in hypospadias incidence in northern France, (ii) evaluate potential associations between hypospadias and ecological variables, and (iii) compare spatial clusters of hypospadias from 1999 to 2012. The study was designed to take into account medical information regarding possible confounding variables We conceived this study as a new way of consolidating previous findings on the association between hypospadias and environmental factors.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^114UJgyX]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Well-child genital examination frequency and risks related to acquired and retractile testes are highlighted. A genital examination should be performed at every well-child check as outlined by the Bright Futures of the AAP. Documentation of testes in the dependent scrotum in the first few years of life should not preclude continued examination of the genitals at every scheduled clinic visit. Systematic genital examination will allow identification and referral of boys with acquired cryptorchidism. Acquired cryptorchid testes are at risk for developing the same adverse histologic changes seen in primary cryptorchid testes and contribute significantly to the number of orchiopexies performed. Systematic and continued genital examinations will also allow identification of boys with retractile testes. While retractile testes do not require surgical correction, the risk of testicular ascent may be higher in boys with retractile testes than in boys whose testes are always positioned in the dependent scrotum.

Cryptorchidism — Guideline statement 4 (acquired cryptorchidism referral and monitoring) states: Providers should refer boys with the possibility of newly diagnosed (acquired) cryptorchidism after six months (corrected for gestational age) to an appropriate surgical specialist. (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Acquired cryptorchidism is the ascent of a previously descended testis and subsequent inability to manipulate the testis back into the scrotum. The prevalence of acquired cryptorchidism is 1–7% and peaks around 8 years of age. Given the potential ascent of previously descended testes, a scrotal examination should be performed at every well-child check.

### The epidemiology of congenital cryptorchidism, testicular ascent and orchiopexy [^1142JQxy]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The frequency, significance and possible etiology of testicular ascent (acquired cryptorchidism) are characterized in light of the known incidence and natural history of congenital cryptorchidism, and data provided by longitudinal and epidemiological studies of ascended testes and orchiopexy rates.

Materials and Methods

We comprehensively reviewed the literature addressing the epidemiology of congenital and acquired cryptorchidism and orchiopexy.

Results

The incidence of congenital cryptorchidism in full-term males at birth (2% to 4%) and at age 1 year (approximately 1%) has not increased in the last few decades. The risk of ascent may be as high as 50% in cases where 1 testis is significantly retractile. Ascended testes are typically unilateral (77%), identified in mid childhood and located distal to the inguinal canal (77%). Ascended and significantly retractile testes may be prone to the same germ cell maldevelopment seen in congenital cryptorchidism. Cumulative orchiopexy rates in defined populations are 2% to 4%, and mean age at orchiopexy remains higher than expected (greater than 4 years), despite a long held standard of care that includes recommendation for surgery by age 2. These data suggest that cryptorchidism may be acquired in a significant subset of cases.

Conclusions

With close monitoring of young boys spontaneous ascent of testes from a scrotal to a suprascrotal position may be observed with time, due to either true or apparent testicular ascent, with possible adverse effects on germ cell development and fertility potential. Patients with significant testicular retractility appear to be at highest risk for acquired cryptorchidism, and should be followed closely at yearly intervals until puberty.

### Association of gestational opioid exposure and risk of major and minor congenital malformations [^111bzmob]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found that opioid dispensing in the first trimester was associated with no excess risk of major birth defects. Opioid exposure in the third trimester was associated with a 1.26-fold higher risk of overall minor congenital malformations compared with no exposure. After classifying by organ systems, prenatal opioid exposure in the second trimester was associated with a 1.50-fold higher risk and in the third trimester was associated with a 1.65-fold higher risk of minor malformations in the musculoskeletal system. The risk of minor birth defects overall or in the musculoskeletal system was higher with greater exposure in the third trimester. Such a dose-exposure effect would be expected of a teratogen, an agent that causes fetal malformation.

The prevalence of major congenital malformation is approximately 3% among live births in the US; the reported incidence of minor congenital anomalies in newborns is more frequent and ranges from 14.7% to 47.7%, depending on population, defect types, and method of ascertainment. Infants with minor anomalies, mostly consisting of structural changes that pose less serious morbidity and disability, have a greater risk of more serious major malformations, developmental problems, or mental disorders. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the risk of minor anomalies in children with prenatal opioid exposure.

Consistent with teratology theory, our study suggests that minor congenital malformations in the musculoskeletal system are significantly associated with maternal opioid dispensing during the second or third trimester in a dose-dependent manner. Three anomalies that were disproportionately high in infants with prenatal opioid exposure in the second or third trimester were plagiocephaly, polydactyly, and other specified congenital deformities of the hip. The musculoskeletal system appears to be the third most common organ system (approximately 16%) involved in congenital malformations, preceded by the circulatory system (26%) and genitourinary system (21%). Infants with deformational plagiocephaly exhibited a higher rate of developmental delay and cognitive dysfunction. One study reported the high incidence of torticollis in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Opioid use in pregnancy has been associated with dislocated hip and musculoskeletal defects and polydactyly. In our study, a high risk of plagiocephaly, along with hip deformities and polydactyly, was associated with higher doses of opioid use in the second and third trimesters.

### Risk of major congenital malformations in relation to maternal overweight and obesity severity: cohort study of 1.2 million singletons [^112hsNFz]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

When comparing subgroups of malformations in boys and girls, the largest sex difference (with higher proportions for boys) was noted for genital malformations (boys 0.9% and girls 0.04%) and malformations in the urinary system (boys 0.5% and girls 0.2%; see supplementary eFigure 1). In the sex stratified analyses of malformation subtypes, comparisons were hampered by reduced statistical power in the different BMI categories, especially in girls. The risks of congenital heart defects increased with maternal overweight and severity of obesity for boys, whereas only female offspring of mothers in obesity classes I to III were at increased risks. Maternal BMI was associated with statistically significant increased risks of malformations in the digestive system in boys but not in girls (see supplementary eFigure 2).

Overall, 0.5% of infants who had diagnoses associated with increased risk of malformations were excluded from the main analyses, with a range from 0.5% in the offspring of normal weight mothers to 0.8% in the offspring of mothers in obesity class III. Risks of these malformations also generally increased with maternal overweight and severity of obesity (see supplementary eTable 4).

Sensitivity analysis: exclusion of women with diabetes — after exclusion of women with pregestational and gestational diabetes, the associations between BMI and overall major congenital malformations were materially unchanged (see supplementary eTable 5).

### Requirements for a multicentric multidisciplinary registry on patients with disorders of sex development [^116LpXiv]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Disorders of Sexual Development (DSDs) are a group of rare to very rare congenital anomalies of the genito-urinary tract of genetic and endocrine causes. Recently, an international database I-DSD was successfully implemented to register patients with DSD and to provide the basis for epidemiologic, genetic, and clinical research. This tool needs to be adjusted and supplemented with additional modules in order to better assess the anatomical basis of DSD as well as to monitor risk factors such as gonadal histology. A proposal for the additional information to be obtained is discussed.

### Genitourinary anomalies of pediatric FG syndrome [^112o8fkY]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The FG syndrome, also known as Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, is an X-linked disorder characterized by developmental delay, congenital hypotonia, characteristic facial appearance, relative macrocephaly and anomalies affecting the genitourinary, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems. Genitourinary abnormalities in the FG syndrome include cryptorchidism, hypospadias, inguinal hernia, hydrocele and occasional anomalies of renal or ureteral development. To our knowledge no previous study has systematically evaluated the genitourinary aspects of the disorder. We describe the genitourinary anomalies seen in children with the FG syndrome. This report may help elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disorder. Also, we provide a simple checklist for urologists that will help guide referrals for genetics and other specialty consultations.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 228 patients with the FG syndrome to identify the frequency of characteristic historical and physical findings. These patients were diagnosed on the basis of a firsthand history and physical examination, or by a careful outside evaluation including detailed records and photographs.

Results

Of the patients 90% were male. The overall incidence of any genitourinary anomaly was 48.5% in boys, 13.6% in girls and 44.7% overall. In boys the most common abnormalities were cryptorchidism (24%), hypospadias (14%) and hernia or hydrocele (13%).

Conclusions

The FG syndrome is a disorder with a greater prevalence than previously thought, yet is rarely suspected by urologists. The manifestations may be complex. Identification of patients with syndromal genitourinary anomalies by urologists will enhance the quality of care based on referral of patients for additional evaluation.

### Adult urological outcomes for patients with anorectal malformation [^113HTvkq]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Anorectal malformations (ARM) are rare congenital anomalies characterized by a spectrum of defects resulting in the absence of a normal anal opening with or without fistula. Urogenital involvement is common, and the fistulous tract may terminate in the genitourinary system in males or within gynecological structures in females. Surgical reconstruction occurs early in life and survival of these patients to adulthood is the norm. There has, therefore, been increased focus on their long-term outcomes to better anticipate and treat the sequelae that may impact their health and well-being as this population ages. For urologists, urinary health, sexual function, and fertility outcomes are of particular interest among this population. This article aims to provide a review of urological, sexual, and fertility outcomes for individuals born with ARM with a focus on key issues that may occur later in life to ensure adequate counseling, screening, and treatment.

### A clinical algorithm to diagnose differences of sex development [^113HXiye]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

The diagnosis and management of children born with ambiguous genitalia is challenging for clinicians. Such differences of sex development (DSDs) are congenital conditions in which chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. The aetiology of DSDs is very heterogenous and a precise diagnosis is essential for management of genetic, endocrine, surgical, reproductive, and psychosocial issues. In this Review, we outline a step-by-step approach, compiled in a diagnostic algorithm, for the clinical assessment and molecular diagnosis of a patient with ambiguity of the external genitalia on initial presentation. We appraise established and emerging technologies and their effect on diagnosis, and discuss current controversies.

Notably, our findings are consistent with other studies based on GBD 2019 data, showing that females have lower ASMR and ASDR compared to males. This disparity may be partly attributed to the renoprotective effects of estrogen, which has been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease. Furthermore, males tend to progress to ESRD earlier, possibly due to greater exposure to adverse factors such as physical and psychological stress, higher rates of smoking, and less favorable nutritional profiles. Additionally, the disease spectrum of CAKUT differs by sex. Severe anomalies such as posterior urethral valves, which are exclusive to males and associated with early-onset renal dysfunction, may further contribute to the higher ASMR and ASDR observed in males.

The observed sex-based difference in ASPR within high-middle SDI regions may be attributed to several factors. First, certain CAKUT subtypes — such as ureteral duplication, ectopic ureter, and ureterocele — have been reported to occur more frequently in females, potentially contributing to this disparity. Second, greater healthcare accessibility and utilization in high-middle SDI regions may lead to more frequent diagnostic evaluations among female patients, thereby increasing the likelihood of detection. Cultural, genetic, or biological differences in disease presentation or care-seeking behavior between sexes may also play a role. However, further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate these patterns.

Some countries, such as Russia, demonstrated relatively high ASPR and ASIR of CAKUT, while maintaining comparatively low ASMR and ASDR. This pattern may be attributed to early detection and early intervention. The widespread implementation of prenatal and neonatal screening programs in these settings likely contributes to increased ASPR and ASIR. In parallel, timely access to surgical intervention and nephrological care may effectively reduce ASMR and ASDR.

BAPC projections reveal that over the next 15 years, CAKUT-related mortality and DALYs, along with their ASRs, are expected to continue to decline, reflecting advancements in CAKUT management, surgical techniques, and medical treatments. However, CAKUT prevalence and incidence, as well as their respective ASPR and ASIR, are projected to rise steadily over the next 15 years, indicating that CAKUT will remain a significant public health challenge. The rebound in ASIR, which began in 2019, is expected to persist through 2036, highlighting the need for further investigation into CAKUT etiology to identify more effective preventive strategies.

### Side predilection in congenital anomalies of the kidney, urinary and genital tracts [^117WfpVR]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There appear to be various patterns of sidedness with relation to the common urogenital malformations observed in pediatric urology. The objective of this statistical review was to synthesize this data and to assess if these patterns are significant.

Materials and Methods

Eighteen urogenital conditions were investigated and for each condition the five largest studies that noted laterality were included. The sidedness of each condition was then analysed for statistical significance.

Results

Three conditions had a statistically significant higher proportion on the right side: palpable undescended testis (63%, p = 0.0002), inguinal hernia (59%, p = 0.0001) and hydrocele (60%, p = 0.003). Three conditions were significantly more common on the left side: impalpable undescended testis (59%, p = 0.0008), renal agenesis (54%, p = 0.02) and vesico-ureteric junction obstruction (71%, p < 0.0001) while both pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (62%, p = 0.09) and absent vas deferens (61%, p = 0.11) were trending towards significance.

Conclusions

Various urogenital malformations display a predilection for one side. Proximal malformations tend to be more frequently seen on the left side, where as inguinoscrotal malformations are more frequently observed on the right. There is an increasing body of literature regarding aetiological factors for these conditions. However, our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions does not completely explain this pattern of observation.

Imaging in disorders of sexual development

Intersex, now universally named disorder of sexual development, is another rare condition but with essential implications for the affected individual and their families. The prevalence at birth is 1:5,000 for complex anomalies possibly related to genital ambiguity. There is a markedly heterogeneous group of conditions: Identical genetic defects may result in various clinical presentations, and a similar phenotype may be the end point of different genetic pathways. Usually the query arises after birth when ambiguous outer genitalia are noted. Sometimes it is discovered incidentally during an investigation for other reasons such as urinary tract infection. A group of patients may become manifest because of growth or pubertal disorders. The mainstay of diagnosis is genetic and laboratory (endocrine) tests. Clinical inspection and history are of utmost importance.

The task of imaging is to determine the absence or presence of the inner genitalia to decide whether gonadal structures are male or female or, possibly, streak gonads, to offer information necessary for potential corrective surgery, and to evaluate for associated malformations and findings. In all age groups, the first imaging step usually is US, which in most situations can answer the relevant questions:
Is the uterus present or absent? The answer is most helpful. It is easier to obtain in the neonatal period because of the prominent uterine volume commonly seen during the first months after birth due to previous maternal hormonal stimulation. Also: Is there a vagina?
Are there gonads? Does their structural appearance suggest a male or a female phenotype?
Are there any associated malformations of the genital or urinary tracts? Include documentation of the adrenal appearance.

By using a transabdominal and a transperineal approach as well as US genitography, most of these questions can be answered sonographically. Appropriate recommendations have been issued.

However, in some situations, US is insufficient, particularly if access is problematic as to gonadal structures in an unusual position or in marked gonadal hypodysplasia. In these circumstances, particularly in older patients, MRI of the pelvis using high-resolution sequences may be very helpful. However, even with MRI, some structures may remain unclear; if tubular characteristics are suspected, the filling with saline or diluted contrast (as with genitography) may be necessary for defining their provenance. For detailed anatomical assessment of the inner genitalia, particularly in vaginal malformations with potential fistula, fluoroscopic genitography is still a recommended complementary tool. This could be performed with the same catheters in place as used for US genitography.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^112o1y2v]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association cryptorchidism — timing of orchidopexy is specified as follows: In the absence of spontaneous testicular descent by six months (corrected for gestational age), specialists should perform surgery within the next year. (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Observational data indicate that in a 10 year, retrospective cohort of 1,235 boys, all patients with eventual spontaneous descent initially presented by six months and no patient presenting beyond six months had spontaneous descent. Orchidopexy in the first 18 months of life is recommended to preserve available fertility potential, with histology showing that although most have normal germ cell numbers in the first six months, about 25% are born with reduced germ cells and after 15 to 18 months the proportion without germ cells rises to about 40% in bilateral cases at 8–11 years of age.

### Caring for individuals with a difference of sex development (DSD): a consensus statement [^112reaCL]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Birthweight

Complications at conception or in early pregnancy and reduced fetal growth have long been associated with atypical male genital developmentand male subfertility. Cryptorchidism occurs with increased frequency in preterm infants and infants born small for gestational age; the odds ratio for having hypospadias when born small for gestational age is 4.34. Conversely, in men with a clinical picture of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), a mutation in the androgen receptor is more likely if birthweight is within the normal range than if birthweight is outside the normal range. Presently, it is unclear whether intrauterine growth restriction contributes to the development of hypospadias or whether both conditions result from a common underlying aetiology, but androgens per se do not seem to play a notable role in prenatal body growth. Possibly other, so-far unidentified, factors regulate differentiation and development of the urethra as well as prenatal growth.

### Association of neural tube defects with congenital abnormalities of the urogenital system in a Chinese cohort [^115fptds]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

General data

Among the 190 children, 100 children were boys and 90 children were girls, and the age of these children ranged from five days old to 17 years old, with an average age of 1.48 years old.

Types and incidence of congenital abnormalities of the urogenital system

Among the 190 children, 56 children were complicated with malformations of other systems (Tables 1 and 2) due to multiple malformations, and the total number of patients with malformations was 63.

As presented in Tables 3 and 23 children were complicated with urogenital malformations, with an incidence was 12.1% (23/190), and the total number of urogenital malformations was 30. Solitary kidney and renal dysplasia were the most common, and both accounted for 16.7% (5/30) of the total urogenital malformations. These were followed by renal ureteral duplication (13.3%, 4/30), horseshoe fusion kidney (3%, 4/30), hypospadias (13.3% 4/30), ectopic kidney (10%, 3/30), cryptorchidism (10%, 3/30), bladder ectropion (3.3%, 1/30), and bladder duplication (3.3%, 1/30).

Urinary system symptoms

For the 23 children with urogenital malformations, most of these children had no definite urinary system symptoms, while some of these children had multiple incidences of urinary system infections. Furthermore, one child had bladder ectropion, four children had hypospadias, and three children with cryptorchidism were detected with a malformation due to the abnormal appearance in the early stage. In the treatment of malformations, children with bladder ectropion, bladder duplication, hypospadias and cryptorchidism underwent surgical therapy during their childhood, while the urogenital malformations of the remaining children were not treated, and continued to receive a follow-up examination in the Urology Department.

### Prevalence and clustering of congenital heart defects among boys with hypospadias [^112PuV8w]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

We analyzed 11 population-based birth defects registries that comprised more than 8.1 million pregnancies spanning 2 decades and found consistent evidence that boys with hypospadias are substantially more likely than boys without hypospadias to have a co-occurring major CHD. In general, boys with hypospadias have a 6-fold or greater risk for co-occurrence of any major CHD, with further elevated prevalence across specific CHDs. We found that boys with hypospadias have critical CHDs that require surgical intervention in the first years of life and have improved prognosis with earlier detection. In addition, our analyses suggest that differences in both hypospadias severity and maternal race and ethnicity could be associated with the likelihood for hypospadias to co-occur with a major CHD. Together, these findings suggest that, for a boy with a diagnosis of any form of hypospadias, there may be a benefit associated with screening for additional structural defects.

Screenings through prenatal sonography and newborn pulse oximetry are widely implemented to detect critical CHDs. Despite the success of these screening programs, these tests have imperfect sensitivity and positive predictive values for critical CHDs and often fail to detect noncritical CHDs. In addition, to our knowledge, there are currently no recommended additional screenings for boys with a diagnosis of hypospadias, regardless of hypospadias severity. However, it is increasingly recognized that boys with hypospadias could experience a benefit associated with clinical sequencing and genetic counseling, and the American College of Medical Genomics and Genetics now recommends sequencing for children with a diagnosis of a congenital anomaly prior to 1 year of age. Sequencing of individuals with multiple congenital anomalies, particularly those across body systems, has a high likelihood to yield a molecular diagnosis. Together, these findings suggest that additional clinical and genetic evaluations of boys with hypospadias may identify subclinical birth defects and improve molecular diagnoses for boys with multiple congenital anomalies.

### Congenital urological anomalies diagnosed in adulthood-management considerations [^115DvtF3]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite worldwide availability of prenatal ultrasound, many patients are diagnosed in adult life with congenital anomalies such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), undescended testicle (UDT), ureterocele, hypospadias, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and primary obstructing megaureter (POM). The aim of this review was to describe these clinical conditions and their suggested management based on the available medical literature.

Review

Adult UPJO is not a rare condition; symptomatic patients should be treated rather than observed. Treatment options are nephrectomy for non-functioning kidneys and reconstructive surgery for functioning renal units. The adult UDT has low fertility potential and increased cancer risk; hence most of the data in the literature indicate performing an orchiectomy. Adult ureteroceles are usually related to single systems and they are intravesical and less obstructive. For symptomatic patients endoscopic incision showed high efficacy for symptom elimination with minimal side effects. Primary hypospadias correction in the adult patient is feasible, but success rates are low compared to the pediatric age group. Secondary correction, whether primary correction was performed in childhood or adulthood, is a challenging task with a high complication rate. Treatment decisions regarding adult patients with VUR are difficult to make as the available data are inconsistent; there is no strict evidence that reflux in an adult is directly related to renal growth impairment, ascending pyelonephritis, and/or embryo loss in a pregnant woman. In contrast to the pediatric age group, adult POM is usually a symptomatic condition and related to a high complication rate including infections, stone formation and renal failure. Spontaneous resolution is rare and hence active surgical management is advocated.

Conclusion

Congenital urological anomalies identified in adulthood are not rare and pose a management challenge to the urologist. For most of the reviewed diseases, evidence-based management direction is difficult due to a lack of randomized trials and long-term follow up.

### Prevalence and clustering of congenital heart defects among boys with hypospadias [^1112iQSm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The high prevalence of co-occurring CHDs in this cohort study suggests that hypospadias may not be an isolated defect and that additional birth defect screening among boys born with hypospadias is warranted. The ability to characterize molecular alterations associated with the development of both hypospadias and CHDs may lead to targeted prevention strategies and improved counseling for these relatively common and medically significant birth defects.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: guidelines and reality – a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^1147Vkwh]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary undescended testis is the most common congenital anomaly of the urogenital system and the most common disorder in pediatric surgery, affecting up to 30% of preterm and 3% of term infants worldwide. A synopsis of nomenclature and possible origins of non-scrotal position of the testis is presented in Table 1. The non-scrotal position of the testis bears a considerable risk for the development of both uni- and contra-lateral testicular malignancy as well as impaired fertility. Testicular decent takes place at two stages under control of insulin-like hormone 3 between 8 and 15 weeks of development and androgens facilitating inguinoscrotal migration afterwards. While plenty of research is dedicated to improve understanding of the morphological complexity involved in the process of testicular descent, the exact cause of cryptorchidism currently remains elusive. Relevant risk factors include prematurity, genetic predisposition, endocrine disorders (e.g. disrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis), small-for-gestational-weight (SGA), birth weight < 2500 g as well as environmental factors (nicotine, alcohol, pesticides). 10% of the cases are bilateral and are commonly associated with complex syndromes or other congenital malformations such as abdominal wall defects or neural tube defects. Spontaneous descent occurs in approximately 70% of the cases, mostly within the first three (to six) months of life. After six months of life therapeutic intervention is indicated, as a spontaneous descent is then unlikely. Hormonal treatments with GnRH monotherapy or in combination with ß-HCG yield success rates of 15–20%. However, secondary re-ascent occurs in approximately 20% of the successfully treated boys and a positive effect of hormonal therapy on the degree of paternity remains to be scientifically proven. Scrotal or inguinal orchidopexy is the surgical treatment of choice in prepubertal boys with palpable, cryptorchid testes. In case of nonpalpable testes an examination under anaesthesia by a surgical specialist is indicated. If the testis remains unpalbable, surgical exploration and laparoscopic abdominal orchidopexy are the treatment of choice. Surgery bears a high success rate and complications occur infrequently (1–3%). In UDT, early orchidopexy has been proven to improve prognosis regarding testicular growth, number of germ cells and the risk for malignant transformation. Recently, experts even suggested surgery to take place as early as within the first three to nine months of life in order to prevent abnormal gonocyte maturation in the affected testis. Neoadjuvant GnRH treatment has been shown to improve the fertility index in prepubertal UDT and is thus thought to improve fertility later in life. A prospective randomized trial published by Spinelli et al. in 2014 reported that patients with UDT and a testicular atrophy index > 20% had a significant increase in testicular volume after 5 years of follow-up when treated with pre- and postoperative GnRHa therapy. Consequently, treatment recommendations for UDT can be assumed to remain dynamically changing in the near future.

### Cryptorchidism and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders [^114kNj1x]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Male congenital malformations as cryptorchidism may contribute to the development of neurodevelopmental disorders directly or via shared familial genetic and/or environmental factors, but the evidence is sparse. Using population-based health registries, we conducted a cohort study of all liveborn singleton boys in Denmark during 1979–2008. Boys with a diagnosis of cryptorchidism were categorized into the exposed cohort and the other boys into the unexposed comparison cohort. The outcomes were diagnoses of any neurodevelopmental disorders and their subtypes. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs), taking into consideration several potential confounders. Among 884,083 male infants, 27,505 received a diagnosis of cryptorchidism during follow-up. Boys with cryptorchidism were more likely to be diagnosed with intellectual disability (HR = 1.77; 95%confidence interval [CI]:1.59,1.97), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (HR = 1.24; 95% CI:1.13,1.35), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08,1.26), anxiety (HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01,1.17), and other behavioral/emotional disorders (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.08,1.26) compared to boys without cryptorchidism. The observed risks of intellectual disability, ASD, and ADHD were increased further in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. Except for anxiety, cryptorchid boys had higher risks of neurodevelopmental disorders than their non-cryptorchid full brothers. The observed increased risks were similar among boys who underwent orchiopexy, as well as among those with shorter waiting times for this surgery. Cryptorchidism may be associated with increased risks of intellectual disability, ASD, ADHD, and other behavioral/emotional disorders. Cryptorchidism and neurodevelopmental disorders may have shared genetic or in-utero/early postnatal risk factors, which need to be further investigated.

### Adult male health risks associated with congenital abnormalities [^114ykyP3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital abnormalities of the genitourinary system have a definable durable impact on the adult lives of those individuals affected, despite prompt and appropriate surgical and medical intervention during infancy and childhood. Three abnormalities are described, including relatively common problems of the newborn male, such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, as well as a less common issue, posterior urethral valves. An understanding and awareness of the consequences of these 3 congenital abnormalities is paramount for the long-term care of the pediatric patient as he transitions to adolescence and adulthood.

### Acquired undescended testes in boys with hypospadias [^114GkCzw]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the incidence of acquired undescended testes in boys with hypospadias.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 566 boys with hypospadias who were referred to our outpatient clinic between January 2000 and September 2009. Acquired undescended testes were defined as testes that were documented at the bottom of the scrotum at least once after birth by the pediatric urologist at our institution but were subsequently documented to have moved from a satisfactory scrotal position by the same pediatric urologist or an equally experienced pediatric urologist. However, this definition did not include undescended testes after inguinoscrotal surgery. We excluded boys with gender development disorders with testicular dysgenesis, those who underwent bilateral inguinoscrotal surgery and those without congenital cryptorchidism who were followed less than 3 months.

Results

Of the 566 boys with hypospadias 100 met study exclusion criteria. Of the 466 boys included in analysis 29 (6.2%) had congenital cryptorchidism and 15 (3.2%) had acquired undescended testes. Urethroplasty was performed in 413 boys, including 91 with distal, 132 with mid and 181 with proximal hypospadias. The incidence of congenital cryptorchidism and acquired undescended testes in boys with proximal hypospadias was significantly higher than that in boys with other types of hypospadias (p = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

Boys with proximal hypospadias are at a higher risk for acquired undescended testes than those with other mild types of hypospadias. Thus, testicular location should be monitored regularly until after puberty.

### A review of mullerian anomalies and their urologic associations [^112vnSQQ]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Structural anomalies of the female reproductive tract, known as Mullerian anomalies, can occur in isolation or in association with anomalies of other organ systems. Due to shared embryology, the most common association in up to 40% of patients is with renal, ureteral, and bladder anomalies. Affected girls can have a wide range of genitourinary symptoms with urologists playing an integral role in their diagnosis and treatment. To facilitate the recognition and management of these conditions, we provide a review of Mullerian anomalies including the embryology, classifications, syndromes, evaluation, and treatments with attention to their urologic applicability.

### Upper-tract genitourinary malformations in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^1126NMtk]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, specific abnormalities, and clinical significance of upper-tract genitourinary malformations in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Methods

Medical charts of children who received a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia between 1985 and 2005 were reviewed.

Results

Of 107 patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, 66 girls were identified. Of these, 14 were found to have upper-tract genitourinary abnormalities. The anomalies consisted of vesicoureteral reflux grades 1 to 3 (9), hydronephrosis (4), and duplicated collecting system (1). Two boys with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and known upper-tract genitourinary anomalies were also identified. One had ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and the other had a left malrotated kidney with hydronephrosis. Four patients (1 boy, 3 girls) underwent surgery that consisted of ureteral reimplantation (2) and ureteral stent placement (2). The reflux eventually resolved in 3 patients and worsened in 1. Hydronephrosis improved in 1 patient. None of the patients developed any impairment in renal function.

Conclusion

The incidence of upper-tract genitourinary anomalies in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is much higher in our cohort than in the general population (21.2% vs 2%-4%). This association represents a potentially significant medical issue because some patients may require surgical intervention and antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infections and impairment in renal function.

Conclusions

In summary, this study demonstrates that from 1990 to 2021, CAKUT prevalence rose globally, while incidence, mortality, and DALYs declined. By 2036, CAKUT prevalence and incidence are expected to rise, highlighting the need for global collaboration to enhance screening, prevention, and treatment, particularly in high-burden regions such as Southern Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Latin America, and Southern Latin America.

### Prevalence and clustering of congenital heart defects among boys with hypospadias [^116oD4Uv]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the relative prevalence of congenital heart defects among boys born with hypospadias compared with boys born without hypospadias?

Findings

In this large multistate birth defects registry cohort study of data from population-based birth defect surveillance programs on all male infants born in 11 US states, boys born with hypospadias were 6 times more likely than boys without hypospadias to have any major congenital heart defect.

Meaning

This study suggests that screenings for additional birth defects among boys born with hypospadias may be warranted; in addition, molecular studies are needed to uncover the shared etiology of co-occurring defects in different developmental fields.

### Epidemiology of male genital abnormalities: a population study [^114vQAjV]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted genital health wellness screens in male kindergarten children between the ages of 3 and 6 years to assess the incidence of congenital abnormalities and their treatment.

Methods

We performed genital examinations on 2241 male children in 8 kindergartens. We screened for 4 conditions: phimosis, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and hydrocele/hernia. We assessed the incidence of these conditions and the effectiveness or lack of their treatment.

Results

Among this sample, 55.5% children aged 3 to 4 years and 44.1% aged 5 to 6 years were found to have persistent phimosis. The circumcision rate, excluding those performed in conjunction with hypospadias repair, was 2.8%, but it carried a 3.2% complication rate. There was a lower incidence of hypospadias and cryptorchidism than reported in the literature at 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Our hypospadias repair rate was 60%, with a success rate of 66.7%. Our cryptorchidism repair rate was only 25%, and all repairs were performed above the age of 5 years. Incidence of hydrocele and hernias was 1.2%, and our treatment rate was 46.2%. Finally, we found high incidence of keloid formation, 73.3%, associated with inguinal incision.

Conclusions

There was high prevalence of phimosis in Chinese boys, a natural physiologic condition, up to age 6. There appeared to be lower incidences of hypospadias and cryptorchidism in our screened population. However, there were opportunities for us to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these 2 conditions. Our hydrocele/hernia incidence was on par with literature, but we had a lower treatment rate. Finally, we found a high incidence of keloid formation associated with inguinal incision.

### Embryology of the urogenital tract; a practical overview for urogynecologic surgeons [^116wQ9Ww]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Urinary tract anomalies are one of the most common birth defects. Nevertheless, they prove challenging to diagnose as a result of variable presenting symptoms. We aimed to perform a review of urogenital tract development, highlight common congenital upper urinary tract anomalies encountered by urogynecologists and tools to facilitate diagnosis.

Methods

Multiple searches were performed utilizing resources such as PubMed and the TriHealth library database to access publications related to embryology of the urinary tract and urinary tract anomalies. Each citation was reviewed.

Results

Congenital urinary tract anomalies account for up to 20% of all birth defects and occur more often in females. The true incidence of these malformations is unknown as some can remain clinically insignificant throughout life. In addition, patients may present with non-specific complaints such as urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis or urinary incontinence. Therefore, unsuspected anomalies pose a risk of delayed diagnosis and potential injury during urogynecologic surgery. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are the most common diagnostic tests. Management and treatment options range from observation to surgical resection with the goal of optimizing long-term functionality and prevention of chronic sequelae.

Conclusion

Patients with urinary tract anomalies can present with vague complaints often encountered by urogynecologists. It is crucial to understand the embryologic development of urinary tract anomalies to help facilitate diagnosis and guide care within the office and operating room setting.

### Prevalence and clustering of congenital heart defects among boys with hypospadias [^111Yh6hn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Risk for hypospadias and CHDs independently differs by maternal race or ethnicity. We found that boys with hypospadias born to Hispanic mothers were more likely to have a co-occurring CHD than boys with hypospadias born to non-Hispanic White mothers. We additionally identified a higher prevalence of CHDs among boys with hypospadias in Texas, which may reflect the high proportion of Hispanic individuals living in Texas compared with Arkansas. Disparities in outcomes for select CHDs disproportionately affect Hispanic individuals, so it is important to identify vulnerable populations that could benefit from enhanced screening and surveillance of co-occurring conditions.

### Predictors of surgical complications in boys with hypospadias: data from an internationa registry [^116iXaCv]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias, a congenital defect of the male external genitalia, occurs in 1 in 300 live births. Surgical correction is the only treatment option, with postoperative complication rates reported to range from 8% to 56%. These disparities are largely explained by variability in hypospadias phenotypes. A urethral opening at the distal end of the penis is classed as a mild hypospadias and accounts for 70% of all hypospadias cases, while an opening at the mid or proximal end of the penis is classed as severe hypospadias and accounts for the remaining 30% of cases. Severe forms are often found in combination with a smaller glans, less penile skin, greater curvature, and poor urethral plate quality, which are associated with more challenging surgeries and with poorer postsurgical outcomes. In addition, severe hypospadias may represent differences/disorders of sex development (DSD), a term used to describe a wide range of complex congenital disorders in which genetic, chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex is abnormal, resulting in atypical formation of the reproductive system. These boys often present with additional genital defects (cryptorchidism, bifid scrotum and/or micropenis) and non-genital defects.

Postsurgical complications can negatively impact long-term functional, cosmetic, and psychological outcomes. Although various clinical factors, such as phenotype, age at operation, the surgeon's experience, surgical technique and length of follow-up have all been associated with postoperative complications, they do not fully explain complication rates. It has been hypothesized that novel clinical factors may be associated with postsurgical complications and could therefore be used as predictive tools. Previous studies have indicated that boys with a genetically confirmed androgen receptor (AR) mutation or a co-occurring extragenital congenital malformation, are at increased risk of postsurgical complications. However, further investigation is required to confirm these associations. By characterizing this population and identifying novel predictive factors of postsurgical outcomes, alterations in both diagnosis and management can be made to optimize patient care and minimize the chances of complications occurring, thus improving short-term and long-term outcomes. As such, the aim of this study was to assess complication rate in an international cohort and identify if any clinical factors can predict surgical outcomes for boys with hypospadias.

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^112SDU3W]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Undescended testes (UDT) is the most common congenital anomaly of the male genitourinary tract. In patients with UDT, testes can most often stop in the abdominal cavity or in the inguinal canal on their way. Congenital UDT occurs predominantly unilaterally in preterm infants. Most testes that do not descend at birth will complete the descent within the first 3 months of life, while spontaneous descent after the sixth month is extremely rare. After a series of studies reporting the negative effects of such laid testes, the recommendation from some associations is that treatment should begin as early as 6 months and end no later than 18 months. Acquired UDT occurred in a group of boys whose testes are palpable in the scrotum and can be observed during neonatal and infant life, but will ascend over time. In this group of boys, it is important to note that orchidopexy before puberty can significantly reduce the risk of testicular cancer. Due to low success rates, there are fewer and fewer proponents of hormone therapy. Since hormonal treatment can improve fertility indices, it is recommended as an additional tool in addition to orchidopexy, especially in boys who have UDT on both sides. The most common technique with a high success rate is Dartos pouch technique. For non-palpable intra-abdominal testes, the simplest and most accurate way of locating is diagnostic laparoscopy, after which Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy is most often used for testicular locating, but there are other techniques currently available that have not been used in our hospital. The severity of the outcome of untreated UDT, especially infertility and cancer, requires early referral of such boys for definitive treatment.

Introduction

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) encompass a large variety of malformations that are caused by impaired embryonic development of the genitourinary tract. The majority of CAKUTs can be diagnosed early in life, with a broad spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild urinary tract structural anomalies to severe renal dysfunction, even leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CAKUT represents the main cause of pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD), accounting for 40–50% of pediatric CKD cases. Given the increasing global burden of CKD, which is projected to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2040, a thorough understanding of its upstream etiologies, such as CAKUT, is imperative.

Recent literature has highlighted important limitations in the current understanding of the burden of CAKUT. Many published studies are based on single-center experiences or national-level hospital data, and often lack methodological standardization. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study offers a robust and standardized framework for evaluating disease burden across 204 countries and territories over time. It provides an invaluable data repository for assessing the health impacts of a plethora of diseases and injuries. Through this resource, researchers can evaluate key health metrics such as prevalence, incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with CAKUT. These data are crucial for understanding the disease's impact on both global and regional scales, offering insights into disparities across countries, regions, and socioeconomic groups. Two recent studies utilizing GBD 2019 data provided valuable insights into the global burden of CAKUT. However, these analyses had several limitations. They were based on the earlier GBD 2019 dataset rather than the most up-to-date GBD 2021 estimates. Furthermore, one of the studies focused exclusively on individuals aged 0–24 years, without capturing the burden across the full life course. Importantly, neither study included projections of future disease burden, which limits their utility for long-term health planning and policy development.

This study aims to fill critical gaps by providing a comprehensive assessment of the global, regional, and national burden of CAKUT via estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021). We will analyze the prevalence, incidence, mortality, and DALYs associated with CAKUT while also projecting trends up to 2036. Through rigorous data analysis and future-oriented modeling, this research seeks to offer a more nuanced understanding of CAKUT, contributing valuable insights for clinicians and public health policymakers.

### Society for endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^115Wwi6k]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

It is generally accepted that investigations are necessary in those cases where the appearance of the genitalia is so ambiguous that sex assignment is not possible at birth or the appearance is not consistent with any prenatal genetic tests. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer and prior to presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of atypical genitalia may be as high as 1 in 300 births, 23 but the birth prevalence of a condition that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as 1 in 5000 births. 24

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear on surgical exploration. 25 These external features can be individually scored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinization score (EMS) 26 (Fig. 1). Routine systematic examination of 423 consecutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412 (98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only 1 of 423 had an EMS of less than 11. 26 In boys with atypical genitalia, a chromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% of those with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadias and 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. 27 In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studies performed over a decade ago revealed a likely cause in about 30% of cases 28 and based on current reports of genetic analysis in XY DSD, a genetic cause may be identified in about 40% of cases. 29 With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it is unclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.

### Epidemiologic assessment of microtia in over 23 million consecutive United States births [^113MQLA8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Conflicting data exist regarding the incidence, demographics, and abnormalities associated with microtia. Using a large national cohort database, a comprehensive evaluation of microtia in the United States was performed.

Methods

The Kids' Inpatient Database was reviewed over a 15-year consecutive period. Information regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, postoperative complications, and hospital setting was collected. Statistical tests were analyzed using independent t tests and χ analysis.

Results

A total of 23,479,792 births over 15 consecutive years from 1997 to 2012 were included in the study. Microtia was identified in 1563 births. Incidence of microtia was higher in males (P < 0.01) and patients of Asian or Hispanic race (P < 0.01). Patients with microtia had significantly more congenital anomalies relative to the rest of the population (P < 0.01). Specifically, cardiac and genitourinary anomalies were 51 and 19 times, respectively, more likely in microtia patients. Risk of associated congenital anomalies with microtia was highest in female and Black patients. 12.6% of all microtia patients had an associated craniofacial syndrome with a comparable postsurgical course to the nonsyndromic population.

Conclusion

This study represents the largest national, longitudinal study of microtia allowing for demographic, socioeconomic, and comorbidity commentary. By quantifying relative risk of associated congenital anomalies, it can help inform the type and utility of screening modalities when evaluating microtia patients.

### Male predominance of congenital malformations in infants of women with type 1 diabetes [^115pf6XQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The 323 pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes included four therapeutic abortions: two due to major congenital malformations (spina bifida, 18 weeks' gestation, male fetus; anencephaly, 12 weeks' gestation, sex unknown) and two due to chromosomal abnormalities (both Klinefelter syndrome). One maternal death occurred at 17 weeks' gestation, and four other pregnancies ended before 24 weeks of gestation, leaving 314 ongoing pregnancies. Of these, eight were twin pregnancies and one was a triplet pregnancy, resulting in 324 infants born after 24 weeks of gestation. The sex ratio of males to females at birth was 0.94:1 (157 male [48.5%] vs. 167 female [51.5%]). Pregnancies with a male newborn were associated with a higher incidence of congenital malformations (12.7 vs. 3.0%; P = 0.001), preterm birth (39.5 vs. 28.7%; P = 0.04), and respiratory disorders (18.5 vs. 10.6%; P = 0.047) compared with pregnancies with a female newborn. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the occurrence of congenital malformations was independently associated with male newborns (OR 3.5 [95% CI 1.3–10.0]; P = 0.02). Of the 157 male newborns, there were 20 with a congenital malformation: 10 major (5 cardiovascular anomalies, 4 urogenital anomalies, and 1 caudal regression syndrome) and 10 minor. The incidence of 3.0% in female newborns (n = 5; 4 major and 1 minor) approaches the incidence of congenital malformations in the national population (2.6%). Glycemic control (i.e. A1C levels) early in pregnancy and overall during gestation was not different in pregnancies with a male or female newborn (6.6 ± 1.1 vs. 6.4 ± 1.0, P = 0.18; and 6.3 ± 0.9 vs. 6.3 ± 0.9, P = 0.36).

### Risk association of congenital anomalies in patients with ambiguous genitalia: a 22-year single-center experience [^115TQcte]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ambiguous genitalia refers to a form of differences of sex development (DSD) wherein the appearance of the external genitalia is atypical. This rare condition presents challenges in decision-making and clinical management. Review of historical data may reveal areas for clinical research to improve care for patients with ambiguous genitalia.

Objective

This chart review was performed to identify patients with ambiguous genitalia, and to classify them as having 46, XX DSD, 46, XY DSD, or sex chromosome DSD. Within these categories, we looked at establishment of specific diagnoses, type and frequency of other congenital anomalies and neoplasms, and gender assignment, as well as incidence of gender reassignment and transition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with DSD conditions from 1995 to 2016 using ICD9 codes. For the purpose of this study, review was limited to individuals assessed to have neonatal "ambiguous genitalia" or "indeterminate sex".

Results

Review identified 128 patients evaluated for ambiguous genitalia from 22 years of experience (Figure). Approximately half of these (53%) had 46, XY karyotype, 35% had 46, XX, and the remaining 12% had sex chromosome aberrations. Diagnostic rate for 46, XX DSD was higher at 64%, all of which were congenital adrenal hyperplasia, while diagnostic rate for 46, XY DSD was 11.7% for a molecularly confirmed diagnosis and 24% if clinical diagnoses were included. The most common anomalies included cardiac anomalies in 28/128 (22%), skeletal anomalies in 19/128 (15%), and failure to thrive or growth problems in 19/128 (15%). Additional congenital anomalies were found in 53 out of 128 patients (41%). There were three reported neoplasms in this group: gonadoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7. Gender assignment was consistent with chromosomes in approximately 90% of XX and XY patients. There were three recorded gender reassignments or transitions.

Discussion

Diagnostic rate for ambiguous genitalia is low, especially in 46, XY DSD. Most neonates were assigned gender consistent with their chromosomes. Given the high rate of associated anomalies, screening for cardiac or other anomalies in patients with ambiguous genitalia may be beneficial.

Conclusion

Patients with ambiguous genitalia often have additional congenital anomalies. Establishment of a specific diagnosis is uncommon in 46, XY patients. A few patients have gender reassignment outside of the newborn period. Ongoing collection of clinical data on this population may reveal new information regarding long-term health, quality of life, and establishment of more diagnoses with improved molecular techniques.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^114FJSFa]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Zidovudine (ZDV) teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes evidence indicates that first-trimester exposure to ZDV is not associated with increased risk of congenital anomalies, with clinical trial data showing similar incidence of minor and major congenital abnormalities between ZDV and placebo without specific defect patterns and observational cohorts showing no increase in birth defects; in PHACS/SMARTT, no association was identified between first-trimester ZDV exposure and congenital anomalies. Although a previous report described a 10-fold increase in the risk of hypospadias among infants exposed to ZDV, this was not confirmed in a more detailed analysis. The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) provides updated birth defect data twice a year through interim reports released in June and December and has monitored sufficient first-trimester exposures to detect at least a 1.5-fold increase in overall birth defects and a twofold increase in the more common classes, including the cardiovascular and genitourinary systems.

### Study on the incidence of congenital genitourinary system malformations in congenital microtia patients [^112xhcaj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Study the incidence of genitourinary malformations combined with microtia, find the regularity of the disease, and analyze the correlation between them.

Methods

There is a total of 3143 microtia patients from January 2015 to December 2019 in Plastic Surgery Hospital. We examined their renal ultrasound, counted cases with genitourinary system deformities, and calculated the incidence of the disease.

Results

Among 3143 patients with congenital microtia, there were 163 patients with congenital genitourinary system malformations, accounting for 5.2%. The side of congenital microtia is associated with the side of congenital genitourinary malformations.

Conclusions

Genitourinary malformations occur more frequently in patients with microtia than in the general population. The 2 malformations are more likely to be ipsilateral. We believe it is necessary to complete the systemic physical and renal ultrasound examination for patients with microtia.

### Birth prevalence of hypospadias and hypospadias risk factors in newborn males in the United States from 1997 to 2012 [^116crdb4]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypospadias is a common genitourinary malformation and there are conflicting data on whether its prevalence is increasing. Previous studies have described associations with risk factors including small for gestational age (SGA), multiple gestation birth, environmental influences, and maternal factors.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine birth prevalence of hypospadias and hypospadias risk factors in a large national dataset and to evaluate for changes from 1997 to 2012. We hypothesized that any increase in the birth prevalence of hypospadias would be associated with an increase in risk factors such as SGA, prematurity, or multiple gestation birth.

Study Design

The Kids' Inpatient Database was used to generate national estimates for prevalence of males born with hypospadias, SGA, prematurity, or to a multiple gestation and then prevalences were evaluated for association with time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate whether birth prevalence of hypospadias was associated with increasing year, SGA, prematurity, and multiple gestation birth.

Results

The estimated birth prevalence of hypospadias increased from 6.1 per 1000 births (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9 to 6.3) to 6.8 per 1000 births (95% CI 6.7 to 7.0), an 11.5% increase from 1997–2012 (P = 0.014). Among male births, the prevalence of SGA increased 74%, multiple gestation increased 25%, and prematurity increased 20% (P < 0.001 for all) (Summary Figure). A risk factor was seen in around 20% of males born with hypospadias. Hypospadias birth prevalence also increased in males without risk factors but was not statistically significant (9.1% increase, P = 0.5). On multivariable logistic regression, being born SGA (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3), to a multiple gestation (OR = 1.1), or premature (OR 1.9) were associated with increased odds of hypospadias (P < 0.01 for all), whereas increasing year was not (P = 0.3).

Conclusions

The estimated birth prevalence of hypospadias in the United States increased from 6.1 to 6.8 per 1000 births from 1997 to 2012. Known hypospadias risk factors of SGA birth, multiple gestation birth, and premature birth also increased over this time to a higher degree. About 20% of males born with hypospadias had one of these risk factors. The birth prevalence of hypospadias in males without any studied risk factors also increased, but this was not statistically significant. More studies are needed to evaluate whether this increase in hypospadias prevalence is due to increases in known hypospadias risk factors, new environmental exposures, improved diagnosis at birth, some combination, or unrelated causes.

### A rare case of partial unilateral corpus cavernosum agenesis with concomitant multiple genitourinary anomalies [^1153fJ3J]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital penile agenesis is a rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 30 million, while other congenital malformations of the cavernous bodies are much less common. In a few cases in the literature, it has been reported that the reason for consulting a physician with these conditions is the insufficient erection. As a first reported case, we present a 16-year-old male patient with partial unilateral corpus cavernosum agenesis accompanying genitourinary anomalies.

### Reproductive markers of testicular function and size during puberty in boys with and without a history of cryptorchidism [^1158yn2N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism (undescended testis, maldescensus testis) is a condition in which one or both testes fail to reach the normal position at the bottom of the scrotum. Congenital cryptorchidism is the most common congenital anomaly among newborn boys, and it has a prevalence at birth of 1.1% to 8.4% in boys with a birthweight over 2500 g. Some testes can descend spontaneously after birth, which mostly occurs before the age of 3 to 6 months. The prevalence of cryptorchidism both at 3 and 12 months of age is approximately 1%.

Cryptorchidism is associated with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors and an increased risk of infertility, due to an impaired spermatogenesis. The consequences of cryptorchidism on testicular endocrine development during puberty are still unclear. Orchiopexy between 6 and 12 months and 18 months at the latest is nowadays the recommended treatment for cryptorchidism.

### Modelling genitourinary defects in mice: an emerging genetic and developmental system [^115DoYhW]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2003). Medium credibility.

The rising incidence of genitourinary (GU) defects among newborns establishes the need and opportunity to focus research efforts on the amelioration of this growing public-health concern. Sadly, our inability to explain the causes of GU defects can be directly attributed to our lack of understanding of GU gene function. Recently, mouse models have been used to provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie congenital GU malformations.

### Initial management of disorders of sex development in newborns [^111kHxSy]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Disorders of sex development are challenging to evaluate and diagnose in the newborn. As pediatric urologists, our goals are to (1) identify patients who should be evaluated; (2) rule out life-threatening syndromes; and (3) involve a multidisciplinary team for evaluation, diagnosis, and gender assignment. This review briefly goes over the newborn differential diagnosis in disorders of sex development, highlights the important laboratory and imaging data needed, and discusses the multidisciplinary approach to gender assignment and care of these patients. Early involvement of the family in decision-making with the multidisciplinary team is paramount to a timely evaluation and diagnosis in these patients.

### A case series of infants with increased VAMP7 gene dosage at birth and virilization defects [^111SPyvF]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Genitourinary disorders are the most frequent congenital defects in newborns; however, little is known about their etiology. Several studies have been carried out to find genetic risk factors in the development of these malformations. The expression of VAMP7 is found in testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostatic tissues, penis, and urethra. Alterations in gene dose of VAMP7 were recently reported in a subset of male patients initially identified clinically by the presence of congenital genitourinary disorders. In 2016, the authors developed a diagnostic algorithm for early detection of sex chromosome aneuploidies by quantifying the SHOX, VAMP7, and SRY gene dose in newborns by qPCR using dried blood spot (DBS) samples.

Objective

Correlate the increased gene dose of VAMP7, obtained by qPCR using DBS, with genitourinary congenital defects attributable to disorders in virilization and verify the increased gene dose by microarrays.

Study Design

Samples that only presented increased VAMP7 gene dosage were selected from a previously analyzed group of 5088 males in which the early detection of sex chromosomes aneuploidies was performed. Eight males were found with an increased gene dose of VAMP7 (relative quantitation > 1.3) and were called in for a complete clinical evaluation aimed at the identification of genitourinary anomalies, qPCR and microarrays.

Results

Eight males from 5088 samples were identified with increased VAMP7 gene dosage of which six patients were clinically evaluated, of which 50% were identified with alterations in genital development (bilateral cryptorchidism, unilateral cryptorchidism, and glandular hypospadias) and speech delay, while the rest presented different types of atopy.

Discussion

Tannour-Louet et al. postulated on 2014 that the duplication of the Xq28 region, specifically of VAMP7, plays a role in the human masculinization disorders of the urogenital tract. The study was based on array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) results performed to 116 males with disorders of sexual differentiation. In the present study, the patients were initially selected due to an increased gene dose of VAMP7 detected by qPCR, then the clinical evaluation and the aCGH were performed, inverse to what was reported previously but with similar percentages between both studies.

Conclusion

In this work, the authors report cases of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, language delay and atopy in male preschoolers initially identified because they have an increased gene dose of VAMP7.

### Genitourinary imaging: part 1, congenital urinary anomalies and their management [^114Rz45j]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital urinary anomalies may be symptomatic or encountered during imaging for other clinical indications. The array of abnormalities is related to the embryologic stage at the time of the developmental insult, and these abnormalities result in a spectrum of conditions ranging from insignificant to incompatible with life.

Conclusion

Understanding the implications of common congenital urinary anomalies is the key to detecting associated anomalies, initiating therapy, and avoiding both complications and unnecessary intervention.

### Increased occurrence of disorders of sex development, prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction in children with proximal hypospadias associated with undescended testes [^112omzeq]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Proximal hypospadias represents 20% of hypospadias cases, which are considered to have a higher incidence of associated urological, nonurological, developmental and sexual development disorders, and chromosomal anomalies. We compared associated anomalies in boys with proximal hypospadias and undescended testis with those in boys with proximal hypospadias and descended testes.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 69 boys who underwent 2-stage hypospadias repair for proximal hypospadias at a single institution during the 11-year period of 2001 to 2011. Collected data included demographics, birth history, associated urological and extra-urological anomalies, karyotype analysis and gonad palpability. Patients were divided into group 1-those with proximal hypospadias and undescended testis, and group 2-those with proximal hypospadias and descended testes. Statistical analysis was performed using the 2-tailed Fisher exact test.

Results

There were 17 patients (25%) in group 1 with a median age of 2.2 years and 52 in group 2 (75%) with a median age of 2 years. Children in group 1 had a higher incidence of XY nondysgenetic testicular sexual development disorder (8 vs 11, p = 0.06), premature birth (9 vs 10, p = 0.01) and intrauterine growth restriction (8 each) than children in group 2 (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction are significantly associated with proximal hypospadias and undescended testis. Also, due to the 28% incidence of an underlying sexual development disorder, male infants with proximal hypospadias should undergo multidisciplinary evaluation.

### UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development [^113McrQZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

If the appearance of the external genitalia is sufficiently ambiguous to render sex assignment impossible or the phenotype is not consistent with prenatal genetic tests, then de facto, extensive investigation is required. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer, and prior to presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of genital anomalies may be as high as one in 300 birthsbut the birth prevalence of complex anomalies that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as one in 5000 births.

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear on surgical exploration. These external features can be individually scored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinization score (EMS; Fig. 1). Routine systematic examination of 423 consecutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412 (98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only 1 of 423 had an EMS of < 11. In boys with genital anomalies, a chromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% of those with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadias and 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studies performed a decade ago revealed a likely cause in 31% of cases. With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it is unclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.

### Congenital renal anomalies in cloacal exstrophy: is there a difference? [^116vNj4n]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cloacal exstrophy (CE) is the most severe manifestation of the epispadias-exstrophy spectrum. Previous studies have indicated an increased rate of renal anomalies in children with classic bladder exstrophy (CBE). Given the increased severity of the CE defect, it was hypothesized that there would be an even greater incidence among these children.

Objective

The primary objective was to characterize renal anatomy in CE patients. Two secondary objectives were to compare these renal anatomic findings in male and female patients, and female patients with and without Müllerian anomalies.

Study Design

An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review of 75 patients from an institutional exstrophy database. Data points included: age at analysis, sex, and renal and Müllerian anatomy. Abnormal renal anatomy was defined as a solitary kidney, malrotation, renal ectopia, congenital cysts, duplication, and/or proven obstruction. Abnormal Müllerian anatomy was defined as uterine or vaginal duplication, obstruction, and/or absence.

Results

The Summary Table presents demographic data and renal anomalies. Males were more likely to have renal anomalies. Müllerian anomalies were present in 65.7% of female patients. Girls with abnormal Müllerian anatomy were 10 times more likely to have renal anomalies than those with normal Müllerian anatomy (95% CI 1.1–91.4, P = 0.027).

Discussion

Patients with CE had a much higher rate of renal anomalies than that reported for CBE. Males and females with Müllerian anomalies were at greater risk than females with normal uterine structures. Mesonephric and Müllerian duct interaction is required for uterine structures to develop normally. It has been proposed that women with both Müllerian and renal anomalies be classified separately from other uterine malformations on an embryonic basis. In these patients, an absent or dysfunctional mesonephric duct has been implicated as potentially causal. This provided an embryonic explanation for uterine anomalies in female CE patients. There were also clinical implications. Women with renal agenesis and uterine anomalies were more likely to have endometriosis than those with isolated uterine anomalies, but were also more likely to have successful pregnancies. Males may have had an analogous condition with renal agenesis and seminal vesicle cysts. Future research into long-term kidney function in this population, uterine function, and possible male sexual duct malformation is warranted.

Conclusion

Congenital renal anomalies occurred frequently in children with CE. They were more common in boys than in girls. Girls with abnormal Müllerian anatomy were more likely to have anomalous renal development. Mesonephric duct dysfunction may be embyologically responsible for both renal and Müllerian maldevelopment.

### Anomalies associated with anorectal malformations according to the krickenbeck anatomic classification [^117VKCXw]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the incidence of congenital anomalies associated with anorectal malformations (ARMs) in relation to the anatomic type of ARM as defined by the Krickenbeck classification.

Methods

We reviewed 99 children with ARM in our institution from 2002 to 2011. Data were collected on patient demographics, type of ARM, and associated congenital anomalies, which were categorized according to organ systems. Statistical analysis was performed for comparison between groups using 'perineal fistula' as the base group.

Results

There were 62 (63%) male patients. The majority had perineal fistulas (35, 35%). Seventy-seven (78%) had at least one associated malformation. The most frequent malformations seen were genitourinary (28, 28%) and spinal anomalies (26, 26%). Those with rectovesical fistula had the highest proportion of genitourinary malformations (Odds Ratio [OR], 41.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7–363.4). Those with cloaca (OR, 49.5; 95% CI, 3.4–718.9) and those with rectovestibular fistula (OR, 12.4; 95% CI, 2.3–65.6) were most likely to have major spinal abnormalities, with tethered cord seen in all groups. The rectovestibular group was also most likely to have other associated malformations (OR, 8.6; 95% CI, 2.2–32.8).

Conclusion

More than 75% of children with anorectal malformation have other associated malformations. Genitourinary anomalies are the most common. Major spinal anomalies are seen in all groups, affecting nearly half of those with rectovestibular fistula and those without fistula. The incidence of associated malformations in the rectovestibular group is higher than described in the literature. Thorough systematic evaluation of all infants with ARM should be done regardless of type of ARM.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^113XyV3e]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism — natural history and postnatal changes include both spontaneous descent and re-ascent: suprascrotal testes were newly diagnosed in about 2% of boys examined longitudinally up to 10 years; spontaneous descent of congenitally cryptorchid testes occurred in 35–45% of newborn boys, usually prior to 3 months of age, and re-ascent was reported in 22% of boys; in a referral population, spontaneous descent occurred in 24% of boys presenting prior to age 4 months and none at or after 6 months, totaling 6.9% in the first year of life.

### Association between male genital anomalies and adult male reproductive disorders: a population-based data linkage study spanning more than 40 years [^116hEpua]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The male genital anomalies hypospadias and undescended testes have been linked to adult male reproductive disorders, testicular cancer, and decreased fertility. Few population-based studies have evaluated their effects on adult fertility outcomes and, in the case of undescended testes, the importance of early corrective surgery (orchidopexy).

Methods

We did a population-based cohort study of all liveborn boys in Western Australia in 1970–99, and followed them up until 2016 via data linkage to registries for hospital admissions, congenital anomalies, cancer, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Study factors were hypospadias or undescended testes, and study outcomes were testicular cancer, paternity, and use of ART for male infertility. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations between genital anomalies and testicular cancer or paternity, and log-binomial regression was used to calculate relative risks (RRs) for the associations between genital anomalies and use of ART.

Findings

The cohort comprised 350835 boys, of whom 2484 (0·7%) had been diagnosed with hypospadias and 7499 (2·1%) with undescended testes. There were 505 (0·1%) cases of testicular cancer, 109471 (31·2%) men had fathered children, and 2682 (0·8%) had undergone fertility treatment with ART. Undescended testes was associated with a more than two times increase in risk of testicular cancer (HR 2·43, 95% CI 1·65–3·58) and hypospadias with an almost 40% increase (1·37, 0·51–3·67), although this increase was not significant. Both hypospadias and undescended testes were associated with a 21% reduction in paternity (adjusted HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·71–0·89] for hypospadias and 0·79 [0·74–0·85] for undescended testes). Undescended testes was associated with a two times increase in use of ART (adjusted RR 2·26, 95% CI 1·58–3·25). For every 6 months' delay in orchidopexy, there was a 6% increase in risk of testicular cancer (HR 1·06, 95% CI 1·03–1·08), a 5% increase in risk of future use of ART (1·05, 1·03–1·08), and a 1% reduction in paternity (RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·98–0·99).

Interpretation

Undescended testes is associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer and male infertility, and decreased paternity. We provide new evidence to support current guidelines for orchidopexy before age 18 months to decrease the risk of future testicular cancer and infertility.

### Risk of major congenital malformations in relation to maternal overweight and obesity severity: cohort study of 1.2 million singletons [^113mAxNo]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

We found higher risks of several subtypes of malformations in boys than in girls. In particular, risks of genital malformations were markedly higher in boys. One might speculate that this difference may be partly attributed to the clinically more available evaluation of genital structures in boys compared with girls. Data from experimental studies show higher growth rate and substantially higher glucose consumption in males at the embryonal stage, even before sexual differentiation. Furthermore, male preimplantation embryos are more vulnerable to heat stress induced production of radical oxygen species than female preimplantation embryos. One might hypothesize that male embryos are more prone than female embryos to respond with enhanced oxygen radical production to different environmental insults, which in turn could contribute to their increased risk of malformations.

Folic acid supplementation has been associated with decreased risks of neural tube defects and congenital heart malformations. In the present study we did not have information on folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy. However, folic acid deficiency is common in obesity, and according to a recent national survey from the US, overweight and obese women are less likely to take multivitamins before pregnancy compared with normal weight women. Thus it is possible that the increased risks of neural tube defects and congenital heart defects in offspring of obese mothers may be partly due to folic acid deficiency.

Conclusion

We found that risks of major congenital malformations in offspring progressively increase with maternal overweight and severity of obesity. This underlines the importance of having a maternal BMI in the normal range before pregnancy. Preventive effects of weight reduction in early pregnancy cannot be expected as organogenesis occurs within the first eight weeks of gestation. Thus, efforts should be made to encourage women of reproductive age to adopt a healthy lifestyle and to obtain a normal body weight before conception.

### Proximal hypospadias and risk of acquired cryptorchidism [^116TT2hs]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We hypothesized that boys with proximal hypospadias are at increased risk for acquired cryptorchidism.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively studied the records of 114 boys who underwent repair for proximal hypospadias and had at least 1 year of followup, and 342 age matched boys receiving well child examinations. We used chi-square analysis to determine if cryptorchidism prevalence differed between the cohorts. Association between predictor (presence and severity of hypospadias, ethnicity/race, age, medical comorbidities) and outcome (acquired cryptorchidism, primary cryptorchidism, retractile testes) variables was modeled using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.

Results

A total of 22 subjects (19%) with hypospadias had 26 nonscrotal testes, of which 2 (2%) represented primary cryptorchidism, 16 (14%) acquired cryptorchidism and 8 (7%) retractile testes. A total of 12 controls (3.5%) had 15 nonscrotal testes, of which 6 (1.8%) represented primary cryptorchidism, 1 (0.3%) acquired cryptorchidism and 8 (2.3%) retractile testes. Children with hypospadias had a higher prevalence of acquired cryptorchidism and retractile testes (all p < 0.05). Hypospadias (OR 60.67, 95% CI 7.79–472.80) and increasing age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1–1.03) were associated with development of acquired cryptorchidism. Hypospadias was associated with development of retractile testes (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.4–8.50), and greater severity of hypospadias correlated with development of acquired cryptorchidism (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Boys with a history of severe hypospadias are at increased risk for acquired cryptorchidism and retractile testes. The risk of acquired cryptorchidism increases directly with hypospadias severity. We suggest that the role of prenatal and postnatal androgen disruption, which may link these conditions, be explored further.

### Predictors of surgical complications in boys with hypospadias: data from an internationa registry [^111fU9Uw]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Within this study cohort, median age at first surgery was older than the 6‒18 months recommended by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) and the European Association of Urology (EAU). This may be due to characteristics associated with DSD postponing hypospadias surgery. For example, malformations such as undescended testes may be corrected first (via orchidopexy) due to the risk of malignancy or functional impairment. Furthermore, due to high rates of SGA and micropenis, it is possible that some hypospadias surgeries were postponed in order to permit penile growth and reduce anesthetic risk.

SGA was the most prevalent extragenital malformation in this cohort and was seen in 23% of all boys, which may therefore contribute to the high rates of complications observed. A recent study has reported higher hypospadias reoperation rates in boys with SGA. That said, in our cohort, SGA alone was not sufficient to predict postsurgical complication rates as a single risk factor. This again confirms that several mechanisms may lead to complications.

No single clinical factor or combination of risk factors was significantly associated with postsurgical complication rates in this cohort. It was previously reported that boys with hypospadias and an identified AR variant were more likely to require additional operations than those with no identified AR variant. In our study, however, while there was a high complication rate, the presence of additional extragenital malformations, or a genetic diagnosis were not associated with risk of complication. Previous studies have excluded patients with genetic variants in their analysis, which may explain differences in reported complication rates. It is plausible that the high rates of extragenital malformations within the current cohort prevented an association being observed and that discrepancies in the results obtained from this study may be due to variations in genetic and biochemical testing internationally. It is possible that severe forms of hypospadias, such as those which may be reported by specialists in the care of DSD, may be part of a more complex syndrome that affects systems out-with the urogenital system, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary care in hypospadias and other DSD conditions.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^116L4bjE]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association cryptorchidism — evaluation and referral recommendations state that providers should refer infants with a history of cryptorchidism who do not have spontaneous testicular descent by six months (corrected for gestational age) to an appropriate surgical specialist for timely evaluation (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B), and providers should refer boys with the possibility of newly diagnosed (acquired) cryptorchidism after six months (corrected for gestational age) to an appropriate surgical specialist (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Providers must immediately consult an appropriate specialist for all phenotypic male newborns with bilateral, nonpalpable testes for evaluation of a possible disorder of sex development (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade A). Providers should not perform ultrasound (US) or other imaging modalities in the evaluation of boys with cryptorchidism prior to referral as these studies rarely assist in decision making (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Providers should assess the possibility of a disorder of sex development when there is increasing severity of hypospadias with cryptorchidism (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C).

### Rising hypospadias rates: disproving a myth [^114TXaxu]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital abnormalities occurring in males. In recent years, the prevalence of hypospadias and whether that prevalence is rising or stable has become part of a larger debate over the potential effects of so-called 'endocrine disruptors', such as phthalates and bisphenol-A, on male reproductive health. This commentary critically examines allegations suggesting a worldwide increase in hypospadias rates. Despite the lack of scientific support for this hypothesis and for related claims that the disorders of male reproductive health are related to endocrine disruptors, these constructs remain firmly entrenched in popular literature, and are being used in part to justify litigation banning suspected endocrine disruptors such as phthalates and bisphenol-A. A review of the epidemiologic data on this issue amassed to date clearly demonstrates that the bulk of evidence refutes claims for an increase in hypospadias rates. This suggests that two of the three components of alleged testicular dysfunction syndrome, i.e. decline in sperm counts and rise in urogenital anomalies, lack clinical support. It further suggests that extrapolations from data derived in laboratory animal studies about alleged occult risks to humans of various candidate compounds are unwarranted at this time.

### Undescended testis: a roundtable discussion based on clinical scenarios-part 1 [^114XEth1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT, cryptorchidism) is the most common congenital anomaly of the genital tract. Despite its high incidence, the management of UDT varies between specialties (urology, pediatric surgery, pediatric urology, pediatric endocrinology). Therefore, as the European Association of Urology - Young Academic Urologists Pediatric Urology Working Group, we requested experts around the world to express their own personal approaches against various case scenarios of UDT in order to explore their individual reasoning. We intended to broaden the perspectives of our colleagues who deal with the treatment of this frequent genital malformation.

### Undescended testis: a roundtable discussion based on clinical scenarios-part 2 [^112KcLJF]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT, cryptorchidism) is the most frequent genital anomaly in boys. However, its treatment varies widely throughout the world. This second part of our roundtable discussion aims to continue to ask global experts to express their attitudes towards several case scenarios of UDT in order to explore the rationale for their clinical decisions. As the European Association of Urology - Young Academic Urologists Pediatric Urology Working Group, we believe that this roundtable series will facilitate colleagues all over the world to reflect and improve their practices regarding the treatment of UDT.

### Parental subfertility and hypospadias and cryptorchidism in boys: results from two Danish birth cohorts [^115UcpF5]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To study if parental subfertility is related to the occurrence of the male genital anomalies, cryptorchidism and hypospadias.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

A total of 80,220 singleton boys and their mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort and the Aarhus Birth Cohort.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The two congenital anomalies; cryptorchidism and hypospadias, registered within the Danish National Patient Register up until December 31, 2012.

Result(S)

By means of Cox regression analyses, we found no associations between waiting time-to-pregnancy (TTP) and cryptorchidism or hypospadias among those who conceived spontaneously. The highest hazard ratio for cryptorchidism was seen among boys of couples with a TTP > 12 months who conceived after fertility treatment (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.92–1.55). For hypospadias, we found that boys of couples with a TTP > 12 months who conceived after fertility treatment, had a 71% higher risk of hypospadias (aHR 1.71, [95% confidence interval 1.24–3.36]) as compared with boys of couples with a TTP < 5 months.

Conclusion(S)

The findings from this study showed that boys of couples with TTP > 12 months who conceived after fertility treatment, had a higher occurrence of hypospadias than boys conceived spontaneously of couples with a short TTP. Among those who conceived spontaneously, TTP was not associated with hypospadias or cryptorchidism. These findings indicate that fertility treatment or severity of subfertility is related to hypospadias.

### Incidence of genitourinary anomalies in congenital scoliosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115U7atE]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The main objective of this study was to assess the overall incidence of genitourinary anomalies in patients with congenital scoliosis by providing the highest level of evidence. The secondary objective was to look for associations and trends influencing the incidence.

Methods

A meta-analysis using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration Library database was carried out. We included studies focusing on patients with congenital scoliosis and genitourinary anomalies. The main outcome was the incidence of genitourinary anomalies in congenital scoliosis. We also collected the following data: patient gender, type of deformity (formation, segmentation, or mixed), deformity location, and associated anomalies. We included cohort studies. Data was extracted from published reports and combined using Review Manager 5.4. The quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria.

Results

A total of eight cohort studies were included from a pool of 2781 patients. The incidence of genitourinary anomalies associated with congenital scoliosis was 22.91% (95% CI 13.39–32.43%). The incidence of surgically treated genitourinary anomalies was 13.92% (95% CI 4.54–23.31%). There were no differences related to gender (male 49.3% versus female 50.7%; p > 0.05). There were no differences regarding the type of deformity. The incidences of associated intraspinal, cardiac, musculoskeletal and craniofacial anomalies were 33.30%, 17.60%, 27.77% and 19.83% respectively. The most frequent genitourinary anomalies were: unilateral kidney (111/388); renal ectopia (50/367); obstructive uropathy (30/201), horseshoe kidney (30/313) and undescended testicle (16/180).

Conclusions

The incidence of genitourinary anomalies associated with congenital scoliosis was 22.91%, and 13.92% were surgically treated. Unilateral kidney was the most common genitourinary abnormality. There were no differences between genders and deformity types. It is important to consider the association between genitourinary anomalies and intraspinal or musculoskeletal anomalies.
