## Question

Treatment cellulitis by mycobacterium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating cellulitis caused by mycobacterium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and distinguishing nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) cellulitis from typical bacterial cellulitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to suspect NTM and what tests to order. Next, I will review species-specific treatment principles and durations. After that, I need to check the role of surgical management and source control. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and how to integrate this into a practical algorithm, while double-checking where guidelines are silent and where evidence is limited.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and why it matters. NTM cellulitis is not the same as typical streptococcal or staphylococcal cellulitis; it is indolent, often culture-negative on routine bacterial media, and frequently misdiagnosed, leading to delays and failures with standard β-lactam therapy, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion in the right contexts [^1161pmJC] [^114EnHcC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the epidemiologic and clinical clues that raise suspicion. NTM SSTIs often follow trauma, surgery, cosmetic procedures, or aquatic exposure, and may present as chronic, nonhealing cellulitis, nodules, sporotrichoid spread, or draining sinuses; immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk, and delays beyond 2 months are associated with treatment failure, so I need to ask about exposures and comorbidities carefully [^1161pmJC] [^116D18R7] [^112WCN1R].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic strategy. Routine bacterial cultures are often negative; I need to request mycobacterial cultures from tissue biopsy or deep aspirate, and consider histopathology looking for granulomas, while remembering that AFB stains can be negative despite infection; molecular identification can help when cultures are slow or inconclusive, so I should coordinate with microbiology and pathology early [^1161pmJC] [^114EnHcC] [^111RuNyb].

> I will now examine species-specific treatment principles, starting with Mycobacterium marinum. Let me think about duration and agents: clarithromycin is commonly used, often for 3 to 6 months, with doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as alternatives depending on susceptibilities; I should confirm that therapy is tailored to culture results and that we plan for prolonged treatment given the indolent course [^112WCN1R] [^113SHYKN].

> For rapidly growing mycobacteria such as M. abscessus, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum, I need to ensure combination therapy based on susceptibilities. Typical regimens include a macrolide plus an IV agent such as amikacin, imipenem, or cefoxitin for an initial intensive phase, followed by oral macrolide-based maintenance for months; I should double-check that macrolide susceptibility is confirmed because inducible resistance is common in M. abscessus, and I must plan for 6 to 12 months total therapy in many cases [^115eL3hS] [^111rq5Yf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of surgery because antibiotics alone are often insufficient. Surgical debridement is crucial for source control, obtaining adequate tissue for culture, and improving penetration of antimicrobials; delays in debridement and relying on antibiotics alone increase failure risk, so I should coordinate early surgical consultation when NTM is suspected or confirmed [^11798Jbm] [^116D18R7] [^1161pmJC].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients and those on biologics, NTM infections are more common and may be disseminated; in these cases, I need broader evaluation for systemic disease and consider longer or more aggressive therapy with close monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^11798Jbm] [^116unAe6] [^113PUZVG].

> Let me consider monitoring and response assessment. I need to track clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours, but for NTM, early response may be slower; if there is no improvement by 3 to 5 days, I should reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and adequacy of source control, and repeat cultures if necessary, adjusting therapy to susceptibilities as they return [^116zpUYf] [^1161pmJC].

> But wait, what if the presentation is actually cutaneous tuberculosis rather than NTM. I should double-check for systemic TB risk factors and consider that tuberculous cellulitis, though rare, can mimic bacterial cellulitis and requires standard anti-tuberculous therapy; in that scenario, I would pivot to TB regimens and coordinate with infectious diseases for optimal management [^116cHK7k] [^114wnhix].

> Next, I should review how to integrate this into a practical algorithm. If cellulitis is atypical, chronic, or refractory to standard therapy, I should obtain tissue for mycobacterial culture and histology, start empiric NTM-directed therapy in consultation with ID when suspicion is high, and arrange surgical evaluation for debridement; once species and susceptibilities return, I will narrow to a targeted combination regimen and plan for prolonged therapy with defined endpoints for cure [^1161pmJC] [^11798Jbm] [^111rq5Yf].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed key pitfalls. Misdiagnosing NTM as typical cellulitis leads to repeated courses of ineffective β-lactams and delays definitive therapy; I should maintain vigilance in the right epidemiologic and clinical contexts, communicate with the lab about mycobacterial testing, and coordinate multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes [^1161pmJC] [^114EnHcC] [^116D18R7].

Cellulitis caused by mycobacteria is best managed with **prolonged combination antimycobacterial therapy** [^11798Jbm] tailored to species and susceptibilities, plus **surgical debridement** for source control [^116D18R7]. Typical regimens use a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) with a second active agent (e.g. rifampin, ethambutol, fluoroquinolone, or amikacin) for 6–12 weeks [^11798Jbm], extending to 3–6 months for M. marinum or M. abscessus [^113SHYKN] [^111e4hTH]. Early tissue biopsy with mycobacterial cultures and molecular identification are essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^1161pmJC] [^111RuNyb]. Adjunctive measures include wound care, elevation, and management of comorbidities; immunocompromised patients may need longer therapy and closer monitoring [^11798Jbm].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Mycobacterial cellulitis typically presents as a **chronic, indolent infection** with erythematous, indurated plaques or nodules that may ulcerate or form abscesses [^114EnHcC]. Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific clinical features and low yield of routine bacterial cultures [^1161pmJC]. Key diagnostic steps include:

- **Clinical suspicion**: Persistent, non-healing cellulitis unresponsive to standard antibiotics, especially in immunocompromised hosts or after environmental exposure (water, trauma, surgery) [^1161pmJC].

- **Tissue biopsy**: Essential for histopathology and mycobacterial culture, as routine swabs are often negative [^1161pmJC].

- **Molecular methods**: PCR and mass spectrometry can expedite species identification and guide therapy [^111RuNyb].

---

## Antimicrobial therapy

Treatment depends on the **mycobacterial species**, **antimicrobial susceptibilities**, and **patient factors** (immunosuppression, comorbidities). Combination therapy is standard to prevent resistance and improve outcomes [^11798Jbm].

| **Mycobacterial species** | **Recommended regimen** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Mycobacterium marinum | Clarithromycin + doxycycline or TMP-SMX | 3–6 months [^113SHYKN] |
| Mycobacterium chelonae | Clarithromycin + fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) | 6–12 weeks [^11798Jbm] |
| Mycobacterium abscessus | Macrolide + amikacin + imipenem or cefoxitin | 3–6 months [^111e4hTH] |
| Mycobacterium avium complex | Clarithromycin + rifampin + ethambutol | 6–12 weeks [^11798Jbm] |

---

Key principles include **macrolide-based therapy** — clarithromycin or azithromycin as the backbone [^11798Jbm] — plus a second active agent based on susceptibilities [^111e4hTH]; **prolonged therapy** for 6–12 weeks, extending to 3–6 months for M. marinum or M. abscessus [^113SHYKN] [^111e4hTH]; and **susceptibility testing** to guide regimen selection and adjust therapy [^111rq5Yf].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical debridement is critical for **source control**, reducing bacterial burden, and improving antibiotic penetration [^116D18R7]. Indications include abscess formation, necrotic tissue, or failure of medical therapy alone [^11798Jbm]. Repeated debridement may be necessary for extensive disease or biofilm-associated infections [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

Adjunctive measures include **wound care** with regular dressing changes, elevation, and compression to reduce edema [^114NgcMq]. Management of comorbidities — such as diabetes, immunosuppression, or vascular insufficiency — is essential to optimize healing [^notfound]. Patient education on adherence, adverse effects, and signs of relapse is important for success [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical assessment should track response and detect adverse effects early [^112dWTAe]. Laboratory monitoring includes CBC, renal, and hepatic function tests to detect drug toxicity [^112dWTAe]. Imaging (ultrasound or MRI) may be needed for deep or extensive infections to guide management [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is generally favorable with **timely, appropriate therapy**, but recurrence is common in immunocompromised patients or with inadequate source control [^116D18R7]. Delayed diagnosis and monotherapy increase failure risk, underscoring the need for early recognition and combination therapy [^116D18R7].

---

## Special considerations

Immunocompromised patients may require **longer therapy**, closer monitoring, and multidisciplinary care [^11798Jbm]. Pediatric patients generally follow adult principles, with weight-based dosing and careful monitoring for adverse effects [^notfound]. Drug interactions are common with rifampin and macrolides; review concomitant medications and adjust as needed [^112dWTAe].

---

Effective management of mycobacterial cellulitis requires **combination antimycobacterial therapy**, surgical debridement, and supportive care, with treatment individualized to species, susceptibilities, and patient factors. Early diagnosis and coordinated care are essential to optimize outcomes and reduce recurrence.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

### Mycobacterium marinum cellulitis: a fishy etiology [^112WCN1R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections account for 2% of emergency department visits annually, though more unusual causative bacteria associated with saltwater exposure may result in morbidity. Mycobacterium marinum represents a rare but important cause of cellulitis, which if untreated or improperly managed, can progress to dactylitis or osteomyelitis. This unusual diagnosis is made more challenging due to the prolonged incubation period of approximately 21 days, temporally separating the inoculation from the disease. Patients will present with a nodular rash in a sporotrichoid pattern. While doxycycline is one antibiotic providing saltwater coverage, M. marinum has variable sensitivities to anti-mycobacterial antibiotics, and thus biopsy helps confirm the diagnosis as well as provide sensitivities for treatment. Emergency clinicians should inquire about environmental risk factors when caring for patients with cellulitis, especially with atypical skin presentations, and consider M. marinum as a rare but important cellulitis etiology.

Soft-Tissue Infections

Diagnosis

Proper identification of NTM in skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) is crucial for treatment success in orthopaedics. SSTIs caused by NTM often occur after skin-breaching trauma (traumatic injury, surgery, or cosmetic procedures), and this was demonstrated in a study by Goldstein et alwhere 14 patients with NTM SSTIs were all found to have undergone a previous procedure at the site of infection. SSTIs from NTM typically present in a nonspecific fashion, which are diverse, including abscesses, cellulitis, nodules, ulcers, draining sinus tracts, plaques, folliculitis, and others. The identification of a SSTI could also be as a consequence of disseminated NTM disease, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.

An indolent SSTI that is culture negative and unresponsive to typical antimicrobials should also raise concern for NTM. The relative rarity of NTM, the fact that mycobacterial cultures are not routinely performed on cultures, and the nonspecific nature of its presentation can all lead to delays in diagnosis, which is why a high clinical suspicion must be maintained. In addition, because treatment varies based on the specific NTM species and their sensitivities, NTM-specific cultures from tissue biopsies are essential for accurate diagnosis.

Histologic analysis of NTM tissue biopsies frequently shows negative results with acid-fast bacilli stains and cannot preclude the possibility of NTM infections. However, suppurative granulomas are one of the most characteristic histologic features of biopsy specimens and should trigger suspicion for cutaneous NTM. Occasionally, positive cultures occur in the absence of clinical disease, which may be attributed to laboratory cross-contamination or contaminated instruments, especially those with small crevices that can be difficult to sterilize. If NTM are identified in normally sterile sites, in large quantities, or there are multiple isolates from nonsterile sites, then surgeons should consider this as a true infection until proven otherwise and urgent consultation with ID specialists should be done for consideration of therapy, especially in immunocompromised patients.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Case series and review of the literature of Mycobacterium chelonae infections of the lower extremities [^112RYwnd]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium chelonae infections involving the lower extremities are rare clinical entities that present a diagnostic challenge given its diverse clinical presentations ranging from superficial (e.g., cellulitis, painful vesicular lesions) to deep (e.g., tenosynovitis) infections. We present 1 cases of M chelonae infections of the feet diagnosed 6 to 12 months after initial symptoms representing the difficulty of diagnosing this condition. Both cases were successfully managed with aggressive surgical debridement and long durations of antibiotic therapy with long-term care. A comprehensive review of the literature of M chelonae infections of the lower extremities was performed to provide summary data on the presenting symptoms, examination findings, predisposing conditions, and management approaches of this rare, but emerging clinical entity. Our cases and comprehensive review serve to raise awareness of atypical mycobacterial infections, including M chelonae, and advocate for the early consideration of mycobacterial cultures in the diagnostic workup of chronic lower extremity infections especially in the setting of poor initial response to standard antibacterial therapies.

### Skin and soft tissue infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria [^111rq5Yf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review skin and soft tissue infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM), with a particular focus on recently published literature (2021–2022).

Recent Findings

RGM are increasingly reported as a cause of skin and soft tissue infections, both in the community setting and as a cause of nosocomial outbreaks. Recent advances in molecular methods have expanded the number of species of RGM and resulted in increased diagnosis. New treatment options are under evaluation particularly for Mycobacterium abscessus, the most difficult-to-treat among RGM.

Summary

RGM are an uncommon cause of skin and soft tissue infections and a high clinical suspicion together with advanced laboratory facilities are required for diagnosis. Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential to drive appropriate treatment, which combines surgical debridement with prolonged antimycobacterial combination therapy.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NgcMq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Nontuberculous mycobacteria: skin and soft tissue infections [^114EnHcC]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria are increasing in incidence. The nontuberculous mycobacteria are environmental, acid-fast bacilli that cause cutaneous infections primarily after trauma, surgery and cosmetic procedures. Skin findings include abscesses, sporotrichoid nodules or ulcers, but also less distinctive signs. Important species include Mycobacterium marinum and the rapidly growing mycobacterium: M. fortuitum, M. abscessus and M. chelonae. Obtaining tissue for mycobacterial culture and histopathology aids diagnosis. Optimal therapy is not well-established, but is species-dependent and generally dictated by susceptibility studies. Management often includes use of multiple antibiotics for several months and potential use of adjunctive surgery.

### Failure of antibiotics in cellulitis trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138M9cS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of the study are to quantify trial-to-trial variability in antibiotic failure rates, in randomized clinical trials of cellulitis treatment and to provide a point estimate for the treatment failure rate across trials.

Methods

We conducted a structured search for clinical trials evaluating antibiotic treatment of cellulitis, indexed in PubMed by August 2015. We included studies published in English and excluded studies conducted wholly outside of developed countries because the pathophysiology of cellulitis is likely to be different in such settings. Two authors reviewed all abstracts identified for possible inclusion. Of studies identified initially, 5% met the selection criteria. Two reviewers extracted data independently, and data were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey transformation under a random-effects model. Our primary outcome was the summary estimate of treatment failure across intent-to-treat and clinically evaluable participants.

Results

We included 19 articles reporting data from 20 studies, for a total of 3935 patients. Treatment failure was reported in 6% to 37% of participants in the 9 trials reporting intent-to-treat results, with a summary point estimate of 18% failing treatment (95% confidence interval, 15%-21%). In the 15 articles evaluating clinically evaluable participants, treatment failure rates ranged from 3% to 42%, and overall, 12% (95% confidence interval, 10%-14%) were designated treatment failures.

Conclusions

Treatment failure rates vary widely across cellulitis trials, from 6% to 37%. This may be due to confusion of cellulitis with its mimics and perhaps problems with construct validity of the diagnosis of cellulitis. Such factors bias trials toward equivalence and, in routine clinical care, impair quality and antibiotic stewardship. Objective diagnostic tools are needed.

### Which outcomes are reported in cellulitis trials? Results of a review of outcomes included in cellulitis trials and a patient priority setting survey [^113ZgDBb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is an emerging need to develop consistent outcomes in clinical trials to allow effective comparison of treatment effects. No systematic review has previously looked at the reporting of outcome measures used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment and prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas).

Objectives

The primary aim of this review was to describe the breadth of outcomes reported from RCTs on cellulitis treatment and prevention. The secondary aim was to identify outcome themes from patients' and healthcare professionals' feedback from a cellulitis Priority Setting Partnership (PSP).

Methods

We conducted a review of all outcome measures used in RCTs from two recent Cochrane reviews. Free-text responses from a cellulitis priority setting survey were used to understand the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals.

Results

Outcomes from 42 RCTs on treatment of cellulitis and six RCTs on prevention of cellulitis were reviewed. Only 28 trials stated their primary outcome. For trials assessing treatment of cellulitis, clinical response to treatment was categorized in 25 different ways. Five of these trials used an outcome that was in accordance with FDA guidance and only four trials incorporated either quality of life or patient satisfaction. For trials assessing prevention of cellulitis, recurrence was the key outcome measure. From the cellulitis PSP, prevention of recurrence, clinical features and long-term disease impact were the most important outcome themes for patients.

Conclusions

We have shown that in cellulitis treatment and prevention research, there is significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, inadequate focus on patient-reported outcomes, and a disparity between what is currently measured and what patients and healthcare professionals feel is important. We recommend that future cellulitis treatment trials consider the use of longer-term outcomes to capture recurrence and long-term morbidity, as well as short-term resolution of acute infection.

Answers:
A: Injection site reaction – Incorrect. Injection site reactions, such as erythema, swelling, pain, and bruising, are common immediate reactions, which generally resolve spontaneously within a week.
B: Acne fulminans – Incorrect. Acne fulminans is a rare disorder presenting as an acute, painful, ulcerating, and hemorrhagic lesions on face and trunk. It usually affects young males. It may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, polyarthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, etc. X-rays may show osteolytic bone lesions.
C: Acute facial cellulitis – Incorrect. Acute facial cellulitis is mostly unilateral acute infection, caused by Group A Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus, and is usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. Routine laboratory tests may show leukocytosis. Fourteen days treatment with systemic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ciprofloxacin is expected to improve symptoms of this condition.
D: Delayed inflammatory reaction to dermal filler – Incorrect. Delayed inflammatory reactions are immune mediated reactions to dermal fillers. They appear weeks to years after injection of resorbable or permanent fillers. Such reactions are usually not accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy, neither start on day 4 after the injection.
E: Mycobacterium abscessus infection – Correct. Inflammatory nodules, presenting within 3 to 7 days after filler injection are suspected as infection. In spite Staphylococci and Streptococci are the most identified organisms, limited response to first-line antibiotics and lack of growth from routine bacterial culture should raise suspicion of nontuberculous mycobacteria. The most common nontuberculous mycobacteria species causing postcosmetic procedures skin infection are M abscessus, followed by Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium fortuitum.

### Decreased antibiotic utilization after implementation of a guideline for inpatient cellulitis and cutaneous abscess… [^111BwCZv]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Broad anaerobic activity: β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, clindamycin, or imipenem-cilastatin. A, All cases; B, patients with cellulitis; C, patients with cutaneous abscess. Duration of antibiotic therapy by time period. A, All cases; B, patients with cellulitis; C, patients with cutaneous abscess. Parenteral vancomycin was suggested for empirical therapy15, 33 in addition to adjunctive use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, 34 unless contraindicated, and elevation of the affected area. 15, 33 Use of antimicrobial agents with broad aerobic gram-negative or anaerobic activity was specifically discouraged. On clinical improvement in cases in which culture data were not available, transition to oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was recommended. 15 A total course of therapy of 7 days was suggested, with longer courses reserved for cases of severe or poorly responsive disease.

8, 15, 33 To promote knowledge of, and adherence to, the guideline, we performed a multifaceted implementation strategy consisting of 4 components. Although cellulitis and cutaneous abscess are predominantly caused by gram-positive pathogens, use of treatment regimens with a broad spectrum of gram-negative and anaerobic activity is common. 7–13 In our guideline, we promoted the use of a single gram-positive agent, vancomycin, as empirical treatment for both cellulitis and cutaneous abscess. We chose vancomycin for the sake of simplicity in the guideline, the unclear role of community-associated MRSA in cases of cellulitis, and the frequent isolation of MRSA from abscess culture samples. At the same time, we actively discouraged the use of agents with broad gram-negative and anaerobic activity. This treatment strategy led to marked decreases in exposure to broad spectrum therapy.

Implementation of the guideline promoting 7 days of therapy decreased the median duration of therapy by nearly 25%. Moreover, patients were less likely to receive prolonged durations of therapy and more likely to receive a short course of therapy. Of importance, patients who received a short course of therapy were not more likely to experience clinical failure than those who received a long course of therapy. Our data suggest that short durations of therapy targeted to gram-positive pathogens decreases unnecessary antibiotic exposure without adversely affecting outcomes; however, clinical trials in this area are needed.

### Rarely seen infections [^111kRtMs]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

There are many rare cutaneous infections of the face. This phrase seems irrelevant, because rare infections in certain parts of the world are common in others. This is more apparent if applied to different sites of the body (eg, face). For instance, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is common in Central and South America and uncommon in the United States. Because most medical practitioners in this country have never seen a case, it is easy for them to miss a diagnosis. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a protozoan infection transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, is typically divided into two forms: one found in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and southern Europe, called Old World leishmaniasis, and one found in Latin and Central America, called New World leishmaniasis. Also atypical mycobacterial infection has been described in the medical literature since the mid-1950s. The development and introduction of a rapid radiometric mycobacterial detection system has advanced the field of mycobacteriology over the past 20 years. This method has allowed the distinction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from other mycobacteria and enabled the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of mycobacteria. The increased frequency of atypical mycobacterial infection stems from advances in the diagnostic procedures concerning the infection paired with the prevalence of mycobacterial disease in immunocompromised patients infected with HIV. Erysipelas and facial cellulitis are covered briefly in this paper.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116QtZHg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas… [^112JMiZb]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the most appropriate antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment for cellulitis. Findings In this systematic review of 43 studies that included 5999 participants, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another and the use of intravenous over oral antibiotics; short treatment courses appear to be as effective as longer treatment courses. Meaning In light of low-quality evidence found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis, additional research is required to define the optimum management of cellulitis. Importance The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to inform the production of evidence-based guidelines that cover antibiotic choice, route of administration, duration of treatment, the role of combinations of antibiotics, and gaps in research. We included studies of adults or children with a cellulitis diagnosis that randomized participants to groups. We used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas, as the 2 conditions cannot be readily distinguished. The focus of this review was cellulitis requiring acute therapy with antibiotics rather than prophylaxis. We considered a randomized clinical trial if a comparison was made between different treatment regimens, including different antibiotics, routes of administration, and duration of therapy. One study47 compared clindamycin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

This study was of uncomplicated skin infections and included participants with cellulitis in an area of high community prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. No difference was found between clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Data on adverse events could not be extracted. The use of oral therapy was supported by the limited data for oral vs IV antibiotics and by trials in which only oral antibiotics were used with good outcome. The earliest studies of antimicrobials for erysipelas administered the drugs orally with good outcomes. 21, 22 In this review, when oral antibiotics were compared with IV treatments, the oral treatments appeared more effective. 28, 29, 48, 58.

### Cellulitis… [^114adJqh]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

2–4 For infection in patients without diabetes, empiric treatment with a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, first-generation cephalosporin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, macrolide, or fluoroquinolone is appropriate. 5 Limited disease can be treated orally, but more extensive disease requires parenteral therapy. Marking the margins of erythema with ink is helpful in following the progression or regression of cellulitis. Outpatient therapy with injected ceftriaxone provides 24 hours of parenteral coverage and may be an option for some patients. The patient should be seen the following day to reassess disease progression. Most cases of superficial cellulitis improve within one day, but patients who exhibit thickening of the dermis usually take several days of parenteral antibiotics before significant improvement occurs. Antibiotics should be maintained for at least three days after the resolution of acute inflammation.

5 Adjunctive therapy includes the following: cool compresses; appropriate analgesics for pain; tetanus immunization; and immobilization and elevation of the affected extremity.
6. Recurrent episodes of cellulitis or undergoing surgery, such as mastectomy with lymph node dissection, can compromise venous or lymphatic circulation and cause dermal fibrosis, lymphedema, epidermal thickening, and repeated episodes of cellulitis. These patients may benefit from prophylaxis with erythromycin, penicillin, or clindamycin. 5, 7 Periorbital cellulitis is caused by the same organisms that cause other forms of cellulitis and is treated with warm soaks, oral antibiotics, and close follow-up. Because of developing resistance, erythromycin is no longer the drug of choice. 17 Azithromycin for five days and cephalexin for 10 days have been shown to be effective and well-tolerated.

20 Dicloxacillin, oxacillin, first-generation cephalosporins, or amoxicillin-clavulanate are also acceptable alternatives. 22 Impetigo can be spread by direct person-to-person contact, so appropriate hygiene is warranted. Nasal carriage of S. aureus has been implicated as a source of recurrent disease and can be reduced by the topical application of mupirocin twice daily for five days. 23.

### Risk factors for treatment failure in skin and soft tissue infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria [^116D18R7]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This study investigated the characteristics of patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and identified the risk factors for treatment failure in these patients.

Material and Methods

Data of patients with NTM SSTIs who received treatment between January 2014 and December 2019 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were collected retrospectively. Possible risk factors were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression models.

Results

A total of 47 patients (24 male, 23 female; age, 57.1 ± 15.2 years) were enrolled. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity. The most common mycobacterial species was the Mycobacterium abscessus complex, and the most commonly affected site was the axial trunk. Treatment was successful in 38 patients (81%). Six patients had recurrent infections (13%) after the treatment course was completed, and 3 patients (6.4%) died of NTM-related infection. Delayed treatment for more than 2 months and antibiotic-alone treatment were 2 independent risk factors for treatment failure of NTM SSTIs.

Conclusions

Delayed treatment for more than 2 months and antibiotic-alone treatment were associated with a higher failure rate in patients with NTM SSTIs. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of NTM infection should always be considered when the treatment course is prolonged but not effective. Early identification of causative NTM species and appropriate antibiotic treatment may lower the risk of treatment failure. Prompt surgical treatment is suggested if available.

### Postcataract endophthalmitis caused by Mycobacterium goodii [^116J3guL]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

This is the first reported case of delayed-onset postcataract endophthalmitis caused by Mycobacterium goodii, confirmed by multiple cultures. The patient had uneventful cataract removal by phacoemulsification with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL). One month later, he developed redness, pain, a hypopyon, and a decrease in visual acuity to finger counting in the affected eye. A vitreous biopsy was performed for suspected endophthalmitis; culture results showed rapidly growing bacteria identified by DNA sequencing as Mycobacterium goodii. The eye ultimately required IOL explantation but had a good final outcome with 20/40 uncorrected vision. Mycobacterium goodii is a rapidly growing Mycobacterium with isolates more commonly occurring in cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and respiratory disease. Single-drug antibiotic therapy for nonocular disease is often sufficient if the correct antimicrobial agent is used. The newer fluoroquinolones are promising against rapidly growing Mycobacterium.

### Under the sea: superficial skin infection with an atypical cause [^113SHYKN]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic abrasions on human extremities as a result of direct contact with sea, lake, river, or aquarium animals or from traumatic injuries sustained in seawater may develop into solitary or linear granulomatous lesions. One of the more common microbial etiologies for such infections is Mycobacterium marinum. An astute pediatrician, family physician, or nurse practitioner should have a high index of suspicion and obtain specific cultures to support the growth of Mycobacterium species. Mycobacterium marinum infections will not respond to antibiotics typically chosen to treat simple skin and soft tissue infections. Rather, M. marinum infections are best treated by prolonged antimicrobial treatment regimens for 3 to 6 months and, in some cases, may require polypharmacologic therapy. We present the case of a 6-year-old girl who suffered a traumatic abrasion on her right ankle in seawater. For 10 days, the skin infection morphed from cellulitis, papules, pustules, and eventually into sporotrichoid linear granuloma. After several failed antibiotic trials, M. marinum was eventually identified from the depth of her lesions. The patient improved after a 3-month course of clarithromycin. This case report is the first to include pictures demonstrating the clinical progression and resolution of M. marinum infection.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect".

Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1149CyRV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

### Sarilumab (Kevzara) [^113PUZVG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including KEVZARA. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystis were reported with KEVZARA. Some patients presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. The most frequently observed serious infections with KEVZARA in RA patients included pneumonia and cellulitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. While not reported in KEVZARA clinical studies, other serious infections (e.g., histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis) have been reported in patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of RA.

Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating KEVZARA in patients who have:

chronic or recurrent infection;
a history of serious or opportunistic infections;
underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection;
been exposed to tuberculosis; or
lived in or traveled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Hold treatment with KEVZARA if a patient develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.

Perform prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient who develops a new infection during treatment with KEVZARA; initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.

Tuberculosis

Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating treatment with KEVZARA. Treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating KEVZARA. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of KEVZARA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but having risk factors for TB infection. When considering anti-TB therapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in TB may be appropriate.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

### Nontuberculosis Mycobacterium infections in orthopaedic surgery: review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines [^117EPCgv]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

NTM infections in skin, soft tissues, grafts, and prostheses are rare but growing in incidence. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for indolent culture-negative infections that do not respond to standard therapies. While there are no formal treatment guidelines, treatment typically consists of prolonged culture-specific antibiotics, surgical débridements, implant/prosthesis removal, and occasionally amputations. These multidrug therapies are complicated by drug-drug interactions and side effects, which can lead to poor patient compliance and suboptimal treatment regimens, especially in those with comorbidities or in an immunocompromised state. Orthopaedic surgeons should initiate a multidisciplinary approach with ID specialists and pharmacists to optimize antimicrobial regimens, patient tolerance, and overall rate of treatment success.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial skin infections: recognition and management [^112sVkCN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial organisms have re-emerged as an important cause of infectious disease worldwide. Both tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections remain endemic in many parts of the world and are becoming more common in patients with iatrogenic immunosuppression and HIV infection. The nontuberculous mycobacteria, often referred to as mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOT), are of special significance to the dermatologist because they often present in the skin, typically after exposure to an aqueous environment. Presentations range from indolent nodules with sporotrichoid spread to acute suppurative folliculitis and abscess formation. Infection with MOT should be considered whenever routine bacterial cultures are negative. Cultures should be obtained, but empiric therapy must often be started while cultures are pending. Some data suggest that clarithromycin may be the best initial empiric therapy.

### Atypical mycobacterial infections after plastic surgery procedures abroad: a multidisciplinary algorithm for diagnosis and treatment [^115eL3hS]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The recent rise in medical tourism, especially for cosmetic procedures, has been mirrored by an increase in the incidence of infections with Mycobacterium abscessus, which is an atypical mycobacterium that is ubiquitous in aquatic environments. M. abscessus soft tissue infections arise from the use of improperly sterilized water and surgical equipment during surgical procedures, and these infections have devastating consequences if not promptly treated. M. abscessus infections are notoriously difficult to diagnose and properly treat, and therefore, we illustrate a typical case presentation and provide a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment algorithm.

Methods

Of the patients who have presented to our hospital for treatment of cutaneous M. abscessus infections, a representative patient's story was included to illustrate the typical presentation and treatment timeline. The current literature on M. abscessus infections was reviewed, and this literature and the clinical experience of our plastic surgery and infectious disease teams were used in the creation of a diagnostic and treatment algorithm for M. abscessus infections.

Results

M. abscessus infections can have an incubation period of months, and the classic presenting signs include purulent drainage, violaceous nodules, and subcutaneous abscesses at the site of a recent surgery. A key finding is persistence of the infection despite debridement and empiric antibiotic treatment. Cultures grown on mycobacterial-specific growth media are considered the diagnostic criterion standard, but high clinical suspicion is enough to warrant the initiation of treatment. Treatment itself consists of surgical drainage and debridement in combination with multidrug antibiotic regimens that typically include amikacin, a macrolide, and a carbapenem or cephalosporin antibiotic, with the option for macrolide and fluoroquinolone maintenance therapy.

Conclusions

M. abscessus cutaneous infections present with unique history and physical examination findings and often require complex diagnostic workups and treatment plans. Increased provider awareness of the management and potential complications of M. abscessus is crucial to the improvement patient outcomes, as is a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates primary care providers, pathologists, plastic surgeons, and infectious disease specialists.

Orbital cellulitis — urgency, evaluation, treatment, pathogens, and complications are specified: All cases of orbital cellulitis should be considered potential sight-threatening medical emergencies that require prompt diagnostic work-up and treatment. Orbital cellulitis is characterized by inflammation of deep periocular tissues with severe clinical features such as conjunctival edema and injection, restricted ocular motility, and pain on attempted eye movement, with additional symptoms including blurred vision, headache, double vision, eyelid edema, erythema, warmth, tenderness, proptosis, fever, purulent discharge, and hypesthesia. Treatment requires hospitalization for IV antibiotics, imaging, and immediate ophthalmology and/or otolaryngology, neurosurgery, or infectious disease consultation. Culture of open wounds, purulent drainage, and tissue obtained during surgery is optimal to diagnose orbital cellulitis, and bacterial causes include Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, Bacteroides species, and other environmental gram-negative rods. Failure to respond to IV antimicrobials with formation of a subperiosteal abscess may necessitate surgical intervention to clear bacterial infection, and surgical intervention is also indicated for invasive mold infections such as sino-nasal mucormycosis, which must be ruled out in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. All patients with orbital cellulitis must be monitored for complications, including cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and extension into the brain parenchyma.

### Therapy of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [^115NMpsw]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections are increasing in incidence worldwide, partly as a result of the increase in immunocompromised individuals. They cause a large number of cutaneous infections with a broad array of manifestations. Because of their diverse manifestations and sometimes fastidious nature, infections with mycobacteria are often misdiagnosed, leading to delay in and sometimes failure of therapy. In addition, many mycobacteria display both in vitro and in vivo drug resistance to antimicrobial agents. Early recognition of affected patients, initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy based on current guidelines, and tailoring of therapy after susceptibility testing is available are therefore essential to the successful treatment of mycobacterial infections.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^116nB31V]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

GNB are increasingly recognized as important pathogens of SSTIs, particularly in comorbid and immunocompromised patients. Common GNB-causing SSTIs include Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Risk factors for GNB SSTIs are recent hospitalization, prior antibiotic use and underlying comorbidities. GNB SSTIs and polymicrobial episodes were found at a high risk for initial inappropriate treatment, often associated with MDRO isolation, with a consequent increased risk of new exacerbation and recurrence.

Other less common pathogen implicated in SSTIs are atypical bacteria, as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Two main risk factors are contributing to the increased prevalence of these pathogens in SSTIs: the increasing number of immunocompromising conditions and of cosmetic and body-modifying procedures. Common NTM species implicated in SSTIs include rapidly growing mycobacteria, M. marinum and M. avium complex, with M. kansasii also causing SSTIs and osteomyelitis in rare cases. A challenging diagnosis, involving tissue biopsy and molecular tests, and treatment, often requiring both surgical debridement and combination antibiotic therapy, explains the frequent subacute, remitting/recurring course of these SSTIs.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qTzei]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in the outpatient setting: presentation of a case, review of the literature, and therapeutic considerations [^116TPkT3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections are not common issues for many dermatologists. Recognition and treatment of these infections are frequently delayed by incorrect diagnoses. Frequently, the diagnosis of a mycobacterial infection is hampered by coinfection with bacteria including Staphylococcus. In some instances, patients will have infections with both mycobacteria and Staphylococcus. For some patients, as was the case with the patient reported herein, a biopsy is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Physicians need to keep an open mind when presented with cutaneous infections and consider mycobacterial infections for patients that do not improve with standard antibacterial medications.

### Progressive lower extremity cellulitis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus on systemic immunosuppression: a rare manifestation of cutaneous tuberculosis [^116cHK7k]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Tuberculous cellulitis is a rare presentation of cutaneous MTB primarily seen in immunosuppressed patients. It presents as an indurated, erythematous plaque that may mimic cellulitis due to typical bacteria or rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (RGM). Identifying tuberculous cellulitis presents challenges, as evidenced by the delayed diagnosis in this case and a misdiagnosis rate as high as 33% to 50% in some contexts. Consistent with other cases, our patient's disease was not limited to the skin, which highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation for distant sites of TB infection.

Most published cases of tuberculous cellulitis occurred in patients on immunosuppressive medications rather than other forms of immunocompromise, such as HIV/AIDS or malignancy (Table I). Besides 1 reported case of tuberculous cellulitis in an immunocompetent patient, systemic corticosteroids were implicated in all described cases of cutaneous TB. While patients with HIV/AIDS are known to be at elevated risk of other forms of TB, including disseminated TB, tuberculous cellulitis has not been reported in this patient population, perhaps implicating suppression of a CD4 + -independent pathway in this unique manifestation of cutaneous TB.

Table I
Summary of reported cases of tuberculous cellulitis

Previous reports suggest that TB cellulitis can arise from exogenous inoculation, localized contiguous spread, or hematogenous dissemination; however, it is frequently observed in patients with other concurrent foci of TB (Table I). In our case and in several reported cases of TB cellulitis, skin manifestations preceded diagnosis of pulmonary or miliary TB. Thus, TB cellulitis may herald underlying occult disseminated disease.

Microbiological species obtained from this patient's skin biopsy showed abundant mycobacteria, which grew in 6 days in liquid broth culture. Culture growth occurs in fewer than half of cases in other forms of cutaneous TB (eg, lupus vulgaris), and when growth occurs, it is typically after more than 3 weeks. Mycobacterial culture growth within 7 days is classically associated with RGM, which also cause antibiotic-resistant skin and soft tissue infections. The short time-to-positivity measured in our case likely reflects an especially high bacillary load that developed in the setting of immunosuppression.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Case of disseminated cutaneous Mycobacterium chelonae infection mimicking cutaneous vasculitis [^116ShFRX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium chelonae is a non-tuberculous, rapidly growing mycobacteria and is widely distributed in the natural environment. In the immunocompetent status, localized cutaneous infections such as cellulitis and subcutaneous abscesses commonly occur after traumatic injury. However, disseminated cutaneous infections occur on a background of immunosuppression. Cutaneous M. chelonae infection presents with a variety of skin eruptions. We report a case of disseminated M. chelonae infection mimicking cutaneous vasculitis. The patient was treated with long-term oral corticosteroids and injected etanercept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Because the skin eruptions were preceded by asthma and rheumatoid arthritis and the pathological findings showed fibrinoid necrosis around the vascular of dermis, cutaneous vasculitis was first suspected. The culture from the pus revealed the bacterium which grew within 5 days on Ogawa's culture medium suggesting a rapidly growing mycobacteria. This bacterium was identified as M. chelonae by the DNA-DNA hybridization method. We chose 800 mg/day clarithromycin and 500 mg/day levofloxacin as a result of the drug-sensitivity test. After 6 months of the treatment, infection symptoms disappeared. Rapidly growing mycobacteria should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infections in patients under immunosuppression caused by diseases or drugs such as corticosteroids and biologic agents. Repeated bacterial examinations are important and required for the diagnosis of rapidly growing mycobacteria.

### Nontuberculosis Mycobacterium infections in orthopaedic surgery: review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines [^117F9QJT]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculosis Mycobacterium infections are rare but devastating infections in orthopaedic surgery. The complexity of treatment and the high rate of treatment failure for nontuberculosis Mycobacterium infections illustrate their unique pathogenesis and success at evading normal immune responses. To date, there is no formal treatment algorithm developed for managing these infections in orthopaedic surgery. Successful eradication relies on prolonged culture-specific antibiotic therapies coupled with surgical resection, implant/prosthesis removal, and occasionally amputations. These multidrug therapies often have a high rate of complications, drug-drug interactions, and poor tolerance, further increasing the complexity of treatment. Outlining the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines of these rare but detrimental infections is essential to improving treatment success.

### Mycobacterium abscessus complex infections in humans [^1116QWR3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Mycobacteria are divided into 2 major groups for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which comprises M. tuberculosis, and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which comprise all of the other mycobacteria species that do not cause tuberculosis. NTM can cause pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), central nervous system infections, bacteremia, and ocular and other infections. Over the past decade, the number of NTM disease cases worldwide has markedly increased, and the upsurge cannot be explained solely by increased awareness among physicians and advances in laboratory methods.

M. abscessus complex is a group of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant NTM species that are ubiquitous in soil and water. Species comprising M. avium complex (MAC) are the most common NTM species responsible for disease; however, infections caused by M. abscessus complex are more difficult to treat because of antimicrobial drug resistance. M. abscessus complex is also resistant to disinfectants and, therefore, can cause postsurgical and postprocedural infections. Although M. abscessus complex most commonly causes SSTIs and pulmonary infections, the complex can also cause disease in almost all human organs. To improve our understanding of M. abscessus complex infections, we reviewed the epidemiology and clinical features of and treatment and prevention measure for diseases caused by the organisms as well as the taxonomy and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these organisms.

### Drugs for treating buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans disease) [^113jjicM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing cutaneous infection caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans bacteria that occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The infection progresses from nodules under the skin to deep ulcers, often on the upper and lower limbs or on the face. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it can lead to lifelong disfigurement and disabilities. It is often treated with drugs and surgery.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence of drug treatments for treating Buruli ulcer.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature; BIREME). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). All searches were run up to 19 December 2017. We also checked the reference lists of articles identified by the literature search, and contacted leading researchers in this topic area to identify any unpublished data.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared antibiotic therapy to placebo or alternative therapy such as surgery, or that compared different antibiotic regimens. We also included prospective observational studies that evaluated different antibiotic regimens with or without surgery.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed methodological quality. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included a total of 18 studies: five RCTs involving a total of 319 participants, ranging from 12 participants to 151 participants, and 13 prospective observational studies, with 1665 participants. Studies evaluated various drugs usually in addition to surgery, and were carried out across eight countries in areas with high Buruli ulcer endemicity in West Africa and Australia. Only one RCT reported adequate methods to minimize bias. Regarding monotherapy, one RCT and one observational study evaluated clofazimine, and one RCT evaluated sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. All three studies had small sample sizes, and no treatment effect was demonstrated. The remaining studies examined combination therapy.

Rifampicin combined with streptomycin

We found one RCT and six observational studies which evaluated rifampicin combined with streptomycin for different lengths of treatment (2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks) (941 participants). The RCT did not demonstrate a difference between the drugs added to surgery compared with surgery alone for recurrence at 12 months, but was underpowered (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.51; 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

An additional five single‐arm observational studies with 828 participants using this regimen for eight weeks with surgery (given to either all participants or to a select group) reported healing rates ranging from 84.5% to 100%, assessed between six weeks and one year. Four observational studies reported healing rates for participants who received the regimen alone without surgery, reporting healing rates ranging from 48% to 95% assessed between eight weeks and one year.

Rifampicin combined with clarithromycin

Two observational studies administered combined rifampicin and clarithromycin. One study evaluated the regimen alone (no surgery) for eight weeks and reported a healing rate of 50% at 12 months (30 participants). Another study evaluated the regimen administered for various durations (as determined by the clinicians, durations unspecified) with surgery and reported a healing rate of 100% at 12 months (21 participants).

Rifampicin with streptomycin initially, changing to rifampicin with clarithromycin in consolidation phase

One RCT evaluated this regimen (four weeks in each phase) against continuing with rifampicin and streptomycin in the consolidation phase (total eight weeks). All included participants had small lesions, and healing rates were above 90% in both groups without surgery (healing rate at 12 months RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 151 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One single‐arm observational study evaluating the substitution of streptomycin with clarithromycin in the consolidation phase (6 weeks, total 8 weeks) without surgery given to a select group showed a healing rate of 98% at 12 months (41 participants).

Novel combination therapy

Two large prospective studies in Australia evaluated some novel regimens. One study evaluating rifampicin combined with either ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, or moxifloxacin without surgery reported a healing rate of 76.5% at 12 months (132 participants). Another study evaluating combinations of two to three drugs from rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, ethambutol, moxifloxacin, or amikacin with surgery reported a healing rate of 100% (90 participants).

Adverse effects were reported in only three RCTs (158 participants) and eight prospective observational studies (878 participants), and were consistent with what is already known about the adverse effect profile of these drugs. Paradoxical reactions (clinical deterioration after treatment caused by enhanced immune response to M ulcerans) were evaluated in six prospective observational studies (822 participants), and the incidence of paradoxical reactions ranged from 1.9% to 26%.

Authors' conclusions

While the antibiotic combination treatments evaluated appear to be effective, we found insufficient evidence showing that any particular drug is more effective than another. How different sizes, lesions, and stages of the disease may contribute to healing and which kind of lesions are in need of surgery are unclear based on the included studies. Guideline development needs to consider these factors in designing practical treatment regimens. Forthcoming trials using clarithromycin with rifampicin and other trials of new regimens that also address these factors will help to identify the best regimens.

Treatment Escalation, Other Resource Use, and Outcome in Relation to Early Response

Antibiotic treatment escalation was observed in 34% (69/205) of cases, mostly within 2 days of treatment initiation (Table 2). Among cases with such early escalation, 90% (37/41) had nonresponse at day 1. Most cases with nonresponse at day 1 and treatment escalation within day 2 had response within day 3, but not as often as those without escalation (73% [24/33] vs 91% [75/82]; P = 0.009). Treatment escalation within day 2 was rarely associated with inappropriate initial therapy (2/40 [5%]) and was common both in cases with confirmed or probable BHS etiology (32/173 [19%]) and other cases (8/39 [27%]). Long duration of therapy was strongly associated with nonresponse at day 3, but not with nonresponse at day 1 (Table 2). Surgical treatment escalation was clearly more common in cases with nonresponse at day 3.

Table 2.
Treatment Resources and Outcome in Relation to Response at Days 1 and 3

Nonresponse at day 1 and day 3 was not significantly associated with clinical failure, but nonresponse at day 3 was predictive of a complicated, resource-demanding course (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis with replacement of missing response data gave similar results.

Tuberculous lymphadenitis — recommended regimen and procedures: We believe a 6-month regimen is adequate for initial treatment of all patients with drug-susceptible tuberculous lymphadenitis. Affected lymph nodes may enlarge and new nodes can appear during or after therapy without evidence of bacteriological relapse. Therapeutic lymph node excision is not indicated except in unusual circumstances; aspiration of large fluctuant nodes has been reported by some experts to be beneficial although not examined systematically. Incision and drainage of cervical lymphadenitis has been associated with prolonged wound discharge and scarring, and in US children the majority of lymphatic mycobacterial disease is caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria.

### Cutaneous infections due to nontuberculosis Mycobacterium: recognition and management [^111RuNyb]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a diverse group of organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment, and the incidence of cutaneous infections due to NTM has been steadily increasing. Cutaneous infections due to NTM can be difficult to diagnose, due to their wide spectrum of clinical presentations and histopathological findings that are often nonspecific. A variety of modalities including tissue culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may be necessary to identify the organism. Treatment can also be challenging, as it can depend on multiple factors, including the causative organism, the patient's immunological status, and the extent of disease involvement. In this review, we discuss the common presentations of cutaneous NTM infections, diagnostic tools, and treatment recommendations. A multi-disciplinary approach that involves good communication between the clinician, the histopathologist, the microbiologist, and infectious disease specialists can help lead to successful diagnosis and management.

### Drugs for treating buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans disease) [^1157uSHF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing cutaneous infection caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans bacteria that occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The infection progresses from nodules under the skin to deep ulcers, often on the upper and lower limbs or on the face. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it can lead to lifelong disfigurement and disabilities. It is often treated with drugs and surgery.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence of drug treatments for treating Buruli ulcer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature; BIREME). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/). All searches were run up to 19 December 2017. We also checked the reference lists of articles identified by the literature search, and contacted leading researchers in this topic area to identify any unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared antibiotic therapy to placebo or alternative therapy such as surgery, or that compared different antibiotic regimens. We also included prospective observational studies that evaluated different antibiotic regimens with or without surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed methodological quality. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included a total of 18 studies: five RCTs involving a total of 319 participants, ranging from 12 participants to 151 participants, and 13 prospective observational studies, with 1665 participants. Studies evaluated various drugs usually in addition to surgery, and were carried out across eight countries in areas with high Buruli ulcer endemicity in West Africa and Australia. Only one RCT reported adequate methods to minimize bias. Regarding monotherapy, one RCT and one observational study evaluated clofazimine, and one RCT evaluated sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. All three studies had small sample sizes, and no treatment effect was demonstrated. The remaining studies examined combination therapy. Rifampicin combined with streptomycinWe found one RCT and six observational studies which evaluated rifampicin combined with streptomycin for different lengths of treatment (2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks) (941 participants). The RCT did not demonstrate a difference between the drugs added to surgery compared with surgery alone for recurrence at 12 months, but was underpowered (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.51; 21 participants; very low-certainty evidence). An additional five single-arm observational studies with 828 participants using this regimen for eight weeks with surgery (given to either all participants or to a select group) reported healing rates ranging from 84.5% to 100%, assessed between six weeks and one year. Four observational studies reported healing rates for participants who received the regimen alone without surgery, reporting healing rates ranging from 48% to 95% assessed between eight weeks and one year. Rifampicin combined with clarithromycinTwo observational studies administered combined rifampicin and clarithromycin. One study evaluated the regimen alone (no surgery) for eight weeks and reported a healing rate of 50% at 12 months (30 participants). Another study evaluated the regimen administered for various durations (as determined by the clinicians, durations unspecified) with surgery and reported a healing rate of 100% at 12 months (21 participants). Rifampicin with streptomycin initially, changing to rifampicin with clarithromycin in consolidation phaseOne RCT evaluated this regimen (four weeks in each phase) against continuing with rifampicin and streptomycin in the consolidation phase (total eight weeks). All included participants had small lesions, and healing rates were above 90% in both groups without surgery (healing rate at 12 months RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 151 participants; low-certainty evidence). One single-arm observational study evaluating the substitution of streptomycin with clarithromycin in the consolidation phase (6 weeks, total 8 weeks) without surgery given to a select group showed a healing rate of 98% at 12 months (41 participants). Novel combination therapyTwo large prospective studies in Australia evaluated some novel regimens. One study evaluating rifampicin combined with either ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, or moxifloxacin without surgery reported a healing rate of 76.5% at 12 months (132 participants). Another study evaluating combinations of two to three drugs from rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, ethambutol, moxifloxacin, or amikacin with surgery reported a healing rate of 100% (90 participants). Adverse effects were reported in only three RCTs (158 participants) and eight prospective observational studies (878 participants), and were consistent with what is already known about the adverse effect profile of these drugs. Paradoxical reactions (clinical deterioration after treatment caused by enhanced immune response to M ulcerans) were evaluated in six prospective observational studies (822 participants), and the incidence of paradoxical reactions ranged from 1.9% to 26%.

Authors' Conclusions

While the antibiotic combination treatments evaluated appear to be effective, we found insufficient evidence showing that any particular drug is more effective than another. How different sizes, lesions, and stages of the disease may contribute to healing and which kind of lesions are in need of surgery are unclear based on the included studies. Guideline development needs to consider these factors in designing practical treatment regimens. Forthcoming trials using clarithromycin with rifampicin and other trials of new regimens that also address these factors will help to identify the best regimens.

### Mycobacterium abscessus complex infections in humans [^111e4hTH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment

Several problems regarding treatment of M. abscessus complex infections in different organs are unsolved. For example, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal antimicrobial agents and combination therapy, optimal treatment duration, and the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents (e.g. tigecycline). Reports describing cases of M. abscessus complex infection are limited, except for those describing pulmonary disease and SSTIs. Thus, treatment recommendations must rely on retrospective case series. A summary of treatment recommendations from previous studies is shown in Table 2. The treatment of serious M. abscessus complex disease usually involves initial combination antimicrobial therapy with a macrolide (clarithromycin 1,000 mg daily or 500 mg twice daily, or azithromycin 250 mg–500 mg daily) plus intravenous agents for at least 2 weeks to several months followed by oral macrolide–based therapy. The drugs of choice for initial intravenous administration are amikacin (25 mg/kg 3×/wk) plus cefoxitin (up to 12 g/d given in divided doses) or amikacin (25 mg/kg 3×/wk) plus imipenem (500 mg 2–4×/wk). As previously mentioned, the in vitro MICs of tigecycline are low, and the drug should be considered in treatment regimens.

### A case of ulcerative tuberculous cellulitis in the setting of methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder [^117HFFju]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB) can be classified into 2 major categories: true CTB and tuberculids. True CTB includes scrofuloderma, lupus vulgaris, tuberculous gumma, orificial tuberculosis (TB), and acute miliary TB. Tuberculids, including papulonecrotic tuberculid, lichen scrofulosorum, and Bazin erythema induratum, are an allergic reaction to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Unlike with true CTB, organisms are not generally detected in tuberculids.

Tuberculous cellulitis is a rare form of CTB with cellulitis-like plaques, and it usually affects immunocompromised patients. Early recognition and treatment may prevent its progression but are often difficult due to overlapping features with other skin conditions.

Several cases of atypical CTB have been reported in adults. We present a rare case of ulcerative tuberculous cellulitis in a patient with methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD.)

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116zpUYf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common causes of medical care, and increasing frequency and costs are reported. The SSTI that most often requires systemic antibiotics is cellulitis, a diffuse skin infection that includes the superficial subtype known as erysipelas. Cellulitis is usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) that are susceptible to penicillin and other narrow-spectrum antibiotics. However, there are significant treatment challenges, including overuse of broad-spectrum and intravenous antibiotics, difficulties regarding when to initiate rescue therapy and when to stop treatment, and frequent recurrences. Toxin effects and profound local inflammation, not necessarily corresponding to bacterial burden or antibiotic needs, may contribute to these problems. Also, host factors affecting the dynamics of treatment response may adversely impact antibiotic choices and other resource use.

Increasing the knowledge on the clinical course, response dynamics, and associated factors may be important in dealing with the challenges of cellulitis care. Optimizing the assessment of treatment response may be a key factor, due to its major role in treatment decisions and clinical trials. The standard assessment of response in SSTI trials has been performed after end of treatment (EOT). However, clinical success posttreatment may often be the result of natural improvement, as demonstrated by high cure rates following nonantibiotic therapy in studies from the preantibiotic and early antibiotic eras. Moreover, 2 studies published in 1937 comparing antibiotic and ultraviolet therapy found the difference between treatment arms to peak 2–3 days after start of treatment, suggesting that early response is a more treatment-specific measure than cure assessed posttreatment. Clinical response 48–72 hours after treatment initiation is therefore currently recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the primary efficacy endpoint for clinical trials. This has not been without controversy, however, primarily because early response is not the ultimate goal of antibiotic therapy. European guidelines still recommend cure assessed after treatment as the primary endpoint.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^115wHzWj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Infection

Delayed-onset chronic infections, which generally develop 2 or more weeks after injection, tend to affect a more generalized area and may involve an atypical organism (such as Mycobacteria or Escherichia coli). These are challenging for both diagnosis and treatment and can cause a chronic inflammatory response.

In the opinion of the panel, a sequence of treatment options similar to that in early acute infection should be followed:
To perform a bacterial culture and clinical assessment to decide type of infection and treat with antibiotics or corticosteroids.
It is important to do a differential diagnosis with hypersensitivity, as the use of steroids should be avoided in infection.
There are not comparative studies supporting the effectiveness of a specific therapeutic regimen. Once the species is identified, an antibiogram is required. If atypical mycobacteria are suspected, while waiting for the antibiogram results, an empirical treatment with antibiotics, which cover atypical mycobacteria, such as claritromicina 500 mg/twice daily combined with ethambutol or rifampicin, may be recommended.

Abscess

Abscess formation is a rare complication, reported in permanent hydrogel fillers, occurring any time from 1 week to several years after treatment; it may persist for weeks, and periodically recur for months.

The first-line therapy is drainage and antibiotics. As mentioned for the delayed-onset chronic infections, the panel recommends, in order to tailor the treatment, to obtain bacterial cultures and perform sensitivity reports. Although it is extremely rare, midfacial and periorbital infection may result in intracerebral complications.

It has been proposed that low-grade infections are responsible for all delayed-onset complications, including foreign-body granulomas, as a result of biofilm formation.

Nodules

Nodules and lumps are common complications resulting from the use of dermal fillers.

Nodules must be categorized as inflammatory or non-inflammatory.

Lactational breast abscess — drain the abscess to achieve source control, with needle aspiration with fluid culture and sensitivity often recommended as the first-line intervention for lactational abscess; however, patients most often require recurrent aspirations and drain placement as the initial intervention should be considered for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction, and vacuum-assisted wound devices on a lactating breast should be strictly avoided. After aspiration or drain placement, mothers should continue breastfeeding from the affected breast, with milk fistula rate < 2%, and antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, though a shorter course may be appropriate if cellulitis resolves rapidly. Tissue inflammation and phlegmonous changes may persist for several weeks; patients should undergo interval examination and imaging to ensure resolution. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendations: C.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the head and neck [^114yn5ge]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous in the environment. Immunocompetent children are commonly infected by these resilient organisms. Cervical lymphadenitis, the most frequent head and neck manifestation of NTM infection, often presents as chronic, unilateral lymphadenopathy with characteristic violaceous overlying skin changes. Diagnosis is ultimately dependent on culture or histopathologic examination of specimen obtained through excisional lymph node biopsy or FNA. The principal treatment of NTM infection remains the surgical excision of diseased tissue. Antibiotics augment surgical therapy and their potential role as a single-modality therapy continues to be investigated.

Pathogenesis

Immune Response and Immune System Evasion

The failure of sterilization and treatment of NTM infections stems from the impressive ability of these infections to evade the immune system. The development of biofilm has been a successful survival strategy for these organisms and allows them to be more resistant to standard disinfectants and survive in municipal water systems. To increase the complexity, the growth characteristics of these biofilms differ between the different Mycobacterium species; for example, M chelonae grows vertically while M fortuitum covers a broader surface area with thinner growth.

Another virulence factor of Mycobacterium involves a process called cording. This occurs when bacilli are aligned in a parallel fashion, growing into long intertwining structures, giving them the appearance of a rope or cord when viewed under a microscope. Extensive cording is seen in Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as numerous NTM species, including M abscessus, M chelonae, and M marinum, and enhances their ability to survive in host macrophages by preventing them from being completely phagocytosed. - By preventing phagocytosis, this allows for uncontrolled extracellular replication, the formation of abscesses, soft-tissue damage, and death. - Typically, when a bacterial organism is phagocytosed, an "early phagosome" is created. Usually, it undergoes a maturation process, with the eventual production of a "late phagosome" and then the phagolysosome. The latter is an acidic compartment containing proteases, hydrolases, and lipases in addition to other antimicrobial molecules. By evolving the ability to disrupt the maturation of phagosomes, Mycobacteria have improved their ability to survive and replicate intracellularly.

Complexity of Treatment

Secondary to the abovementioned pathogenesis, it is understandable that NTM infections are very challenging to treat. Preferred antimicrobials include those with the ability to concentrate adequately intracellularly. To avoid selection of resistant pathogens, treatment typically consists of multiple antimicrobials with extended courses. However, this leads to the secondary problem of drug intolerances and side effects, which can jeopardize optimal drug regimens and successful treatment completion in patients. This is especially true in the elderly and patients with comorbidities on numerous baseline medications because drug-drug interactions occur frequently. Close clinical and laboratory monitoring is necessary throughout treatment, typically in the form of serial complete blood cell counts, creatinine concentration tests, liver function tests, and others based on expected medication-specific toxicities. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is strongly recommended to optimize treatment success and should also be repeated when faced with treatment failures.

### [^1141tDTh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium chelonae is a rapidly growing mycobacterium which is known to respond well to standard antibiotic treatment regimen. There are no specific guidelines for treatment. Antibiotics are chosen based on the bacterial sensitivity. Here we present a 47-year-old man with hip replacement who developed bright red papular generalised skin lesions and bilateral hip abscess. On workup, it was confirmed that M. chelonae was the causative organism. He was given 8weeks of antibiotics; however, there was worsening of the hip abscess on interval imaging. The progression was most likely due to M. chelonae developing antibiotic resistance. Physicians should be aware of the rising resistance of this organism, and guide antibiotic therapy based on bacterial sensitivity to yield better outcomes.

### A 39-year-old man with a skin infection [^116ZHwAY]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

The case of Mr M, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

### Infected ptosis surgery-a rare complication from a multidrug-resistant organism [^115pZi7h]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

However, its porous nature may allow proliferation of bacterial contaminants and cause abscess formation, resulting in a high risk of soft tissue complications. In our patient, constant scratching may have led to infection of the wound. With tracking of the long, porous ePTFE material through an open wound, it serves as a good site for bacterial proliferation.

The periorbital abscess was chronic and persistent even after treatment with multiple antibiotics and repeated incision and drainage, indicating the highly virulent nature of the causative organism. This could be due to the formation of biofilm by the causative bacteria, especially on biomedical implants, causing antimicrobial resistance. Complete resolution in our case occurred only after removal of the Gore-tex material, which might have harbored the virulent microorganism.

There were a few other reports of complications of ptosis surgery such as granuloma and infection. In a retrospective study of 59 frontalis suspension procedures, infection with preseptal cellulitis appeared in one case (1.7%) and required removal of the material, and in two cases (3.4%) there were foreign body granulomas that were resolved by excision. There were other reports of post-ptosis surgery complicated by long-standing postoperative infection which were mostly associated with mycobacterium or candida infection. However, to our knowledge, there was no reported case of long-standing post-ptosis surgery infection involving multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species. Acinetobacter rarely colonizes implant materials; it commonly causes nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin infections.

In a delayed and long-standing post-frontalis surgery infection, multidrug-resistant organisms may be responsible for delayed healing and poor response to treatment. Surgical removal of infected slings and a prolonged course of antibiotics may be required for complete resolution.

### Mycobacterium abscessus infections in children: a review of current literature [^111cEgGf]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited literature on Mycobacterium abscessus infections in children and limited data about its diagnosis and management. The incidence of infections due to M abscessus appears to be increasing in certain populations and can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Management of these infections is challenging and relies on combination antimicrobial therapy and debridement of diseased tissue, depending on the site and extent of disease. Treatment regimens often are difficult to tolerate, and the antimicrobials used can cause significant adverse effects, particularly given the long duration of therapy needed. This review summarizes the literature and includes information from our own institution's experience on pediatric M abscessus infections including the epidemiology, transmission, clinical manifestations, and the management of these infections. Adult data have been used where there are limited pediatric data. Further studies regarding epidemiology and risk factors, clinical presentation, optimal treatment, and outcomes in children are necessary.
