## Question

why ondansetron is contraindicated in a case with malignant bowel obstruction with vomiting

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why ondansetron should not be used in cases of malignant bowel obstruction with vomiting and what the evidence-based rationale is for avoiding it in this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of malignant bowel obstruction and how that alters management priorities. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about ondansetron's effects on ileus and gastric distension. Next, I will review guideline recommendations specific to malignant bowel obstruction and see whether they mention ondansetron at all. After that, I need to check whether any high-quality evidence supports ondansetron in MBO. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and outline safer, guideline-concordant alternatives for antiemesis in MBO.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology. Malignant bowel obstruction is typically due to mechanical or functional blockage with proximal accumulation of gas and secretions, leading to distension, colicky pain, nausea, and vomiting; critically, motility distal to the obstruction is reduced or absent, so prokinesis is either ineffective or dangerous depending on completeness of obstruction, and the immediate priority is decompression and symptom control rather than simple antiemesis that could mask deterioration [^116YgSsJ] [^111C963Y].

> Now, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about ondansetron's gastrointestinal effects. Multiple FDA sources warn that ondansetron may mask progressive ileus and/or gastric distension and explicitly note that ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction; patients with risk factors for GI obstruction warrant close monitoring for decreased bowel activity, which directly applies to MBO where ongoing distension and evolving ileus are central concerns [^113LB1Ny].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm whether authoritative guidelines endorse ondansetron in MBO. The MASCC 2022 multidisciplinary recommendations, which synthesized hundreds of studies, do not list ondansetron among preferred antiemetics for MBO; instead, they emphasize octreotide as foundational therapy, consider granisetron as a 5‑HT3 antagonist option with low-level evidence, and caution against prokinetics in complete obstruction, while recommending haloperidol, H1 antagonists, phenothiazines, and olanzapine as reasonable alternatives based on mechanism and limited data; notably, ondansetron is not highlighted as a recommended agent in MBO algorithms [^111vKaF2] [^112UKNUJ] [^111NhnA9].

> Wait, let me verify whether any direct evidence supports ondansetron in MBO. I need to check the MASCC evidence tables and related reviews. The only 5‑HT3 agent with any MBO-specific signal is granisetron in a small phase II study, whereas ondansetron lacks MBO-specific trials, and broader systematic reviews of antiemetics in advanced cancer show conflicting or low-quality evidence for serotonin antagonists compared with dopamine antagonists or standard regimens, reinforcing that ondansetron's role here is unsupported by direct evidence [^113DrNeQ] [^116PZ7fg].

> I will now examine the mechanistic and safety rationale more closely. Ondansetron blocks 5‑HT3 receptors centrally and peripherally, reducing emetic reflexes but not promoting transit; in MBO, that means vomiting may transiently abate while proximal distension and secretions continue to accumulate, risking perforation, ischemia, and clinical deterioration that is obscured by symptom suppression; the FDA's explicit warning about masking ileus/gastric distension and the instruction not to substitute ondansetron for nasogastric suction underscore this hazard in obstructed patients.

> But wait, what if the obstruction is only partial — could ondansetron still be acceptable there? Even in partial MBO, guidelines prioritize agents that either reduce secretions (octreotide), restore transit safely when appropriate (metoclopramide/domperidone with caution), or target central emetic pathways without masking obstruction dynamics; ondansetron still does not address motility or secretions and remains a masking risk, so it is not a preferred choice even in partial obstruction, though it may be used as a second-line adjunct if symptoms persist despite guideline-directed therapy and with close monitoring, recognizing the evidence gap [^111C963Y] [^111vKaF2].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. There is no direct efficacy evidence for ondansetron in MBO, there is a credible mechanism for harm via masking of progressive ileus/distension, and authoritative guidelines omit ondansetron from recommended MBO regimens. Therefore, the balance favors avoidance of ondansetron as a primary antiemetic in MBO, with attention instead to decompression, antisecretory therapy, and mechanism-based antiemetics supported by MASCC and ESMO guidance [^115Bg2Y2] [^111vKaF2] [^1155MqhB].

> Next, I should review safer, evidence-aligned alternatives. Octreotide is first-line to reduce secretions and vomiting in inoperable MBO. Haloperidol, H1 antagonists such as dimenhydrinate or cyclizine, phenothiazines like chlorpromazine, and olanzapine are reasonable antiemetics depending on mechanism and obstruction status. Corticosteroids can be adjuncts for inflammation/edema and symptom control. And prokinetics like metoclopramide are reserved for partial obstruction with caution due to perforation risk in complete obstruction, all aligned with MASCC and ESMO recommendations [^111NhnA9] [^111vKaF2] [^112UKNUJ] [^112WjD1F].

> Final answer: Ondansetron is contraindicated in malignant bowel obstruction with vomiting because it may mask progressive ileus and gastric distension without improving motility or decompression, lacks supportive evidence in MBO, and is not recommended by MASCC/ESMO guidelines. Preferred strategies focus on decompression, antisecretory therapy with octreotide, and mechanism-based antiemetics such as haloperidol, H1 antagonists, phenothiazines, or olanzapine, with close monitoring for deterioration that ondansetron could obscure [^112tQFSY] [^113r4Evy] [^115Bg2Y2] [^111vKaF2].

---

Ondansetron is not absolutely contraindicated in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) with vomiting, but it is **not recommended as first-line therapy** because it does not address the underlying pathophysiology and may mask progression of obstruction or ileus [^112tQFSY] [^113r4Evy]. It may be used cautiously as an adjunct when first-line agents (octreotide, haloperidol, metoclopramide in partial obstruction) are insufficient, with close monitoring for worsening obstruction or ileus [^112WjD1F] [^111C963Y]. Ondansetron is contraindicated with apomorphine due to risk of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness [^117BBjVs] [^1134Kv1L].

---

## Pathophysiology of malignant bowel obstruction

MBO is characterized by **mechanical blockage** of the bowel due to tumor infiltration, external compression, or adhesions, leading to accumulation of gas and secretions proximal to the obstruction [^116YgSsJ]. This accumulation causes **severe nausea and vomiting**, abdominal distension, and pain [^116m8dBA]. The vomiting is often bilious and persistent, reflecting the ongoing accumulation of secretions and gas proximal to the obstruction [^111FakFj].

---

## Mechanism of action of ondansetron

Ondansetron is a selective **5-HT3 receptor antagonist** that blocks serotonin receptors in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting [^111DVDNq]. It is commonly used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [^111YVqnG].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding ondansetron use in MBO

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend ondansetron as first-line therapy** for managing nausea and vomiting in MBO [^112WjD1F]. Instead, they emphasize the use of agents that address the underlying pathophysiology of MBO, such as somatostatin analogs (e.g. octreotide), dopamine antagonists (e.g. haloperidol), and prokinetic agents (e.g. metoclopramide) in partial obstructions [^111vKaF2].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of ondansetron in MBO

While ondansetron is effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, its use in MBO carries **specific risks and limitations**:

- **Masking of progressive ileus or gastric distension**: Ondansetron may mask symptoms of progressive ileus or gastric distension, potentially delaying recognition of worsening obstruction or ileus [^112tQFSY] [^113r4Evy].

- **Lack of prokinetic effect**: Ondansetron does not promote gastrointestinal motility, which is crucial in managing partial obstructions where restoring bowel transit is essential [^112tQFSY].

- **Constipation**: Ondansetron itself can cause constipation, which may exacerbate the underlying obstruction and delay bowel movements [^notfound].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Although rare, ondansetron has been associated with serotonin syndrome, particularly when combined with other serotonergic medications [^113LB1Ny].

---

## Alternative antiemetic strategies for MBO

Given the limitations of ondansetron, current guidelines **recommend the following alternative antiemetic strategies** for managing nausea and vomiting in MBO:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Somatostatin analogs | Octreotide, lanreotide | Reduce gastrointestinal secretions and motility, thereby decreasing vomiting | - First-line therapy <br/> - Effective in reducing vomiting and gastric secretions [^117GTLsA] [^112WjD1F] |
| Dopamine antagonists | Haloperidol, metoclopramide | Block dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, reducing nausea and vomiting | - Haloperidol recommended for complete obstructions <br/> - Metoclopramide for partial obstructions only [^114cE4pj] [^111C963Y] |
| Anticholinergic agents | Hyoscine butylbromide | Reduce gastrointestinal secretions and motility | Useful adjunctive therapy, particularly in complete obstructions [^1128ULCY] |
| Corticosteroids | Dexamethasone | Reduce inflammation and edema, potentially improving bowel transit | Adjunctive therapy, particularly in partial obstructions [^113i227A] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where ondansetron may be considered

Despite these limitations, ondansetron may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Ondansetron may be used as an adjunctive therapy when first-line agents (octreotide, haloperidol, metoclopramide) are insufficient in controlling nausea and vomiting [^1155MqhB].

- **Patient-specific factors**: In patients with contraindications to first-line agents or in cases where alternative therapies are unavailable, ondansetron may be considered with caution and close monitoring [^113LB1Ny].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ondansetron is **not absolutely contraindicated** in MBO with vomiting, but it is not recommended as first-line therapy because it does not address the underlying pathophysiology and may mask progression of obstruction or ileus. Clinicians should **prioritize agents that target the underlying mechanisms** of MBO, such as somatostatin analogs, dopamine antagonists, and prokinetic agents, reserving ondansetron for adjunctive use when necessary and with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^1155MqhB] [^113r4Evy].

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Myocardial Ischemia

Myocardial ischemia has been reported in patients treated with ondansetron. In some cases, predominantly during intravenous administration, the symptoms appeared immediately after administration but resolved with prompt treatment. Coronary artery spasm appears to be the most common underlying cause. Therefore, monitor or advise patients for signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia after oral administration of ondansetron [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.5 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.

Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

### Systematic review of the efficacy of antiemetics in the treatment of nausea in patients with far-advanced cancer [^116PZ7fg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To systematically review studies of antiemetics used in the treatment of nausea in patients with far-advanced cancer.

Data Sources

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and uncontrolled studies identified by electronic and hand searching.

Review Methods

Identified studies were appraised for quality and effect size.

Results

Of 21 studies included, 2 were systematic reviews, 7 were RCT and 12 were uncontrolled studies or case series. Differences in interventions and outcomes amongst the RCT precluded any quantitative data synthesis and all seven studies were prone to bias. Whereas uncontrolled studies indicated a high response rate to standard regimens (75–93% for both nausea and vomiting), RCT showed much lower response rates to these agents (23–36% for nausea, 18–52% for vomiting). The two methods of antiemetic choice (choice based either on the inferred mechanism or empirical) were equally effective. There is reasonably strong evidence for the use of metoclopramide in cancer-associated dyspepsia and steroids in malignant bowel obstruction. There was conflicting evidence about the efficacy of serotonin antagonists compared with standard treatments (e.g. metoclopramide, dopamine antagonists and dexamethasone). There was little or no evidence of the efficacy of some commonly used and seemingly effective drugs such as haloperidol, cyclizine, and methotrimeprazine.

Conclusion

Evidence supporting the existing consensus-based guidelines for management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer is sparse. Current approaches to treatment based on the neuropharmacology of the emetic pathway may be inappropriate in this setting. Well-designed studies of the impact of "standard" management and novel agents on nausea and vomiting in palliative populations are needed.

### Evidence-based recommendations for cancer nausea and vomiting [^117QMDPn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The experience of patients living with cancer and being treated with chemotherapy often includes the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. To provide a framework for high-quality management of these symptoms, we developed a set of key targeted evidence-based standards through an iterative process of targeted systematic review, development, and refinement of topic areas and standards and consensus ratings by a multidisciplinary expert panel as part of the RAND Cancer Quality-Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment Project. For nausea and vomiting, key clinical standards included screening at the initial outpatient and inpatient visit, prophylaxis for acute and delayed emesis in patients receiving moderate to highly emetic chemotherapy, and follow-up after treatment for nausea and vomiting symptoms. In addition, patients with cancer and small bowel obstruction were examined as a special subset of patients who present with nausea and vomiting. The standards presented here for preventing and managing nausea and vomiting in cancer care should be incorporated into care pathways and should become the expectation rather than the exception.

### Pharmacologic management of malignant bowel obstruction: when surgery is not an option [^116qDTVV]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) complicates 3%-15% of cancers and often necessitates inpatient admission. Hospitalists are increasingly involved in treating patients with MBO and coordinating their care across multiple subspecialties. Direct resolution of the obstruction via surgical or interventional means is always preferable. When such options are not possible, pharmacological treatments are the mainstay of therapy. Medications such as somatostatin analogs, steroids, H2-blockers, and other modalities can be effective in palliation and possible resolution of obstruction. Awareness of these pharmacologic therapies can aid hospitalists in treating patients who are confronted with this devastating condition.

Regarding medical management for malignant bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to anticholinergics, ESMO/MASCC 2016 guidelines recommend to administer anticholinergic antisecretory agents (such as scopolamine butylbromide, glycopyrronium bromide) and/or corticosteroids as an adjunct or an alternative option if octreotide plus an antiemetic is suboptimal.

Corticosteroids in malignant bowel obstruction — MASCC suggestion, dosing, and outcomes: Suggestion: The use of steroids may be helpful in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade: B). Corticosteroids likely have anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory effects that may decrease intestinal wall edema, promote salt and water absorption, and help with acute management of pain, nausea, and vomiting. For dosing, a dose between 4 and 16 mg of dexamethasone daily may be considered, and in cases of no symptomatic improvement in 3 to 5 days, discontinuation should be considered. Observational data from a Japanese claims cohort of 3,090 adults with MBO treated with octreotide reported that among the 1595 with nasogastric tubes, adding corticosteroids was associated with higher odds of tube removal within four days (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08–1.23). A Cochrane meta-analysis of three double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 89 patients found a trend favoring corticosteroids for resolution of BO within 10 days (relative risk of 0.51 (95% CI 0.19–1.43)), with the number needed to treat six, no effect on mortality at one month, and a very low incidence of adverse events, while the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period should be considered. In a multi-center randomized trial of octreotide for vomiting in MBO, dexamethasone (8 mg daily, intravenously) with ranitidine and hydration was the standardized supportive therapy.

### Nausea and vomiting: a palliative care imperative [^111hH98G]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was undertaken to survey recent literature for research reports and comprehensive clinical reviews addressing the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting (N&V) in advanced cancer. The goal was to integrate findings in a comprehensive article that incorporates palliative care concepts into antiemetic treatment.

Recent Findings

There are few published studies of N&V in advanced cancer; such research may be limited by the multicausal nature of N&V and participant burden to patients with life-limiting disease. Most articles are written by oncologists who also specialize in palliative care, and those addressing adverse effects of drugs used as antiemetics are found in other literature. Articles addressing more novel therapies, like cannabinoids and medical marijuana, are uncommon in the oncology literature. N&V in patients with progressive or advanced cancer is often multicausal. Nausea is more common and persistent, and even mild nausea is bothersome and may cause anxiety or depression. The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting overlap, but different neural pathways constitute the final pathway for each-the brainstem for vomiting and higher brain regions for nausea. Common causes of N&V in advanced cancer include constipation, opioids, and malignant bowel obstruction. About 40% have undetermined causes and may be exacerbated by impaired gastric emptying, chemical imbalances, or other factors. Several drugs that have antiemetic effects and act at different receptors are used to palliate N&V. There is a paucity of research that supports palliative antiemetic choices, and other research is needed to define potential therapeutic strategies that capitalize on differences between nausea and vomiting.

### Medical management of malignant bowel obstruction in patients with advanced cancer: 2021 MASCC guideline update [^111dAeQf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a frequent complication in patients with advanced cancer, particularly colon or gynecological malignancies. MASCC previously published a guideline for symptom management of MBO in 2017. This is a 5-year update.

Method

A systematic search and review of relevant literature includes a review published in 2010 and 2017. The guideline update used the same literature search process as followed in 2015. The dates of the new search included 2015 up to February 2, 2021. The guidelines involved the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) only. Only randomized trials were included in the updated guideline as evidence. The evidence was reviewed by the panel and the MASCC criteria for establishing a guideline were followed using MASCC level of grading and category of evidence.

Results

There was one systematic review and 3 randomized trials accepted as evidence from 257 abstracts. Octreotide is effective in reducing gastrointestinal secretions and colic and thereby reduces nausea and vomiting caused by MBO. Scopolamine butylbromide is inferior to octreotide in the doses used in the comparison study. Olanzapine or metoclopramide may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting secondary to partial bowel obstructions. The panel suggests using either drug. Additional studies are needed to clarify benefits. Haloperidol has been used by convention as an antiemetic but has not been subjected to a randomized comparison. Ranitidine plus dexamethasone may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting from MBO but cannot be recommended until there is a comparison with octreotide.

Discussion

Octreotide remains the drug of choice in managing MBO. Ranitidine was used in one randomized trial in all participants and so its effectiveness as a single drug is not known until there is a randomized comparison with octreotide. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide and olanzapine may be effective, but we have very few randomized trials of antiemetics in MBO.

Conclusion

The panel recommends octreotide in non-operable MBO. Randomized trials are needed to clarify ranitidine and antiemetic choices.

### Current concepts in malignant bowel obstruction management [^111Rtio9]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a challenging complication of advanced cancer. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the syndrome, including mechanical compression, motility disorders, gastrointestinal secretion accumulation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and inflammation. The treatment of related symptoms requires a collaborative approach of surgical, interventional, and medical specialists. The surgical approach proves beneficial in selected patients with operable lesions, life expectancy greater than 2 months, and good performance status. Interventionalists place self-expanding metallic stents as a minimally invasive palliative method either as a definitive treatment or as a bridge to surgery. However, most patients with MBO are not candidates for surgery or stent placement. Medical management with opioids, antispasmodics, antiemetics, antisecretory agents, and corticosteroids is effective in controlling the symptoms associated with MBO. This article discusses the current understanding of MBO pathophysiology and emphasizes current MBO management concepts; it then reviews surgical, interventional, and medical approaches.

Somatostatin analogs for malignant bowel obstruction — Recommendation: Somatostatin analog (octreotide, lanreotide) may reduce vomiting in MBO (levels of evidence: I; grade A). Octreotide may be administered by subcutaneous bolus or continuous subcutaneous infusion. Its duration of activity is approximately 6 to 12 h, with an average half-life elimination of 1.8 h, and a long-acting depot formulation is available to be administered intramuscularly once a month; lanreotide is available as a long-acting depot formulation. A 2016 systematic review of randomized control trials and quasi-randomized control trials, published between 1979 and 2016, identified seven studies, whereas two studies with low Cochrane risk of bias found no significant difference in vomiting between somatostatin analog and placebo in their primary endpoints, and a secondary analysis found no difference in quality-of-life scores.

Background

Etiology

MBO most frequently occurs when patients have advanced cancers that originate in the abdomen or pelvis. Though the incidence of MBO is not well established, based on retrospective and autopsy-based studies, MBO is estimated to occur in 10–28% of patients with gastrointestinal cancers and up to 51% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Limitations of these estimates include patient population selection and nonhomogeneous criteria to diagnose MBO.

The mechanisms of MBO development are multi-factorial and can be divided into two main groups: mechanical and functional obstruction. Causes of mechanical obstruction include extrinsic obstruction of the lumen by pathology, such as mesenteric and omental masses, adhesions, and fibrosis; intra-luminal obstruction from tumor growth in the bowel; and intra-mural obstruction by tumor within the bowel wall, which impairs motility. Whereas functional obstruction is a result of motility disorders, which can be due to tumor infiltration of mesentery, nerves and/or celiac and enteric plexus, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Further, nonmalignant factors may induce or worsen bowel obstruction (BO) in patients with advanced cancer, including constipation/fecal impaction, pharmacological (i.e. opioids, intra-peritoneal chemotherapy), fibrosis, and adhesions from prior surgery and radiotherapy.

Pathophysiology and symptoms

MBO can occur in the small or large bowel, with small BO being more common. The obstruction can be partial or complete and can occur at single or multiple transition points. MBO causes reduction or absence of movements of the intestinal content and bowel distension. The accumulation of content in the intestinal lumen increases the epithelial surface area and prompts an accumulation of gastric, pancreatic, biliary secretions, water, and salt, which damages the intestinal epithelium and triggers an inflammatory response with intestinal edema, hyperemia, and production of inflammatory mediators (i.e. prostaglandins, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and nociceptive mediators). Bacterial overgrowth and translocation are important mechanisms in the development of symptoms. The cumulative impact of these events results in abdominal pain, cramps, distention, nausea, vomiting, absence of gas and stool passage, and, occasionally, overflow diarrhea. MBO symptoms usually start gradually and become more frequent and severe when a complete obstruction occurs. Re-obstruction and malnutrition are common, with malnutrition being an independent predictor of poor survival in this population.

Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant) — AGA recommendation for gastroparesis: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests against the use of aprepitant as a first-line treatment (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). As part of shared decision making, patients who place a higher value on the potential improvement in nausea and vomiting and lower value on the potential adverse effects may reasonably elect to use aprepitant. Implementation considerations state that aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, is an antiemetic approved for chemotherapy-induced vomiting, but has no effect on gastric motor function, and that aprepitant may be helpful in patients with gastroparesis and nausea/vomiting in whom 5HT 3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, and other antiemetics are not helpful. Evidence informing this recommendation was derived from 1 clinical trial comparing aprepitant with placebo.

Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting should be managed with medications that target dopaminergic pathways (i.e. haloperidol, risperidone, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence).
Octreotide should be utilized in the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to bowel obstruction caused by cancer (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence).
We suggest adding a second agent (i.e. ondansetron) to control nausea and vomiting when the first-line medications are unable to control the symptoms (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence).

Aforementioned drugs are routinely used as therapies for nausea because of their inhibition of receptors in the brain's chemoreceptor trigger zone. Studies have not shown newer 5-HT 3 medications to be superior to older dopaminergic agents in treating nausea at the end of life.

All medications that may be added as second agent in treating refractory nausea are listed in Table 2 together with the setting of use and doses and route of administration.

Suggestions/recommendations

The following sections present each MBO management recommendation and its associated evidence (Table 3). In complete MBO, medication should be administered intravenously or subcutaneously if available.

Table 3
Summary of suggestions and recommendations for MBO management, with associated level and grade of evidence

Anti-emetics

The 2021 MASCC guideline about select pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in MBO was released in August 2021 as an update to a previous guideline published in 2017. The following sections and Appendix B provide suggestions/recommendations for all anti-emetic drug classes reportedly used for MBO management and their associated existing evidence:

Anticholinergics

Suggestion: The benefit of anticholinergics (hyoscine butylbromide) may be inferior to octreotide to reduce vomiting in MBO. (Level of evidence: III; Grade: D).

Hyoscine (scopolamine) butylbromide is an anticholinergic agent that reduces gastrointestinal secretions. A 2016 systematic review identified four randomized clinical trials with high Cochrane risk of bias that found somatostatin analog (e.g. octreotide) were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide in reducing nausea and vomiting. Three case reports reported mixed findings, where two reported hyoscine butylbromide in combination with other drugs (e.g. octreotide, dexamethasone) was effective in reducing vomiting, and one that reported that it was ineffective for controlling vomiting. Since the publication of that review, no new randomized clinical trials have been published. An alternative anticholinergic that can reportedly be used is glycopyrrolate. However, this review only identified one case report that reported that glycopyrrolate reduced nausea and vomiting in MBO. Appendix B presents the characteristics of all included studies about anticholinergic use in MBO.

Butyrophenone antipsychotic

Suggestion: Haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, may be an effective anti-emetic in MBO, particularly for complete MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: B),

Butyrophenone antipsychotics are commonly used as anti-psychotics for delirium management but are also used for the management of nausea and vomiting in MBO. The main butyrophenone used is haloperidol. The review identified two cross-sectional studies and two case reports/series that reported on haloperidol's use in MBO. All studies suggested that haloperidol effectively relieve nausea and vomiting in MBO and is the preferred anti-emetic in complete BO.

### Medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction [^1173YuHE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction.

Data Sources

A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases searching malignant bowel obstruction, etiology, types, pathophysiology, medical, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic drugs, analgesics, promotion of emptying, prevention of infection, anticholinergics, somatostatin analogs, gastric antisecretory drugs, prokinetic agents, glucocorticoid, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, enema, and adverse effects.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized or observational studies, cohorts, case reports, or reviews written in English between 1983 and November 2020 were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) commonly occurs in patients with advanced or recurrent malignancies and severely affects the quality of life and survival of patients. Its management remains complex and variable. Medical management is the cornerstone of MBO treatment, with the goal of reducing distressing symptoms and optimizing quality of life. Until now, there has been neither a standard clinical approach nor registered medications to treat patients with inoperable MBO.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review provides information on the etiology, type and pathophysiology, and medical treatment of MBO and related adverse reactions of the drugs commonly used, which can greatly assist clinicians in making clinical decisions when treating MBO.

Conclusions

Published research shows that medical management of MBO mainly consists of antisecretory, anti-inflammatory strategies, controlling vomiting and pain, promoting emptying, preventing infection, and combination therapy. Being knowledgeable about the most current treatment options, the related adverse effects, and the evidence supporting different practices is critical for clinicians to provide individualized medical therapy for MBO patients.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113r4Evy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1), OVERDOSAGE (10)].

5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction. Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

Serotonin (5-HT 3) antagonists

Suggestion: Granisetron, serotonin (5HT 3) antagonist may reduce nausea and the frequency of vomiting in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade D).

Serotonin (5-HT 3) antagonists act on receptors located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea and vomiting. The review identified only one study published in 2009 that examined the use of a 5-HT 3 antagonist, granisetron, for MBO management. This study was a phase II clinical trial that found granisetron, in addition to dexamethasone and as-needed haloperidol, significantly reduced the severity of nausea (p < 0.001) and a number of episodes of vomiting (p < 0.001) before and after treatment. However, the reported incidence of constipation associated with granisetron ranges from 3 to 18%. Further studies are required to assess its use in MBO.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of octreotide in malignant bowel obstruction [^113pVquw]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Does octreotide reduce vomiting in cancer-associated bowel obstruction?

Objectives

To evaluate the net effect of adding octreotide or placebo to standardized therapies on the number of days free of vomiting for populations presenting with vomiting and inoperable bowel obstruction secondary to cancer or its treatment.

Methods

Twelve services enrolled people with advanced cancer presenting with vomiting secondary to bowel obstruction where surgery or anti-cancer therapies were not indicated immediately. In a double-blind study, participants were randomized to placebo or octreotide (600 μg/24 hours by infusion). Both arms received standardized supportive therapy (infusion of ranitidine [200 mg/24 hours], dexamethasone [8 mg/24 hours], and parenteral hydration [10–20 mL/kg/24 hours]). The primary outcome was patient-reported days free of vomiting at 72 hours.

Results

In a study that recruited to the numbers identified in its power calculation, 87 participants provided data at 72 hours (45, octreotide arm). Seventeen people (octreotide) and 14 (placebo) were free of vomiting for 72 hours (P = 0.67). Mean days free of vomiting were 1.87 (SD 1.10; octreotide) and 1.69 (SD 1.15; placebo; P = 0.47). An adjusted multivariate regression of the incidence of vomiting over the study showed a reduced number of episodes of vomiting in the octreotide group (incidence rate ratio = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.19–0.86; P = 0.019); however, people in the octreotide arm were 2.02 times more likely to be administered hyoscine butylbromide (P = 0.004), potentially reflecting increased colicky pain.

Conclusion

Although there was no reduction in the number of days free of vomiting, the multivariate analysis suggests that further study of somatostatin analogues in this setting is warranted.

### Inoperable malignant bowel obstruction: palliative interventions outcomes-mixed-methods systematic review [^112vbekB]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a serious complication of cancer, affecting an estimated 3%–15% of patients with cancer globally, and most common with primary cancers of gynaecological and gastrointestinal origin (50% and 28%, respectively). People with MBO describe distressing abdominal pain and distension, nausea and vomiting, inability to eat and drink with a consequential reduction in quality of life (QoL), nutritional and performance status.

Surgery provides the best option for longer-term survival. However, surgery is often contraindicated due to ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple sites of obstruction, and poor functional and nutritional status. Those with inoperable MBO (IMBO) are managed medicallywith analgesics, corticosteroids, antiemetics and antisecretory agents. Those with IMBO may also be managed with parenteral nutrition (PN), gut decompression (eg, palliative venting gastrostomy (PVG), nasogastric tube drainage) or stenting. Clinical decision making is challenging, with only low-level evidence to guide clinicians in day-to-day decision making with no nationally agreed recommendations leading to wide variation between clinical centres. Management choices are typically based on clinicians' individual clinical experience or patients' goals (if explored).

The use of PN in advanced cancer is receiving growing attention with the publication of systematic reviews; two focused on MBO solely, two focused on advanced cancer, however, most included papers had a large proportion of participants with MBO. These reviews focused mostly on survival and rarely evaluated other important outcomes such as QoL and health resource utilisation.

There is only one systematic review exploring the use of PVG for MBO with regard to safety and efficacy for symptom reliefbut again, this did not address impact on QoL or health service utilisation.

We aim to synthesise systematically the current evidence on the use of PVG and PN in MBO, investigating how they affect: survival, health-related QoL, symptoms, health service utilisation, physical function and nutritional status. We included PVG for gut decompression or treatment with PN as destination treatment, with a comparator (if available) of no decompressive support or no PN support.

### An assessment of aetiology-based guidelines for the management of nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer [^113wATgs]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Study Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of aetiology-based guidelines for the management of nausea and vomiting (N&V) in patients with advanced cancer.

Patients and Methods

This was a prospective study of 121 patients admitted to a hospice. Patients with N&V underwent assessments at presentation, 48 h and 1 week, to determine the aetiology of N&V and the response to treatment. Antiemetics were prescribed according to aetiology-based guidelines.

Results

Sixty-one patients (50%) had N&V during their admission: 21 (17%) had isolated nausea, 2 (2%) had isolated vomiting and 38 (31%) had combined N&V. During the assessment period, physicians altered their opinion about the primary cause of N&V in 26% of cases and finally expressed confidence about the aetiology in 75% of patients. The most common cause of N&V was impaired gastric emptying (contributing in 44% of patients), followed by chemical causes (33%) and bowel obstruction (19%). At 1 week, nausea was controlled in 56% of patients, and vomiting in 89% of patients, and residual symptoms were generally mild.

Conclusions

An approach using aetiology-based guidelines in the management of N&V is moderately effective, although there are some patients with N&V refractory to standard antiemetic regimens.

### Aggressive pharmacological treatment for reversing malignant bowel obstruction [^1119A1DT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Early and intensive pharmacological treatment not only may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms but also reverse malignant bowel obstruction. Fifteen consecutive advanced cancer patients with inoperable bowel obstruction received a combination of drugs including metoclopramide, octreotide, dexamethasone and an initial bolus of amidotrizoato. Recovery of intestinal transit was reported within 1–5 days in fourteen patients, who continued this treatment without presenting symptoms of bowel obstruction until death. This case series establishes that the combination of propulsive and antisecretive agents can act synergistically to allow a fast recovery of bowel transit without inducing unpleasant colic. It suggests that the most important mechanism in these circumstances is functional and can be reversible, if an aggressive treatment is initiated early before fecal impaction and edema render bowel obstruction irreversible.

### Can malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer patients be treated at home? [^117CPY5E]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Eleven advanced cancer patients affected by malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) were treated at home with a combination of octreotide, metoclopramide, morphine, and dexamethasone. In all patients, we observed a prompt control of gastrointestinal symptoms and recovery of bowel movements within 1–5 days. Based on our results, a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action allows an effective and safe treatment for MBO at home. Further studies with larger number of patients are warranted to confirm these preliminary data.

Malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging clinical problem encountered in patients with advanced abdominal and pelvic malignancies. Although medical therapies form the foundation of management, some patients may be suitable candidates for surgical and procedural interventions. The literature is composed primarily of retrospective single-institution experiences and the results of prospective trials are pending. Given the high symptom burden and limited life expectancy of these patients, management may be best informed by multidisciplinary teams with relevant expertise.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^1116acuL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Although IONV has not been thoroughly examined, nausea and vomiting during the postoperative phase of regional anesthesia have been extensively researched, and up to 80% of cesarean section cases develop PONV.

When the uterus is forced back into the abdominal region, vomiting is one of the most frequent side effects of spinal anesthesia, occurring in 66% of instances. This is treated with a range of drugs; the most popular medication is metoclopramide.

Preoperative and intraoperative use of drugs, including 5-HT3 antagonists (e.g. ondansetron), dopamine antagonists (e.g. metoclopramide, droperidol), and sedatives (midazolam & propofol), can reduce nausea and vomiting during and after surgery under regional anesthesia. Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone), antihistamines (e.g. cyclizine), and anticholinergics (e.g. scopolamine), careful hypotension monitoring, obtaining a good anesthetic block, gentle surgical technique, and prudent use of uterotonic drugs were also effective interventions for nausea and vomiting. In addition, acupressure was useful in lowering nausea but not vomiting. But all these medications could have their own side effects and contraindications. So, it is better to weight the risk benefit comparisons of each interventions. For instance Metoclopramide, can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as tardive dyskinesia, restlessness, and muscle spasms, particularly with prolonged use or high doses. Other side effects include drowsiness, fatigue, and diarrhea. It's contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, mechanical bowel obstruction, and a history of EPS. In addition, Ondansetron can cause headache, constipation, and rarely, cardiac arrhythmias like QT prolongation. Its use should be cautious in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or those taking other QT-prolonging medications.

### A systematic review of the treatment of nausea and / or vomiting in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy or radiation [^117TdjXU]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Context

A systematic review of antiemetics for emesis in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation is an important step in establishing treatment recommendations and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic review based on the question "What is the evidence that supports antiemetic choices in advanced cancer?" guided this review.

Objectives

To determine the level of evidence for antiemtrics in the management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation, and to discover gaps in the evidence, which would provide important areas for future research.

Methods

Three databases and independent searches using different MeSH terms were performed. Related links were searched and hand searches of related articles were made. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective single-drug studies, studies that used guidelines based on the etiology of emesis, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and case series or single-patient reports. Studies that involved treatment of chemotherapy, radiation, or postoperation-related emesis were excluded. Studies that involved the treatment of emesis related to bowel obstruction were included. The strength of evidence was graded as follows: 1) RCTs, A; 2) single-drug prospective studies, B1; 3) studies based on multiple drug choices for etiology of emesis, B2; and 4) cohort, case series, retrospective, and single-patient reports, E. Level of evidence was determined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 2001) (A, B, C, D).

Results

Ninety-three articles were found. Fourteen were RCTs, most of them of low quality, based either on lack of blinding, lack of description of the method of randomization, concealment, and/or attrition. Metoclopramide had modest evidence (B) based on RCTs and prospective cohort studies. Octreotide, dexamethasone, and hyoscine butylbromide are effective in reducing symptoms of bowel obstruction, based on prospective studies and/or one RCT. There was no evidence that either multiple antiemetics or antiemetic choices based on the etiology of emesis were any better than a single antiemetic. There is poor evidence for dose response, intraclass or interclass drug switch, or antiemetic combinations in those individuals failing to respond to the initial antiemetic.

Conclusion

There are discrepancies between antiemetic studies and published antiemetic guidelines, which are largely based on expert opinion. Antiemetic recommendations have moderate to weak evidence at best. Prospective randomized trials of single antiemetics are needed to properly establish evidence-based guidelines.

Analgesics for malignant bowel obstruction — Pain is experienced by 70 to 90% of patients with MBO. The WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacologic and Radiotherapeutic Management of Cancer Pain in Adults and Adolescents recommend that analgesics should be given by mouth whenever possible. However, patients with MBO often have significant nausea and vomiting and malfunctioning gastrointestinal tracts that prevent ingestion and absorption of oral analgesics; consequently, the parenteral (subcutaneous or intravenous) and/or transdermal routes of administration should be considered for this population to deliver effective analgesia, and a comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous routes found no differences, confirming both routes as feasible, effective, and safe.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) for patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) MBO study group conducted a systematic review of databases (inception to March 2021) to identify studies about patients with advanced cancer and MBO that reported on the following outcomes: symptom management, bowel obstruction resolution, prognosis, overall survival, and quality of life. The review was restricted to studies published in English, but no restrictions were placed on publication year, country, and study type. As per the MASCC Guidelines Policy, the findings were synthesized to determine the levels of evidence to support each MBO intervention and, ultimately, the graded recommendations and suggestions.

Results

The systematic review identified 17,656 published studies and 397 selected for the guidelines. The MASCC study group developed a total of 25 evidence-based suggestions and recommendations about the management of MBO-related nausea and vomiting, bowel movements, pain, inflammation, bowel decompression, and nutrition. Expert consensus-based guidance about advanced care planning and psychosocial support is also provided.

Conclusion

This MASCC Guideline provides comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations about MBO management for patients with advanced cancer.

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea, defined as the unpleasant subjective feeling of wanting to vomit or retch, and/or vomiting, are experienced by as many as 68% of patients with cancer at some point during their illness; during the last 6 weeks of life, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting is 40% or more. Poorly controlled nausea and vomiting is associated with physical, cognitive, and psychosocial distress, and can contribute to patient and family fears of death from dehydration and/or starvation.

Nausea and vomiting secondary to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy should be anticipated and managed according to ASCO antiemetic, or equivalent, clinical practice guidelines. The latest ASCO antiemetic update includes evidence-based recommendations and information on the appropriate use of olanzapine, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and use of subcutaneous 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists.

Much less trial evidence is available for the use of antiemetics in patients with advanced cancer and nausea and vomiting unrelated to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Instead, an etiologic or mechanism-based approach to choosing an antiemetic is commonly recommended. This approach requires clinicians to take a detailed history and perform a focused examination to determine the most likely underlying cause(s) of the patient's nausea and vomiting. In the advanced cancer population, the most common underlying causes of nausea and vomiting are chemical abnormalities (eg, renal or liver failure, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia); drugs (eg, opioids, antidepressants, antibiotics); infection; and impaired gastric emptying, as well as visceral and serosal causes of delayed gastrointestinal transit (bowel obstruction, gastric bleed, enteritis, constipation). - Once the most likely underlying cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting is determined, an appropriate antiemetic can then be selected based on the pathophysiology and receptors implicated (Table 1).

### What is the evidence for dietary modification in the management and prevention of malignant bowel obstruction? A scoping review [^111FakFj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common complication in advanced malignancy, particularly in gynaecological and gastrointestinal tumours that spread within the abdominal cavity. MBO affects up to 51% of patients with recurrent gynaecological cancers, and malignant obstructions of the small bowel are more prevalent than large bowel obstructions.

MBO typically presents as colicky abdominal pain, distention, nausea and bilious vomiting, and an inability to pass wind or stool. This occurs due to either a functional or mechanical obstruction, the aetiology and pathophysiology of which are well described elsewhere. MBO is often recurrent with symptoms increasing in severity and frequency over time, until, without surgical intervention, obstruction becomes a permanent state. This results in frequent, protracted hospital admissions, with significant burden both for patients and healthcare services. In addition to diminishing well-being and quality of life (QoL), patients with MBO have reported lack of attention to nutritional problems, fear of starvation and unmet supportive care needs.
