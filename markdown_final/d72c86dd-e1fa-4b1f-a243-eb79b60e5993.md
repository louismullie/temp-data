## Question

A previously healthy 67-year-old man comes to the physician because of a history of recurrent right lower abdominal pain for the past 2 years. A CT scan shows a 1.2-cm (0.47-in) mass located in the terminal ileum. He undergoes surgical removal of the mass. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Cells from this tissue are most likely to stain positive for which of the following?
A. Desmin
B. Chromogranin A
C. Vimentin
D. Cytokeratin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which immunohistochemical marker is most likely to stain positive in a 1.2 cm terminal ileal mass surgically removed from a 67-year-old man with recurrent right lower abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic location and what the most common terminal ileal neoplasms are in this age group. Then, I should verify which entities in the differential express desmin, chromogranin A, vimentin, or cytokeratin. Next, I will check guideline-backed diagnostic immunopanels to see which marker is most consistently positive across the likely diagnoses. Finally, I will consider rare mimics to ensure I am not missing a less common but marker-consistent alternative and confirm the best single choice among the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and location, because terminal ileal lesions in older adults most commonly include neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid), adenocarcinoma, and, less often, mesenchymal tumors such as GIST or lymphoma, so I need to keep that in mind as I interpret immunostains. I should also remember that standard operative management of distal ileal tumors often involves terminal ileal resection with right hemicolectomy, underscoring that the location and resection context fit with these pathologies rather than a vascular or soft-tissue tumor outside the bowel wall [^114jKncN].

> Now, I will examine the neuroendocrine possibility because small bowel NETs are relatively common in the terminal ileum and characteristically express chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Wait, let me verify that this applies to midgut NETs of the ileum. Yes, NCCN and ESMO both emphasize that diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasms requires chromogranin A and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry, and midgut ileal NETs typically show strong chromogranin A positivity with granular cytoplasmic staining, making chromogranin A a leading candidate here [^1141pcWB] [^117U7dy7] [^114DZYCR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also consider small bowel adenocarcinoma, which is another common terminal ileal malignancy in older adults and is defined by epithelial differentiation. I need to check that adenocarcinomas stain with cytokeratin; indeed, broad-spectrum cytokeratin markers such as AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 are used to confirm epithelial lineage, and small bowel adenocarcinomas are cytokeratin positive, so cytokeratin would also be a strong contender if the lesion is an adenocarcinoma rather than a NET [^1158KxTg] [^113xsMtw].

> Next, I should review mesenchymal options. Desmin is a muscle marker that stains smooth muscle and myoid tumors; leiomyomas and some PEComas are desmin positive, but these are uncommon in the terminal ileum compared with NETs and adenocarcinomas, so desmin is less likely to be the best answer here. Let me double-check: leiomyomatous polyps and PEComas do show desmin positivity, but their rarity in this location and the absence of a classic myoid morphology hint in the question make desmin a lower-yield choice for a 1.2 cm ileal mass in this age group [^112UGKnE] [^111h4hrs].

> I will now examine vimentin. Vimentin is a broad intermediate filament expressed by mesenchymal cells and is often positive in sarcomas and some carcinomas, but it lacks specificity for a single lineage and is not used as a primary diagnostic marker to distinguish among the leading ileal neoplasms. Wait, I should verify whether vimentin helps narrow the differential here; it does not, and relying on vimentin alone would be misleading in this context, so vimentin is unlikely to be the best answer among the provided options [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the differential and the marker performance. Chromogranin A is the most specific and sensitive marker for neuroendocrine differentiation and is required in the diagnostic workup of suspected NETs, which are common in the terminal ileum; cytokeratin is the universal marker of epithelial differentiation and would be expected in adenocarcinoma; desmin is restricted to myoid differentiation and is less likely to be the key marker here; vimentin is nonspecific and not decisive. Given the epidemiology and the need to choose the single best marker among the options, chromogranin A edges out cytokeratin because NETs are a leading diagnosis for a small terminal ileal mass in this age group and chromogranin A is the anchor marker for NET confirmation, even though cytokeratin would also be positive if the lesion were an adenocarcinoma [^1141pcWB] [^117U7dy7] [^113xsMtw].

> But wait, what if the photomicrograph showed a sarcomatoid carcinoma or a GIST-like lesion; could that change the answer? Sarcomatoid carcinomas can show cytokeratin positivity in the epithelial component and occasionally aberrant neuroendocrine marker expression, and GISTs are identified by KIT/DOG1 rather than desmin, so desmin would not help with GIST. I should confirm that in such rare scenarios, chromogranin A could still be positive if there is neuroendocrine differentiation, but the most reliable initial discriminator for epithelial origin remains cytokeratin, whereas chromogranin A remains the NET marker. However, without the image, and given the pretest probability in the terminal ileum, chromogranin A remains the most likely correct choice among the listed options [^111W93Ai] [^1145QPfu] [^1158KxTg].

> Final answer: B. Chromogranin A. I should double-check that this aligns with guidelines. Yes, NCCN and ESMO specify chromogranin A as a required neuroendocrine marker in the diagnostic panel for suspected NETs, and midgut ileal NETs are prototypically chromogranin A positive, making this the most likely positive stain for the described terminal ileal mass in a 67-year-old patient [^1141pcWB] [^117U7dy7] [^114DZYCR].

---

The most likely diagnosis for a 1.2-cm terminal ileum mass in a 67-year-old is a **well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET)** [^notfound], given the location and size. NETs show **chromogranin A positivity** on immunohistochemistry [^113V97be], so the correct answer is **B. Chromogranin A**. Desmin (A) stains muscle tumors, vimentin (C) stains mesenchymal tumors, and cytokeratin (D) stains epithelial tumors; while NETs can show focal cytokeratin, chromogranin A is the most sensitive and specific marker here [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis of terminal ileum masses

The differential diagnosis for a 1.2-cm terminal ileum mass includes:

- **Neuroendocrine tumor (NET)**: Common in the terminal ileum; typically well-differentiated and indolent [^116wiHYJ].
- **Adenocarcinoma**: Less common but possible in the terminal ileum [^1131Y3WN].
- **Lymphoma**: Can occur in the terminal ileum, especially in older adults [^115v4GkL].
- **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)**: Rare in the terminal ileum but possible [^notfound].
- **Metastatic lesions**: Rare but possible [^114d2BR5].

Given the patient's age, location, and size, a **well-differentiated NET** is the most likely diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Immunohistochemical markers for neuroendocrine tumors

NETs are **diagnosed and characterized** by immunohistochemistry [^117U7dy7]. The most sensitive and specific markers include:

| **Marker** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Chromogranin A | Major soluble protein in neurosecretory vesicles | Highly sensitive and specific for NETs [^notfound] |
| Synaptophysin | Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein | Highly sensitive for neuroendocrine differentiation [^1143oTJn] |
| CD56 (NCAM) | Neural cell adhesion molecule | Sensitive but less specific for NETs [^notfound] |
| Ki-67 | Proliferation marker | Used for grading NETs (G1, G2, G3) [^1128zz1t] |

---

Chromogranin A is the **most sensitive and specific marker** for NETs, including ileal NETs [^notfound].

---

## Immunohistochemical markers for other differential diagnoses

- **Desmin**: Muscle marker; positive in leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas [^notfound].
- **Vimentin**: Mesenchymal marker; positive in sarcomas and some carcinomas [^notfound].
- **Cytokeratin**: Epithelial marker; positive in adenocarcinomas and other epithelial tumors [^113xsMtw].

---

## Clinical correlation and management implications

NETs are often indolent but can metastasize, particularly to the liver and lymph nodes [^116wiHYJ]. Management typically involves **surgical resection with lymph node sampling** [^1141pcWB]; adjuvant therapy may be considered based on grade, size, and metastatic status [^notfound]. Chromogranin A is also useful for **postoperative surveillance and monitoring** for recurrence [^1179XLf5].

---

## Conclusion and answer

The most likely diagnosis is a **well-differentiated NET**, and the most appropriate immunohistochemical marker is **chromogranin A** [^1141pcWB]. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. Chromogranin A** [^1141pcWB].

Ga-PSMA PET/CT is a new imaging technique that is highly sensitive to metastatic prostate cancer lesions compared with other conventional imaging modalities. We report a case of a 77-year-old man with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma who had a PSMA PET/CT scan for staging of his disease. An intensely PSMA-avid right pelvic mass was identified abutting the cecum and terminal ileum. Surgical removal and histopathologic examination of this lesion revealed the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor. It is important to be aware that many tumors other than prostate carcinoma may also show avid uptake on PSMA PET/CT scan.

A 76-year-old man presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and fatigue. The patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. An abdominal computed tomographic scan showed collections of free air in the abdomen with obstruction of the distal small intestine and multiple masses in the liver. Laparotomy revealed a widespread malignant neoplasm in the abdomen, with multiple tumor nodules in the ileal wall, mesentery, and liver. The ileal wall was perforated within the area of one of the tumors. Pathologic examination of the lesion showed a neoplasm composed of solid sheets of spindle and undifferentiated cells, forming interlacing delicate vascular channels with atypical endothelial cells. The tumor cells were positive for the endothelial marker CD31, whereas reactivity for a broad panel of epithelial and other endothelial markers was negative. This case demonstrates that although angiosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract are rare, they should be considered in cases of intestinal perforation or severe bleeding, especially in the elderly. A broad panel of immunochemical markers might be necessary to establish the pathologic diagnosis.

### Four tumours including neuroendocrine tumour of the ileum [^115gPLsh]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours are associated with development of further primary tumours. Certain conditions give an inherited predisposition to developing neoplasia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to report a patient with neuroendocrine tumour and three other tumours: a further bowel cancer, a brain tumour and a skin cancer. We report a case of a 42-year-old Caucasian man presenting with clinical features of intestinal obstruction who on histopathology of surgical specimen was found to have two distinct tumours of the bowel: a colonic adenocarcinoma at the splenic flexure and a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour of the terminal ileum. His history included a basal cell carcinoma and a benign brain tumour. He had extensive family history of neoplasia suggesting an inherited predisposition. Our case demonstrates the importance of investigating patients with known neuroendocrine tumours for further malignancy and suggests that patients with multiple primary malignancies should be referred for genetic testing.

### Diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in older patients… [^1174XHLe]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The pain of diverticulitis is more acute and more severe than that of painful diverticular disease. The diagnosis often is made clinically. CT is the modality of choice when the diagnosis is uncertain or an abscess or fistula is suspected. 34 Barium enema and colonoscopy should be avoided in the acute phase because of the risk of expanding a localized perforation. 4, 5, 33. Gallstone ileus is a rare but important cause of small bowel obstruction in older patients. 5, 14, 35 It has been implicated as the cause of small bowel obstruction in up to 20 percent of patients older than 65 years. 5, 14 In gallstone ileus, a gallstone lodges in the distal ileum. Patients present with the classic triad of small bowel obstruction, air in the biliary tree, and calculus on plain film radiographs. 3 The classic triad for a ruptured AAA is present in only 25 to 50 percent of cases.

42, 43 A palpable mass with flank ecchymosis is highly suggestive of a ruptured AAA. Abdominal pain and backache are common presenting symptoms. 42, 43 Presentation may resemble acute cholecystitis, perforated ulcer, diverticulitis, or renal colic. 3, 43 For this reason, patients with AAA often are misdiagnosed.
43. Plain radiographs may show calcifications of the aneurysm, a soft tissue mass, loss of the psoas shadow, or loss of renal outline. Ultrasonography is a fast, safe, and reliable way to distinguish an abdominal aneurysm from another intra-abdominal process and may be performed at the bedside. Urgent CT should be reserved for clinically stable patients and to identify whether a leaking or dissecting aortic aneurysm is present. 5 See Figure 2 for an example of a dissecting aneurysm. Plain film radiographs may initially be unremarkable; an adynamic ileus, distention, air-fluid levels, and fixed dilated loops may be seen as the ischemia goes untreated.

A CT scan may reveal bowel wall thickening from edema or hemorrhage and intestinal wall gas. CT may rule out other pathology and may detect superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. 44, 45 Angiography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis if mesenteric ischemia is strongly suspected. 44, 45.

### Multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors and synchronous ileal carcinoids [^1119VNe5]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

A 74-year-old African-American male presented with a 3-day history of hematemesis and melena. The patient reported no abdominal pain, constitutional symptoms, bright red blood per rectum, constipation, or diarrhea. His physical examination and medical history were unremarkable except for benign prostatic hypertrophy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a 3 x 2 x 2 cm smooth round mass in the cardia, 2 cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction. Biopsy of the mass revealed an ulcerated tumor composed of spindle cells. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for a number of biochemical markers, including KIT, Ki-67 and smooth muscle actin, but was negative for the markers S100 and desmin. A gastric-wedge resection revealed an ulcerated 4.5 cm mass in the stomach, and exploration of the abdomen revealed two ileal carcinoid tumors, jejunal diverticula and reactive mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

Investigations

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, biopsy, CT scan, immunohistochemistry, DNA microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR.

Diagnosis

Multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors occurring concomitantly with ileal carcinoids.

Management

Gastric-wedge resection and segmental resection.

### Mesothelial reaction in longstanding Crohn's ileitis simulating papillary mesothelioma [^114eJycg]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Intestinal and extraintestinal complications of Crohn's disease are well documented. Changes in the connective tissue within the intestinal wall and surrounding tissue including mesenteric fat are characteristically seen in resected and autopsy specimens. A rare and unusually florid mesothelial reaction in the surrounding small bowel serosa of a patient with a 2-year history of Crohn's ileitis is described. The peritoneal surface of the ileal resection specimen displayed exuberant tubulo-papillary formations of the mesothelium, with superficial invasion of the underlying stroma. The case demonstrates the well-recognised difficult differential diagnosis between a benign mesothelial proliferation and malignant mesothelioma in a novel clinical setting, and the diversity of the extramural manifestations of Crohn's disease.

### Primary gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma: a clinicopathologic study of 13 cases from Taiwan [^115v4GkL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Goals

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common nodal lymphoma. Primary gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma (GIFL) is rare and most commonly occurs in the elder women with indolent clinical course, mainly in the duodenum and terminal ileum. We conducted this study to characterize GIFL in Taiwan.

Study

A total of 13 cases were retrospectively collected in 4 hospitals in southern and eastern Taiwan up to 2006. Pathology review and immunohistochemistry were performed and the clinical data were obtained from chart review.

Results

There were 5 men and 8 women with a median age of 58 years (range, 31 to 74; mean, 55). The most frequent site was ileum (7/13, 54%) with 4 tumors in the terminal ileum and the most common symptom was abdominal pain (8/13, 62%). Multiple lymphomatous polyposis was present in 6 patients (46%). Five (45%) of 11 tumors with surgical resection showed transmural involvement. Most of the cases revealed a predominantly follicular pattern (7/13, 54%) and low-grade disease (grades 1 and 2; 10/13, 77%). The tumors expressed CD10 (62%), Bcl-2 (77%), Bcl-6 (77%), and MUM1 (38%). Five patients (38%) were at stage IE and 8 (62%) at stage IIE. Treatment included surgery with or without chemotherapy. All patients achieved complete remission and relapse occurred in 3 patients. At a median follow-up time of 51 months (range, 3 to 180; mean, 63), 11 patients (85%) were disease free and no patient died of lymphoma.

Conclusions

We characterized the clinicopathologic features of the first series of GIFL in Taiwan. These tumors frequently involved ileum with a favorable prognosis.

### Primary sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine: very rare and aggressive tumour [^111W93Ai]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine is a very rare and aggressive variant of small intestinal cancers with poor prognosis. The tumour primarily affects middle-aged and older patients with a mean age of 57years at the time of presentation. We report a woman aged 58years without any relevant medical history who presented with small intestinal obstruction. She underwent radiologic and endoscopy investigation with persistent features of small bowel obstruction. The patient was found to have a small bowel tumour causing the obstruction and underwent surgical excision of the tumour. Pathology revealed malignant neoplasm with sarcomatoid and epithelioid features involving the terminal ileum. The use of immunohistochemical markers helps in wide range of differential diagnoses. Surgical resection is still considered the best and first-line therapy with poor response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Diagnosis

Histology

The diagnosis of a NEN is based on its distinctive histologic and immunohistopathologic profile such as expression of the general markers of neuroendocrine differentiation chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Consequently, histology should be obtained by biopsy or resection in all patients suspected of having a NEN. In addition, immunohistochemistry is also useful for identifying prognostic and theranostic markers.

In the past, a major problem in the management of patients with NENs was the lack of universally accepted standards regarding their nomenclature, prognostic stratification, and staging. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of 2000 attempted to address some of these issues, the clinicopathologic classification that was introduced was rather complicated, whereas terminologies such as lesions of "uncertain behavior" were confusing and not widely accepted. It subsequently became apparent that NENs constitute a heterogeneous group of lesions with ubiquitous malignant potential. Their ability to metastasize or invade adjacent structures depended on tumor site, type, and biologic behavior.

However, it was not until the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) introduced a grade classification and a site-specific staging system that some of these issues were addressed. The proposed classification by ENETS attempted to combine tumor heterogeneity according to the tissue of origin, along with tumor differentiation and malignant potential. Based on this classification, it became evident that tumors originating from specific anatomical sites such as gastric NENs related to hypergastrinemia, duodenal, appendiceal, and rectal NENs follow a less aggressive course than those derived from other parts of the GI tract and the pancreas.

As per other malignancies, the TNM staging system was also incorporated in this classification system to denote the anatomical extent of the disease. Tumors localized to the organ of origin are staged as I or II depending on their size and extent, tumors with spread to regional nodes are staged as III, and those with distant metastases as stage IV. This classification is adopted with the intention that categories within each group are more or less homogeneous in respect of survival, and that the survival rates are distinctive between groups. As the potential for tumor spread is directly related to the tissue of origin, tumor size incorporated in the TNM staging differs among tumors originating from different anatomical sites. Subsequently, in the 2010 WHO classification the term "neuroendocrine" was fully adopted to highlight the expression of neural markers in tumors exhibiting endocrine properties and phenotype.

### Thinking out of the: a case of obscure lower GI bleeding [^112tSUFE]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

A middle-aged man was admitted for episodes of fresh per-rectal bleeding, which were not associated with defecation. He was recently investigated for macrocytic anaemia in the outpatient haematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal haemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding. Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.5g/dL, normal 12.9–17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin 95.3fL, normal 80.0–95.0 fL). Peripheral blood film showing blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells and hypogranular platelets. The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal haemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. The bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop of haemoglobin to 4.8g/dL requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography performed during an episode of significant bleeding revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding. Bleeding subsequently recurred and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12units of packed cell transfused, exploratory laparotomy, on-table enteroscopy (figure 1) with small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen was performed (figures 2–4).gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F1F1GUTJNL2016313252F1Figure 1Multiple ileal lesions with stigmata of recent bleed.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F2F2GUTJNL2016313252F2Figure 2Area of ulceration associated with atypical mononuclear infiltrate.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F3F3GUTJNL2016313252F3Figure 3Atypical mononuclear infiltrate composed of cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei containing variably prominent nucleoli.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F4F4GUTJNL2016313252F4Figure 4Atypical cells displayed cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase.

AUA/ASCO/SUO muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) surveillance — laboratory values and urine markers: "Following therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, clinicians should monitor laboratory assessment at three to six month intervals for two to three years and then annually thereafter. (Expert Opinion)". After cystectomy and diversion, "all patients should undergo assessment of electrolytes and renal function" and "vitamin B 12 levels should be assessed… in patients with resection of > 60 cm of ileum and in those patients in whom the terminal ileum is utilized". "Routine frequent complete blood count and liver function testing for cancer surveillance has not been validated". For urine cytology, a meta-analysis estimated "it would require 2,000 urinary cytological examinations in order to find a single invasive upper tract cancer", and while it "can be used to monitor for recurrence after cystectomy", "its sensitivity is low for upper tract cancer, and there is difficulty with interpretation after urinary diversion". Interpretation may be further limited because "urine collected from intestinal urinary diversion or previously irradiated bladders may contain desquamated intestinal epithelial cells or atypia due to therapy, which may lower the diagnostic specificity". Overall, "there is insufficient data to support the routine use of cytology or urine-based tumor markers in detection of upper tract urothelial cancers". Although newer biomarkers exist ("either protein-based or cell-based"), "the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers does not support the routine use for MIBC post-therapy surveillance", and "these assays have not been thoroughly tested or validated for patients following prior cystectomy with urinary diversion or following bladder preserving therapy".

Small bowel neoplasms

Tumors of the small bowel are a very rare entity, accounting for only 1% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms and 0,3% of all tumors. The most common modes of presentation are intestinal obstruction and occult gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Occasionally, the presentation involves the development of a palpable but otherwise asymptomatic mass, whereas perforation and gross bleeding are rare. Small bowel tumors are usually located in the proximal small bowel, with the exception of adenocarcinoma in the contest of ileal Crohn's disease and NETs.

Adenomas are the most common benign tumors of jejunum and ileum. Their histological subtype are either tubular adenomas with low malignant potential or villous adenomas with high malignant potential. Lipomas are more frequent in the ileum, have no malignant potential and do not require a surgical excision unless symptomatic.

Malignant neoplasm present similarly to benign lesions. Diagnosis is often delayed conducing to advanced tumors, for whom surgical resection is rarely curative. Adenocarcinomas represent 50% of all small bowel malignancies. Most lesions are located in the proximal bowel, except in the setting of Crohn's disease in which most are ileal. Resection is the best treatment but overall the prognosis is poor due to late presentation in most patients (15% to 35% 5-year survival). Lymphomas represent 10% to 20% of small bowel malignant tumors. The ileum is the most common site of involvement because of the greatest amount of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Primary small-bowel lymphoma is the most common extranodal form of lymphoma. Most are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and predominantly B-cells in origin. Patients commonly present with fatigue, weight loss and abdominal pain, whereas perforation, bleeding, obstruction or intussusceptions are less frequent. Treatment in such emergent cases is surgical and consists in resection along with a wedge of mesentery. Adjuvant therapy is recommended for patients with positive margins. Survival for completely resected intestinal lymphomas is about 50%.

### Primary small intestine angiosarcoma mimicking Crohn's disease [^112ipYew]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A man in his 40s presented to an emergency department after experiencing worsening abdominal pain for 2days. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed circumferential mural thickening and luminal narrowing of the distal ileum and upstream dilatation of the small intestine, indicating small intestine obstruction. This prompted emergency laparotomy, where two lesions in the distal ileum were identified as the source of his bowel obstruction and resected. Immunohistochemistry of the resected segment revealed a primary small intestine angiosarcoma acting positively for vascular markers ERG and CD31. A subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed positive mediastinal metastatic lymphadenopathy without organ metastases. Following his surgery, the patient recovered well and was promptly referred to an oncology unit at a specialised health centre for further treatment. Primary small intestine angiosarcoma is a rare entity in which patients present with non-specific symptoms requiring prompt tissue diagnosis to facilitate multidisciplinary management.

Immunohistochemistry

IHC is used to confirm a high-grade NEN's neuroendocrine epithelial nature, for grading purposes (i.e. Ki-67), and to determine the site of origin in metastases of unknown primary. NENs are nearly always positive for broad-spectrum low molecular weight or pankeratins (e.g. CAM5.2, AE1/AE3); antibodies to EMA and/or EpCAM can be used in rare negative cases. NETs are nearly always positive for synaptophysin, though several diagnostic mimics may also be positive. As such, chromogranin A is typically performed concurrently. In contrast, up to one-quarter of NECs are negative for all traditional general neuroendocrine markers. INSM1 has emerged as the most sensitive general neuroendocrine marker in this setting, expressed by up to 95% of NECs.

Ki-67 IHC is mandatory for the grading of extra-pulmonary NET, and in the vast majority of cases, the diagnosis is made based on a proliferation index > 20%, rather than a mitotic count > 20 per 2 mm 2. Ki-67 IHC may be useful in NEC, as it is predictive and prognostic. Studies have identified various Ki-67 cutpoints in regard to prognosis but there is a lack of consensus as to if any specific Ki-67 cut point should be used as it generally does not affect the treatment approach. Though the Digestive Tumours Blue Book recommends evaluating the Ki-67 proliferation index in 'hot-spots' encompassing at least 500 cells, proliferation indices in NEC are typically uniformly very high. In contrast, in many G3 NETs, foci of high proliferation are more limited in extent. Although the median proliferation index in NEC (80% in one recent series) exceeds that in G3 NET (50% in the same series), the ranges are overlapping such that Ki-67 should not be used alone in the distinction of these two tumor types. Additional useful markers in this diagnostic setting include p53 (missense-mutation and null-pattern staining support a diagnosis of NEC), Rb (loss of staining supports a diagnosis of NEC), SSTR2A (diffuse, strong staining favors a diagnosis of NET, though up to one-third of NECs demonstrate strong staining), and CXCR4 (diffuse, strong staining favors a diagnosis of NEC, though this marker is not widely available).

### Contemporary pathology of gastrointestinal stromal tumors [^117Rgrzz]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The vast majority of GISTs harbor a KIT or PDGFRA mutation and express KIT by immunohistochemistry. However, KIT-negative tumors and tumors showing unusual morphologic features can cause major diagnostic problems. The ability to inhibit the active KIT or PDGFRA kinase with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and alternative drugs demands more than ever accurate tumor classification and risk assessment. This article focuses on the pathology of GIST, including unusual variants and morphologic changes resulting from treatment. Parameters for risk assessment, potentially helpful new immunohistochemical markers, differential diagnosis, and the application of molecular classification schemes are discussed.

### Jejunal polyp: a rare cause of intussusception [^116uLasa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 36-year-old male complaining of non-radiating abdominal pain for 15 days, with multiple episodes of green-colored vomitus. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed jejuno-jejunal intussusception with a 6×3×3cm homogenously enhanced smoothly marginated polypoidal soft tissue neoplastic lesion at the lead point (Fig. 1). An intestinal segment with intussusception was sent for histopathology. On gross examination, a single sessile polypoidal mass was identified measuring 6×3×3cm. The cut surface was white, firm with focal myxoid appearance. Microscopic examination (Fig. 2) showed submucosal tumor with overlying ulcerated jejunal mucosa. The tumor was moderately cellular containing interlacing fascicles of bland spindle-shaped, smooth muscle cells. The nuclei appeared elongated and cigar-shaped, without any pleomorphism. There was no evidence of necrosis or abnormal mitosis. Immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin and smooth muscle actin but negative for c-KIT (CD117) excluding the possibility of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and establishing the diagnosis of jejunal leiomyomatous polyp.

Tumors of the small intestine, benign or malignant, are rare. Their clinical manifestations are variable and include abdominal pain, melena, hematochesia and intestinal obstruction, the latter being the most common cause for hospital admission. Benign tumors of the small intestine presenting as acute abdomen requiring immediate intervention are rare. Leiomyomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract have been described commonly in the esophagus and rectum. However there are only a few case reports of leiomyoma involving the small intestine. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult to make owing to the absence of specific clinical symptoms and difficulties in radiologic evaluation of small bowel. Ultrasonography and CT scan with or without contrast are of little help since no specific features for small bowel leiomyoma have been described. Leiomyoma in the small bowel can arise either from the muscular layer or small muscles of vasculature. Leiomyomatous polyps can mimic lymphoma, epithelial tumors, neurofibroma or GIST on radiology. Correct diagnosis can be achieved only on routine histopathology or immunohistochemistry.

### Small bowel adenocarcinoma, version 1.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116CaPEV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Small bowel adenocarcinoma lymph node evaluation specifies that regional lymph nodes differ by primary tumor site, with retropancreatic, hepatic artery, inferior pancreaticoduodenal, and superior mesenteric nodes regional to the duodenum, and cecal or ileocolic (terminal ileum only, superior mesenteric, or mesenteric [not otherwise specified]) nodes regional to the jejunum and ileum. SEER analyses associate longer survival after resection with a lower ratio of positive-to-negative lymph nodes and with a higher number of regional lymph nodes assessed during surgery. For adequate staging, a minimum of 5 lymph nodes should be retrieved for duodenal tumors and a minimum of 9 lymph nodes for jejunal or ileal tumors, and pooled analyses found that 8 regional lymph nodes should be assessed.

### MRNA profiling of a well-differentiated G1 pancreatic NET correlates with immunohistochemistry profile: a case report [^113V9sfu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that can occur in all organs of the body, with the gastrointestinal system being a common site of localisation. Within the GI tract, the most common sites are the small intestine, rectum, colon, stomach, pancreas and appendix. NENs express markers of neuroendocrinology differentiation and may secrete a range of peptides that can cause hormonal symptoms Some features of neuroendocrine differentiation are common to all NENs while others may be site-specific. This has caused confusion in the classification of NENs because morphologically similar tumours can be found in different organs.

Gastrointestinal NENs are clinically challenging in their management. Some patients present with circulating levels of biologically active peptides including circulating chromogranin A and serotonin while others, termed non-functional NENs may have no specific clinical indicators but present with local symptoms including obstruction and bleeding. Non-functional pancreatic tumours account for 85% of all pancreatic tumours and have a significantly worse outcome than functional tumours and they may only present after metastasis.

Histological morphology and immunohistochemical criteria are routinely used to diagnose NENs. Established diagnostic immunohistochemical markers include Ki-67 a marker of proliferation, chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin, and CD56. Additional markers used including CDX2, a transcription factor required for intestinal differentiation, cytokerations, and the transcription factor PDX-1 that is required for pancreatic ductal and islet cell development. It is clear that the complexity of a tumour cannot be defined by a small set of markers but on the other hand there is a limit to the number of tests that can be carried out for routine diagnostic purposes.

Based on the 2019 WHO classification, NENs are classified into three grades: Grade 1 (low grade) with a mitotic rate < 2 and Ki‐67 < 3% (NET, G1), Grade 2 (intermediate) with a mitotic rate < 2 and Ki‐67 3‐20%, (NET, G2) and Grade 3 (high) with both mitotic rates and Ki‐67 > 20% (NET, G3). NECs are small cell type or large cell type, both poorly differentiated and with both mitotic rate and Ki‐67 > 20%.

### Xenin-immunoreactive cells and extractable xenin in neuroendocrine tumors of duodenal origin [^112jCJyQ]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Xenin is a 25-amino acid peptide produced by specific endocrine cells of the duodenal mucosa. We investigated whether xenin is expressed in neuroendocrine tumors.

Methods

Seventy-two foregut and midgut neuroendocrine tumors were examined by means of immunohistochemistry, confocal laser microscopy with an antibody against the C-terminus of xenin, and high-pressure liquid chromatography after acidic extraction, assessed by radioimmunoassay.

Results

We found xenin-immunoreactive cells in 23 of 26 duodenal neuroendocrine tumors, including gastrinomas, somatostatinomas, and nonfunctioning and enterochromaffin cell tumors. In these tumors, up to 20% of the endocrine cells were xenin immunoreactive, and xenin immunoreactivity was concentrated in secretory granules. Xenin was coexpressed with chromogranin A. We found no xenin expression in gastrin-, somatostatin-, and serotonin-immunoreactive cells. High-pressure liquid chromatography after acidic extraction revealed 497 ± 285 pmol of xenin per gram of tissue in 5 duodenal gastrinomas. The other neuroendocrine tumors, such as bronchial carcinoids, gastric enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoids, gastric and ileal enterochromaffin cell carcinoids, insulinomas, and gastrinomas of pancreatic origin, did not contain immunoreactive xenin.

Conclusions

Xenin is a peptide marker specific to neuroendocrine tumors of the duodenum. This finding may be useful in tumor classification and in the differential diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors of the upper gut.

### Extra-appendiceal mucinous neoplasms: a tumour with clinicopathologic similarities to low-and high-grade appendiceal counterpart [^115AxUCw]. Human Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms feature neoplastic mucinous epithelium with pushing borders and densely fibrotic walls. We have identified five examples of analogous colorectal tumours.

Methods and Results

Slides, pathology reports, and clinical data were reviewed. Whole genome sequencing was performed in two cases. Three were women and the mean age was 70. Associated GI conditions included Crohn's disease [1], diverticulosis [2], and sarcoma of the terminal ileum [1]. Signs/symptoms included obstruction [2], nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain [1], and positive faecal immunohistochemical test [1]. Colonoscopic findings included narrowing [1], "fullness" [1], and caecal lesion concerning for GIST [1]. Tumours involved the rectosigmoid [2], sigmoid [1], transverse colon [1], and cecum [1] and ranged from 1.5 cm to 8.5 cm. All but one tumour arose in the setting of faecal stream abnormalities related to obstruction, diverticulosis, or bowel diversion. All cases showed columnar, variably mucinous epithelium associated with little-to-no lamina propria. All but one case showed fibrosis of the submucosa. Three cases had high-grade areas. Neoplastic glands and/or mucin dissected through the muscularis propria or subserosa in 3 examples. No extracolonic neoplastic cells/mucin, infiltrative invasion, or desmoplastic response were identified. Three patients with available follow-up [5.5–28 months] are alive. Whole genome sequencing identified pathogenic TP53 and ERBB2 variants, as well as ERBB2 copy number amplification in one high-grade example.

Conclusions

Though these tumours share clinicopathologic characteristics with their appendiceal counterparts, our cohort is too small to draw solid conclusions. We propose the term "extra-appendiceal mucinous neoplasm [EAMN]" for these rare lesions.

### Inflammatory myoglandular polyp as a cause of recurrent abdominal pain in a patient with quiescent Crohn's disease [^114tc4mG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The surgical specimen consisted of a 12.5-cm-long segment of the terminal ileum, including the 2 aforementioned polyps. Macroscopic examination revealed a sessile polyp with lobulated surface measuring 3.7×3.4×2.6 cm, partially obstructing the ileal lumen. A flat tan mucosal lesion measuring 0.5 cm in greatest diameter was seen 3 cm proximally to the polyp.

Histologically, the larger polyp had features of an inflammatory myoglandular polyp, with focal superficial ulceration, rare cryptitis, foci of pyloric metaplasia, and a hyperplastic mesenchymal stroma with vascular proliferation and rare acellular mucin lakes. Immunohistochemistry for a smooth muscle actin and CD68 confirmed the presence of fibromuscular stromal hyperplasia, with numerous proliferating vessels lined by CD31-positive endothelial cells (Fig. 3) and few CD68-positive macrophages. The smaller lesion corresponded to an area of intramural hemorrhage involving the submucosa muscularis propria. No epithelial dysplasia was observed and there was no evidence of cytomegalovirus infection by histology or immunohistochemistry. The surrounding mucosa showed changes consistent with CD in remission.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^114J1hhg]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Immunohistochemistry for ovarian carcinoma differential diagnosis — Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with certain markers may help with differential diagnosis; whereas most (80%–90%) of serous carcinomas are positive for WT1 and endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas are usually negative. Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), PAX8, CA-125, and estrogen receptors, and most clear cell carcinomas express Napsin A. The presence of endometriosis can sometimes help to distinguish subtypes, as clear cell carcinomas and endometrioid tumors can be associated with endometriosis, whereas other subtypes are less likely to be. It is difficult to distinguish based on histology between primary mucinous ovarian carcinomas and GI metastases; PAX8 immunostaining is typical of primary tumors, although absence of PAX8 does not rule out ovary as the primary site. SATB2 is consistent with colonic origin, and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20 and CEA.

### A case of carcinoid tumor of the terminal ileum and simultaneous ovarian dermoid cyst [^113p9CKe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing malignant neoplasms associated with an indolent clinical course. About 60% of such tumors are located within the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we describe the first case, to our knowledge, of a carcinoid tumor of the terminal ileum and a simultaneous ovarian dermoid cyst. A 57-year-old woman was presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and clinical signs of mechanical bowel obstruction. Radiograph and computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed hydroaeric levels. Laparotomy revealed a mass in the terminal ileum and a right ovarian cystic mass. Right hemicolectomy and right oopherectomy were performed. The histopathological workup showed a carcinoid tumor of the terminal ileum and ovarian dermoid cyst. Small intestinal carcinoid tumor, an uncommon disease, has been reported earlier to coincide with various neoplasms. No association between small intestinal carcinoid tumor and ovarian dermoid cyst has been reported earlier in the English literature.

### Lung carcinoid tumours: histology and Ki-67, the eternal rivalry [^114pHq4y]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The recent WHO‐2021 criteria and terminology of Lu‐NETs has remained largely unchanged from the 2015 prior edition, meaning that diagnostic and prognostic challenges, debated in recent years, remain unresolved. The classification of well‐differentiated carcinoid tumours is still based on mitotic cut‐off of 2 per 2 mm 2 and/or presence of necrosis, however no significant improvements in predicting clinical outcome have become available yet. In addition, the prognostic and diagnostic role of Ki‐67 index is still much debated, although it is currently a standard marker for grading of digestive tract NENs.

In this study we characterized the morphologic, proliferative and immunophenotypic aspects of a large series of LCTs with the purpose of evaluating the morphologic factors, protein expression and role of Ki‐67 index with the aim of understanding and providing new insights into the biology and aggressiveness of these rare tumours. Our study demonstrates that Ki‐67 index, specifically with a 3% cut‐off, is a strong prognostic marker for LCTs, strongly associated with post‐operative recurrence, and therefore it should be implemented in diagnostic routine workflow.

2.3 Histological re‐evaluation

Samples were re‐collected from several different hospitals in South‐East Norway. The material consisted of surgical resection specimens from primary tumours from different origins, biopsies from the primary tumours or from metastases, and core biopsies. For some patients there were multiple samples, both from the primary tumour and metastases. All cases had been evaluated initially for histopathological tumour characteristics on haematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained slides, and with a neuroendocrine panel of markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin A and Ki‐67. The slides were re‐examined by an experienced pathologist according to the criteria in the 2019 WHO classification. The H&E slides were assessed according to a standardised template consisting of origin of the tumour (when possible, based on the material received), tumour growth pattern, the location of vessels close to or distant from the tumour, adjacent adenoma or adenocarcinoma, adjacent NET, desmoplastic stroma and confluent necrosis similar to what was done in the recent study by Elvebakken et al.

The result of the immunohistochemical examination of synaptophysin positivity was graded as 0 (0%), 1+ (1%–33%), 2+ (34%–66%) and 3+ (67%–100%) positive tumour cells, and chromogranin A as percentage positive tumour cells. Ki‐67 labelling was also graded in percentage of positive tumour cells compared to all tumour cells. As the tumour samples available for examination differed in size the total amount of tumour cells in the slides differed, but a minimum of 600 tumour cells were counted. The tumours were then classified into PD, further divided into SC or LC NEC, and WD consistent with NET G3.

### Pituitary neoplasm nomenclature workshop: does adenoma stand the test of time? [^115dYU5i]. Journal of the Endocrine Society (2021). High credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) — epidemiology and relation to pituitary adenomas — are epithelial neoplasms from neuroendocrine cells that most commonly originate in the gastrointestinal tract, but pituitary adenomas are not classified as NETs, and primary pituitary NETs are extremely rare and should be differentiated from metastatic NETs of other organs. NET incidence increased 6-fold to 6.98 per 100 000 in 2012, an autopsy study reported a prevalence about 0.5%, and survival data note median survival is 9.3 years with the highest rates in localized disease (> 30 years), Grade 1 NETs (16.2 years), and NETs of the appendix (30 years). Treatment decisions are based on functional status, extent of disease, grade and differentiation, rate of growth, primary site, and somatostatin receptor (SST) expression status, and NETs are extremely heterogeneous.

### Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract: classification, pathologic basis, and imaging features [^1173aGWN]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Many radiologists are unfamiliar with the recently developed World Health Organization classification scheme for neuroendocrine tumors. According to this classification scheme, neuroendocrine tumors are divided into well-differentiated endocrine tumors (carcinoids), well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas (malignant carcinoids), and poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas on the basis of their location, histologic features, and biologic behavior. Most neuroendocrine tumors have nonspecific imaging characteristics. However, they sometimes have peculiar clinical manifestations and radiologic features, on the basis of which radiologists may infer the specific diagnosis. Neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract originate from the cells derived from the embryonic neural crest, neuroectoderm, and endoderm. They usually produce bioactive substances and show immunoreactivity to neuroendocrine markers. Although neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon, they should be considered in developing the differential diagnosis for gastrointestinal tumors in patients with a typical syndrome or when the tumors have characteristic imaging features.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Langerhans cell histiocytosis - NCCN, more specifically with respect to immunohistochemistry, NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain comprehensive immunophenotyping including S100, CD1a, Langerin (CD207), CD68 and/or CD163, cyclin D1, BRAF V600E (VE1), factor XIIIa, and, if indicated, ALK and fascin. Use discriminatory markers for carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, and other suspected disorders for differential diagnoses. Recognize that cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry can be helpful to distinguish Langerhans cell histiocytosis from reactive Langerhans cell collections and has also been reported to be positive in Rosai-Dorfman disease.

### Endometriosis of the appendix causing small bowel obstruction in a virgin abdomen [^112LqQQD]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 29-year-old, otherwise well, nulligravid woman presented to the emergency department with 1-day history of generalised abdominal pain and vomiting. She had similar symptoms 6 months prior following recent menstruations, which resolved conservatively. She had no prior history of abdominal surgery or endometriosis. CT scan demonstrated distal small bowel obstruction. A congenital band adhesion was suspected, and she underwent prompt surgical intervention. During laparoscopy, a thickened appendix was adhered to a segment of distal ileum. There was blood in the pelvis. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis and appendicectomy were performed. Histopathology demonstrated multiple foci of endometriosis of the appendix with endometrial glands surrounded by endometrial stroma. Oestrogen receptor and CD10 immunostains highlighted the endometriotic foci. The patient made a good recovery and was referred to a gynaecologist for further management.

Neuroendocrine tumours

Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are categorised into three groups: well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (benign behaviour or uncertain malignant potential; synonymous with carcinoid in gastro-enteric NETs), well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (low-grade malignancy; synonymous with malignant carcinoid) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (high-grade malignancy; usually small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas). Rectum is the second most common gastrointestinal tract carcinoid following small bowel and comprises 27.4% of all carcinoid of GI tract. Rectal carcinoid is a submucosal tumour with a more indolent course compared with adenocarcinoma. Metastasis occurs in 4–18% of cases; most commonly to bone, liver and lymph nodes and has better prognosis in rectum compared with other sites. It is located commonly in the mid-rectum on the anterior and lateral wall. On MRI they appear as a solitary, small, submucosal, polypoidal mass, isointense on T1 and isointense to hyperintense on T2 with marked homogenous enhancement (Fig. 11). Management decisions are based on tumour size, necrosis, depth of invasion, mitosis and angiolymphatic invasion. Current treatment recommendations are: < 1 cm — endoscopic or trans-anal resection; 1–2 cm, without muscular invasion or lymph node metastasis — wide excision; 2 cm or greater, muscular invasion or lymph node metastasis — radical surgery.

### Testicular metastasis from ileal carcinoid: report of a case [^111pf62P]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

This report presents a patient with testicular metastasis from an ileal carcinoid.

Methods

This was a retrospective case review with literature review.

Results

The patient underwent right orchiectomy for a solid mass. Pathology revealed carcinoid tumor. Octreotide scan showed increased concentration in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Computerized tomography results were negative. Colonoscopy with biopsy revealed carcinoid of the terminal ileum. The patient underwent an elective resection of the terminal ileum and the right colon. Pathology revealed carcinoid tumor with vascular and lymphatic invasion present, and eight lymph nodes were positive. The patient had adjuvant treatment with octreotide.

Conclusion

Carcinoid tumors have been reported to metastasize to numerous areas. This is the first report of testicular metastasis from ileal carcinoid. Primary carcinoids of the testicle have been reported also. The clinician should be aware of this rare metastatic event. When pathology reveals carcinoid of the testicle, metastatic disease should be excluded before the tumor is identified as primary.

### Diagnosis of a remote neuroendocrine tumor thrombus by EUS-guided FNA [^116SgevA]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcome

Final FNA cytologic analysis of the thrombus demonstrated that the neoplastic cells were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin, supporting the diagnosis of a malignant neuroendocrine tumor thrombus (Fig. 9). Given the presence of metastatic disease, a curative resection was not possible. Our group has previously reported a series of successful cases of EUS-guided FNA of remote tumor thrombi. This case demonstrates the utility and safety of performing EUS-guided FNA of a possible tumor thrombus. Differentiation of a tumor from a bland thrombus can have a meaningful impact on a patient's clinical course.

### Independent somatic evolution underlies clustered neuroendocrine tumors in the human small intestine [^115wsAKv]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Patients

Eleven patients who underwent surgery for SI-NET at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, were included in the study. The clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Patients were postoperatively diagnosed with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor grade 1–2 of the ileum (WHO 2019). Tumor grade and the stage were based on one primary intestinal tumor and extent of lymph node metastases as standard clinical routine. Tumor samples were collected at surgery and were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A piece of each tumor was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for studies by immunohistochemistry. Blood was collected and used as normal tissue in sequencing. All included participants received in-person information by a designated research nurse as well as written information explaining the purpose of the study. In accordance with the ethical permit, consent was obtained in-person and was documented in writing by a signed document or as a designated entry in the patient's medical journal. The study was approved by the Central ethical review board in Gothenburg (Dnr. 833–18).

Immunohistochemistry

Sections of all sampled tumors from 11 patients with SI-NET were subjected to antigen retrieval using EnVision FLEX Target Retrieval Solution (high pH) in a Dako PT-Link. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in a Dako Autostainer Link using EnVision FLEX according to the manufacturer's instructions (DakoCytomation). Histopathological evaluation and assessment of tumor cell content was performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, serotonin and somatostatin receptor 2. These antibodies were used: anti-chromogranin A (MAB319/PHE5; Chemicon; diluted 1:1000), anti-synaptophysin (SY38/M0776; Dako; diluted 1:100), anti-serotonin (H209; Dako; diluted 1:10) and anti-SSTR2 (UMB-1; Abcam; diluted 1:50). All collected tumor samples were reviewed by a board certified surgical pathologist (ON).

DNA extraction

For DNA extraction, tumor samples of sufficient size and with a purity above 30% were included. DNA from fresh-frozen biopsies as well as blood from each patient was isolated using the allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

### Is the sum of positive neuroendocrine immunohistochemical stains useful for diagnosis of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) on biopsy specimens? [^112mpsdW]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

For the interpretation of neuroendocrine differentiation, care must be taken not to make a false positive call. This may occur in a tumour‐circumvented bronchiole with occasional neuroendocrine cells or by CD56 positivity on intratumoral lymphocytes. Moreover, for judging chromogranin‐A, evaluation of tumour cells at a ×40 objective is essential to detect occasional dot‐like positivity of small cytoplasmic granules, which may not be observed with the ×2.5–10 microscope objective.

Previous studies that aimed to evaluate the LCNEC WHO 2015 criteria on biopsy specimens have shown high diagnostic specificity. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Similarly, we provide evidence that the specificity for LCNEC on a biopsy specimen is acceptable (i.e. 83%). Nonetheless, we observed that several biopsy specimens diagnosed as LCNEC were classified as SCLC in the resection specimens. This is probably explained by tumour heterogeneity and the difficulty in assessing cytological features in biopsy specimens, as addressed previously. 4, 28 This imperfect specificity may affect the results of chemotherapy studies, as was suggested recently. 29

Several recently described markers may aid in the differential diagnosis of LCNEC on biopsy specimens and require further evaluation. The insulinoma‐associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a transcription factor of neuroendocrine differentiation proposed as a pan‐neuroendocrine marker that outperforms traditionally used markers, with similar specificity as chromogranin A and comparable sensitivity to CD56 and synaptophysin. 30, 31 INSM1 stains 75–91% of LCNEC and focal staining is observed in 0–4% of NSCLC. 30, 31, 32 The value of INSM1 in an algorithm of ≥ 2 neuroendocrine markers staining for biopsies to recognise LCNEC is unclear. Furthermore, recent studies have addressed the existence of different molecular subtypes of LCNEC. 27, 33, 34 Proposed are the LCNEC‐SCLC with TP53/RB1 mutations recognised with IHC by loss of the RB1 protein and the LCNEC‐NSCLC subtype with STK11/KEAP/KRAS mutations and the presence of RB1 protein staining. 27, 35 In the differential diagnosis of LCNEC versus SCLC, staining of RB1 IHC is indicative of a non‐SCLC‐like tumour. 4 Finally, napsin‐A is proposed as a marker to differentiate the TTF1‐positive molecular LCNEC‐NSCLC subtype from adenocarcinoma, as only few show focal staining for napsin‐A while all adenocarcinomas show (strong) staining for both markers. 36

A 62-year-old Asian man presented with a 3-month history of right iliac fossa pain which had progressively worsened over the last 3 weeks. All blood parameters were found to be unremarkable except for mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. CT imaging demonstrated thickening of the ascending colon and caecum. Colonoscopic biopsies showed submucosal granulomas with features suggestive of schistosomiasis and parasite serology was positive for Schistosoma antibodies. He was treated with praziquantel and showed subsequent symptomatic and radiological improvement. However, he represented nearly 2 years later and underwent a right hemicolectomy for small bowel obstruction. The resected bowel showed an inflammatory caecal mass and a terminal ileal adenocarcinoma.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are difficult to diagnose. Their symptoms may be vague or intermittent, and are frequently associated with much more common diseases; many of the tumors may be asymptomatic. Therefore, diagnosis can be delayed for some years. Because most NETs are secretory, the measurement of circulating biomarkers is helpful not only for diagnosis but also for assessing tumor response to treatment, monitoring disease progression, and use as prognostic indicators.

### First description of a PEComa (perivascular epithelioid cell tumor) of the colon: report of a case and review of the literature [^111h4hrs]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a young female patient suffering from a PEComa (perivascular epithelioid cell tumor) of the cecum, incidentally found at an examination made by her family physician. The perivascular epithelioid cell tumor is a very rare tumor, until today reported in a few cases in falciform ligament, uterus, jejunum, terminal ileum, rectum, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, and soft tissue of the thigh. This tumor is part of a new group of tumors, comprised of angiomyolipoma, lymphangiomyolipoma, and clear-cell myomelanocytic "sugar" tumor. Defined by coexpression of melanocytic (HMB-45) and muscle markers (smooth muscle actin and desmin) the perivascular epithelioid cell tumor does not have predictable histopathologic behavior. Some cases of metastasis are described, comorbidities such as tuberous sclerosis of the brain "Bourneville" and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be excluded. The therapy consists of the radical resection. An adjuvant therapy is not known. Recommended is a close and long-term follow-up clinically and by CT scan.

### A 66-year-old male with lower abdominal lump: an unusual presentation of an uncommon abdominal pathology [^112UTqBQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 66-year-old Caucasian male was admitted following symptoms of intermittent umbilical pain aggravated after meals and associated with vomiting of contents. Physical examination revealed a tender, partially reducible swelling suspicious of complicated umbilical hernia. Abdominal x-ray revealed dilated small bowel loops which appeared consistent with clinical diagnosis. He underwent a laparotomy subsequently which revealed a small defect in the linea alba with viable small bowel and two firm mesenteric masses encroaching the lumen approximately two feet from the ileocaecal junction. The histology of the excised bowel and masses revealed that the tumour composed of bland spindle cells with slender to plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mesenteric fibromatosis are the most common primary tumours of the mesentery and constitute about 3.5% of all fibrous tissue tumours. Intra-abdominal desmoids are very rare and benign tumours but are very aggressive and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.

Case presentation

Patient no. 1

A 54-year-old Chinese man came to the hospital due to an abdominal mass he had noticed 4 days prior. Abdominal plain CT and MRI scans showed an abdominal cystic mass that was considered to be a cystic teratoma. The patient had a history of inguinal hernia surgery. An abdominal examination showed no positive signs. Routine blood, blood biochemistry, tumour biomarkers (AFP, CEA, CA12–5, and CA199), other blood tests and urine analysis were normal. Abdominal enhanced CT revealed (Fig. 1) an irregular mass originating from the mesentery in the left mid-abdomen, and the maximum cross-sectional area of the mass was approximately 5.5 cm × 10.6 cm. Contrast-enhanced CT scans showed no obvious enhancement of the lesion. Radiologically, it was diagnosed as possibly a lipoma.

Fig. 1
Abdominal enhancement CT revealing an irregular mass (arrows) originating from the mesentery in the left mid-abdomen. The maximum cross-sectional area of the mass was approximately 5.5 cm × 10.6 cm, and a low-density shadow of the fat inside can be observed. The contrast-enhanced CT scans show no obvious enhancement. The mass constricted the adjacent small bowel and pushed it out (Case 1)

The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration and surgical resection. During surgery, a cystic lesion of 8 cm × 10 cm originating from the small bowel mesentery was observed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The tumour was completely resected. A lipoma was diagnosed by rapid intraoperative pathology. Postoperative histological examination revealed that the mass had lumens of varying sizes with lymphatic fluid and lymphocytes, which prompted a final pathological diagnosis of lymphangioma. Further immunohistochemical staining showed CD31 (blood vessel +), CD34 (blood vessel +), and D2–40 (lymphatic vessel +) positive reactions (Fig. 2 a–d). Finally, the diagnosis was confirmed to be haemolymphangioma originating from the small bowel mesentery. The patient recovered well and was discharged 8 days after surgery. No tumour recurrence was observed after 4 months of follow-up.

H&E slides of both resection and biopsy specimens were examined for (i) cell type, presence of cytoplasm and tumour to lymphocyte ratio to assess NSCLC of SCLC features according to the WHO 2015 classification, (ii) the presence of neuroendocrine morphology, (iii) estimated mitotic activity in non‐crushed fields [≤ 10, 11–30 or > 30 mitoses/10 high‐power field (HPF)], (iv) necrosis [none, 'dot‐like' (= as occasionally seen in atypical carcinoids) or abundant (= more extensive than 'dot‐like')]. If available, the MIB1 (Ki‐67) staining was scored into < 25% and > 25%. 15, 16 In more limited tissue samples (< 2 mm 2), mitoses were evaluated on all assessable HPFs. 4 Either > 10 mitoses/2 mm 2, abundant tumour necrosis or a Ki‐67 staining of more than 25% of tumour cells was sufficient to score for high‐grade tumour disease. 15 Chromogranin‐A and synaptophysin were scored as (+) on observation of focal small cytoplasmic dots in an occasional tumour cell at ×40 microscope. Any membrane staining was sufficient for CD56 (+). For all neuroendocrine markers, observation of staining (×4 or ×2.5 objective) was scored as strongly positive (+++), and between staining as (++). Additionally, p63/p40/TTF1 and cytokeratin stainings were evaluated when these were available. LCNEC diagnoses were established when both neuroendocrine morphology and neuroendocrine staining of at least a single marker was present, as according to the algorithm as described in the WHO classification (2015).

### Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116wiHYJ]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors:

- **Definition**: Gastroenteropancreatic NETs are a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms arising from neuroendocrine cells within the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, characterized by variable hormonal activity and malignant potential.
- **Pathophysiology**: Gastroenteropancreatic NETs originate from neuroendocrine cells capable of hormone production and secretion. They are classified by primary site (e.g., pancreas, small intestine, rectum), functional status (hormone-secreting vs. nonfunctional), and histologic grade based on mitotic rate and Ki-67 proliferation index. The biological behavior varies widely, ranging from indolent, well-differentiated tumors to aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Hormone-producing tumors may cause clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome or insulinoma, while nonfunctional tumors often present late with mass effect or metastases.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs has increased over recent decades. In the US, the estimated incidence is approximately 3.6 per 100,000 individuals per year, with a 20-year prevalence of 48 per 100,000. In Europe, incidence rates range from 1.3 to 2.3 per 100,000, though estimates vary due to heterogeneity in national and regional registry data.
- **Risk factors**: Most gastroenteropancreatic NETs are sporadic, but risk is increased in patients with inherited syndromes such as MEN1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Other risk factors may include chronic atrophic gastritis (for gastric NETs) and long-standing IBD.
- **Disease course**: The clinical presentation depends on tumor location, size, and functional status. Nonfunctional gastroenteropancreatic NETs are often indolent and asymptomatic until advanced stages, presenting with abdominal pain, mass effect, or metastases. Functional tumors present earlier due to hormone-related symptoms (e.g., flushing and diarrhea in carcinoid syndrome, hypoglycemia in insulinoma). Many tumors are diagnosed incidentally on imaging or endoscopy. Disease progression varies with tumor grade and site, and metastatic disease (most commonly to the liver) may occur even in low-grade tumors.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis depends on tumor grade, stage, primary site, and functional status. Well-differentiated, low-grade gastroenteropancreatic NETs generally have a favorable prognosis with long survival, even in the presence of metastases. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas are aggressive and associated with poor outcomes. Early-stage tumors amenable to complete resection have the best prognosis. Ongoing surveillance is essential due to the potential for late recurrence or progression.

### Surgical treatment and prognostic analysis for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the small intestine: before the era of imatinib mesylate [^113VbeRp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are rare, comprising only 0.1% to 3% of all GI neoplasms. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract. These tumors are composed of tumor cells from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are considered to be GI pacemaker cells.

Gain-of-function mutations in the c-kit proto-oncogene and overexpression of the kit protein can occur, and result in a constitutive stimulus to tumor cell growth. Because the kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly known as STI571, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) has been shown to produce a promising clinical result in an advanced GIST patient, identification of GIST by kit immunopositivity has become paramount.

Surgical resection with a negative gross margin remains the mainstay of therapy for primary GISTs. However, recurrence is common, and the 5-year survival rate after complete resection ranges from 40% to 65%. Several clinical and pathological factors that influence patient survival have been reported, but the results have varied due to variation in confirmation of kit. Postoperative follow-up and management for small intestine GISTs after curative resection should be tailored to patients according to high- or low-risk status of the tumors. Before the era of imatinib mesylate, we identified 100 patients with primary GISTs of the small intestine using positive kit immunostaining. Our aim was to identify predictors for long-term DFS and OS for small intestine GIST patients and clarify the difference between low- and high-risk patients after curative resection.

### Loss of CDX2 in colorectal cancer is associated with histopathologic subtypes and microsatellite instability but is prognostically inferior to hematoxylin-eosin-based morphologic parameters from the WHO classification [^117VjssT]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

CDX2 is a highly conserved transcription factor that controls cell fate and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium and is diffusely expressed by non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cells. CDX2 is also known to be strongly expressed by the majority of neoplasms of the colorectal system and is a marker that is frequently used in the daily practice of surgical pathology to verify or rule out an intestinal and especially colorectal origin of a carcinoma, for example in the setting of suspected CRC metastases in other organs or for histogenetic classification of cancers with unknown primary site. For the diagnosis of primary CRC in resection specimen, CDX2 is not frequently used, because the vast majority of CRCs are accompanied by adenomatous precursor lesions that are diagnostic of primary CRC in combination with a morphologically compatible invasive carcinoma component. However, CDX2 gained increasing attention in the scientific community in recent years as some studies proposed a lost or diminished expression of CDX2 as an independent biomarker of a more aggressive disease course, while other studies could not generally confirm these results. Compared to CDX2, which is normally assessed via immunohistochemistry, the recent WHO classification from 2019 defines the different histomorphological subtypes of CRC, tumour budding activity and the traditional WHO-grading algorithm in its essential diagnostic criteria for CRC, which represent purely histomorphological parameters that are assessed through the evaluation of HE-stained slides. In a recent study, we were able to confirm the high prognostic and in part stage-independent (CRC subtypes/tumour budding) prognostic impact of these parameters in the very same CRC cohort of > 1000 tumours.

Panel Consensus Pathology Revision

The retrieved IHC stains included the neuroendocrine markers [chromogranin‐A, synaptophysin and CD56 (NCAM)], TTF1, P63, Ki‐67 and available cytokeratin markers. All IHC markers were stained in routine diagnosis. All cases minimally required an H&E stain and one of three neuroendocrine IHC markers, as described previously. Subsequently, all tumour slides were systematically evaluated by three pathologists (R.v.S. M.d.B. and E.T.) using a multihead microscope. All pathologists were blinded for clinical outcome and for matching biopsy‐resection specimens. Total tissue size of the biopsy specimens was estimated by applying the following categories: ≤ 2, > 2 but ≤ 5, > 5 but ≤ 10 and > 10 mm. The total size of the samples was evaluated guided by the field of view of the microscope objective. In overview magnification (×2.5) the total size should well exceed the field of view (diameter 8 mm) to be larger than 10 mm; if at ×2.5 objective the total size was smaller than the maximum, but covering more than half the field of view, the size was between 5 and 10 mm; smaller samples were evaluated at ×10 objective: if the total sample size was smaller than the field of view (diameter 2 mm) then the total size was less than 2 mm, or it was between 2 and 5 mm.

### Management of neuroendocrine tumors of unknown origin [^111X5vn2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of unknown origin account for more than 10% of all NETs. Most of these tumors are poorly differentiated and, thus, very aggressive. Establishing the location of the primary tumor can be challenging. Workup of these NETs of unknown origin includes a thorough family history, immunohistochemistry, imaging, and OctreoScan. If the location of the primary malignancy is not determined, treatment is often initiated based on the grade and level of differentiation of the tumor, with well- and moderately differentiated tumors treated as carcinoid tumors, whereas poorly differentiated tumors are treated similarly to small cell tumors. Therapy is chosen based on symptoms and with the goal of debulking tumor when feasible and safe.

### NESP55, a novel chromogranin-like peptide, is expressed in endocrine tumours of the pancreas and adrenal medulla but not in ileal carcinoids [^113V97be]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Ileal endocrine tumours

A total of 15 tumours were analysed. Tumours were classified according to WHO 2000 as being well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas (malignant carcinoids). All tumours had metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes and/or liver. All patients had a typical midgut carcinoid syndrome with overproduction of serotonin. Immunocytochemical analysis did not demonstrate any NESP55 labelling in the ileal carcinoids (0 out of 15), while all tumours (15 out of 15) were strongly positive for CgA (Table 2

Table 2
Immunocytochemical demonstration of NESP55 and CgA in 118 endocrine and nonendocrine tumours).

Pancreatic endocrine tumours

A total of 25 tumours were analysed and classified according to WHO 2000. The criteria for malignancy was invasion of contiguous structures or documented metastases. The tumour material was divided into the following categories: (1) 12 well-differentiated endocrine tumours, including six insulinomas, one glucagonoma, one gastrinoma (associated with MEN 1 syndrome) and four nonfunctioning tumours; (2) 13 well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas, including two insulinomas, one gastrinoma, one glucagonoma and nine nonfunctioning tumours, (one was associated with MEN 1 syndrome). Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated NESP55 labelling in 14 out of 25 tumours. In the group of benign tumours (well-differentiated endocrine tumours) positive NESP55 labelling was observed in eight out of 12 tumours. Extensive NESP55 labelling was observed in five out of six insulinomas and two out of four nonfunctioning tumours. Focal NESP55 labelling was observed in one out of one gastrinoma. All tumours (12 out of 12) were strongly positive for CgA. In the group of malignant tumours (well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas) positive NESP55 labelling was observed in six out of 13 carcinomas. Extensive NESP55 labelling was observed in one out of two insulinomas, while focal NESP55 labelling was observed in one out of two insulinomas and four out of nine nonfunctioning carcinomas. All carcinomas (12 out of 12) were strongly positive for CgA. Neuroendocrine secretory protein 55 labelling in benign and malignant tumours was cytoplasmic with a strong perinuclear accumulation. In a small population of tumour cells, the cytoplasmic NESP55 labelling was granular, and similar to that of chromogranin A (Figures 3

Results

This retrospective study included a cohort of 66 patients with pathologically confirmed primary extra-ampullary stage II resected SBAs. Demographic and clinicopathologic data of all patients evaluated are reported in Table 1. We recruited 21 patients with celiac disease associated-SBA, 20 with Crohn's disease associated-SBA, 18 sporadic, and 7 cases with confirmed (1 case showing constitutional mutation of MLH1 gene) or highly suspected (6 cases) Lynch syndrome (see below).

A fraction of such cases entered previous studies from the Small Bowel Cancer Italian Consortium. Patients were predominantly males (64%), the median age at SBA diagnosis was 61.5 years, and the tumor was mainly located in the jejunum-ileum (92%). Histologically, SBAs were classified as glandular (74%), medullary (8%), mixed (9%), or diffuse/poorly cohesive (9%) (Fig. 1). In 44% of cases, the total number of examined lymph nodes was under the cut-off endorsed by the NCCN guidelines. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was eight. At least one high-risk or extended high-risk feature was present in the majority of cases (62% and 79%, respectively).

### Workup of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^1159Kh1Q]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas are rare. Their presentation overlaps with other intra-abdominal neoplasms, but can have unique features. The workup involves recognition of unusual clinical features associated with the tumors, imaging, analysis of blood or urine concentrations, and biopsy. Functional imaging takes advantage of the neuroendocrine tumor-specific expression of somatostatin receptors. There are characteristic features supporting the diagnosis on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging. The use of tumor markers for biochemical diagnosis requires an understanding of the confounding variables affecting these assays. There are unique and specific immunohistochemical staining and grading requirements for appropriate diagnosis of these tumors.

Intra-abdominal fibromatosis

Intra-abdominal fibromatosis is a benign tumoral entity, also known as intra-abdominal desmoid tumor or mesenteric fibromatosis. It is part of the clinicopathological spectrum of deep fibromatoses, a group of benign fibroproliferative entities with locally aggressive behavior and frequent recurrences, but no metastatic potential. Small bowel mesentery is the most common site of origin. Other locations are the omentum, the ileocolic mesentery and the transverse and sigmoid mesocolon. It is associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, specifically with the Gardner syndrome variant.

Common imaging features are solid mesenteric or omental masses with well-defined margins and random distribution (Fig. 31). These masses may appear striated or whorled due to the alternation of areas of myxoid stroma (hypodense on CT and hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images) with collagenous areas (isodense or hyperdense on CT and hypointense on T2-weighted MR images). Predominantly myxoid lesions typically remain hypoattenuating and do not enhance with intravenous contrast. A diffuse and spiculated infiltration of the mesentery is also frequently seen, especially in Gardner syndrome.

Fig. 31
Intra-abdominal fibromatosis in a 67-year-old man. a, b Axial CT images in the portal phase show two nodular solid masses in the small bowel mesentery and the left greater omentum (red arrows). Note the mixed density of the big mesenteric mass, due to the combination of hypodense myxoid material (black asterisk) and dense collagenous material (white asterisk) within its stroma. c H&E stain photomicrograph shows a poorly cellular lesion without atypia or necrosis, within a background of fibrous stroma

Histology may resemble a GIST, hence the immunohistochemical profile is key for the differential diagnosis. Treatment is controversial, but many authors suggest a conservative approach due to the difficulties of complete resection, the surgical morbidity and the high recurrence rate.

### What every gastroenterologist should know about gastrointestinal NETs [^1128zz1t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

OBTAINING NET STAGE AND GRADE

The initial management of NETs is similar to that of any cancer. Because all NETs have malignant potential (i.e. the ability to invade or develop metastases), it is critical to adequately stage these tumors using the Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification. Tumor grade is also important to understand NET biology, which ultimately translates to how patients will fare. The World Health Organization classification identifies tumor grade using the mitotic index and Ki67 proliferation index (Table 1), where increased mitotic rate and high Ki-67 index are associated with a more aggressive clinical course and worse prognosis.

### Large pelvic mass reveals poorly differentiated carcinoma with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation: a diagnostic and surgical challenge [^1166Kr7j]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy characterised by a combination of epithelial and mesenchymal features, often complicating the identification of its primary origin. These tumours can arise in various anatomical sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and pelvis, and are typically associated with rapid growth, local invasion and a poor prognosis. We present the case of a woman in her mid-60s with a history of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease, who developed a large pelvic mass. Initial imaging revealed an extensive, heterogeneous lesion measuring 12cm in diameter, involving adjacent structures. Surgical exploration demonstrated the tumour's extensive adherence to surrounding tissues, necessitating ileocolic resection and omentectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, while immunohistochemical studies were inconclusive regarding the primary origin. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by sarcomatoid carcinoma, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the role of molecular studies in optimising management.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116eanUs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — special considerations note that keratin and neuroendocrine markers can be positive in certain neoplasms that may morphologically resemble, but are not classic neuroendocrine neoplasms, and they are treated differently; therefore, correct identification or exclusion in the appropriate clinical context is necessary. These include (but are not limited to) pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, Merkel cell carcinomas, Ewing sarcoma, and desmoplastic round cell tumor. The terminology "carcinoma with neuroendocrine features" or "adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features" should be avoided, and a definite WHO-recommended tumor classification should be attempted, noting that adenocarcinomas in the GI tract can often express neuroendocrine markers patchily without any survival or management significance. In case of ambiguous histology and challenges in interpreting the neoplasm, this should be stated clearly in the report, indicating the importance of clinical correlation, and recommending molecular testing (broad next-generation sequencing [NGS] panel).

### Calcifying fibrous tumor of the gastrointestinal tract [^111tzRmv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Calcifying fibrous tumor is a benign mass lesion classically described as a soft tissue tumor. However, a thorough review of the literature reveals that it can occur virtually anywhere, including the tubular gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Its clinical manifestations are variable in the GI tract, and its imaging findings are nonspecific. However, it has unique histologic and immunophenotypical features that must be recognized by GI pathologists to differentiate it from an assortment of other rare mesenchymal lesions of the abdomen and GI tract. Calcifying fibrous tumor is composed of a paucicellular collagen matrix, interspersed calcified bodies, and a sparse inflammatory infiltrate. Although calcifying fibrous tumor is benign, pathologists must be aware that it may occur in the GI tract to differentiate it from other potentially more aggressive, rare mesenchymal lesions.

Case presentation

A 72-year-old man presented with lower abdominal pain for 2 months, accompanied by bloody stools occasionally. On physical examination, there was a soft abdomen with mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. In palpation, a mass was identified in the lower abdomen, measuring 4 × 3 cm approximately. The mass boundary was unclear and the mass can be mobile. The patient had no family history. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin (HGB) of 85 g/L, leucocytes of 15.41 × 10 9 /L and K of 3.28 mmol/L. Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities. Abdominal CT shows a 4.7 × 3.7 cm mass communicated with the small intestinal lumen (Fig. 1) and the edge of the mass was rough, with shallow lobes. Several enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the adjacent mesentery and in the right cardiophrenic angle. After enhancement, the mass shows heterogenetic enhancement and a small lesion in the seventh segment of the liver (Fig. 2). Based on CT characteristic, GIST was first considered. Subsequently, the patient underwent radical resection of the small intestinal tumor and intraoperative liver lesion ablation. At laparotomy, the mass was covered in omentum majus and invaded the adjacent peritoneum. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed in mesentery with the largest diameter of 2 cm and three small lesions were observed in liver with the largest diameter of 0.5 cm. Histopathology of the small intestinal tumor and liver lesion showed moderately differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma with lymph nodes metastases. Microscopic examination of the surgical specimens indicates squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the entire intestinal wall (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical investigations demonstrated positive for cytokeratin 19, cytokeratin 5/6, P63and Ki-67 (approximately 30%). However, immunohistochemistry indicates negative for CD5 and CD117. The patient subsequently received chest CT and was found to have an irregular contours mass in anterior mediastinum with mild heterogenetic enhancement, measuring 2.3 × 1.4 cm (Fig. 4). Biopsies of the anterior mediastinum mass revealed thymic squamous-cell carcinoma. Although both CD5 and CD117 for intestinal mass were negative, after multidisciplinary consultation, clinician concluded the small intestine mass was metastasized from the thymus because primary small intestinal squamous cell carcinoma is extremely rare, and both thymic and small intestinal squamous cell carcinoma were confirmed by pathological examination. The patient was started on gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen.

### Small invasive colon cancer with systemic metastasis: a case report [^114CoKr9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with an unknown primary carcinoma, the site remains unidentified in 15~25% of the cases even after autopsy, although recent advances in clinical examination and diagnostic work-up have decreased this frequency. The median survival of high-risk patients with cancer of unknown primary origin ranges from 3 to 11 months, making prompt diagnosis and treatment very important. In this case, 2 months elapsed between the initial consultation at the referring institution and the patient's presentation at our hospital. Pathological and IHC reviews of cervical lymph node tissue were the main tools used to determine the primary site of cancer origin.

When attempting to trace the primary site of a metastatic tumour of unknown origin, clarification of the histological type is indispensable in selecting appropriate treatment. Microscopic features and cell morphologies can be identified with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and this information can be used to identify the primary site. However, in the evaluation of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated cancers, IHC evaluation is a useful addition to HE staining in locating the tumour site. In particular, a pattern of positive CDX2 or CK20 expression and negative CK7 expression is indicative of primary colorectal cancer.

RESULTS

Immunocytochemical localisation of NESP55 and CgA in normal gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and adrenal gland

Gastrointestinal tract

NESP55 labelling was observed over a few cells in the mucosa of the gastric antrum. Labelled cells were located in the lower half of the antral glands. No NESP55 labelling was observed in the mucosa of the small intestine and colon. In the submucous and myenteric plexa, a few NESP55-labelled ganglion cells were observed. Numerous CgA-positive endocrine cells were observed in the mucosa at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract. A few CgA-positive nerve fibres and ganglion cells were observed in the myenteric and submucous nerve plexa at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract.

Pancreas

Neuroendocrine secretory protein 55 labelling was observed in pancreatic islets, while exocrine parenchyma was devoid of labelling. The majority of NESP55 labelling was located in beta-cells, as evident from consecutive staining for NESP55, CgA and insulin (Figure 1

Figure 1
Immunocytochemical demonstration of CgA, NESP55 and insulin in a pancreatic islet. Consecutive sections were stained with an indirect immunoperoxidase technique (EnVision+™). The majority of pancreatic β -cells (insulin positive) are also positive for CgA and NESP55.). The NESP55 staining pattern was cytoplasmic, with an accumulation of labelling in the perinuclear region. All labelling was abolished after adsorption of NESP55 antiserum with 1 μ synthetic human NESP55 peptide. Chromogranin A labelling was also located to pancreatic islets, with no labelling over exocrine parenchyma. The CgA labelling in pancreatic islets was cytoplasmic with a characteristic granular pattern (Figure 1).

Adrenal gland

The chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla were labelled by the NESP55 antibody, while none of the parenchymal cells of the adrenal cortex were labelled. The NESP55 labelling pattern in chromaffin cells was cytoplasmic, with an accumulation of labelling in the perinuclear region. All labelling was abolished after adsorption of NESP55 antiserum with 1 μ synthetic human NESP55 peptide. Chromogranin A was also located to the adrenal medulla and showed a characteristic granular labelling pattern in the chromaffin cells (Figure 2

Investigations

No specific blood or serum markers have been identified for this malignancy. In certain cases, imaging studies, cytology or biopsy may be conducted prior to surgery. In our patient's case, CT imaging revealed a substantial 8 cm mass in the small bowel compressing the intestine, leading to the decision to proceed with surgical treatment. Pathologic evaluation of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma.
