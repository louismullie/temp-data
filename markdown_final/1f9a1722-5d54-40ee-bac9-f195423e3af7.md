## Question

Best drugs for panic attacks

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are best for panic attacks and panic disorder, and how to choose among them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question targets acute panic attacks versus the chronic disorder. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about comparative efficacy and tolerability across drug classes. Next, I will align with guideline recommendations to anchor first-line choices. After that, I need to examine individual agents within the preferred class, especially SSRIs, and consider special populations. Finally, I will address acute rescue strategies, duration of therapy, and how to monitor and adjust treatment over time, making sure I double-check any claims that might be overgeneralized from limited data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "panic attacks" are discrete episodes peaking within minutes, whereas "panic disorder" is defined by recurrent unexpected attacks with persistent concern and behavioral change. Treatment decisions differ if the goal is aborting an acute attack versus preventing future attacks and maintaining remission, so I need to keep both scenarios in mind as I proceed.

> Next, I should review the highest-quality comparative evidence. Wait, let me verify the most recent network meta-analyses: multiple 2022 BMJ analyses converge on the same conclusion — SSRIs, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants all improve remission versus placebo, but SSRIs offer the best balance of benefit and adverse events, whereas benzodiazepines, despite strong short-term efficacy, carry higher risks of adverse events and dependence. SUCRA rankings consistently place SSRIs in the optimal quadrant for remission and tolerability, with sertraline and escitalopram standing out among SSRIs [^113r1t5q] [^112BF4gs] [^116owtBX] [^111wn7YJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should align this with guidelines. Major guidelines recommend SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder, with CBT as a co–first-line nonpharmacologic option; WHO 2023 explicitly recommends SSRIs and advises against routine benzodiazepine use, and AAFP similarly prioritizes SSRIs, while Canadian guidance lists several SSRIs and venlafaxine as first-line options; this reinforces that SSRIs are the default starting point for maintenance treatment of panic disorder [^111YyzMN] [^111UuPt9] [^114DSbVV] [^112hvzWB].

> I will now examine individual SSRIs, but I should double-check which agents have the most favorable benefit–risk profile. The BMJ network meta-analyses indicate sertraline and escitalopram achieve high remission with relatively lower adverse event risk; paroxetine and fluoxetine are effective but tend to have more adverse effects, and citalopram shows less favorable efficacy and more adverse events in the pooled rankings; regulatory labeling confirms efficacy for sertraline and paroxetine, supporting their clinical use when chosen thoughtfully [^113r1t5q] [^112BF4gs] [^111gz9zA] [^116csarF].

> But wait, what if someone cannot access SSRIs or cannot tolerate them? I need to ensure I cover alternatives. TCAs and benzodiazepines are effective for remission but have higher adverse event burdens; WHO suggests TCAs if SSRIs are unavailable, and Canadian guidance lists TCAs and benzodiazepines as second-line options; SNRIs like venlafaxine are reasonable alternatives, though they rank slightly lower on benefit–risk balance than SSRIs in network analyses; MAOIs work but are rarely used due to safety constraints [^111YyzMN] [^113TbkPK] [^113r1t5q] [^115MP9y2].

> Now, for acute panic attacks, I should confirm the role of benzodiazepines. Guidelines consistently restrict benzodiazepines to short-term, crisis use because of dependence, withdrawal, cognitive effects, and falls; if needed, fast-onset agents like lorazepam, alprazolam, or clonazepam can be used briefly while definitive therapy is initiated, with a plan to taper; some clinicians use a short benzodiazepine bridge during SSRI initiation, but I need to emphasize this is time-limited and not a maintenance strategy [^114iZuMB] [^1122sdfX] [^1121JuDE] [^114ijhDE].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities. In pregnancy or when planning conception, I should avoid teratogenic or higher-risk agents and generally favor SSRIs with better reproductive safety data, adjusting the choice and dose carefully. In older adults, I should avoid benzodiazepines due to sedation and fall risk. In patients with prominent autonomic symptoms, I might consider a beta-blocker like propranolol as adjunctive for somatic symptoms, recognizing limited and heterogeneous evidence and that this does not treat core panic psychopathology. In refractory cases, augmentation with atypical antipsychotics or switching classes can be considered, though evidence quality varies [^113r1t5q] [^113B4oBR] [^116PWt9k] [^114XcYJq].

> I should confirm dosing and onset expectations to set realistic timelines. SSRIs often require 2–4 weeks for initial improvement and up to 8–12 weeks for full effect. Starting low and titrating slowly mitigates activation and jitteriness that can mimic or exacerbate panic early on. Early improvement signals (e.g. CGI-I by week 2, HAM-A by week 3) predict endpoint remission with sertraline, which can guide early adjustments. Maintenance for at least 12 months after remission reduces relapse risk before attempting a gradual taper [^114YmJYN] [^117KyV5R].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and adjust therapy. I need to check panic attack frequency, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance, and functional impairment using validated scales like PDSS periodically. If there is inadequate response after 6–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose, I should confirm adherence, consider dose optimization, or switch to another SSRI or SNRI. If partial response persists, augmentation with CBT or, in select cases, a time-limited benzodiazepine adjunct can be considered. Throughout, I should screen for comorbid depression, substance use, and medical contributors that can blunt response [^111y3NA8] [^112t3DUv] [^116cmM9r].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of psychotherapy alongside medication. CBT has durable benefits and is a co–first-line treatment; evidence suggests comparable short-term efficacy between CBT and SSRIs, with combined treatment often practical; delivery formats such as individual, group, digital, and guided self-help are effective, expanding access; in primary care, brief CBT protocols or referral pathways can be integrated to improve outcomes [^115bhSGJ] [^111d5kYR] [^115BftCk] [^116cmM9r].

> Putting this together, my hierarchy is as follows, and I should double-check each tier against the evidence before concluding: first-line for panic disorder maintenance is an SSRI, with sertraline or escitalopram preferred for the best benefit–risk balance. Paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, and venlafaxine are acceptable alternatives based on patient factors and availability. For acute panic attacks, short-term benzodiazepines can be used sparingly while definitive treatment is initiated, with explicit plans to taper. TCAs and MAOIs are reserved for intolerance or nonresponse to first-line agents. Throughout, combine with CBT when feasible and continue maintenance for at least 12 months before tapering to reduce relapse risk [^113r1t5q] [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV] [^117KyV5R].

SSRIs are the **first-line pharmacotherapy** for panic attacks and panic disorder because they reduce panic frequency and severity [^1116FTyo] and are safe for long-term use [^111y3NA8]. Sertraline and escitalopram have the **best balance of efficacy and tolerability** [^113r1t5q] among SSRIs [^112BF4gs]. Benzodiazepines (e.g. alprazolam, clonazepam) are effective for rapid relief but should be limited to short-term use due to dependence and withdrawal risks [^11347y8h] [^1121JuDE]. SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine) are alternatives when SSRIs are not tolerated [^115MP9y2]. CBT is a **highly effective nonpharmacologic option** [^115bhSGJ] and can be combined with SSRIs for enhanced outcomes [^112Ua63f].

## Pharmacological treatments

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

SSRIs are the **first-line pharmacological treatment** for panic disorder because of their efficacy, safety, and favorable long-term profile [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV]. They reduce panic frequency and severity and improve quality of life [^111gz9zA].

- **Sertraline and escitalopram**: These SSRIs have the best balance of efficacy and tolerability, with high remission rates and low risk of adverse events [^113r1t5q] [^112BF4gs].

- **Paroxetine and fluoxetine**: Also effective, but paroxetine has higher withdrawal risk and fluoxetine may cause activation early in treatment [^113qNjUR].

- **Citalopram**: Effective but associated with higher adverse event risk compared to sertraline and escitalopram [^113qNjUR] [^112BF4gs].

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

SNRIs, particularly venlafaxine, are effective alternatives when SSRIs are not tolerated or are ineffective [^111wn7YJ]. They have a **favorable efficacy profile** but may cause more adverse events than SSRIs [^115MP9y2].

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines provide rapid relief of panic symptoms [^11347y8h] but carry risks of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal [^113r1t5q] [^114iZuMB]. They are recommended for **short-term use only** or as adjuncts during SSRI initiation [^117Y4uqj].

- **Alprazolam and clonazepam**: Highly effective for acute relief but should be limited to short-term use due to dependence risk [^112XVSfc] [^1121JuDE] [^113r1t5q].

- **Diazzepam and lorazepam**: Effective alternatives with similar cautions regarding long-term use [^113TbkPK] [^1121JuDE].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

TCAs, such as imipramine and clomipramine, are effective but have **higher adverse event rates** and are generally reserved for treatment-resistant cases [^113qNjUR] [^114KtvmP].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a **highly effective non-pharmacological treatment** for panic disorder [^115bhSGJ], reducing panic frequency and severity and improving functioning [^117ANacU]. CBT can be delivered individually, in groups, or via digital platforms, and is often combined with pharmacotherapy for enhanced outcomes [^112Ua63f] [^113o7Zkk].

## Comparative effectiveness and safety

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Tolerability** | **Safety** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | High | High | High |
| SNRIs | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| Benzodiazepines | High (short-term) | Moderate | Low (long-term) |
| TCAs | Moderate | Low | Moderate |

---

SSRIs, particularly sertraline and escitalopram, offer the **best balance of efficacy and tolerability** [^113r1t5q], while benzodiazepines are effective for short-term relief but carry long-term safety concerns [^11347y8h].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line treatment**: SSRIs are recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV].

- **Second-line treatment**: SNRIs or benzodiazepines may be considered when SSRIs are ineffective or not tolerated [^115MP9y2] [^113TbkPK].

- **Non-pharmacological treatment**: CBT is recommended as a standalone or adjunctive treatment [^1116FTyo] [^117Gopyu].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Treatment choice should be **individualized** based on comorbidities, medication tolerance, and patient preferences [^115bhSGJ]. SSRIs are preferred in patients with comorbid depression or anxiety disorders, while benzodiazepines may be considered for short-term relief in patients without substance use disorders [^1121JuDE].

---

SSRIs are the **first-line treatment** for panic attacks and panic disorder, with sertraline and escitalopram offering the best balance of efficacy and tolerability [^113r1t5q]. Benzodiazepines are effective for short-term relief but should be used cautiously due to dependence risk [^11347y8h]. CBT remains a highly effective non-pharmacological option and can be combined with pharmacotherapy for optimal outcomes [^1116FTyo].

Introduction

Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by the recurrence of unexpected panic attacks, in which an intense fear accompanied by a series of bodily and/or cognitive symptoms develops abruptly, without an apparent external cause (American Psychiatric Association). In the general population, about one-quarter of people suffering from panic disorder also have agoraphobia (Kessler et al.). Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a life-time prevalence of 3.7% without agoraphobia and 1.1% with agoraphobia (Kessler et al.). In primary care settings, panic syndromes have been reported to have a prevalence of around 10% (King et al.).

Three types of intervention are recommended for treating individuals with panic disorder (NICE). The intervention for which there is evidence for the longest duration of effect is psychological therapy, followed by pharmacological therapy and self-help. Among various psychological therapies, guidelines recommend the use of cognitive-behaviour psychotherapy (CBT) (American Psychiatric Association; Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Psychiatrists; NICE; Katzman et al.). In line with these recommendations, a recent Cochrane review and network meta-analysis (Pompoli et al.) found CBT to be the most efficacious treatment among other competing psychological therapies.

### CBT treatment delivery formats for panic disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115BftCk]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings may inform clinical practice and policy. Current guidelines on panic disorder (American Psychiatric Association; Katzman et al; NICE; Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Clinical Practice Guidelines Team for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia,) lack specific indications on treatment delivery strategies and should be updated according to the following key findings. First, with the same efficacy and acceptability of CBT delivered through the group or the individual format, guided self-help CBT should be viewed as a first line option for the treatment of panic disorder, with the goal of reducing personal, social, and monetary costs, and expanding the accessibility of treatments (Fairburn & Patel; Kazdin & Blase). Second, guidelines should highlight the need to routinely implement a shared-decision making framework that considers both the preferences and the clinical situation of the patient, promoting the use of guided self-help protocols for patients that may have difficulties in leaving home or have transportation or other personal difficulties that hamper the possibility to perform face-to-face sessions. Finally, our findings might encourage policy makers to consider the implementation of a stepped care approach in the clinical routine, where people are first offered a potentially highly available, flexible and low-cost option (guided self-help programs) followed by more intensive and structured therapies (face-to-face or drug therapy) only if the first step is unsuccessful.

Outcomes of interest

The primary outcomes were remission, defined as no panic attack for at least one week at the end of study, and dropout, defined as patients who discontinued treatment or withdrew before the end of the study owing to adverse events, protocol violation, or a lack of treatment efficacy. The secondary outcomes were anxiety and depression symptom scores and any adverse events (eg, sedation, fatigue or weakness, malaise, ataxia, slurred speech, cognitive impairment, sleep problems, sexual dysfunctions, tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting, gastrointestinal problems, chest pain, nervousness, headache, lack of coordination, blurred vision, difficulty with urination, menstrual irregularity, change in appetite, change in body weight, upper respiratory tract infection, irritability, agitation, paraesthesia, diaphoresis, tremor, anxiety, depressive symptoms, asthenia, and orthostatic hypotension). Anxiety and depression symptom scores were originally measured by the tools specified in the studies included, such as the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, clinical anxiety scale, Hamilton rating scale for depression, and Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale. These validated tools have been accepted and commonly used for measuring anxiety and depression symptoms. Given the limited number of studies that reported health related quality of life, this was not considered as an outcome (see review protocol registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020180638).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (NC and KC) independently extracted data on study characteristics (eg, setting, design, study period), participant characteristics (eg, mean age, percentage of women, duration of panic disorder), duration of treatment, and outcome measurements. Data used for pooling were extracted as means and standard deviations or continuous outcomes, and number of participants across treatments for dichotomous outcomes. When data were insufficient, we contacted the corresponding authors of the studies.

Objective

Recently, pharmacological treatment guidelines for panic disorder have changed as newer treatment options have become available. The authors examined how the use of psychotropic drugs has shifted over the course of 10 years to determine if prescribing patterns have changed to reflect these revised treatment guidelines.

Method

A total of 443 patients with panic disorder were enrolled in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project, a prospective longitudinal study of anxiety disorders. These patients were interviewed over the course of 10 years to examine their use of psychotropic medications.

Results

Despite efforts aimed at increasing the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with panic disorder (e.g. APA's practice guideline for panic disorder, Food and Drug Administration approval of particular SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder), only a modest increase in their use was found. Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder. In comparison, SSRI use throughout the follow-up period has remained low. Patients using an SSRI did not have a more favorable clinical course than those using a benzodiazepine, nor were there significantly better rates of remission in patients using SSRIs and benzodiazepines concomitantly.

Conclusions

These results highlight a gap between pharmacological treatment guidelines and actual delivery of care in that recommendations to use SSRIs to treat panic disorder are not being followed. Factors potentially associated with promoting and ignoring treatment recommendations are discussed.

### Dismantling cognitive-behaviour therapy for panic disorder: a systematic review and component network meta-analysis [^116yqGeh]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The analyses have been conducted in adherence to a pre-specified protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD42015027601) and the results are reported following the PRISMA extension statement for network meta-analysis (Hutton et al.).

Study eligibility criteria

We included all RCTs that compared any form of CBT against another form of CBT or any other psychotherapeutic control intervention. We included adult patients of both sexes, with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We included studies in which diagnoses were made according to operationalized diagnostic criteria. Table 1 presents the 12 different components of interest and their definition. We included a psychological therapy or a control intervention as long as it could be regarded as a combination of these 12 components. Table 2 provides a clarification of how the various forms of CBT were conceptualized according to a component-level perspective.

Conceptualization of various forms of CBT according to a component-level perspective

Therapies could be of any duration. We included both individual and group therapies. Pharmacological co-administration was allowed as long as there were no systematic differences in drug administration between study arms.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was remission of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in the short term (measured as close to 3 months as possible, with a maximum of 6 months). Remission was defined as a dichotomous outcome expressing the number of patients who reached a satisfactory end-state, as defined by the original investigators (e.g. achieving a score of 7 or less at end-point on Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)). Secondary outcomes included response and dropouts for any reason in the short term. The response was defined as a dichotomous outcome expressing the number of patients who had a substantial improvement from baseline, as defined by the original investigators (e.g. at least 40% reduction in PDSS scores from baseline).

Search strategy

In March 2015, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic search of all psychological therapies for panic disorder in order to identify relevant studies for a Cochrane review that has recently been published (Pompoli et al.). We updated and re-assessed these search results according to relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study in November 2015. Online Supplement 1 provides the details of the databases searched, along with supplementary searches and search strategies used.

### Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: current treatments and future directions [^114dPfEo]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Modern pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders are safer and more tolerable than they were 30 years ago. Unfortunately, treatment efficacy and duration have not improved in most cases despite a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety. Moreover, innovative treatments have not reached the market despite billions of research dollars invested in drug development. In reviewing the literature on current treatments, we argue that evidence-based practice would benefit from better research on the causes of incomplete treatment response as well as the comparative efficacy of drug combinations and sequencing. We also survey two broad approaches to the development of innovative anxiety treatments:the continued development of drugs based on specific neuroreceptors and the pharmacological manipulation of fear-related memory. We highlight directions for future research, as neither of these approaches is ready for routine clinical use.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^116b7dhi]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment implications by anxiety groups

The classification of anxiety disorders into fear-dominant, mixed, and anxiety-dominant groups directly informs treatment strategies (Table 1). International treatment guidelines provide consensus-based recommendations, emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment, followed by pharmacotherapy when necessary. The German guidelines for anxiety disorders recommend CBT as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as first-line pharmacological options. Benzodiazepines are discouraged due to dependency risks, while treatment-resistant cases may benefit from switching antidepressants or combination therapy. Similarly, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) clinical practice guidelines recommend CBT and SSRIs/SNRIs as standard treatments, with combination therapy considered for severe cases.

In the fear-dominant group (SP, AG), exposure therapy is highly effective. Gradually exposing patients to feared stimuli helps reduce exaggerated fear responses and avoidance behaviors. CBT, which involves exposure, is beneficial for SP but focuses primarily on the behavioral (exposure) component rather than on cognitive restructuring. For AG, CBT combines cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, helping patients challenge their fears and reduce avoidance. While SSRIs and SNRIs are not typically recommended for SP, they may be used to treat AG when comorbid with other anxiety disorders. However, some individuals remain resistant to standard treatments, requiring alternative therapeutic strategies.

In the mixed group (PD, SAD), CBT is the preferred treatment. It focuses on both exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring. CBT has demonstrated strong efficacy across both PD and SAD, reducing avoidance and fear responses. In SAD patients, CBT is particularly effective in addressing fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. In PD, CBT helps patients correct catastrophic misinterpretations of panic symptoms and encourages gradual exposure to avoided situations. In addition to CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs serve as first-line pharmacological treatments, targeting both anticipatory anxiety and acute fear responses. However, residual symptoms persist in some patients, necessitating augmentation strategies and alternative interventions.

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113B4oBR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

To date, statistical equivalence of the efficacy of propranolol versus benzodiazepines regarding the treatment of individuals with panic disorder with or panic disorder without agoraphobia has not been shown. Because the evidence converges to suggest that propranolol and benzodiazepines prescribed in clinical settings have similar effectiveness in the short-term treatment of these conditions, other factors also need to be considered. First, it takes time for an effect to become prominent upon administration. SSRIs generally require a period of 2–4 weeks, while in some patients with panic disorder the onset of action may take up to 12 weeks. Therefore, early adjuvant therapy with propranolol may be taken into consideration. Second, the side effects profile should be taken into account. Whereas the clinical effects of benzodiazepines are considered equivalent to the first-line pharmacotherapy of panic disorder (SSRIs;), they carry a high risk of unwanted sedative effects, cognitive impairment and dependence, and tolerance will develop over time. Conversely as compared with benzodiazepines, the side effects of SSRIs are temporary, reversible and relatively benign, albeit still considerably frequent (among others, > 10% gastrointestinal complaints, fatigue, insomnia, and headache;). Although side effects of propranolol occur less frequently (among others, 1–10% sleeping disturbances, nightmares, transient fatigue, and cold extremities;), the extent of the supporting evidence base is currently broader and more consistent for SSRIs than for propranolol. Therefore, it would seem most reasonable not to divert from current treatment guidelines recommending SSRIs as the first-line medication for panic disorder until robust data regarding the comparative efficacy and tolerability of propranolol versus SSRIs become available.

With regard to the therapeutic effects of propranolol, it has been proposed that propranolol's anxiolytic properties may result from its peripheral (autonomic) rather than its central activity. This may explain the lack of evidence for propranolol's efficacy in the long-term treatment of anxiety disorders other than panic disorder. To this end, it seems most likely that propranolol aids in breaking a vicious cycle of anxiety in which catastrophic misappraisal of bodily sensations of orthosympathetic origin, such as palpitations or increased ventilation, fuel the occurrence of panic attacks. This explanation is supported by research that found that subjects suffering from high levels of general trait anxiety improved little on propranolol, whereas more favourable effects were found in the treatment of performance anxieties, in which enhanced sensitivity for adrenergic hyperactivation may similarly initiate the fear response.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^115jWLmC]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, there were no evidence‐based guidelines for managing common anxiety disorders in non‐specialized care settings focusing on low‐ and middle‐income countries. These recommendations were produced to fill this gap and will serve as a foundation for forming a new module in the mhGAP Intervention Guide, a tool frequently used to operationalize the mhGAP guidelines. Extensive work will be needed to scale up capacities in countries to act on these mhGAP recommendations and ensure effective management of anxiety disorders globally.

### Diagnosis and management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults [^111y3NA8]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are among the most common mental disorders in the United States, and they can negatively impact a patient's quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living. Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high, with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes. Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions. Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy. The GAD-7 and the Severity Measure for Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools. Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient. Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or psychotherapy, both of which are highly effective. Among psychotherapeutic treatments, cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has an extensive evidence base. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, but their use is limited by risk of abuse and adverse effect profiles. Physical activity can reduce symptoms of GAD and PD. A number of complementary and alternative treatments are often used; however, evidence is limited for most. Several common botanicals and supplements can potentiate serotonin syndrome when used in combination with antidepressants. Medication should be continued for 12 months before tapering to prevent relapse.

### Next-step strategies for panic disorder refractory to initial pharmacotherapy: a 3-phase randomized clinical trial [^112t3DUv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

More data are needed to guide next-step interventions for panic disorder refractory to initial intervention.

Method

This 24-week randomized clinical trial (RCT) enrolled 46 patients with DSM-IV-defined panic disorder from November 2000 to April 2005 and consisted of 3 phases. Patients who failed to meet remission criteria were eligible for randomization in the next treatment phase. Phase 1 was a 6-week lead-in with open-label sertraline flexibly dosed to 100 mg (or escitalopram equivalent) to prospectively define treatment refractoriness (lack of remission). Phase 2 was a 6-week double-blind RCT of (1) increased-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) versus (2) continued SSRI plus placebo. Phase 3 was a 12-week RCT of added cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to "medication optimization" with SSRI plus clonazepam. Primary endpoints were remission and change in Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the intent-to-treat sample in each phase.

Results

In phase 1, 20.5% (8/39) of the patients achieved remission, and only baseline severity predicted endpoint PDSS score (beta [SE] = 1.04 [0.15], t = 6.76, P < .001). In phase 2, increasing the SSRI dose did not result in greater improvement or remission rates (placebo 15% [n = 2] vs increased dose 9% [n = 1]: Fisher exact test P = NS). In phase 3, remission was minimal (medication optimization = 11% [n = 1]; CBT = 10% [n = 1]), with a lack of group difference in PDSS score reduction (t(17) = 0.51, P > .60) consistent with a small effect size (d = 0.24).

Conclusions

Although power was limited and larger studies are needed, we failed to find evidence for greater benefit of increased SSRI dose versus continuation of current dose for panic disorder symptomatic after 6 weeks at moderate dose. Further, augmentation with CBT or medication optimization with clonazepam augmentation in nonremitted panic after 12 weeks of an SSRI did not differ, suggesting that both are reasonable next-step options. However, low overall remission rates in this comorbid refractory population suggest that better predictors of response to specific treatments over time and additional interventions are needed.

### Early improvement predicts endpoint remission status in sertraline and placebo treatments of panic disorder [^114YmJYN]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

The early identification of likely remitters and non-remitters to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder may have important implications for clinical treatment decisions. To address this question, combined data from two fixed-dose and two flexible dose placebo-controlled studies of sertraline treatment of panic disorder were examined. Patients (N = 544) diagnosed with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, were treated with 50 mg of sertraline, 100 mg of sertraline, flexible dosages of sertraline, or placebo. Measures of early improvement included panic attack frequency (full + limited symptom attacks), anticipatory anxiety, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) Scale. Improvement as reflected in CGI-I ratings and change from baseline in the HAM-A at weeks 1, 2, and 3 significantly (P < 0.0001) predicted endpoint clinical remission (defined at endpoint as no full panic attacks and a CGI-Severity rating of 1 or 2). Improvements in panic attack frequency and anticipatory anxiety were not consistent predictors in multivariate predictive models. Receiver-Operator Curve analyses revealed good specificity (0.83) for change in CGI-I at week 2, and good sensitivity (0.82) for change in HAM-A at week 3. Predictive success for HAM-A and CGI-I was not significantly different for fixed vs. flexible dose sertraline treatment, nor for sertraline vs. placebo treatment. The use of ROC analyses for examination of early response as a predictor of final remission holds promise for aiding clinicians in decision making regarding the need for alternative or supplemental treatment approaches during the course of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder.

### Treatment of panic disorder [^1116FTyo]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia occurs commonly in patients in primary care settings. This article assesses multiple evidence-based reviews of effective treatments for panic disorder. Antidepressant medications successfully reduce the severity of panic symptoms and eliminate panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective in the treatment of panic disorder. The choice of medication is based on side effect profiles and patient preferences. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in treating panic disorder. Family physicians who are not trained in cognitive behavior therapy may refer patients with panic disorder to therapists with such training. Cognitive behavior therapy can be used alone or in combination with antidepressants to treat patients with panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are effective in treating panic disorder symptoms, but they are less effective than antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.

### What are the best medications for panic disorder?… [^113rDcJF]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Jennifer Middleton, MD, MPH Posted on February 28, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to worsen mental health around the world; early studies from 2020 were already showing an increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, and studies from 2021 demonstrate continued increasing rates of these mental health disorders. With several Food and Drug Administration approved medications for panic disorder currently available in the United States, choosing an initial medication for patients with a new diagnosis can feel overwhelming. A newly published systematic review and network meta-analysis sought to identify the most effective medications for panic disorder and found that sertraline and escitalopram had the best balance of benefit and adverse events. The systematic review and network meta-analysis examined the literature through June 2021 regarding pharmaceutical options for panic disorder.

The researchers looked for randomized controlled trials that included adults aged 18 years and older and cited outcomes related to either benefit and/or harm. They identified 87 studies with a total of 12, 800 participants and followed appropriate systematic review methodology to extract and synthesize the data. Most of the studies compared medication treatment to placebo, so the authors conducted a network meta-analysis to compare outcomes among the various medication classes and medications identified in the systematic review: Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values.

Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events. Medications are a useful tool for treating panic disorder, but cognitive behavioral therapy is very effective as well. Accessing support resources can be beneficial; I included a list of mental health resources developed during the pandemic in this blog post from 2020, and I especially like this one from the World Health Organization that emphasizes the importance of simple self-care habits.

### Long-term management of panic disorder [^112Ua63f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a chronic, disabling condition that is often associated with a need for long-term clinical treatment. While a variety of pharmacotherapy options, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, are effective in reducing symptoms in the acute phase, a significant number of patients do not fully respond to initial treatment, and a large majority of patients experience relapse after medication discontinuation. Optimal long-term treatment of panic disorder involves attention to adequate medication dosing and adequate duration of treatment to achieve maximum improvement before discontinuing. Recent reports suggest the efficacy of adjunctive pharmacotherapies and combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral therapy to improve treatment response. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness of these multifaceted treatment strategies among patients suffering from refractory panic disorder.

### Changes in anxiety sensitivity with pharmacotherapy for panic disorder [^113qSKkN]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

Fear of anxiety symptoms (anxiety sensitivity) has been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of panic disorder, and has been shown to improve with cognitive-behavioral treatment. The impact of pharmacotherapy on anxiety sensitivity is less clear. We administered the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) during a 12-week randomized controlled trial investigating the relative efficacy of paroxetine, paroxetine plus sustained clonazepam, and paroxetine plus brief clonazepam for patients with panic disorder. We found a mean reduction in ASI scores of 9.6 points, which correlated with symptomatic improvement, and did not differ significantly between groups. Our data provides further evidence that pharmacotherapy leads to significant acute reductions in fears of anxiety symptoms in patients with panic disorder, albeit at levels that may be somewhat less than the changes associated with CBT. Implications of these findings are discussed relative to optimizing pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to benzodiazepine or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability.

Main Results

We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.

### The pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders: a review of progress [^115WiC33]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders, as a group, are among the most common mental health conditions and frequently cause significant functional impairment. Both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic techniques are recognized to be effective management strategies. This review provides a discussion of the major classes of psychotropic medications investigated in clinical trials of the following anxiety disorders: panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Findings suggest that both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are useful first-line agents for most of the anxiety disorders, particularly given the frequent comorbidity with mood disorders. Highly serotonergic agents are preferred for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Other antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are generally reserved as second- and third-line strategies due to tolerability issues. Evidence for other agents, including anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics, suggests that they may have an adjunctive role to antidepressants in cases of treatment resistance, while azapirones have been used effectively for generalized anxiety disorder, and a substantial body of evidence supports benzodiazepine use in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite notable advances, many patients with anxiety disorders fail to adequately respond to existing pharmacologic treatments. Increased research attention should be focused on systematizing pharmacologic and combined pharmacologic-psychosocial strategies to address treatment resistance and developing novel treatments for anxiety disorders.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111uELGn]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Our study had several strengths. Our network meta-analysis considered a wide range of drug classes and agents. Both positive (remission) and negative (adverse events) outcomes were considered as part of the SUCRA and cluster ranking plot. Therefore, our findings represent treatments that provided high remission with low risk of adverse events.

Some limitations, however, could not be avoided. Most of the studies included are more than 20 years old and are affected by poor study methodology or reporting. Therefore, the overall risk of bias for all studies included some concerns to high risk, except for a single study, which had a low risk of bias. In addition, consistency assumption might be violated for network meta-analysis of adverse events, even excluding the studies with high inconsistency factors. Risk of bias and inconsistency were considered in the grading of evidence, which represented a low to moderate level for certainty of evidence. Moreover, most of the studies were of short duration (< 12 weeks); thus the effects of long term treatment require further investigation and the assessment of only short term effects might overemphasise the therapeutic effects of some drugs such as benzodiazepines without considering the potential harms of dependency and difficulties associated with discontinuation.

The comparison adjusted funnel plots were asymmetrical for some outcomes, which were more likely due to between treatment effect heterogeneity across studies rather than because of small study effects or missing studies. Noticeably for adverse events, the asymmetry in the funnel suggested that the four smaller studies were skewed towards more harmful effects. These studies also represented high treatment effects of benefit outcomes for remission, dropouts, and anxiety scores, suggesting a negative correlation between high benefits and high risk of adverse events.

Heterogeneity was also present for some pooled relative treatment effects. Although potential sources of heterogeneity were explored, in some instances they were not identified owing to missing data in some studies. In addition, seven studies had single zero cells for dropout and one study for adverse events, necessitating a continuity correction through the addition of 0.5 to all cells to allow the estimation of effect measures in the two stage network meta-analysis. A sensitivity analysis was also performed by applying a one stage approach, which has been reported as a more valid method for dealing with zero cells; results were consistent between the one stage and the two stage approaches used in this study (supplementary eTable 19).

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113r1t5q]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values. Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit (remission) with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events.

Comparison with other studies

Multiple options exist for the treatment of panic disorder; however, previous evidence has been mainly limited to placebo comparisons. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported benzodiazepines as the most efficacious in reducing panic attack frequency and anticipatory anxiety symptoms. Despite this clear evidence of benefit, benzodiazepines have not been recommended as the primary treatment option for panic disorder owing to potential adverse events (sedation, impaired memory and cognitive function, and increased risk of falling, especially in elderly people) and long term risks of dependency and withdrawals. This was consistent with our findings of associated risks.

SSRIs as a drug class have been recommended as the primary treatment for panic disorder. However, evidence or comparative studies to identify the most efficacious individual drug has been insufficient. In our study we specifically evaluated each SSRI to determine the most suitable as treatment for panic disorder. Our findings suggest that fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were more efficacious than placebo for achieving remission. SSRIs combined with β blockers, were associated with reduced anxiety symptoms and were top ranked for improving both anxiety and depression symptoms. SSRIs were not considered to be the best treatment for dropout, especially compared with benzodiazepines, which might be associated with a delayed onset of action that can take several weeks. When the benefits of remission and low adverse events are considered against potential agitation and early dropout, SSRIs were considered the best treatment option. Sertraline and escitalopram in particular offered the best balance between benefit (remission) and risk (adverse events) and were the top ranked among individual SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder. The findings for escitalopram, however, were based on a single study and as such should be interpreted with caution. There are concerns about using escitalopram at supratherapeutic dose (30 mg/day) as it has been shown to increase the risk of QT prolongation. However, the risk of serious arrythmias is rare when escitalopram is prescribed at treatment dosage (10–20 mg/day).

### CBT treatment delivery formats for panic disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1169QeBy]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1 shows selected characteristics of the included studies. Seventy-seven per cent of participants suffered from panic disorder associated with agoraphobia. The mean age was 37.3 years. The mean proportion of included women was 69.4%. All studies enroled adults between 18 and 65 years of age, with only one study including older adults (i.e. ⩾ 65 years) (Hendriks et al.). Studies were distributed over 31 years (1989–2020) and generally had their main endpoint evaluation around the 12th week of treatment (range: 1 to 24). The mean number of therapy sessions was approximately 10 (range: 1 to 19). Most participants were receiving medications during the treatment period: 68 RCTs (91.9% of the total) allowed various psychotropic drugs to be taken on top of the experimental and control treatments. However, the great majority of the RCTs enroled participants only if they had been on a stable dosage for at least 1–3 months, and upon agreement to keep the dosages constant throughout the treatment period. Most treatments were implemented following the guidance of a manual (72 RCTs, 97.3%) and were delivered by licensed or specifically trained and supervised therapists (61 RCTs, 82.4%) but treatment integrity was verified in only 25 studies (33.8%) (online Supplementary material appendix I). Thirty-nine studies (70.9%) employed scales specifically designed to capture panic disorder symptoms.

Table 1.
Characteristics of randomised controlled trials included in the systematic review and in each network of primary outcomes

Risk of bias of included studies

In most cases (40 RCTs, 54.2%) studies were considered to be at overall high risk of bias, for 25 (33.7%) studies there were 'some concerns', and 9 (12.1%) were judged to be at low risk of bias (online Supplementary material appendix J). The majority of the studies missed to adequately report the randomisation process, leading to 'some concerns' judgment in 58 studies (78.3%), 38 studies (51.5%) were judged to be at low risk of deviation from the intended interventions, for 45 (60.8%) there were no concerns of missing outcome data, 32 (43.2%) had low risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome, but only 7 (9.4%) were identified as having a low risk of bias in the selection of reported results.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115MP9y2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For other antidepressants, SNRIs, when compared with placebo, were more efficacious in attaining remission, similar for dropout, and had significantly more associated adverse events. However, SNRIs were ranked lower than SSRIs for achieving remission and adverse events and might represent a second line treatment option for panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants were found to be statistically superior to placebo for dropout, remission, anxiety, and depression scores but worse for adverse events. Despite their efficacy, tricyclic antidepressants are associated with adverse effects, which are further exacerbated when combined with benzodiazepines. As such, the clinical use of tricyclic antidepressants alone or combined with benzodiazepines is limited because of the extent of the associated adverse effects.

For additional treatment options not included in previous meta-analyses, monoamine oxidase inhibitors were found to be significantly superior to placebo for remission but were not different from placebo for other outcomes. However, monoamine oxidase inhibitors have severely limited use in real world practice given their adverse effects profile, increased risk of hypertensive crisis, and multiple drug interactions. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors did not show much effect compared with placebo, although some guidelines have recognised their use as a potential treatment option for panic disorder. Given the limited evidence available and lack of demonstrable benefit, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors might not be a suitable treatment for panic disorder. Evidence is also insufficient to recommend the use of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants given their associated high rate of drowsiness and weight gain, and this is in line with current recommendations from the American Psychological Association. Given the low quality of the studies with identified adverse effects, high dropout rate, and no demonstrable efficacy, buspirone should not be currently considered a viable treatment option for panic disorder.

### An integrative review of systematic reviews related to the management of breathlessness in respiratory illnesses [^115VgBYg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

With the exception of research into treatments for asthma and COPD, the majority of intervention studies, as reflected in our review, continue to focus on pharmacological approaches. We have included two reviews of non-pharmacological interventions for bronchiectasis, but in all other disease categories we found no further examples. More research should focus in the future on the management of breathlessness in respiratory diseases other than asthma and COPD.

As pharmacological treatments do not completely manage breathlessness and they have the added burden of side effects, it seems imperative that non-pharmacological interventions are seen as appropriate complementary interventions to standard pharmacological management, or even an alternative method in selected patients. Despite good evidence from the literature, many non-pharmacological interventions have not become mainstream and are not used in the rehabilitation of patients with respiratory diseases. New ways of thinking about evaluation research, and new combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions may be needed for symptoms like breathlessness that continue to impose a heavy burden of distress across a wide range of disease types.

There are also a number of non-pharmacological studies that have shown some promise, although conclusions are difficult due to the small sample sizes they have used and limited replication. Such interventions include oxygen, self-management approaches, breathing exercises, use of fans, acupuncture/acupressure, calorie controlled diet, selenium supplementation, approaches to reduce anxiety and panic, or those interventions that may be theoretically useful but for which no studies have been carried out so far (e.g. Alexander technique or other complementary therapies). Future research should focus on such promising approaches and provide a good evidence-base for practice.

### Initial severity and antidepressant efficacy for anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111kcpw1]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

3.3 Panic disorder

For PD, the model with the lowest AIC (38,267.2) contained the two‐way interaction between baseline severity and group, but because this term was not significant (p = 0.11), we preferred a more parsimonious model without the interaction and with an only marginally larger AIC (38,268.6 after removing two nonsignificant terms, see Supporting Information Table 3). This model indicated that the drug‐placebo difference was constant on the log scale of the negative binomial model and hence that the ratio of the endpoint number of panic attacks/2 weeks in the placebo group compared to the drug group was constant (2.46) on the original scale. Consequently, the absolute difference between drug and placebo groups actually increased with increasing severity (Figure 2). For participants experiencing two panic attacks/2 weeks at baseline, the estimated drug–placebo difference was 0.2 (95% CI: 0.2–0.3) (in favor of antidepressants) at week 10. This increased to 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3–0.6) for participants experiencing 10 panic attacks/2 weeks at baseline, 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7–1.2) for participants experiencing 20, and 4.7 (95% CI: 3.0–6.4) for participants experiencing 40 (Table 3).

### Second-stage treatments for relative nonresponders to cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia-continued cbt versus ssri: a randomized controlled trial [^113BbYWS]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy are efficacious for the short-term treatment of panic disorder. Less is known about the efficacy of these therapies for individuals who do not respond fully to short-term CBT.

Method

The current trial is a second-step stratified randomized design comparing two treatment conditions-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; paroxetine or citalopram; n = 34) and continued CBT (n = 24)-in a sample of individuals classified as treatment nonresponders to an initial course of CBT for panic disorder. Participants were randomized to 3 months of treatment and then followed for an additional 9 months. Only treatment responders after 3 months were maintained on the treatment until 12-month follow-up. Data analysis focused on panic disorder symptoms and achievement of response status across the first 3 months of treatment. Final follow-up data are presented descriptively.

Results

Participants in the SSRI condition showed significantly lower panic disorder symptoms as compared to continued CBT at 3 months. Results were similar when excluding individuals with comorbid major depression or analyzing the entire intent-to-treat sample. Group differences disappeared during 9-month naturalistic follow-up, although there was significant attrition and use of nonstudy therapies in both arms.

Conclusions

These data suggest greater improvement in panic disorder symptoms when switching to SSRI after failure to fully respond to an initial course of CBT. Future studies should further investigate relapse following treatment discontinuation for nonresponders who became responders.

### The management of panic disorder [^114ijhDE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The evidence for benzodiazepines in panic disorder is compelling; along with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), they are a standard treatment for panic and other anxiety disorders. However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations, and extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Because of their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.

### Paroxetine [^116csarF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Panic Disorder

The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was demonstrated in three 10- to 12-week multicenter, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Patients had PD (DSM-IIIR), with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating PD by at least 2 out of 3 measures of panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness score.

Study 1 was a 10-week dose-range finding study; patients received fixed doses of paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo. A statistically significant difference from placebo was observed only for the paroxetine 40 mg daily group. At endpoint, 76% of patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg daily were free of panic attacks, compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients.

Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily and placebo. At endpoint, 51% of paroxetine-treated patients were free of panic attacks compared to 32% of placebo-treated patients.

Study 3 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily to placebo in patients concurrently receiving standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. At endpoint, 33% of the paroxetine-treated patients showed a reduction to 0 or 1 panic attacks compared to 14% of placebo-treated patients.

In Studies 2 and 3, the mean paroxetine dose for completers at endpoint was approximately 40 mg daily.

Long-term efficacy of paroxetine in PD was demonstrated in an extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 10-week double-blind phase and during a 3-month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo in a 3-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients.

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.

Anxiety scores

Anxiety scores were reported in 39 studies (4112 participants), in which SSRIs versus placebo were the most common comparisons (nine studies, 1884 participants), followed by benzodiazepines versus placebo (seven studies, 771 participants) (supplementary eTable 7). Anxiety scores were measured by the Hamilton scale for anxiety in most studies (36/39) or alternatively the clinical anxiety scale (3/39).

Direct meta-analyses indicated anxiety scores associated with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and paroxetine were significantly lower than those associated with placebo, with corresponding unstandardised mean differences of −4.59 (95% confidence interval −6.39 to −2.80; I² = 45.6%), −5.41 (−9.71 to −1.11; I² = 73.75%), and −2.32 (−4.09 to −0.55; I² = 0%) (supplementary eFigure 13). Duration of panic disorder and percentage of patients with agoraphobia accounted for some heterogeneity in the comparison of benzodiazepines versus placebo (supplementary eTable 8 and eFigure 14).

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115RxPAn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines cover the range and aims of treatment for anxiety disorders. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and are presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision making in primary and secondary medical care. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and their carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting involving experts in anxiety disorders reviewed the main subject areas and considered the strength of evidence and its clinical implications. The guidelines were constructed after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence for recommendations was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of anxiety disorders and key steps in clinical management, including acute treatment, relapse prevention and approaches for patients who do not respond to first-line treatments.

### Identifying and treating panic disorder in primary care [^113TEqUf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Many individuals who experience a panic attack at some point in their lives will meet criteria for panic disorder. However, although most primary care physicians recognize broad-spectrum mood and anxiety disorders, they may not make a specific diagnosis such as major depressive disorder or panic disorder. Comorbid panic disorder and other anxiety conditions are a well-established phenomenon in depressive disorders and can have a negative impact on treatment and worsen prognosis. This negative impact underscores the importance of specifically identifying these disorders and their comorbidities. Although an analysis of other potential causes of presenting symptoms is at times indicated, diagnosis should be made positively by identifying the symptoms diagnostic of the anxiety conditions rather than negatively by eliminating other conditions. Treatment of patients with panic disorder can improve quality of life and productivity as well as reduce health care costs. Pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and collaborative relationships with patients and psychiatrists can all aid primary care physicians in providing acute and long-term treatment for patients with panic as well as other mood and anxiety disorders.

Remissions

Fifty studies (n = 9481 participants) reported remission. Supplementary eTable 1 presents the treatment comparisons and data used for pooling in direct meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. The most common treatment comparisons were SSRIs versus placebo (13 studies, 2295 participants), followed by benzodiazepines versus placebo (11/2061).

Results of direct meta-analyses (supplementary eFigure 3) showed significant effects on remission for tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine compared with placebo, with risk ratios of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.47; I² = 0%), 1.49 (1.36 to 1.63; I² = 13.18%), 1.42 (1.12 to 1.79; I² = 55.77%), 1.30 (1.10 to 1.54; I² = 0%), and 1.26 (1.08 to 1.48, I² = 52.02%), respectively. No significant difference on remission was found between benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants (0.99, 0.94 to 1.04; I² = 0%). A meta-regression identified the percentage of women and duration of treatment and panic disorder as potential sources of heterogeneity for venlafaxine versus placebo and paroxetine versus placebo (supplementary eTable 2). A subgroup analysis indicated paroxetine was associated with a significant improvement in remission when the duration of treatment was > 10 weeks, with moderate heterogeneity (supplementary eFigure 4).

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^111phfXR]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of paroxetine was established in two 12-week trials with obsessive compulsive outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-IIIR category of obsessive compulsive disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

Obsessive compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable.

Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 6-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients assigned to paroxetine showed a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Panic Disorder

Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.

### Efficacy of 2 interventions for panic disorder in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain [^117ANacU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Brief and efficacious interventions for panic disorder (PD) in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) for chest pain are essential. This study assessed the effects of 2 interventions for this population: a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy delivered by psychologists, and a 6-month pharmacologic treatment initiated and managed by the ED physician. The relative efficacy of both interventions was also examined.

Materials and Methods

Forty-seven adult patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for PD upon presentation to the ED were assigned to 1 of 3 experimental conditions: a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (7 sessions), a pharmacologic intervention (paroxetine; 6 months); and a usual care control condition. The primary outcome was severity of PD on Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and secondary outcomes included measures of PD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and cardiac anxiety. Outcome measures were taken at baseline, postintervention, as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.

Results

Patients receiving either intervention demonstrated significant reductions of PD severity (P = 0.012), frequency of panic attacks (P = 0.048), and depressive symptoms (P = 0.027).

Conclusion

Taken together, these findings suggest that empirically validated interventions for PD initiated in an ED setting can be feasible and efficacious, and future studies should assess their impact on both the direct (ie, health care utilization) and indirect (ie, lost productivity) costs associated with PD morbidity in this population.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^11197pHx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with panic disorder — Co-occurring panic disorder may respond to the SRI used for OCD or to CBT for panic. When panic disorder or a history of panic attacks is present, SRI treatment should be initiated at low doses and slowly titrated upward over a period of weeks to avoid initiating or exacerbating panic attacks. Alternatively, an SRI can be started at usual doses combined with a benzodiazepine at antipanic doses for the first month or so and then the benzodiazepine can be tapered over weeks.

### Antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults [^113Te87J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. Panic disorder is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, antidepressants and benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for panic disorder. Different classes of antidepressants have been compared; and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consider antidepressants (mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In addition to antidepressants, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for the treatment of panic disorder.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the effects of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults.

Search Methods

The Specialised Register of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMDCTR) to 11 September 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. We contacted experts in this field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind randomised controlled trials allocating adult patients with panic disorder to antidepressants or benzodiazepines versus any other active treatment with antidepressants or benzodiazepines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were entered in RevMan 5.3 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

Thirty-five studies, including 6785 participants overall (of which 5365 in the arms of interest (antidepressant and benzodiazepines as monotherapy)) were included in this review; however, since studies addressed many different comparisons, only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes. We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressants and benzodiazepines in terms of response rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.47; participants = 215; studies = 2). Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit for benzodiazepines compared to antidepressants in terms of dropouts due to any cause, even if confidence interval (CI) ranges from almost no difference to benefit with benzodiazepines (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.63; participants = 1449; studies = 7). We found some evidence suggesting that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are better tolerated than TCAs (when looking at the number of patients experiencing adverse effects). We failed to find clinically significant differences between individual benzodiazepines. The majority of studies did not report details on random sequence generation and allocation concealment; similarly, no details were provided about strategies to ensure blinding. The study protocol was not available for almost all studies so it is difficult to make a judgment on the possibility of outcome reporting bias. Information on adverse effects was very limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified studies are not sufficient to comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. The majority of studies enrolled a small number of participants and did not provide data for all the outcomes specified in the protocol. For these reasons most of the analyses were underpowered and this limits the overall completeness of evidence. In general, based on the results of the current review, the possible role of antidepressants and benzodiazepines should be assessed by the clinician on an individual basis. The choice of which antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine is prescribed can not be made on the basis of this review only, and should be based on evidence of antidepressants and benzodiazepines efficacy and tolerability, including data from placebo-controlled studies, as a whole. Data on long-term tolerability issues associated with antidepressants and benzodiazepines exposure should also be carefully considered. The present review highlights the need for further higher-quality studies comparing antidepressants with benzodiazepines, which should be conducted with high-methodological standards and including pragmatic outcome measures to provide clinicians with useful and practical data. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^115uLCj5]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Areas for additional treatment research in pediatric anxiety — the AHRQ/Mayo review yielded insufficient information to draw conclusions about benefits or harms in several domains, so treatment statements for these domains are not offered and research is urgently needed. Priority gaps include circumstances suggesting preferential use of SSRIs or CBT, preferential sequencing of SSRIs and CBT, treatment effect modifiers, use of non-CBT psychotherapies, use of benzodiazepines, long-term safety risks of pharmacologic treatment, and effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments in underserved populations and minorities. Additional evidence limitations include a relatively small body of evidence especially for medication studies, brief follow-up, heterogeneity in rating scales, sparse reporting of mediators and moderators, poor representation of very young children, young adults, and multiracial youths, paucity or lack of medication studies for selective mutism, specific phobias, panic, or agoraphobia as the primary disorder, variable methods for reporting treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, and insufficient data to assess risk of suicidal behavior.

### Understanding and treating panic disorder in the primary care setting [^113HxWmD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

According to studies, the median prevalence of panic disorder in the primary care setting is 4%. Rates are higher among certain patient populations, such as those with cardiac (20% to 50%) or gastrointestinal presentations (28% to 40%). Consequently, patients with panic disorder are high utilizers of medical services and are heavily represented among patients classified as high health care utilizers, compared with other psychiatric or non-psychiatric groups. Despite its frequency in the primary care setting, panic disorder is significantly under-recognized by medical providers. Corresponding with inadequate recognition is the substantial proportion of these patients who fail to receive appropriate treatment (pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy). Most experts have concluded that panic disorder is poorly managed in the primary care setting because of the process of care and patient engagement. In terms of process of care, primary care practice still operates on an acute disease model (leaving no time for initial patient education or follow-up), which is a poor fit for the management of chronic diseases. Insufficient patient engagement in treatment (i.e., being involved in the treatment process, "buying into" rationale for treatment, and being willing to collaborate with clinician and adhere to recommendations) is the second important contributor to inadequate treatment. Use of a chronic disease self-management approach would enhance treatment of panic disorder. This model requires that patients, in collaboration with the health care provider/system, take day-to-day responsibility for managing their illness by doing 3 things: adhering to recommended medical management, adopting improved health habits/coping skills, and assisting in ongoing monitoring of illness status/change. Future approaches to treating panic disorder in primary care would be enhanced by including assessments of patient beliefs and preferences, spending more time in preparing the patient for treatment, utilizing a simple pharmacotherapy algorithm, utilizing simple rating scales to monitor outcomes, and training providers in brief CBT interventions.

### Pharmacological treatments in panic disorder in adults: a network meta-analysis [^112XVSfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. The main symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness. Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (the sensation that the world is unreal). Panic disorder is common in the general population with a prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

Objectives

To compare, via network meta-analysis, individual drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) or placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To rank drug classes for panic disorder (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and benzodiazepines (BDZs) and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, CDSR, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and PsycINFO to 26 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people aged 18 years or older of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We included trials that compared the effectiveness of antidepressants and benzodiazepines with each other or with a placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data and continuous data as risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD): response to treatment (i.e. substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), total number of dropouts due to any reason (as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability: dichotomous outcome), remission (i.e. satisfactory end state as defined by global judgement of the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), panic symptom scales and global judgement (continuous outcome), frequency of panic attacks (as recorded, for example, by a panic diary; continuous outcome), agoraphobia (dichotomous outcome). We assessed the certainty of evidence using threshold analyses.

Main Results

Overall, we included 70 trials in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each arm, and the total sample size per study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty-five studies included sample sizes of over 100 participants. There is evidence from 48 RCTs (N = 10,118) that most medications are more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular, diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect, with diazepam, alprazolam and clonazepam ranking as the most effective. We found heterogeneity in most of the comparisons, but our threshold analyses suggest that this is unlikely to impact the findings of the network meta-analysis. Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications are associated with either a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout rate compared to placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all the medications examined. Thirty-two RCTs (N = 8569) were included in the remission outcome. Most medications were more effective than placebo, namely desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine, imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine, and their effects were clinically meaningful. Amongst these medications, desipramine and alprazolam were ranked highest. Thirty-five RCTs (N = 8826) are included in the continuous outcome reduction in panic scale scores. Brofaromine, clonazepam and reboxetine had the strongest reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but results were based on either one trial or very small trials. Forty-one RCTs (N = 7853) are included in the frequency of panic attack outcome. Only clonazepam and alprazolam showed a strong reduction in the frequency of panic attacks compared to placebo, and were ranked highest. Twenty-six RCTs (N = 7044) provided data for agoraphobia. The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam, compared to placebo. For the pooled intervention classes, we examined the two primary outcomes (response and dropout). The classes of medication were: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs. For the response outcome, all classes of medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most effective, followed by BDZs and MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked lowest. When we compared classes of medication with each other for the response outcome, we found no difference between classes. Comparisons between MAOIs and TCAs and between BDZs and TCAs also suggested no differences between these medications, but the results were imprecise. For the dropout outcome, BDZs were the only class associated with a lower dropout compared to placebo and were ranked first in terms of tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking, TCAs are on average second to BDZs, followed by SNRIs, then by SSRIs and lastly by MAOIs. BDZs were associated with lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs. The quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was moderate, while the quality of the studies comparing BDZs with placebo and antidepressants was low.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of efficacy, SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs may be effective, with little difference between classes. However, it is important to note that the reliability of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of the studies, with all having unclear or high risk of bias across multiple domains. Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small but significant advantage in terms of tolerability (incidence of dropouts) over other classes.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11354oeo]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk of bias of individual studies

Two reviewers (NC and KC) independently assessed risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2.0). Five domains were assessed: bias arising from the randomisation process, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in measurement of the outcome, and bias in selection of reported results.

We graded each risk of bias domain as low, some concern, or high risk. If all the domains for a study were low risk we judged the overall risk of bias as low. In addition, if multiple domains were some concern, we judged the overall risk of bias as high. Disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by a third researcher (TA) through consensus.

Data synthesis

When at least three randomised controlled trials compared similar interventions and outcomes, we performed a direct meta-analysis. For continuous outcomes, we estimated relative treatment effects for individual randomised controlled trials using an unstandardised mean difference if studies used the same outcome measures; otherwise we used a standardised mean difference. A risk ratio was estimated for dichotomous outcomes. The unstandardised mean differences, standardised mean differences, and risk ratios were pooled using the Hartung-Knapp restricted maximum likelihood method. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and I² statistic. If heterogeneity was present (P < 0.10 or I² ≥ 25%), we explored heterogeneity using meta-regression by including possible sources of heterogeneity (mean age, duration of treatment and disease, percentage of women, and presence of agoraphobia) on a one-by-one basis within the meta-regression. We undertook subgroup analyses if the individual factor decreased the τ² or I² values by at least 30% from those of the meta-regression.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112iQHEG]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA).

Relevant studies were identified from Medline through PubMed and Embase from inception to 17 June 2021. The search terms were constructed according to population (eg, panic disorder, panic) and intervention domains (eg, benzodiazepine, SSRI, SNRI). Supplementary appendix 1 provides details of the search terms and search strategies. For searching in PubMed, we used the filter function to select only randomised controlled trials and phase I-IV clinical trials. ClinicalTrials.gov was also searched to identify ongoing trials. In addition, to identify other relevant studies we reviewed the reference lists of included studies and previous meta-analyses.

Randomised controlled trials published in any language were eligible that included adults aged ≥ 18 years with panic disorder diagnosed in accordance with the Feighner criteria, DSM third (and revised third) to fifth revisions, or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health problems; compared any pairs of interventions involving drugs for the treatment of panic disorder, with no treatment (eg, placebo or waitlist); and had any of the outcomes of remission, dropout, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and adverse events. We excluded studies that compared different dosages of the same drugs, such as alprazolam 0.5 mg/day v 1 mg/day, did not report sufficient data necessary for pooling (eg, patient numbers by treatment and outcome groups in contingency tables for dichotomous outcomes or mean and standard deviation values by treatment groups for continuous outcomes), or had concurrent psychotherapy with drug interventions. For multi-arm studies comparing different dosages of the same drug with other drugs or placebo, we only used data from the arm with a common or recommended dosage. Two reviewers (NC and KC) independently selected studies based on titles and abstracts; if eligibility was still undetermined, they reviewed full study texts. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus with a third researcher (TA).

Interventions of interest

Interventions of interest for panic disorder included tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SNRIs, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (eg, mirtazapine), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (eg, reboxetine), benzodiazepines, noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (eg, buspirone), and β adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114zVftx]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Furthermore, we excluded studies that compared concurrent psychotherapy with drug interventions. Therefore, the efficacy of combined psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy could not be estimated in our study. Lastly, in our network meta-analysis, some comparisons were represented by lower numbers of studies or patients, or both, therefore limiting the precision of the network meta-analysis findings. A predictive interval plot was, however, considered based on current findings reported and any future additional studies.

Policy implications

Further studies should consider direct comparisons of more recent SSRIs in a randomised controlled trial design. Although escitalopram was rated highly, this was based on only a single trial and further evidence is required to confirm this finding. In addition, the comparison between benefits and harms used in our study was based on the findings from the cluster ranking plots, which failed to sufficiently consider any weightings to the correlation and actual magnitude of the treatment benefits and associated harms. As such, further investigations on the individual weightings of associated risk and benefit assessment would prove beneficial, although these were beyond the scope of the current study. Furthermore, an economic evaluation to determine the cost-benefit of sertraline and escitalopram as the drugs of choice would inform policy makers beyond the clinical risk benefit determination. As our study focused on short term outcomes, exploration of long term outcomes associated with SSRIs would also be helpful.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that SSRIs offer important benefit with low risk for drug treatment of panic disorder. When individual agents were explored, sertraline and escitalopram were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events when compared with other SSRIs. The findings should be interpreted with caution, however, as the results were based on evidence with moderate to very low levels of certainty.

Clustered ranking plot

The SUCRA clustered ranking plot for remission and adverse events indicated SSRIs as the most efficacious (66.4%) treatment with the least risk of adverse events (58.5%) for panic disorder (fig 6). Other drug classes, such as noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and SNRIs also showed promising efficacy in remission and acceptability of risk for adverse events. In contrast, buspirone showed low efficacy in remission despite high treatment acceptability.

Fig 6
Cluster ranking plot of surface under cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) of remission and adverse drug events. The plot is based on cluster analysis of SUCRA values. Each plot represents SUCRA values for two outcomes (ie, remission and adverse events). Treatments in the upper right corner are more effective (ie, increased remission rate) and safer (ie, lower risk of adverse events) compared with the other treatments. BZD = benzodiazepine; MAOI = monoamine oxidase inhibitor; NaSSA = noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant; NRI = noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; SNRI = serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor; TCA = tricyclic antidepressant

Since the clustered ranking plot identified SSRIs as the treatment with the best balance between remission and risk of adverse events and given current clinical practice recommendation of SSRIs as the preferred treatment for panic disorder, we further explored the performance of individual SSRIs for balancing benefit and risk. Supplementary eAppendix 3 provides details on data analysis, tables, and SUCRA values of remission rates and adverse events. According to SUCRA and clustered ranking plots for individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram represented the most efficacious agents with the lowest risk of adverse events. Fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and fluoxetine indicated favourable efficacy but higher risk of adverse events, whereas citalopram showed minimal efficacy in remission and high risk of adverse events (fig 6).

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^1121JuDE]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The new mhGAP anxiety recommendations have been developed according to the WHO's guideline development process. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) was convened and was responsible for making recommendations based on systematic review and appraisal of available evidence. Seven PICO questions were identified based on expert consensus to guide evidence retrieval, review, synthesis and assessment using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results were then reviewed by the GDG to produce recommendations. The mhGAP anxiety guidelines address the role of psychological interventions, pharmacotherapies, stress management, physical exercise, and collaborative care for adults with GAD or PD.

The guidelines recommend brief structured psychological interventions based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for adults with GAD and/or PD. Most available evidence on the psychological treatment of GAD actually regards CBT, with third‐wave CBT also frequently studied. Evidence indicates that guided self‐help is likely to be more effective than unguided self‐help, and that specialist delivered interventions are likely to be more effective than those provided by non‐specialists, while there appear to be minimal to no differences between digital and face‐to‐face interventions, and between individual and group modalities.

The guidelines also recommend the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for GAD and PD, while tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are recommended only for PD in cases where SSRIs are unavailable. No specific differentiation in terms of effectiveness or adverse effects emerged among the reviewed SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. There was insufficient evidence for the use of TCAs in a‐dults with GAD.

Stress management techniques, including relaxation and/or mindfulness training, are also recommended for adults with GAD and/or PD, as is engagement in structured physical exercise. The guidelines recommend against the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of adults with GAD and/or PD. These drugs should only be used for severe, acute anxiety symptoms and only as a very short‐term measure (3‐7 days). Finally, the guidelines recommend the consideration of collaborative care for adults with depression and/or anxiety and physical health conditions.

### Psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults [^111d5kYR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well-being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up-to-date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross-checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random-effects model throughout.

Main Results

We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. None of the studies reported long-term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short-term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low-quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short-term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low-quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short-term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short-term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short-term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low-quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low-quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer-term, quality-controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short-term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. Future studies should examine the long-term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^111gz9zA]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Panic Disorder –The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1–3) of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-III-R), with or without agoraphobia.

Studies 1 and 2 were 10-week flexible dose studies. Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and then patients were dosed in a range of 50–200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean Sertraline hydrochloride doses for completers to 10 weeks were 131 mg/day and 144 mg/day, respectively, for Studies 1 and 2. In these studies, Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline in panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. The difference between Sertraline hydrochloride and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 2 panic attacks per week in both studies.

Study 3 was a 12-week fixed-dose study, including Sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride experienced a significantly greater reduction in panic attack frequency than patients receiving placebo. Study 3 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^116dwH2K]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The GDG highlighted a number of key considerations in making these recommendations. First, the GDG emphasized that the WHO's process for guideline development does not intend to make recommendations that cover the totality of interventions proven effective in a given area. Instead, the process focuses on areas or interventions where evidence is most substantial or where there have historically been controversies or the need for a policy change. Thus, the GDG noted that these initial guidelines may not encompass the totality of interventions that have been proven effective for GAD or PD.

Additionally, the GDG noted a limitation in the fact that the majority of evidence available comes from research conducted in high‐income countries, and highlighted the need for increased distribution of research funding to institutions in low‐ and middle‐income countries. It also noted considerable evidence for models of care, such as task‐sharing and training and supervision of non‐specialists, that are particularly appropriate for those countries. However, the GDG also specifically noted the challenges in human resources and health worker time and capacity to deliver certain interventions, particularly structured psychological interventions or collaborative care models.

Third, the GDG noted the need for further research to explore the longer‐term impact of interventions on symptoms, functioning and other key outcomes, while also recognizing the substantial evidence for symptom reduction in medium to short term. Fourth, the GDG made particular note of the need to consider cultural variability and individual preferences in applying recommendations in practice. For instance, the GDG highlighted the value of physical exercise for anxiety disorders generally, while also noting the need to consider daily habits of communities receiving care, such as when physical exertion is already a part of their daily life (e.g. farmers, manual labor workers).

Fifth, the GDG emphasized the need to ensure adequate training and follow‐up supervision for non‐specialists in any setting. Sixth, the GDG discussed the frequent over‐prescription of benzodiazepines for anxiety symptoms, particularly in non‐specialist care settings, and emphasized the risks associated with these prescriptions. Lastly, the GDG described the importance of adaptation for delivery of these interventions, including the use of innovative and digital technologies.

### Panic disorder [^115PjAE5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Panic disorder occurs in up to 3% of the adult population at some time, and is associated with other psychiatric and personality disorders, and with drug and alcohol abuse. The risk of suicide and attempted suicide has been found to be higher in people with panic disorder than in people with other psychiatric illness, including depression.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for panic disorder? What are the effects of drug treatments for panic disorder? What are the effects of combined drug and psychological treatments for panic disorder? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 36 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, breathing retraining, brief dynamic psychotherapy, buspirone, client-centred therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (alone or plus drug treatments), cognitive restructuring, couple therapy, exposure (external or interoceptive), insight-orientated therapy, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), psychoeducation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), self-help, and tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine).

### Potential effectiveness and safety of olanzapine in refractory panic disorder [^115iDRQd]. Depression and Anxiety (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder. Despite treatment advances, refractory panic disorder requires novel interventions. One such pharmacologic intervention with theoretical and case study support includes olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine medication currently approved for schizophrenia in the United States. Ten people with refractory DSM-IV diagnosed panic disorder completed an 8-week, open-label, flexible-dose clinical trial. Baseline, in-treatment, and end-of-treatment data for panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, phobic avoidance, and impairment were collected. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Refractory panic disorder patients required a wide dose range averaging 12.3 mg/day of olanzapine to significantly improve or ablate panic attacks. On the average, number of attacks decreased from 6.1/week at baseline to 1.1/week at the end of treatment, and anticipatory anxiety from 32% of the day to 8% of the day. At treatment end, 5 of 10 participants (50%) were panic free, 4 (40%) had one attack in the previous week, 1 (10%) had seven attacks in the previous week, and 6 of 10 participants (60%) were anticipatory anxiety free. There were also statistically and clinically significant improvements in impairment over the course of the trial. There were no significant changes in vital signs, emergent side effects, or average weight, although 6 of 10 people did gain weight. Olanzapine is potentially effective and safe in panic disorder. Due to study limitations, further clinical trials are needed to demonstrate effectiveness.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paroxetine) [^114EX9iX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Panic Disorder

The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was demonstrated in three 10 to 12-week multicenter, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Patients had PD (DSM-IIIR), with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating PD by at least 2 out of 3 measures of panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness score.

Study 1 was a 10-week dose-range finding study; patients received fixed doses of paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo. A statistically significant difference from placebo was observed only for the paroxetine 40 mg daily group. At endpoint, 76% of patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg daily were free of panic attacks, compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients.

Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily and placebo. At endpoint, 51% of paroxetine-treated patients were free of panic attacks compared to 32% of placebo-treated patients.

Study 3 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily to placebo in patients concurrently receiving standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. At endpoint, 33% of the paroxetine-treated patients showed a reduction to 0 or 1 panic attacks compared to 14% of placebo-treated patients. In Studies 2 and 3, the mean paroxetine dose for completers at endpoint was approximately 40 mg daily.

Long-term efficacy of paroxetine in PD was demonstrated in an extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 10-week double-blind phase and during a 3-month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo in a 3-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients.

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^1173kicM]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

2.4. Panic Disorder

Initial Treatment) – In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Panic Disorder, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 10 mg/day. After one week, the dose should be increased to 20 mg/day. The most frequently administered dose in the 2 flexible-dose clinical trials was 20 mg/day.

A dose increase may be considered after several weeks if no clinical improvement is observed. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in patients with Panic Disorder.

Maintenance/Continuation Treatment) – While there are no systematic studies that answer the question of how long to continue fluoxetine, panic disorder is a chronic condition and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.

### Recognition and treatment of panic disorder [^112xyDJi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a common, disabling condition that affects 3% to 5% of the world's population. Although it is treatable, panic disorder goes unrecognized and untreated in many patients. Patients with panic disorder have an increased risk for other psychiatric disorders, especially other anxiety disorders, and panic disorder is associated with other medical conditions such as migraines, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Clinicians treating panic disorder must be able to recognize the disorder, differentiate it from other disorders in which panic attacks are part of the symptomatology, and map out an individualized treatment plan for each patient. This presentation discusses the importance of collaboration between doctor and patient and details available treatment options, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114SK5jS]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The lifetime prevalence of the common psychological problem known as panic disorder is between 1% and 5%. Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks associated with several comorbid psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditionssuch as anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular diseasesand impairment of social, work, and family functioning. Agoraphobia is a strong fear or anxiety provoked by real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations and is often associated with panic disorder. Successive revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV) provide similar definitions of panic disorder, refined with each new edition; but in the fifth revision (DSM-5) panic disorder and agoraphobia have been defined individually.

Several drug treatments are available for panic disorder, including tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Findings from previous systematic reviews and direct meta-analyses suggest these treatments are more effective in reducing panic symptoms than placebo, but tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines are linked with a significantly higher risk of adverse events. As a result several guidelines recommend SSRIs as the primary treatment owing to their preferable long term safety over benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which SSRI is most efficacious and is associated with the lowest risk of adverse events given the limited availability of direct comparisons between SSRIs and other drug classes.

### Acid-base dysregulation and chemosensory mechanisms in panic disorder: a translational update [^114Z2odr]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Panic disorder (PD) is characterized by spontaneous and recurrent panic attacks that consist of incapacitating periods of acute-onset respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, autonomic and cognitive symptoms. PD — which occurs in 6% of Americans — typically begins in the second decade of lifeand exhibits a peak prevalence in the third and fourth decades of life. Thus, this condition is second only to major depressive disorder in terms of associated debility among psychiatric conditions in the United States. Importantly, PD also represents an independent risk factor for suicidality in diagnostically and demographically heterogeneous clinical populationsand increases the risk of developing other anxiety disorders and secondary mood disorders. Yet, many patients suffering from PD are not clinically identified and frequently, do not receive even minimally effective treatment. Even still, available psychopharmacologic treatments (for example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines) and psychotherapies (for example, cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy) or the combination of psychotherapy+pharmacotherapy are often only modestly efficacious (for example, Cohen's d = 0.4–0.6), and in some cases (for example, benzodiazepines) may be associated with treatment-specific side effects or risks such as sedation or the risk of dependence or tolerance.

### Anxiety disorders: a review [^115bhSGJ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning.

Observations

Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.55 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.76 to -0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, -0.30 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39; small to medium effect, 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^116JbLEp]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Panic Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder in adults, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in three 10–12 week trials in adult panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-III-R category of panic disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

### What to do when SSRIs fail: eight strategies for optimizing treatment of panic disorder [^116WKoVs]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drug of choice for treatment of patients with panic disorder. Most patients have a favorable response to SSRI therapy; however, 30 percent will not be able to tolerate these drugs or will have an unfavorable or incomplete response. Strategies to improve management of such patients include optimizing SSRI dosing (starting at a low dose and slowly increasing the dose to reach the target dose) and ensuring an adequate trial before switching to a different drug. Benzodiazepines should be avoided but, when necessary, may be used for a short duration or may be used long-term in patients for whom other treatments have failed. Slower-onset, longer-acting benzodiazepines are preferred. All patients should be encouraged to try cognitive behavior therapy. Augmentation therapy should be considered in patients who do not have a complete response. Drugs to consider for use in augmentation therapy include benzodiazepines, buspirone, beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and valproate sodium.

Abstract

Objective

To identify drug classes and individual selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with high rates of remission and low risk of adverse events in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Embase, Medline, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 17 June 2021.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

Randomised controlled trials that included adults aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of panic disorder, compared drugs used to treat the panic disorder, and measured the outcomes of interest, including remissions, dropouts, and adverse events.

Methods

Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. Direct meta-analyses were performed using random effects models. A two stage network meta-analysis with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of drug classes and individual SSRIs.

Results

87 studies including a total of 12 800 participants and 12 drug classes were eligible for inclusion. Almost all the studies (86/87) had some concern or were at high risk of bias. Network meta-analysis of remission with consistent results indicated that tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) were associated with significantly higher remission rates than placebo, with risk ratios of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.54), 1.47 (1.36 to 1.60), 1.30 (1.00 to 1.69), 1.38 (1.26 to 1.50), and 1.27 (1.12 to 1.45), respectively. SUCRAs identified benzodiazepines (84.5%, mean rank = 2.4), tricyclic antidepressants (68.7%, 3.8), and SSRIs (66.4%, 4.0) as the top three best treatments for remission. However, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and SSRIs were also significantly associated with increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo, with risk ratios of 1.79 (1.47 to 2.19), 1.76 (1.50 to 2.06), and 1.19 (1.01 to 1.41), respectively. Consistency assumption of adverse events was upheld but could still be present on removal of studies with high percentages of women participants and those with agoraphobia. A SUCRA cluster ranking plot considering both remission and adverse events among all drug classes indicated that SSRIs were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. Among individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram provided high remission with an acceptable risk of adverse events.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that SSRIs provide high rates of remission with low risk of adverse events for the treatment of panic disorder. Among SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. The findings were, however, based on studies of moderate to very low certainty levels of evidence, mostly as a result of within study bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of the findings reported.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders [^115Tc4CR]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illness and include disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are both effective treatments for anxiety disorders, with efficacy between 60% and 85%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are first-line pharmacologic treatment for GAD, PD, and SAD. Recommendations for treating pediatric and geriatric populations vary slightly, but first-line treatments remain the same. Recent advancements in the treatment of anxiety disorders are limited although research has discovered novel pathways, which may lead to additional treatment options in the future.

### Designing M-health interventions for precision mental health support [^11664PCJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, the best times to offer an intervention option for inhibiting a craving or overcoming an anxious thought (best offered in moments of crisis) are not similar across individuals, and the decision point times have to be selected at an individual level. In this scenario, since we might not have prior knowledge of when these moments might be, or the knowledge we have suggests substantial variance from person to person, choosing as many decision points over time as possible would be the best course of action. For example, the decision points for interventions that are best practiced during a panic attack are best chosen at a minute resolution, as panic attacks can arise spontaneously.

The choice of decision points in an MRT is critical as the interventions may only be potentially delivered at those time points. This constraint limits learning if individuals are either not receptive, or not in the required state at the chosen time points.

Randomising: when and what?

Several papers elaborate in detail how to calculate power and sample size for an MRT. The objectives of the MRT, coupled with sample size, should inform which intervention options should be randomised at which time points. In addition, the current state of the individual restricts which intervention options are appropriate. For example, if the individual's context is 'driving a vehicle', the only usable intervention option is 'not to interrupt'. Alternatively, if the current context is 'walking', intervention options that suggest 'to extend current walking activity' may be suitable for experimenting. We should only randomise at time points when it is possible to intervene with contextually appropriate intervention options.

Furthermore, how much burden individuals are willing to tolerate and when should be considered while determining the probability of randomisation. Intervention options that pose a high burden on individuals should be randomised to be offered less frequently over time. For example, a 60-min intervention activity might be more appropriate when offered once every 2–3 days, while a brief 2-min activity could be offered a few times each day. Equally, if a particular intervention type provides the same or similar content at all time points and contexts, there is a risk of habituation. Intervention options that are less tailored to the individual should also be randomised at a lower rate to reduce burden and habituation, as there is ample evidence to suggest that greater personalisation increases engagement –.

### Pharmacological interventions for persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) [^113NVxPQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

Given the uncertainty in the pathogenesis of PPPD, at present no clear mechanism of action has been established for SSRIs and SNRIs. Possible modes of action may include altering hyperexcitability, or improving psychological symptoms (such as anxiety) that are present in many people with PPPD, or they may have direct effects on the widespread balance network in the brain.

SSRIs act by preventing serotonin reabsorption by neurons, increasing serotonin levels in the brain. SNRIs have a similar mode of action, but inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. Serotonin receptors are found in the vestibular pathways within the brain (Balaban 2002), and there may consequently be direct actions of SSRIs and SNRIs on balance.

It is also recognised that many individuals with chronic dizziness have associated symptoms, such as anxiety, mood disturbance and panic attacks. The use of SSRIs and SNRIs in PPPD may help to alleviate some of these symptoms, with resulting improvement in quality of life.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. PPPD was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with vestibular migraine and Ménière's disease).

The impact on quality of life, and the absence of national or international management guidelines to recommend treatment strategies, make it important to review the evidence available to manage this condition. At present, there is no guidance available for healthcare professionals and patients to identify the possible benefits or harms of different treatment options. In this review, we aim to summarise the current evidence for pharmacological treatments for this condition; non‐pharmacological therapies are addressed in another review (Webster 2022a).

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111Eyccg]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

A two stage frequentist network meta-analysis approach was applied. For each study we estimated a relative treatment effect (unstandardised and standardised mean differences and risk ratios) along with variance-covariance. Then we pooled these relative treatment effects across studies using a random effect multivariate meta-analysis with a consistency model. To deal with studies with zero events we applied a continuity correction by adding 0.5 to all cells. A common between study variation (τ²) was assumed for all relative treatment comparisons, in which the τ² was classified as low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high if it was < 0.4, 0.4–0.16, 0.16–0.36, and > 0.36, respectively, for binary outcomes. We ranked the probability of treatments being the best — associated with increasing efficacy and decreasing adverse events — and ranked each by a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). SUCRA is a numerical presentation of the overall treatment ranking, which ranges from 0 (low rank) to 100% (top rank). We constructed a cluster plot of SUCRA values for remission and adverse events to assess benefit and risk simultaneously. In addition, to evaluate the SSRI that provided high remission rate and low risk of adverse events, we produced SUCRA cluster ranking plots for individual SSRIs by remission and adverse events. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to the duration of treatment to remission, dropout, and adverse events to assess treatment efficacy for studies of similar duration (8–12 weeks). In addition, we applied a one stage approach using a mixed effect logistic regression for pooling outcomes with zero events.

A design-by-treatment model with a global χ² test was applied to assess the consistency assumption of the network. If inconsistency was present, we used a loop specific approach to estimate an inconsistency factor. The studies responsible for the inconsistency and their characteristics were then explored. We used comparison adjusted funnel plots to examine small study effects. If these plots showed asymmetry, we constructed a contour enhanced funnel plot to explore whether the asymmetry was due to small study effects (most of the small studies showed statistically significant results) or heterogeneity (most of the studies showed both significant and non-significant results). All analyses were performed on the basis of a frequentist approach using Stata version 16. A two sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, except for the Q test, where a P value < 0.10 was applied.

### A meta-analysis of the efficacy of psycho-and pharmacotherapy in panic disorder with and without agoraphobia [^115VGPhe]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy of (cognitive) behavioural ((C)BT) and pharmacological therapy was investigated using meta-analytic techniques. After a comprehensive review of the literature, the results of 124 studies were included. (C)BT was more effective than a no-treatment control and a placebo control. No difference of efficacy was found when using cognitive elements compared to not using them for anxiety; for associated depressive symptoms, additional cognitive elements seems superior. Pharmacotherapy was more effective than a placebo control; there was no superiority of any drug class. Sample size was related to effect size in pharmacotherapy and publication bias was found. (C)BT was at least as effective as pharmacotherapy and depending on type of analysis even significantly more effective. There were no significant differences between (C)BT alone and a combination approach but characteristics of studies have to be considered.

### Sertraline treatment of panic disorder: response in patients at risk for poor outcome [^112HKARJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Background

More than one third of panic disorder patients have a chronic and/or recurrent form of the disorder, accounting for much of the individual and societal cost associated with the illness. Six clinical variables have been most consistently identified as high-risk predictors of poor outcome: (1) panic severity, (2) presence of agoraphobia, (3) comorbid depression, (4) comorbid personality disorder, (5) duration of illness, and (6) female sex. No published research has systematically examined the differential antipanic efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients at high risk for poor outcome.

Method

Data were pooled (N = 664) from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy of sertraline for the treatment of DSM-III-R panic disorder. Two of the studies were 12-week fixed-dose studies with starting daily doses of sertraline, 50 mg, and 2 were 10-week flexible-dose studies with starting daily doses of sertraline, 25 mg. All other study design features were the same, except for the exclusion of women of childbearing potential in the 2 fixed-dose studies. Exclusion of patients with marked personality disorders and depression meant that only 4 of the poor-outcome variables could be evaluated.

Results

Clinical improvement was similar for patients treated with sertraline whether or not they carried an agoraphobia diagnosis, had a duration of illness > 2 years, or were female. Patients with high baseline panic severity had significantly (p = .01) less improvement on the endpoint Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale than patients with moderate severity, although the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale change score was higher in the patients with high severity (-2.00 vs. -1.31). For patients with 3 or more high-risk variables, there was a modest, but statistically significant, tendency for reduced global improvement (endpoint CGI-I score of 2.7 for the high-risk vs. 2.4 for the non-high-risk group; p = .017), although the high-risk group actually had a similar endpoint reduction in frequency of panic attacks (82%) compared with the non-high-risk group (78%).

Conclusion

Treatment of panic disorder with sertraline was generally effective, even in the presence of baseline clinical variables that have been associated with poor treatment response. The main limitations of the analysis were the reliance on pooled data from 4 studies (even if the designs were similar) and our inability to examine the impact of depression and personality disorders on response to treatment because of the exclusion criteria of the clinical trials.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113qNjUR]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To identify drug classes and individual selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with high rates of remission and low risk of adverse events in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 17 June 2021.

Eligibility Criteria For Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials that included adults aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of panic disorder, compared drugs used to treat the panic disorder, and measured the outcomes of interest, including remissions, dropouts, and adverse events.

Methods

Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. Direct meta-analyses were performed using random effects models. A two stage network meta-analysis with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of drug classes and individual SSRIs.

Results

87 studies including a total of 12800 participants and 12 drug classes were eligible for inclusion. Almost all the studies (86/87) had some concern or were at high risk of bias. Network meta-analysis of remission with consistent results indicated that tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) were associated with significantly higher remission rates than placebo, with risk ratios of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.54), 1.47 (1.36 to 1.60), 1.30 (1.00 to 1.69), 1.38 (1.26 to 1.50), and 1.27 (1.12 to 1.45), respectively. SUCRAs identified benzodiazepines (84.5%, mean rank = 2.4), tricyclic antidepressants (68.7%, 3.8), and SSRIs (66.4%, 4.0) as the top three best treatments for remission. However, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and SSRIs were also significantly associated with increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo, with risk ratios of 1.79 (1.47 to 2.19), 1.76 (1.50 to 2.06), and 1.19 (1.01 to 1.41), respectively. Consistency assumption of adverse events was upheld but could still be present on removal of studies with high percentages of women participants and those with agoraphobia. A SUCRA cluster ranking plot considering both remission and adverse events among all drug classes indicated that SSRIs were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. Among individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram provided high remission with an acceptable risk of adverse events.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that SSRIs provide high rates of remission with low risk of adverse events for the treatment of panic disorder. Among SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. The findings were, however, based on studies of moderate to very low certainty levels of evidence, mostly as a result of within study bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of the findings reported.

### Anxiety, panic and adult asthma: a cognitive-behavioral perspective [^1161X9fw]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A review of previous research suggests increased probability of the prevalence of anxiety disorders, and particularly panic disorder and panic attacks in patients with asthma, as compared to a normal population. Research also indicates significant levels of co-morbidity between asthma and anxiety as measured on dimensional scales of anxiety and panic. Clinical anxiety and panic manifestations affect symptom perception and asthma management through the effects of anxiety symptoms such as hyperventilation, and indirectly through self-management behavior and physician response. However, there is limited data on the impact of anxiety co-morbidity on asthma quality of life. Some studies indicate that individuals with co-morbid asthma and anxiety or panic report worse asthma quality of life both in general and in relation to their symptomatology, being limited in their daily activities, in response to environmental stimuli and in regard to feelings of emotional distress. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective and empirically supported treatment of choice for anxiety disorders and panic attacks. However, standard CBT protocols for anxiety and panic may need to be specifically targeted at improving asthma outcomes. Also, asthma research literature is lacking in randomized controlled trials applying CBT to patients with co-morbid asthma and clinical anxiety manifestations. Trials evaluating CBT interventions in individuals with clinical anxiety manifestations and asthma may provide evidence of these interventions as an effective adjunct to improve asthma management and control.

Risk of bias

Study quality

Risk of bias judgements are summarised in Figure 2. The majority of trials (9/12; 75%) failed to provide complete outcome data. On average, 19 percent (37 out of 191) of the participants in the six trials that provided dropout data did not reach study endpoint; hence the risk of attrition bias is considerable. The authors of one trial reported that "data from only the most clinically pertinent findings" were presented in the paper, although they specified all outcome measures that were initially recorded. Therefore, this trial was judged to have a high risk of selective outcome reporting.

Figure 2.
Risk of bias summary figure.

Publication bias

No unpublished reports of completed RCTs were obtained. Three RCTs were found (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00645450, NCT00648375 and NCT01239173) that had been terminated because of inadequate subject recruitment. The authors of these three discontinued trials were contacted. All responded, but none provided data.

Meta-analyses

Propranolol versus benzodiazepines in panic disorder with or without agoraphobia

Meta-analysis I. Outcome: number of panic attacks after 2 weeks of treatment

Two trials report the effects of propranolol (30–320 mg/day) versus benzodiazepines (1–30 mg/day alprazolam or 5–40 mg/day diazepam) prescribed to adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia for a 2-week period, expressed in mean number of panic attacks after 2 weeks of treatment. Effect size for each study was expressed as a WMD. There was substantial statistical heterogeneity of studies (two trials, 50 participants in total; χ² = 3.04, df = 1, p = 0.08, I² = 67%). No significant difference was found between propranolol and benzodiazepines (mean difference = 1.58, 95%-CI [–2.33; 5.50], Z = 0.79, p = 0.43) (Figure 3(a)).

### Antidepressants versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^114KtvmP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by repeated, unexpected panic attacks, which represent a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes, and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. It is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology consider antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Several classes of antidepressants have been studied and compared, but it is still unclear which antidepressants have a more or less favourable profile in terms of effectiveness and acceptability in the treatment of this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antidepressants for panic disorder in adults, specifically:1. to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison to placebo;2. to review the acceptability of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with placebo; and3. to investigate the adverse effects of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, including the general prevalence of adverse effects, compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders' (CCMD) Specialised Register, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to May 2017. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind, randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) allocating adults with panic disorder to antidepressants or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. We entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and settings. Primary outcomes included failure to respond, measured by a range of response scales, and treatment acceptability, measured by total number of dropouts for any reason. Secondary outcomes included failure to remit, panic symptom scales, frequency of panic attacks, agoraphobia, general anxiety, depression, social functioning, quality of life and patient satisfaction, measured by various scales as defined in individual studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one unique RCTs including 9377 participants overall, of whom we included 8252 in the 49 placebo-controlled arms of interest (antidepressant as monotherapy and placebo alone) in this review. The majority of studies were of moderate to low quality due to inconsistency, imprecision and unclear risk of selection and performance bias. We found low-quality evidence that revealed a benefit for antidepressants as a group in comparison with placebo in terms of efficacy measured as failure to respond (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.79; participants = 6500; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 6 to 9): that means seven people would need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. We observed the same finding when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo. Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit for antidepressants compared to placebo when looking at number of dropouts due to any cause (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; participants = 7850; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a NNTB of 27 (95% CI 17 to 105); treating 27 people will result in one person fewer dropping out. Considering antidepressant classes, TCAs showed a benefit over placebo, while for SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) we observed no difference. When looking at dropouts due to adverse effects, which can be considered as a measure of tolerability, we found moderate-quality evidence showing that antidepressants as a whole are less well tolerated than placebo. In particular, TCAs and SSRIs produced more dropouts due to adverse effects in comparison with placebo, while the confidence interval for SNRI, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (NRI) and other antidepressants were wide and included the possibility of no difference.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified studies comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. Based on these results, antidepressants may be more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder. Efficacy can be quantified as a NNTB of 7, implying that seven people need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. Antidepressants may also have benefit in comparison with placebo in terms of number of dropouts, but a less favourable profile in terms of dropout due to adverse effects. However, the tolerability profile varied between different classes of antidepressants. The choice of whether antidepressants should be prescribed in clinical practice cannot be made on the basis of this review. Limitations in results include funding of some studies by pharmaceutical companies, and only assessing short-term outcomes. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^1173Z4v5]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of paroxetine was established in three 10- to 12-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who prescribes paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Combined psychotherapy plus benzodiazepines for panic disorder [^114WpWn2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of combining psychotherapy and benzodiazepines for panic disorder is unclear, despite widespread use.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of the combination compared with either treatment alone.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials comparing the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepine with either therapy alone for panic disorder were identified. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Studies and References Registers were searched. References of relevant trials and other reviews were checked. Experts in the field were contacted. Additional unpublished data were sought from authors of the original trials.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently checked the records retrieved by the searches to identify randomised trials comparing the combined therapy versus either of the monotherapies, among adults with panic disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently checked eligibility, assessed quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The primary outcome was "response" based on global judgement. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from included trials.

Main Results

Three trials met eligibility criteria. A 16-week behaviour therapy intervention was used in two trials, and a 12-week cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention in the third. Duration of follow-up varied, ranging from 0 to 12 months. Two trials (total 166 participants) provided data comparing combination with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy). No statistically significant differences were observed in response during the intervention (relative risk (RR) for combination 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.03, P = 0.35), at the end of the intervention (RR 0.78, 0.45 to 1.35, P = 0.37), or at the last follow-up time point, although the follow-up data suggested that the combination might be inferior to behaviour therapy alone (RR 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.08). One trial (77 participants) compared combination with a benzodiazepine alone. No differences were found in response during the intervention (RR 1.57, 0.83 to 2.98, P = 0.17). Although the combination appeared to be superior to the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment (RR 3.39, 1.03 to 11.21, P = 0.05) the finding was only borderline statistically significant, and no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up (RR 2.31, 0.79 to 6.74, P = 0.12).

Authors' Conclusions

The review established the paucity of high quality evidence investigating the efficacy of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for panic disorder. Currently, there is inadequate evidence to assess the clinical effects of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for patients who are diagnosed with panic disorder.

### The pharmacotherapy of panic disorder [^114aFKnu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is common and associated with significant morbidity and dysfunction. The pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder is aimed at reducing or eliminating panic attacks, avoidance behavior, anticipatory anxiety, and comorbid conditions — and substantially improving and normalizing overall function and quality of life. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines remain the current mainstays of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder, although other novel agents and strategies are becoming available and may add effective alternatives to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy and the treatment of panic disorder: efficacy and strategies [^114S2u6Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

In this article, we review the efficacy and applications of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder. Research supports CBT as an effective first-line treatment of panic disorder that offers relatively quick onset of action and long-term maintenance of treatment benefits. These characteristics, plus the acceptability, tolerability, and cost-efficacy of CBT, make it an especially attractive treatment option for panic disorder. We review these findings as well as some newer developments in the field including research on emotional acceptance, the importance of context in extinction learning, and the use of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111DkVJU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results

A total of 2019 studies were identified, of which 87 (12 800 participants) met the inclusion criteria (fig 1). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies (see supplementary file for references e1-e87). The mean age of participants was 35.0 years and 63.7% (7819/12 276) were women. Most of the studies (39/87, 44.3%) used the DSM-III-TR (text revision) criteria for diagnosing panic disorder. Eighty three studies (95%) included participants with agoraphobia, and duration of panic disorder was 6.9 years before study commencement. The most common duration of treatment was eight weeks (35%), followed by 12 weeks (19%). A total of 21 comparisons were considered for analysis; most compared benzodiazepines with placebo (n = 16 studies) and SSRIs with placebo (n = 16), followed by tricyclic antidepressants versus benzodiazepines (n = 8), tricyclic antidepressants versus SSRIs (n = 8), and SSRIs versus SSRIs (n = 6), and tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo (n = 5), with the remaining comparisons represented in only a few studies. Fifty two studies reported outcomes for remission, 75 for dropouts, 41 for anxiety symptoms, 22 for depression symptoms, and 54 for adverse events. Quality of life outcomes were not considered as data were only available from seven studies.

Risk of bias assessment

Most of the studies had at least some concerns (70%; 61/87) or were at high risk of bias (29%; 25/87); only a single study was considered low risk (supplementary eFigures 1 and 2). Risk of bias was mostly related to insufficient details of randomisation and concealment processes (88%; 77/87 studies) and selection of results reported (91%; 79/87) owing to non-registration or publication of study protocols.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are probably the… [^115jAeot]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Bottom Line Synopsis The researchers identified randomized controlled trials that evaluated medications to treat panic disorder by searching three databases as well as reference lists of identified studies and meta-analyses. They included 87 studies published in any language that included a total of 12, 800 participants and 12 drug classes, with two researchers independently selecting studies for inclusion and abstracting the data. Only one study was at low risk of bias, and all studies were of short duration. The other studies had problems with randomization and allocation concealment or were at risk of selectively reporting outcomes. The authors used network meta-analysis, a method of comparing different drug treatments when they were not studied in head-to-head trials.

Evaluating the effect on remission, which was defined as no panic attacks for at least one week by the end of the study, all drug classes studied were more effective than placebo, with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs, in that order, as the three best treatments for remission. All three drug classes were associated with an increased likelihood of adverse effects, with SSRIs having the least likelihood. Among the SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. Study design: Meta-analysis.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116WFpkm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Network meta-analysis is used to indirectly synthesise evidence on all possible treatments using direct comparisons with common comparators. Although several systematic reviews and direct meta-analyses of panic disorder have been published over the past decade, a network meta-analysis that simultaneously estimates relative efficacy and safety between commonly available drug treatments (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, SSRIs, SNRIs, monoamine oxidate inhibitors) has not been undertaken. We therefore conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to identify which drug classes — tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, β blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (eg, buspirone), SSRIs, SNRIs, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants provided high benefits (remission) and low risk (adverse events) for the treatment of panic disorder. Although guidelines usually recommend SSRIs as the preferred drugs for the treatment of panic disorder, evidence to indicate the most appropriate SSRI is inadequate; thus, we also undertook a network meta-analysis to compare individual SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram).

### Empirically supported treatments for panic disorder [^116iQVFk]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article provides an empirical review of the elements and efficacy of both pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments for panic disorder. Both monotherapies and combination treatment strategies are considered. The available evidence suggests that both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy (prominently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) are effective first-line agents and that CBT offers particular cost efficacy relative to both pharmacotherapy alone and combined pharmacotherapy and CBT. Predictors of non-response and mechanisms of action are considered, as are novel treatment strategies, including the use of memory enhancers to improve CBT outcome.

### Panic disorder [^111RS2og]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Panic disorder is a common mental disorder that affects up to 5% of the population at some point in life. It is often disabling, especially when complicated by agoraphobia, and is associated with substantial functional morbidity and reduced quality of life. The disorder is also costly for individuals and society, as shown by increased use of health care, absenteeism, and reduced workplace productivity. Some physical illnesses (eg, asthma) commonly occur with panic disorder, and certain lifestyle factors (eg, smoking) increase the risk for the disorder, but causal pathways are still unclear. Genetic and early experiential susceptibility factors also exist, but their exact nature and pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. Despite an imprecise, although increased, understanding of cause, strong evidence supports the use of several effective treatments (eg, pharmacological, cognitive-behavioural). The adaptation and dissemination of these treatments to the frontlines of medical-care delivery should be urgent goals for the public-health community.
