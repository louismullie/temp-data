## Question

What are the treatment options for PCOS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about PCOS treatment options, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment philosophy and guideline framework. Then, I should verify first-line lifestyle management and its evidence base. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options for menstrual and hyperandrogenic symptoms, followed by infertility management. After that, I need to check metabolic risk mitigation and screening. I will then consider adolescent-specific care, psychological and quality-of-life aspects, and finally address emerging therapies and off-label considerations, before summarizing a practical, stepwise approach with shared decision-making principles.

> Let me first confirm the treatment philosophy and guideline anchor. PCOS management is individualized, symptom-targeted, and anchored in shared decision-making, with the 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline as the primary reference and the 2018 guideline and subsequent updates informing practice; importantly, most pharmacotherapies are used off-label, so counseling on benefits, risks, and uncertainties is essential [^114PNgub] [^114NbQzh] [^114uX3F8].

> I need to ensure I frame the core domains correctly. Management addresses reproductive features (menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, infertility), metabolic features (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes risk), and psychological features (anxiety, depression, quality of life), with lifestyle intervention as foundational across all domains and pharmacotherapy layered based on goals and severity [^114NbQzh] [^113PpF2p].

> Next, I should review lifestyle interventions as first-line therapy. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: guidelines consistently recommend lifestyle for all with PCOS, with modest but meaningful benefits on weight, BMI, and androgen markers; Cochrane suggests improvements in free androgen index and anthropometrics, though reproductive outcomes like live birth are not well studied in these trials, so expectations should be calibrated [^113PpF2p] [^1153znYR]. Hold on, I should double-check the exercise specifics: there is no single superior exercise modality; any sustainable physical activity aligned with population guidelines is reasonable, and weight stigma should be actively avoided in counseling [^1114xTno] [^114WFy5x].

> Now, pharmacologic management of menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line for cycle control and hirsutism/acne; I initially thought there was a specific formulation mandated, but wait, I should correct that — guidelines prefer lower-dose ethinyl estradiol preparations without specifying a brand, and selection should be individualized with attention to contraindications and metabolic risk [^117BX9Sd] [^111myZ3G]. I should confirm anti-androgen positioning: spironolactone, finasteride, or flutamide can be considered for hirsutism after 6 months of COCPs if inadequate, with contraception mandatory due to teratogenic risk; meta-analytic data suggest anti-androgens can improve hirsutism but are not clearly superior to COCPs as first-line, reinforcing COCPs as initial therapy [^112dxxiT] [^112c5kMa].

> Let me consider insulin sensitizers. Metformin is recommended primarily for metabolic features and can aid cycle regulation, but I need to be clear it is not first-line for hirsutism or acne and has limited standalone ovulation efficacy; it may be considered in adolescents for metabolic indications and cycle control, and in pregnancy, evidence for routine use is mixed, so decisions should be individualized and evidence updated periodically [^111GXWnL] [^116nbmP1] [^1177QWCw]. Hold on, I should verify inositol: myo- or D-chiro-inositol remains experimental for fertility outcomes; women should be counseled accordingly and not substitute it for evidence-based ovulation induction [^115TGnwJ].

> For infertility, I should confirm the ovulation induction hierarchy. Letrozole is first-line and superior to clomiphene citrate for ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth, with no increase in fetal abnormality; clomiphene remains an alternative where letrozole is unavailable or declined, and metformin alone is less effective than letrozole but may be considered in select contexts with counseling on its limitations [^111pkfgU] [^115tdTX5] [^114KMFar]. I need to check second-line options: low-dose step-up gonadotropins with intensive ultrasound monitoring are appropriate when letrozole fails, balancing cost, monitoring burden, and multiple pregnancy risk; IVF is third-line when ovulation induction fails or is unsuitable, with PCOS-specific protocols and strong preference for single embryo transfer to mitigate OHSS and multiple gestation risks [^1164E4zM] [^115fGpFR].

> Next, I should review metabolic risk screening and management. Wait, I should verify the scope: guidelines emphasize screening for impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, sleep apnea, and endometrial cancer risk, with frequency individualized to risk; metformin is appropriate for impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, while statins are not routine unless standard cardiovascular risk thresholds are met, and thiazolidinediones are generally not favored due to risk–benefit concerns in reproductive-age women [^114PNgub] [^114sxcpZ] [^111GXWnL]. But wait, what if weight is a major driver? Structured weight management, including consideration of anti-obesity pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery per general population criteria, may be appropriate in selected patients, though reproductive-specific data are limited and decisions should be individualized [^114DncuV] [^111MMm38].

> I will now examine adolescent-specific care. Diagnosis requires both irregular menses and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity; management mirrors adults with lifestyle first-line, COCPs for cycle control and hyperandrogenism, and metformin for metabolic indications or cycle regulation when needed, all embedded in shared decision-making and transition planning [^116nbmP1] [^111T6jk3]. Hold on, I should verify the "at risk" category: adolescents with only one feature are considered "at risk", warranting symptom management and follow-up rather than a definitive diagnosis [^116nbmP1].

> Psychological health and quality of life cannot be overlooked. I need to ensure routine screening for depression and anxiety, address body image and weight stigma, and integrate quality-of-life goals into care plans; guidelines explicitly call for asking about symptom burden, priorities, and concerns to tailor interventions and improve adherence and outcomes [^111Jtqeu] [^114WFy5x].

> Let me consider emerging therapies and off-label realities. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors show promise for metabolic outcomes but remain investigational for PCOS-specific reproductive endpoints; similarly, bariatric surgery improves metabolic health and may aid fertility indirectly, yet high-quality PCOS-specific reproductive RCTs are limited, so these should be framed within general metabolic care pathways and research contexts [^113drmbc] [^113JbPEF]. I should double-check that counseling emphasizes that most PCOS medications are off-label and that regulatory approval specific to PCOS is limited, reinforcing informed consent and shared decision-making [^114uX3F8].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. Start with education and lifestyle for all; layer pharmacotherapy based on dominant symptoms — COCPs for menstrual and hyperandrogenic features, metformin for metabolic indications; for infertility, proceed from letrozole to gonadotropins to IVF as needed, with careful monitoring and OHSS risk mitigation; throughout, screen for metabolic and psychological comorbidities, avoid weight stigma, and align choices with patient values and local access, documenting off-label discussions and updating care as new evidence emerges [^114PNgub] [^114NbQzh] [^113PpF2p].

---

PCOS management is individualized and symptom-targeted, with **lifestyle first-line** (weight loss, diet, exercise) for metabolic and reproductive benefits [^113PpF2p] [^112VPP2a]. For menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism, **COCPs are first-line** [^117BX9Sd]; metformin is added for metabolic features or insulin resistance [^111GXWnL]. For infertility, **letrozole is first-line** ovulation induction [^111pkfgU], with clomiphene or gonadotropins as alternatives [^112YVDhs]; IVF is reserved for refractory cases [^115fGpFR]. Anti-androgens (spironolactone, finasteride, flutamide) treat hirsutism/acne when COCPs are inadequate or contraindicated [^112dxxiT], and bariatric surgery is considered for severe obesity with failed lifestyle therapy [^114DncuV]. Adolescents receive lifestyle and COCPs; metformin is used for metabolic indications, and ovulation induction is reserved for those attempting pregnancy [^116nbmP1]. Regular screening for metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological comorbidities is essential [^114sxcpZ] [^111Jtqeu].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of PCOS management, providing **significant improvements in metabolic, reproductive, and psychological outcomes** [^113PpF2p].

- **Weight loss**: Even modest weight loss (5–10%) improves insulin sensitivity, menstrual regularity, and fertility [^notfound].

- **Diet**: No specific diet is superior; emphasize balanced, nutrient-dense intake and energy deficit for weight loss [^114WFy5x] [^115gjgoa].

- **Exercise**: Regular aerobic/resistance training improves insulin sensitivity, weight, and cardiovascular risk [^111zM2Qq].

- **Behavioral strategies**: Cognitive-behavioral approaches enhance adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacotherapy is tailored to symptoms, fertility goals, and metabolic risk [^113xdTro].

---

### Menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism

- **Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs)**: First-line for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenic symptoms (hirsutism, acne) [^117BX9Sd].

- **Metformin**: Improves insulin sensitivity, menstrual regularity, and metabolic parameters; not first-line for hirsutism/acne [^1177QWCw].

- **Anti-androgens**: Spironolactone, finasteride, or flutamide for refractory hirsutism/acne; require contraception due to teratogenicity [^112dxxiT].

---

### Infertility management

- **Letrozole**: First-line ovulation induction; superior to clomiphene citrate for ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth [^111pkfgU].

- **Clomiphene citrate**: Alternative first-line where letrozole is unavailable or contraindicated [^117BgeoV].

- **Gonadotropins**: Second-line for clomiphene/letrozole failure; require close monitoring due to OHSS and multiple pregnancy risk [^1164E4zM].

- **IVF**: Third-line for refractory cases; single embryo transfer recommended to reduce multiple pregnancy risk [^115fGpFR].

---

### Metabolic complications

Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters; consider **GLP-1 receptor agonists** (e.g. liraglutide) for obesity and metabolic syndrome when lifestyle fails [^114NbQzh] [^113JbPEF]. Bariatric surgery is an option for severe obesity with failed lifestyle/medical therapy [^114DncuV].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical options are considered for **refractory cases or severe obesity**. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is a second-line option for clomiphene-resistant infertility, and bariatric surgery is indicated for severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities) with failed lifestyle/medical therapy.

---

## Adolescent-specific considerations

Adolescents require tailored approaches emphasizing **lifestyle, menstrual regulation, and metabolic health** [^116nbmP1].

- **Diagnosis**: Requires both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism; exclude other causes [^114NTN9g].

- **Lifestyle**: First-line; focus on healthy weight and preventing excess weight gain [^113PpF2p].

- **COCPs**: First-line for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism; use low-dose preparations [^117BX9Sd].

- **Metformin**: Consider for metabolic indications or cycle regulation when COCPs are contraindicated [^116nbmP1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to track **response, adherence, and complications** [^notfound].

- **Metabolic screening**: Annual BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, and glucose tolerance test [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Assess and manage traditional risk factors [^114sxcpZ].

- **Psychological health**: Screen for depression, anxiety, and quality of life impacts [^113xdTro].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies include **GLP-1 receptor agonists** for obesity and metabolic syndrome, inositol (myo- and D-chiro) as adjuncts for metabolic and reproductive outcomes, and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) under investigation for hyperandrogenism [^113JbPEF].

---

PCOS management is **multimodal and individualized**, prioritizing lifestyle interventions and symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy, with surgical options for refractory cases. Regular monitoring and emerging therapies further optimize outcomes.

### Update on PCOS: consequences, challenges, and guiding treatment [^1111HKxW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis, and less-than-optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. The International PCOS network, consisting of geographically diverse international experts in PCOS as well as consumers, engaged in a multi-year international evidence-based guideline development process that was jointly sponsored by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The guideline was published in 2018 and endorsed by more than 40 international societies involved in PCOS. Translation of this evidence-based guideline to medical practice and consumer groups remains a priority. However, there remain many challenges to both understanding the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Evidence suggests that both clinicians and consumers are not satisfied with the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment options. This review summarizes the important findings for diagnosis and treatment from the guidelines and expands on recent developments in the literature since its publication. Special attention to diagnosis at the ends of the reproductive spectrum are discussed and remaining areas of controversy are noted. Additionally, the review highlights some of the remaining challenges in the understanding and management of PCOS to help guide clinicians and investigators in this perplexing condition.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups, and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: i) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; ii) reducing unnecessary testing; iii) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and iv) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114PNgub]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Contemporary approaches to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111eTeoJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women in their reproductive years and is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. It is also associated with several metabolic abnormalities, particularly insulin resistance and obesity, which play an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and, in particular, negatively influence ovarian function and fertility. This review article summarizes the available treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, current and potentially new therapies are discussed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116jAJc6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Method of Development of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society deemed the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force followed the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group with expertise in development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase "we recommend" and the number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase "we suggest" and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that ⊕○○○ denotes very low quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○, low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○, moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕, high quality. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that panelists considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the panelists and their values and preferences; therefore, these remarks are considered.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NTN9g]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

What Does This Mean for Those With PCOS?

Building on the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), this Guideline updates and expands clinical questions, aiming to ensure that women with PCOS receive optimal, evidence-based care that meets their needs and improves health outcomes. The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages including priority topics and outcomes for those with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their healthcare providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on improved education and awareness of healthcare professionals, partnership in care, and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered, in addition to resource availability across different settings. With effective translation, the Guideline will address priorities identified by women with PCOS, upskill healthcare professionals, empower consumers, improve care and outcomes, identify key research gaps, and promote vital future research.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

Guidelines

Guidelines on polycystic ovary syndrome vary in their methodological quality, approach to diagnosis, approach to screening for health risks, and recommendations for the use of drug treatments. The 2023 update to the international polycystic ovary syndrome guidelines, which uses consensus methodology and clear grading systems for clinical recommendations, has now been released. These evidence based guidelines were developed after consultation with international multidisciplinary and consumer bodies to support clinicians and patients in the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome and reduce variation in care.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive-aged women, with impacts across the lifespan from adolescence to post menopause. PCOS prevalence is between 10% to 13% as confirmed in the guideline process. PCOS aetiology is complex; clinical presentation is heterogeneous with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Women internationally experience delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS remains inconsistent, with ongoing key evidence-practice gaps. Following on from the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, independently evaluated as high quality, this extensive update integrates current literature with previous systematic reviews and extends to new clinical questions prioritized by consumers. Ultimately, we aim to update, extend and translate rigorous, comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and treatment, to improve the lives of those with PCOS worldwide.

To do so, the Guideline leverages substantive government and society investment and brings together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. This comprehensive evidence-based Guideline is constructed from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality clinical service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The Guideline is supported by a multifaceted international translation programme with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of healthcare professionals and to empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program. Here, we summarize recommendations from the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: definition, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment [^113vkmcG]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in premenopausal women. Heterogeneous by nature, PCOS is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction in the absence of other specific diagnoses. The aetiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown, but mounting evidence suggests that PCOS might be a complex multigenic disorder with strong epigenetic and environmental influences, including diet and lifestyle factors. PCOS is frequently associated with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis and treatment of PCOS are not complicated, requiring only the judicious application of a few well-standardized diagnostic methods and appropriate therapeutic approaches addressing hyperandrogenism, the consequences of ovarian dysfunction and the associated metabolic disorders. This article aims to provide a balanced review of the latest advances and current limitations in our knowledge about PCOS while also providing a few clear and simple principles, based on current evidence-based clinical guidelines, for the proper diagnosis and long-term clinical management of women with PCOS.

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are key instruments to implement the practice of evidence-based medicine. We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and variations in CPGs recommendations on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until December 2020 for all evidence-based CPGs and consensus statements on PCOS. We extracted data in duplicate to map clinical recommendations across prespecified disease domains and assessed CPGs methodological quality of using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research & Evaluation II tool.

Evidence Synthesis

We included 13 PCOS CPGs published between 2007 and 2018. CPGs recommendations were mostly focused on screening for and managing metabolic disease (12/13, 92%), followed by cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). Mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least reported domains. Most CPGs had a high quality for scope and purpose description (12/13, 92%) while stakeholder's involvement and applicability of recommendations to clinical practice were appropriate in only 2 CPGs (2/13, 15%). We identified inconsistency in recommendations on PCOS diagnosis in adolescents, optimal lifestyle interventions, hirsutism and acne treatments, interventions to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the frequency and screening criteria for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and optimal screening tools for mental health illness in women with PCOS.

Conclusion

Current CPGs on the diagnosis and management of PCOS vary in their scope and methodological quality, which may hinder evidence translation into clinical practice. We identified disease domains with existing evidence gap to guide future research and guideline updates.

### Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome [^113Q8ryX]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is surrounded by many controversies. On the basis of the currently available evidence, a group of experts reached a consensus regarding the therapeutic challenges raised in these women. Before any intervention is initiated, preconceptional counseling should be provided emphasizing the importance of lifestyle, especially weight reduction and exercise in overweight women, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate (CC). Recommended second-line intervention, should CC fail to result in pregnancy, is either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS). The use of exogenous gonadotropins is associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancy, and, therefore, intense monitoring of ovarian response is required. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery alone is usually effective in less than 50% of women, and additional ovulation induction medication is required under those circumstances. Overall, ovulation induction (representing the CC-gonadotropin paradigm) is reported to be highly effective with a cumulative singleton live-birth rate of 72%. Recommended third-line treatment is in vitro fertilization (IVF). More patient-tailored approaches should be developed for ovulation induction based on initial screening characteristics of women with PCOS. Such approaches may result in deviation from the above mentioned first-line, second-line, or third-line ovulation strategies in well-defined subsets of patients. Metformin use in PCOS should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance. Based on recent data available in the literature, the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended. Insufficient evidence is currently available to recommend the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors for routine ovulation induction. Even singleton pregnancies in PCOS are associated with increased health risk for both the mother and the fetus.

Discussion

Summary of Main Findings

We captured a high number of evidence-based CPGs produced over the last decade covering varied disease domains with a consistently increasing number of recommendations. Guideline quality was varied with poor stakeholders involvement and a substantial lack of clear implementation pathways.

Reassuringly, most of the included CPGs recommended the use of homogenous PCOS diagnostic criteria. Still, there were variations in the recommended diagnostic reference ranges for biochemical hyperandrogenism and on the diagnostic value of anti-Müllerian hormone in adolescents with PCOS.

Most CPGs recommended routine screening for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in affected women; however, the recommended frequency of screening, measurement tools, and associated risk factors varied substantially (Table 3). Mental health was particularly underrepresented in most of the included CPGs with much uncertainty on the most effective screening and treatment pathways for women with PCOS.

Most of the included CPGs emphasized the importance of LST as the first-line treatment strategy for PCOS, although details on specific dietary regimes were lacking. Similarly, the role of anti-obesity medications and insulin sensitizers was varied across included CPGs. Few CPGs recommended particular treatments for hyperandrogenism that could be linked to the limitations of available evidence on this domain. Lastly, with a growing body of evidence on fertility treatments for women with PCOS, there were clearer recommendations on the treatment pathways for anovulation and subfertility. Variations existed on the role of letrozole as the primary ovulation induction agent; however, this is unsurprising giving the evolution of evidence on its effectiveness and safety over the last decade. There was limited guidance about the optimal ovarian stimulation protocols and adjuvant treatments to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with PCOS.

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

Introduction

Metabolic consequences of PCOS

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition affecting women in the reproductive age, with a prevalence of 15–20%.PCOS is characterised by biochemical and clinical features of excess androgen levels (hirsutism and acne), menstrual irregularities and polycystic morphology of the ovaries. Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, both drivers of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nearly 50% of women with PCOS progress to frank metabolic syndrome (MS).MS is defined as a group of conditions including dyslipidaemia, central adiposity, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, all predisposing to coronary heart disease and diabetes. The prevalence of MS in women with PCOS is significantly high, at around 40–50% compared with the general population. In addition, PCOS is associated with a spectrum of complications that include infertility, increased body weight, endometrial cancer and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A therapeutic approach targeting weight control is the cornerstone in the management of PCOS as effective weight loss is a positive predictor for long-term prevention of cardiometabolic disorders in PCOS. However, weight loss in women with PCOS remains challenging to achieve. Lifestyle modifications that include diet and physical activity are the first-line therapy. Still, it rarely reduces body weight by more than 10 kg, and the available evidence on lifestyle intervention is largely disappointing. Pharmacotherapies to prevent and manage metabolic comorbidities in PCOS exist; however, they are underutilised as their effectiveness remains relatively unexplored, and they are used primarily to treat other conditions such as T2DM. The surgical approach for weight loss has been an option for many decades, but it has not been used commonly as a therapeutic option in the management of PCOS. In this review, we have aimed to provide an overview of the treatment options that offer therapeutic and preventive advantages for the metabolic comorbidities in PCOS focussing on lifestyle modification, T2DM medications and bariatric surgery. The review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114uX3F8]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacology treatment principles in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Shared decision making between the patient (and parent/s or guardian/s, if the patient is a child) and the healthcare professional is required. An individual's characteristics, preferences and values must be elicited and considered when recommending any intervention alone or in combination. Understanding how individual adults and adolescents value treatment outcomes is essential when prescribing medications. Medical therapy is generally not approved for use specifically in PCOS and recommended use is therefore evidence-based, but off-label. Healthcare professionals need to inform adults, adolescents and their parents/s or guardian/s and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects. Regulatory agencies should consider approval of evidence-based medications for use in PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) exercise intervention — Healthcare professionals and women could consider that there is a lack of evidence supporting any one type and intensity of exercise being better than another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive or psychological outcomes. Any physical activity consistent with population guidelines will have health benefits and, within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable physical activity based on individual preferences and goals.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1166Mcnz]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Infertility management pathway for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follows a stepwise medical approach beginning with diagnosis/baseline investigations and lifestyle optimization, then first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Baseline investigations include an endocrine profile, pelvic ultrasound, BMI/BP/glycemic assessment, routine preconception checks, and consideration of semen analysis and tubal patency assessment. Healthy lifestyle "should be recommended in all those with PCOS". First line medical treatment is letrozole with dose escalation, with off-label status noted and clinicians advised to inform women of evidence, concerns, and side effects; metformin and gonadotrophins have differing efficacy, cost, and multiple pregnancy profiles, and either may be an alternative first-line choice for informed women. If further treatment is required, second line is gonadotrophins with US monitoring or consideration of laparoscopic ovarian surgery. If needed, third line is in vitro fertilization with PCOS-specific protocols to minimize ovarian hyperstimulation risk and consideration of in vitro maturation; the pathway also includes repeated cycles with shared decision-making considering age and resources then to IVF.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115fUtFh]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

### How to manage weight loss in women with obesity and PCOS seeking fertility? [^111MMm38]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Obesity exacerbates the phenotype of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) including infertility as well as reducing the efficacy and access to fertility treatments. Weight management is, therefore, a key component of treatment for women with PCOS and coexistent obesity. Many women with PCOS describe significant difficulty losing weight and treatment options are limited. The first-line treatment is lifestyle interventions though the weight loss and any impact on fertility are limited. No one dietary strategy can be preferentially recommended based on current evidence. While very low energy diets can result in significant weight loss the evidence for impact on fertility is limited. Pharmacotherapy, including a range of treatments can result in marked weight loss and there is some evidence of improved rates of conception including spontaneous and in response to assisted reproduction treatment. As with pharmacotherapy, data regarding bariatric surgery is largely from nonrandomized studies and though the significant weight loss is anticipated to improve fertility the available data prevents firm conclusions. Clinicians and patients must consider the magnitude of weight loss to be targeted as well as the anticipated fertility treatment required and the timeline of treatment when deciding upon the personalized weight loss strategy. Clinicians and patients should be confident in targeting the most appropriate treatment early in the patient's management to avoid unnecessary delays.

### The effects of old, new and emerging medicines on metabolic aberrations in PCOS [^116Q1Nwk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age that is associated with significant adverse short- and long-term health consequences. Multiple metabolic aberrations, such as insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinaemia, high incidence of impaired glucose tolerance, visceral obesity, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and dyslipidemia are associated with the syndrome. Assessing the metabolic aberrations and their long term health impact in women with PCOS is challenging and becomes more important as therapeutic interventions currently available for the management of PCOS are not fully able to deal with all these consequences. Current therapeutic management of PCOS has incorporated new treatments resulting from the better understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of old, new and emerging therapies used in the management of PCOS, on the metabolic aberrations of PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — letrozole recommendations specify that letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS, with no other infertility factors. The use of letrozole is still off- label in many countries. Letrozole should not be given where there is any possibility of a pre-existing pregnancy, though there is no evidence for increased teratogenicity compared to other ovulation induction agents.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that most likely represents a heterogenous disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. Recent findings suggest PCOS has substantial metabolic sequelae, including risk of diabetes and possibly cardiovascular disease, and that primary treatment should focus on metabolic sequelae. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence on the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

### When should an insulin sensitizing agent be used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome? [^111zj88q]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The attendant hyperinsulinaemia is also thought to contribute to the mechanism of anovulation in PCOS. Both metabolic and reproductive abnormalities are amplified by obesity and the treatment of first choice for overweight or obese women with PCOS is modification of diet and lifestyle. Nevertheless, changes in diet and exercise are, for many subjects, not easy to sustain and there seems an obvious place for insulin sensitizing agents in management of both reproductive and metabolic disturbances. Of the available agents affecting insulin sensitivity, metformin has been the most widely used but despite an enormous literature reporting beneficial effects on reproductive, cutaneous and metabolic manifestations of PCOS, its efficacy is unproven apart from in those subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. Metformin at least has an assured safety record whereas both efficacy and safety of other insulin sensitizing agents in women of reproductive age, such as thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide analogues, remains to be established.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome as a metabolic disease [^117CpVuL]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous familial disorder affecting up to one in five women. The aetiology remains unclear, but available evidence suggests it is a polygenic disorder with epigenetic, developmental, and environmental components. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS are based on reproductive features, and the syndrome is categorized into several phenotypes that can vary by race and ethnicity. Insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and contribute to many adverse metabolic outcomes that place a substantial burden on the health of women with PCOS across their lifespan. Metabolic abnormalities like those identified in women with PCOS are also present in their female and male first-degree relatives. Overall, more emphasis is required on defining PCOS as a metabolic disorder in addition to a reproductive one. This approach could affect the management and future treatment options for the syndrome. The rationale of the current review is to identify and analyse existing evidence for PCOS as a metabolic, as well as a reproductive, disease.

Processes aligned with all elements of the AGREE-II tool for quality guideline assessment, with extensive evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Integrity assessment was integrated into guideline evidence synthesis processes and followed the Research Integrity in Guideline Development (RIGID) framework, with studies assessed against criteria from the Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) tool and the Trustworthiness in RAndomised Controlled Trials (TRACT) checklist. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations. Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, also evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) (Table 1).

Table 1.
Categories of PCOS guideline recommendations

The terms include "should", "could" and "should not", which are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and the evidence quality and are independent descriptors reflecting GDG judgement. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Conditional recommendations are reflected using the terms "could" or "should/could consider" which are used where evidence quality was limited or available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harms was unclear. "Should not" applies when there is a lack of appropriate evidence, or harms may outweigh benefits.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — lifestyle management recommends that lifestyle intervention (exercise alone or multicomponent diet combined with exercise and behavioural strategies) should be recommended for all women with PCOS, for improving metabolic health including central adiposity and lipid profile. Healthy lifestyle behaviours encompassing healthy eating and/or physical activity should be recommended in all women with PCOS to optimize general health, quality of life, body composition and weight management (maintaining weight, preventing weight gain and/or modest weight loss). Healthcare professionals should be aware that lifestyle management is a core focus in PCOS management, lifestyle management goals and priorities should be co-developed in partnership with women with PCOS, and value women's individualized preferences, and there are benefits to a healthy lifestyle even in the absence of weight loss.

### Which treatment options should be used in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome? [^117CME9p]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Several studies have hypothesized a peripubertal onset of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This syndrome affects different pathogenetic pathways and includes endocrine-metabolic abnormalities such as hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance. The therapeutic approaches must be addressed to individualization of therapy, considering the major clinical manifestations of the syndrome during adolescence. While the treatment of hyperandrogenism makes use of different drugs already studied, the debate about the use of insulin sensitizing drugs is still open. It will be more and more necessary to define the phenotypic and genotypic milieu in which all treatments will be as safe and effective as possible.

### Lifestyle changes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112VPP2a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 8% to 13% of reproductive-aged women and is associated with reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Obesity worsens the presentation of PCOS and weight management (weight loss, maintenance or prevention of excess weight gain) is proposed as an initial treatment strategy, best achieved through lifestyle changes incorporating diet, exercise and behavioural interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment in improving reproductive, anthropometric (weight and body composition), metabolic and quality of life factors in PCOS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED (date of last search March 2018). We also searched controlled trials registries, conference abstracts, relevant journals, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews, and grey literature databases, with no language restrictions applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lifestyle treatment (diet, exercise, behavioural or combined treatments) to minimal or no treatment in women with PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed evidence quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. Our primary outcomes were live birth, miscarriage and pregnancy. We used inverse variance and fixed-effect models in the meta-analyses. We reported dichotomous outcomes as an odds ratio and continuous outcomes as a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD).

Main Results

We included 15 studies with 498 participants. Ten studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural intervention or no intervention. Five studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural intervention to minimal intervention. One study compared behavioural intervention to minimal intervention. Risk of bias varied: eight studies had adequate sequence generation, seven had adequate clinician or outcome assessor blinding, seven had adequate allocation concealment, six had complete outcome data and six were free of selective reporting. No studies assessed the fertility primary outcomes of live birth or miscarriage. No studies reported the secondary reproductive outcome of menstrual regularity, as defined in this review. Lifestyle intervention may improve a secondary (endocrine) reproductive outcome, the free androgen index (FAI) (MD -1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.96 to -0.26, 6 RCTs, N = 204, I² = 71%, low-quality evidence). Lifestyle intervention may reduce weight (kg) (MD -1.68 kg, 95% CI -2.66 to -0.70, 9 RCTs, N = 353, I² = 47%, low-quality evidence). Lifestyle intervention may reduce body mass index (BMI) (kg/m²) (-0.34 kg/m², 95% CI -0.68 to -0.01, 12 RCTs, N = 434, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of lifestyle intervention on glucose tolerance (glucose outcomes in oral glucose tolerance test) (mmol/L/minute) (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.33, 3 RCTs, N = 121, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Lifestyle intervention may improve the free androgen index (FAI), weight and BMI in women with PCOS. We are uncertain of the effect of lifestyle intervention on glucose tolerance. There were no studies that looked at the effect of lifestyle intervention on live birth, miscarriage or menstrual regularity. Most studies in this review were of low quality mainly due to high or unclear risk of bias across most domains and high heterogeneity for the FAI outcome.

Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or at risk: When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS, it is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies; shared decision-making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence; natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side effects, cost, and availability; the relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines; the relative and absolute contraindications and side effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion; and PCOS specific features, such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors, need to be considered.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: diagnosis and treatment [^112dkrff]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 6%-7% of reproductive-aged women, making it the most common endocrine disorder in this population. It is characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Affected women may present with reproductive manifestations such as irregular menses or infertility, or cutaneous manifestations, including hirsutism, acne, or male-pattern hair loss. Over the past decade, several serious metabolic complications also have been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome including type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, and possibly cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition to treating symptoms by regulating menstrual cycles and improving hyperandrogenism, it is imperative that clinicians recognize and treat metabolic complications. Lifestyle therapies are first-line treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, particularly if they are overweight. Pharmacological therapies are also available and should be tailored on an individual basis. This article reviews the diagnosis, clinical manifestations, metabolic complications, and treatment of the syndrome. A table summarizing treatment recommendations is provided.

### Lifestyle changes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112DZkRb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 4% to 18% of reproductive-aged women and is associated with reproductive, metabolic and psychological dysfunction. Obesity worsens the presentation of PCOS and weight management (weight loss, maintenance or prevention of excess weight gain) is proposed as an initial treatment strategy, best achieved through lifestyle changes incorporating diet, exercise and behavioural interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment in improving reproductive, anthropometric (weight and body composition), metabolic and quality of life factors in PCOS.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED) (date of last search 7/9/2010), controlled trials register, conference abstracts, relevant journals, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews and grey literature databases, with no language restrictions applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing lifestyle treatment (diet, exercise, behavioural or combined treatments) to minimal or no treatment in women with PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Six studies were included with n = 164 participants. Three studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural advice or no advice. Three studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural interventions to minimal intervention. Risk of bias varied with 4/6 having adequate sequence generation and clinician or outcome assessor blinding and 3/6 having adequate allocation concealment, complete outcome data and being free of selective reporting. There were no studies assessing the fertility primary outcomes of pregnancy, live birth and miscarriage and no data for meta-analysis on ovulation or menstrual regularity. Lifestyle intervention provided benefits when compared to minimal treatment for secondary reproductive, anthropometric and reproductive outcomes. These included endpoint values for total testosterone (mean difference (MD) -0.27 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.09, P = 0.004), hirsutism or excess hair growth by the Ferriman-Gallwey score (MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.35 to -0.03, P = 0.04), weight (MD -3.47 kg, 95% CI -4.94 to -2.00, P < 0.00001), waist circumference (MD -1.95 cm, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.57, P = 0.006) and fasting insulin (MD -2.02 µU/mL, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.77, P = 0.002). There was no evidence of effect of lifestyle for body mass index, free androgen index, sex hormone binding globulin, glucose or cholesterol levels; and no data for quality of life, patient satisfaction or acne.

Authors' Conclusions

Lifestyle intervention improves body composition, hyperandrogenism (high male hormones and clinical effects) and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. There was no evidence of effect for lifestyle intervention on improving glucose tolerance or lipid profiles and no literature assessing clinical reproductive outcomes, quality of life and treatment satisfaction.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities [^111NnsYL]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic goals

Difficulty in losing weight, irregular menses, infertility, and excessive hair growth were the most important health problems reported by patients with polycystic ovary syndrome in an international survey. These problems should therefore represent the main targets for therapeutic intervention, although priority setting partnerships are still needed to help focus research priorities. Existing drug treatments have not been licensed specifically for polycystic ovary syndrome and are used off-label to target symptoms. Also, previous studies have not emphasised health related quality of life measures when evaluating response to treatment. An ideal treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome should look at the health risks, reduce key processes in the pathogenesis of the disease, and be responsive to the symptom profile and needs of the individual. Where relevant, treatments should reduce clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, restore ovulatory cycles and fertility, normalise the length of the menstrual cycle, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce weight and cardiometabolic risk, and improve condition specific quality of life.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lifestyle and weight management — In those with higher weight, weight management can be associated with significant clinical improvements and key points need to be considered including a lifelong focus on prevention of further weight gain, a tailored energy deficit when weight loss is the goal, the value of improvement in central adiposity or metabolic health, and the need for ongoing assessment and support. Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight stigma when discussing lifestyle management with women with PCOS. Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management, in the context of structured, intensive, and ongoing clinical support, appears equally effective in PCOS as in the general population. In those who are not overweight, in the adolescent and at key life points, the focus should be on healthy lifestyle and the prevention of excess weight gain. Although insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in PCOS, clinically available insulin assays are of limited clinical relevance and should not be used in routine care.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113JbPEF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin resistance to type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and it is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising agents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic aspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential therapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices. Incretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that could be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures have become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal of metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment targeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese women with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1 agonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic options for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological features between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is the potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in parallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.

### Off-label drug use in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111yzysJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex lifelong disorder with an etiology and pathophysiology that is not yet entirely understood. Women with PCOS have clinical presentations that may vary from adolescence to menopause, including menstrual irregularity/anovulation and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as acne and hirsutism. Over a lifetime, treatment needs and requirements can change. Unfortunately, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications that are approved solely for the purpose of PCOS, but the symptoms and presentation of PCOS are often amenable to several approved agents, such as oral contraceptives for the indication of acne and clomiphene citrate for the indication of induction of ovulation. However, to meet the needs of women with PCOS, off-label use of medications has flourished. This review explores the data for those agents that do not carry an indication for PCOS but have been used for treating the signs and symptoms of PCOS.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112dxxiT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: −1.59 [−3.06, −0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (−2.11 μU/ml [−3.97, −0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and −1.12 [−1.44, −0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (−0.93, [−3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [−0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (−3.48 [−4.58, −2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (−0.30 ng/ml [−0.50, −0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (−0.29 nmol/l [−0.52, −0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111PxC7f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Letrozole is the preferred first line pharmacological infertility therapy, with clomiphene in combination with metformin; gonadotrophins or ovarian surgery primarily having a role as second line therapy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be offered, potentially with in vitro maturation, as third line therapy, where other ovulation induction therapies have failed and in the absence of an absolute indication for IVF in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Given the underlying risk for pregnancy complications in PCOS, single embryo transfer should be preferred.

Overall, evidence in PCOS is low to moderate quality. Based on high prevalence and significant health impact, greater priority, education, models of care, funding, and research are recommended. Guideline translation will be extensive including multilingual education outputs and evidence-based resources for consumers (the ASKPCOS app), healthcare professionals and policy makers.

The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however a clear process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available by contacting the author for correspondence online. The translation program will be free and internationally accessible, building on the existing range of codesigned resources including the patient focused, evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), used in 186 countries and based on a rigorously developed question prompt list. Multi-faceted patient codesigned resources will aim to enhance health literacy with comprehensive PCOS-related health information available in multiple formats and in 15–20 languages. Internationally accessible resources include education modules for healthcare professionals at different career stages and disciplines, healthcare professional accredited courses, practice resources and tools, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources that will be available online. Importantly, the Guideline and translation of the Guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, of accessible evidence-based information and of improved multi-disciplinary support. Ultimately, this international initiative may serve as an exemplar for large scale collaborative engagement, pooling of resources, avoidance of duplication and inconsistency with consensus-based statements, and codesign of best quality consistent guidelines with processes for local adaption and healthcare impact. Key elements include extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation, consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation, and evaluation. We sincerely thank the partner and collaborating organizations, consumer groups and members of the GDGs for their substantive commitment to the international partnership to optimize health outcomes for women with this common, heterogeneous, and much neglected condition.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: "Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion", whereas "the Rotterdam definition… allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^116nbmP1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

During adolescence, accurate diagnostic criteria and/or identification of adolescents "at risk" of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are critical to establish appropriate screening, treatment, and lifelong health plans. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS aimed to provide the most up-to-date evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes for individuals with PCOS, emphasizing accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS from adolescence.

Methods

The best practice methods following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) criteria were applied. Healthcare professionals and patients/consumers reviewed extensive evidence synthesis/meta-analysis for 55 prioritized clinical questions. Databases (OVID MEDLINE, All EBM, PsycInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched until August 2022 as part of the 2023 update of the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework guided experts on evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength.

Results

This manuscript focuses on the adolescent-specific recommendations of the 2023 Guideline. The diagnosis is based on the presence of both irregular menstrual cycles (defined according to the time postmenarche) and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. Adolescents with only one of these features can be considered "at risk" of PCOS requiring the management of symptoms and ongoing follow-up. Polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasonography or anti-Müllerian hormone levels should not be used for diagnosis during adolescence. Lifelong health planning is recommended to include healthy lifestyles, screening for depression and metabolic features and the transition to adult care, all underpinned by shared decision-making. Healthcare professionals should explain weight-related health risks to adolescents, while minimizing weight stigma. In adolescents with PCOS or "at risk" of PCOS, combined oral contraceptive pills are indicated for menstrual irregularity and clinical hyperandrogenism, focusing on low dose preparations, and metformin could be considered for metabolic features and cycle regulation. Overall, the evidence is limited in adolescents with PCOS, and recommendations are based on low to moderate certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement and rigorous processes generated International Guideline diagnostic criteria for adolescents that differ from adult criteria and clarified appropriate screening and management strategies for PCOS during adolescence.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: a metabolic disorder with therapeutic opportunities [^1134LYus]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by intertwined reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. While its causal origins remain incompletely understood, accumulating evidence suggests metabolic dysfunctions-manifested by insulin resistance, obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia-as key contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of PCOS. Emerging interventions targeting these metabolic disturbances, including caloric restriction, GLP-1-based therapies, and bariatric surgery, have shown efficacy in alleviating PCOS symptoms and potentially blocking their inheritance. By addressing the metabolic roots and therapeutic opportunities in PCOS, this perspective highlights a critical shift in fundamentally recognizing PCOS as a metabolic disorder. The future promises more metabolic-focused research to unravel the underlying pathogenesis and develop precise, long-term strategies for managing this complex disease.

### Treatment of obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome: a position statement of the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society [^113b8a35]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize current evidence on lifestyle management (dietary, exercise, or behavioral interventions) of obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to indicate gaps in knowledge, and to review the medical and surgical alternatives for weight management.

Design

Expert panel appointed by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AEPCOS Society) to review the literature and draft the initial report after a consensus process via electronic communication. The initial report was reviewed and critiqued by all expert panel members and the AEPCOS Society Board of Directors and modified based on their comments.

Conclusion(S)

Lifestyle management should be used as the primary therapy in overweight and obese women with PCOS for the treatment of metabolic complications. For reproductive abnormalities, lifestyle modification may improve ovulatory function and pregnancy. Data are preliminary for improvement in pregnancy and live-birth rates, and further research is needed. There is currently no evidence that modifying dietary macronutrient composition offers additional benefits over conventional dietary approaches for weight loss, and further research is needed. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise offers additional benefits to dietary energy restriction for reproductive features of PCOS.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112c5kMa]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: -1.59 [-3.06, -0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (-2.11 μU/ml [-3.97, -0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and -1.12 [-1.44, -0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (-0.93, [-3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [-0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (-3.48 [-4.58, -2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (-0.30 ng/ml [-0.50, -0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (-0.29 nmol/l [-0.52, -0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

### Drug treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome [^1129czrJ]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition present in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age. Diagnosis can be difficult because the signs and symptoms can be subtle and varied. These may include hirsutism, infertility, menstrual irregularities, and biochemical abnormalities, most notably insulin resistance. Treatment should target specific manifestations and individualized patient goals. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians must take into account comorbidities and the patient's desire for pregnancy. Lifestyle modifications should be used in addition to medical treatments for optimal results. Few agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for use in polycystic ovary syndrome, and several agents are contraindicated in pregnancy. Insulin-sensitizing agents are indicated for most women with polycystic ovary syndrome because they have positive effects on insulin resistance, menstrual irregularities, anovulation, hirsutism, and obesity. Metformin has the most data supporting its effectiveness. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also effective for ameliorating hirsutism and insulin resistance. Metformin and clomiphene, alone or in combination, are first-line agents for ovulation induction. Insulin-sensitizing agents, oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and topical eflornithine can be used in patients with hirsutism.

3.1–3.2 Values and preferences

In evaluating the benefits and risks of HC treatment in women with PCOS, we believed concerns related to untreated menstrual dysfunction and quality of life related to anovulatory bleeding and hirsutism to be the primary considerations. Screening recommendations follow the current World Health Organization and CDC medical eligibility guidelines (Table 6). In making these recommendations, the committee strongly believes that larger controlled studies should be performed to evaluate the risk of long-term HC use in women with PCOS, particularly in the presence of obesity, IR, and lipid disorders. There are insufficient data about whether women with PCOS face increased risk of thromboembolism on particular HC preparations, although preparations may vary with respect to thromboembolic risk in the general population. There are insufficient data to define the optimal duration of treatment with HCs. Women with severe hirsutism or contraindications to hormonal contraception may require other therapies such as antiandrogens (spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, etc) or mechanical hair removal (laser, electrolysis, etc) (see hirsutism guidelines in Ref.).

Role of exercise in lifestyle therapy

3.3 We suggest the use of exercise therapy in the management of overweight and obesity in PCOS (2|⊕⊕○○). Although there are no large randomized trials of exercise in PCOS, exercise therapy, alone or in combination with dietary intervention, improves weight loss and reduces cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes risk in the general population.

3.3 Evidence

It is well recognized in the general population that cardiovascular fitness, as measured by maximal oxygen consumption during exercise, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. This remains significant after adjustment for age, smoking, cholesterol measures, diabetes, hypertension, and family history of cardiovascular disease. Overall, there is good evidence in the general population that metabolic status is improved with exercise alone, and this reduces the risk of diabetes. Thirty minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity is effective in reducing the development of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. There are few trials of exercise therapy targeting women with PCOS, and no large randomized trials are available, but there is a suggestion of weight loss, improved ovulation, and decreased IR.

3.3 Values and preferences

Despite the limited evidence in PCOS, we suggest that the benefits of exercise in improving metabolic disease are strong enough to favor its recommendation, despite a paucity of controlled trials available for review.

### International PCOS guideline clinical research priorities roadmap: a co-designed approach aligned with end-user priorities in a neglected women's health condition [^114mzMWD]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy with significant reproductive, metabolic, and psychological complications. Consensus on PCOS clinical research priorities across end-users is fundamental and necessitates a robust co-development of a clinical research roadmap to guide international research efforts.

Methods

A multistage process included: i) international surveys of women and healthcare providers to identify research priorities and unmet needs; ii) interrogation of systematic reviews conducted for the International PCOS Guideline to identify research gaps; iii) International PCOS Guideline Network consensus generated clinical research roadmap; and iv) international peer review for external validation.

Findings

A codesigned survey engaging 1278 women with PCOS and 1474 healthcare providers found general concordance on research priorities. International PCOS Guideline development processes identified gaps in the literature and coproduced over 150 research priorities throughout the women's life course, affirmed in international peer review. Key themes included: 1) Optimizing PCOS diagnosis; understanding natural history across diverse populations and life stages; detecting and preventing complications, and integrating and interrogating large data assets; 2) developing evidence-based resources, exploring optimal modes for information provision and models of care; 3) exploring effective lifestyle and weight management strategies; minimising weight stigma; 4) exploring intervention effects (including treatment efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and long-term follow-up) on diverse features of PCOS across subgroups; and 5) optimising preconception care and fertility treatments in PCOS.

Interpretation

This rigorously coproduced International PCOS Guideline clinical research roadmap addresses stakeholder priorities to guide future clinical research in this common yet neglected condition. The roadmap complements the established PCOS Core Outcome Set to enhance research quality, and tackles evidence-practice gaps to improve health outcomes for women with PCOS throughout their life course.

Funding

The survey, International PCOS Guideline Network and 2018 and 2023 International PCOS Guidelines were funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centres of Research excellence in PCOS (APP1078444) and in Women's Health in Reproductive life (APP1171592).

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^1177QWCw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Metformin, a synthetic biguanide, is widely used to manage type 2 diabetes, and is commonly prescribed in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to address insulin resistance and associated metabolic and reproductive disturbances. PCOS is characterised by hormonal imbalances such as hyperandrogenism and anovulation, metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance and increased cardiometabolic risk, and higher rates of pregnancy complications. However, the role of metformin in the multifaceted nature of PCOS remains debated. This review synthesises the mechanisms of action of metformin and its effects on metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, and pregnancy‐related outcomes in PCOS. In non‐pregnant women, metformin improves insulin resistance, menstrual regularity, and androgen levels, particularly in those with obesity or insulin resistance, and may enhance fertility when combined with other treatments. However, it is not effective as a first‐line therapy for weight loss, ovulation induction, or treatment of clinical hyperandrogenic features, including hirsutism or acne. In pregnancy, metformin may reduce early pregnancy loss, miscarriage, and preterm birth, though findings for gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are inconsistent. Evidence is limited by study heterogeneity, varying diagnostic criteria, and the use of aggregate data in meta‐analyses, all of which make interpretation challenging. Future research should prioritise well‐powered clinical trials, individual patient data meta‐analyses, and longer‐term follow‐up studies, particularly in pregnancy, to better define the populations most likely to benefit from metformin use across the PCOS spectrum.

Plain Language Summary

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects up to 1 in 10 women of reproductive age. It is characterised by irregular or absent periods, signs of elevated male hormones (high androgens or excess hair growth), and/or polycystic ovaries seen on ultrasound. These features can lead to fertility problems, acne, psychological distress, and an increased risk of various disorders such as depression, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Many women with PCOS also experience challenges during pregnancy, including a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes.
Metformin is a medication most often used to manage diabetes. In women with PCOS, it can help improve how the body responds to insulin, which may also reduce male hormone levels, improve menstrual cycles, and support fertility. This review examines the role of metformin in treating PCOS — both before and during pregnancy — by summarising key findings from the available evidence.
In women who are not pregnant, metformin can help improve insulin resistance, hormone levels, and menstrual regularity, particularly among those who are overweight or have signs of insulin resistance. However, metformin alone is not a first‐choice treatment for weight loss, ovulation problems, or symptoms such as acne and unwanted hair growth. When combined with other treatments, such as hormone therapy or fertility medications, it may offer additional benefits.
During pregnancy, metformin is considered safe for use in women with PCOS and may lower the risk of early pregnancy loss and preterm birth. However, its effects on preventing gestational diabetes or high blood pressure are less clear, with mixed results across studies. Some research suggests that babies exposed to metformin in the womb may have slightly larger head sizes or a higher risk of being overweight in early childhood, but the long‐term health effects remain unknown.
Overall, metformin can be a helpful part of treatment for some women with PCOS, especially those with insulin resistance or certain pregnancy risks. Still, it is not a one‐size‐fits‐all solution. More high‐quality research is needed to better understand which women benefit most and to assess any long‐term effects on children exposed to metformin during pregnancy.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) blog… [^114cJqtM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. PCOS is a common hormonal condition affecting more than 10% of women who may have symptoms of high male hormone levels and irregular cycles. The three clinical criteria of PCOS are: How is PCOS treated. There is no single treatment that works for all women with PCOS. Typically, treatment is used to relieve specific PCOS symptoms. For example, oral contraceptives can be used to manage menstrual cycles. Certain medications may also help control unwanted hair growth. Laser hair removal or electrolysis is also helpful in some cases. Metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, are linked to an increased risk of diabetes and treatment with medicine like metformin may be helpful. Lifestyle modification
- which includes dietary changes and physical activity, may improve certain aspects of PCOS and is still considered a primary treatment. Fertility concerns are usually best treated with medicines that promote ovulation.

Is it possible to reduce the risk of developing PCOS. Right now, we don't have proof that any certain treatment can stop the development of PCOS since the risk of developing PCOS is likely predetermined by genetics. Avoiding weight gain, particularly in adolescence and early adulthood, may help reduce the risk of developing PCOS symptoms. Can you have a healthy pregnancy with PCOS. Absolutely. While there is an increased risk of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and possible preterm delivery described with PCOS pregnancies, most pregnancies occur without complications. Again, pre-pregnancy planning is important. Living a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep before getting pregnant will likely be beneficial in the early stages of pregnancy. Interestingly, losing weight prior to pregnancy for those who are of higher weight has not been associated with improved pregnancy rates.

Overall, living a healthy lifestyle is associated with lower pregnancy risks. What are some misconceptions about PCOS. The most common misconception is that PCOS is caused by, or associated with, ovarian cysts. Even though "cystic" is in the name, cysts are not the cause or a symptom of PCOS. Another misconception is that patients with PCOS will never conceive. This is not true. Many women with PCOS can become pregnant on their own, without intervention. Those with fertility concerns often conceive successfully with treatment.
