## Question

What is the maximum recommended dose of Flomax?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the maximum recommended dose of Flomax (tamsulosin) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative dosing source, which is the FDA-approved prescribing information. Then, I should verify the standard starting dose and the criteria and timing for dose escalation. Next, I will determine the explicit maximum recommended dose and cross-check it with other FDA drug information sources. After that, I need to consider safety trade-offs at higher doses and any pharmacokinetic interactions that could influence dosing. Finally, I will confirm administration instructions and what to do if therapy is interrupted, and then summarize a clear final answer [^111Ajb81].

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing regimen. The FDA label for Flomax recommends 0.4 mg once daily for BPH symptoms, taken approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day, and the capsules should not be crushed, chewed, or opened; for patients without adequate response after 2 to 4 weeks, the dose can be increased to 0.8 mg once daily [^111Ajb81].

> Now, I need to check the maximum dose explicitly. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does the label cap the dose at 0.8 mg and specify once-daily administration? Yes, the FDA labeling indicates a dose range of 0.4–0.8 mg once daily, establishing 0.8 mg once daily as the maximum recommended dose for BPH treatment, which is corroborated by FDA SPL dosing summaries listing maintenance 0.4–0.8 mg PO daily [^111Ajb81] [^117XDM2x].

> Wait, is there any circumstance where tamsulosin is used twice daily at 0.8 mg total that might imply a different maximum or frequency? I should double-check. Some long-term extension studies described maintenance doses as 0.4 mg or 2 × 0.4 mg daily, which corresponds to a total daily dose of 0.8 mg, not exceeding the labeled maximum, and does not change that the approved dosing frequency is once daily per the U.S. label; so the maximum approved exposure remains 0.8 mg per day, once daily [^111SKnvg] [^111Ajb81].

> Next, I should review safety considerations at higher doses. Let me think about dose-related adverse effects — dizziness and orthostatic hypotension tend to increase with higher tamsulosin doses; systematic and trial-level evidence has shown more withdrawals and adverse effects with higher doses, and observational pharmacoepidemiology highlights early-treatment windows with higher hypotension risk, reinforcing caution when escalating to 0.8 mg, especially in older adults or those at fall risk [^112JtBbt] [^114vMZ5Q] [^117T7Cqx].

> I need to ensure I consider drug–drug interactions that could effectively increase exposure beyond what is intended at a given dose. Hold on, I should verify CYP interactions: tamsulosin is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and strong CYP3A4 inhibition (for example, ketoconazole) roughly doubles exposure; the label advises that Flomax 0.4 mg should not be used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and cautions about increased exposure with strong CYP2D6 inhibition, so pushing to 0.8 mg in the presence of such inhibitors would risk supratherapeutic exposure and hypotension; this pharmacokinetic context supports adhering to the 0.8 mg ceiling and sometimes not escalating at all when interactions are present [^114LnaAW] [^111Ajb81].

> I should confirm administration nuances and what to do if therapy is interrupted. If Flomax is discontinued or interrupted for several days at either 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg, therapy should be restarted at 0.4 mg once daily and then titrated again if needed; consistent administration about 30 minutes after the same meal optimizes absorption and tolerability, and capsules should remain intact to preserve the controlled absorption characteristics [^111Ajb81].

> Let me cross-check the therapeutic role contextually, even though guidelines don't stipulate the maximum dose themselves. Urological guidelines endorse alpha-1 blockers as first-line for moderate-to-severe LUTS/BPH, and they generally rely on product labeling for dose ranges, aligning with the FDA's 0.4–0.8 mg daily framework; this supports that 0.8 mg daily is the practical and recommended ceiling in routine care [^116VJAZ4] [^113KWhdq].

> Final answer — let me state this clearly, and I should double-check I've included the key administration details. The maximum recommended dose of Flomax (tamsulosin) is 0.8 mg once daily, administered approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day; if there is inadequate response to 0.4 mg after 2–4 weeks, you may increase to 0.8 mg once daily, and if therapy is interrupted for several days, restart at 0.4 mg once daily before re-escalating as needed [^111Ajb81] [^117XDM2x].

---

The maximum recommended dose of Flomax (tamsulosin) is **0.8 mg once daily** [^111Ajb81] for patients who do not respond to the initial 0.4 mg dose after 2–4 weeks [^117XDM2x]. If therapy is interrupted for several days, **restart at 0.4 mg once daily** [^111Ajb81]. Do not exceed **0.8 mg daily** because of the increased risk of adverse effects [^112JtBbt], particularly hypotension [^111RJL4i] and dizziness [^114vMZ5Q].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Initial dose**: 0.4 mg once daily [^117XDM2x], taken approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day [^111Ajb81].
- **Dose escalation**: If no response after 2–4 weeks, increase to 0.8 mg once daily [^111Ajb81].
- **Administration**: Swallow capsules whole; do not crush, chew, or open [^111Ajb81].
- **Interruption**: If stopped for several days [^111Ajb81], restart at 0.4 mg once daily.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting maximum dose

Clinical trials show that **0.8 mg daily** improves urinary symptoms and flow in BPH but is associated with **higher adverse event rates** [^112JtBbt] than 0.4 mg. The **0.8 mg dose** is reserved for patients with an inadequate response to 0.4 mg [^111Ajb81].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

Increasing to 0.8 mg **raises the risk of adverse effects**, notably:

- **Hypotension**: Orthostatic hypotension and syncope [^111RJL4i], especially early in therapy or after dose increases [^114vMZ5Q].
- **Dizziness**: Dose-dependent [^112JtBbt]; higher at 0.8 mg than 0.4 mg [^114vMZ5Q].
- **Ejaculatory disorders**: Including anejaculation and retrograde ejaculation [^113YLFQL].
- **Other effects**: Headache [^113YLFQL], rhinitis, fatigue, and rare priapism [^117T7Cqx].

---

## Patient populations requiring caution or dose adjustment

Certain patients need **careful monitoring or dose adjustment**:

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of hypotension and falls [^111RJL4i]; monitor closely [^114vMZ5Q].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution; no specific adjustment provided [^112oanHs].
- **Renal impairment**: No adjustment needed in mild to moderate impairment [^1163dd9b].
- **CYP3A4/CYP2D6 inhibitors**: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole); use caution with moderate inhibitors [^114LnaAW] [^111Ajb81].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines recommend alpha-blockers, including tamsulosin, as **first-line therapy** [^116VJAZ4] for moderate-to-severe LUTS/BPH [^113KWhdq]. For inadequate responders to 0.4 mg, the **0.8 mg dose** [^111Ajb81] is appropriate, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^112JtBbt].

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: Risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^111RJL4i]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

We observed an increased rate ratio for severe hypotension requiring admission to the hospital with tamsulosin treatment. The greatest increase in risk — varying in magnitude from 151% to 256% — was observed during the first eight weeks of new drug use and the first eight weeks after restarting drug treatment. A smaller increase in risk for hypotension, varying from 19% to 36%, persisted during maintenance tamsulosin treatment.

Antagonism of α1 adrenoreceptors by tamsulosin relaxes the smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to improve urine flow rate and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although hypertension is not an approved indication for tamsulosin, α blockers are also known to decrease systemic vascular resistance and reduce blood pressure. Clinical trials observed a 12% incidence for orthostatic hypotension among patients taking 0.4 mg tamsulosin, and a 6% incidence among patients taking placebo between four to eight hours after dosing; however, no treatment emergent hypotensive events were observed. In these trials, patients were retained at the treating site for eight hours after the first dose and received counseling on the effects of orthostatic hypotension. This environment may not apply to treatment practice in the real world.

Three currently approved selective α1 adrenergic antagonists (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) have black-boxed warnings for severe hypotension and syncope, particularly at the first dose. Tamsulosin has a warning for hypotension, but without a black box or information on a potential first dose phenomenon. Our data add insights into the risk profiles associated with tamsulosin treatment.

### Flomax [^111Ajb81]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Flomax capsules at a dose of 0.4 mg once daily are recommended for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). They should be administered approximately one-half hour following the same meal each day. Flomax capsules should not be crushed, chewed, or opened.

For patients who fail to respond to the 0.4 mg dose after 2 to 4 weeks of dosing, the dose can be increased to 0.8 mg once daily. Flomax capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

If administration of Flomax capsules is discontinued or interrupted for several days at either the 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg dose, therapy should be restarted with the 0.4 mg once-daily dose.

### Flomax [^114LnaAW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Cytochrome P450 inhibition**: Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

	- **Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6**: Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of Flomax have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when Flomax 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, Flomax capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of Flomax have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Dutasteride plus tamsulosin fixed-dose combination first-line therapy versus tamsulosin monotherapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a budget impact analysis in the Greek healthcare setting [^117HRZur]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The results section details the analysis of resource utilization, clinical outcomes, cost outputs, and sensitivity analysis.

- **Resource utilization**: Table 2 demonstrates the resource utilization of BPH patients, affirmed by an expert panel to be consistent across both social and private healthcare settings. Patients are treated and followed up directly by urologists for all prostate-related complications, while visits to general practitioners (GPs) are limited to remote areas.

- **Clinical outcomes**: Table 3 presents the clinical outcomes of the gradual introduction of dutasteride plus tamsulosin fixed-dose combination (DUT + TAM FDC) over a 4-year time horizon.

- **Cost outputs**: The analysis includes two scenarios:

	- **Public sector scenario**: Table 4 illustrates the total economic impact from the gradual introduction of DUT + TAM FDC on various cost components of BPH disease management, such as consultations, surgery, acute urinary retention (AUR) costs, and drug costs in the public sector.

	- **Private sector scenario**: Table 5 presents the total economic impact of the gradual introduction of DUT + TAM FDC on the various cost components of BPH disease management, including consultations, surgery, AUR costs, and drug costs in the private sector.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: In assessing the impact of uncertainty of various model inputs, univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted on two variables contributing to the cost of treatment: eligible patient population and higher success rates of transurethral resections of the prostate (TURPs). The prevalence of BPH was allowed to vary by ± 10% in one-way sensitivity analysis.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116kJyi5]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods: Study design**: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1992 to July 2018), EMBASE (1995 to July 2018), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register to collect studies investigating the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride versus tamsulosin alone in treating BPH. The search formula was as follows: "tamsulosin, dutasteride, BPH, and RCT". All articles were browsed and read independently by two authors, and if there were any objections, they were referred to a third person for examination. The study was limited to published research with no language restrictions. If the study was a review or summary presented at a meeting, it was excluded. Authors were contacted to provide further information from their research if necessary. Furthermore, the search was also performed to investigate relevant references from the retrieved studies.

- **Inclusion criteria and trial selection**: RCTs that met the following criteria were included: (1) The combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride versus tamsulosin alone in treating BPH was evaluated; (2) Full-text content and related data could be obtained; (3) The study provided accurate data that could be analyzed, mainly including the total number of subjects and the valuable results of each indicator; (4) The article was a randomized controlled study; (5) Treatment duration was greater than or equal to 1 year. If the identical experiment was published in different journals, it was…

### Efficacy and safety of solifenacin plus tamsulosin OCAS in men with voiding and storage lower urinary tract symptoms: Results from a phase 2, dose-finding study (SATURN) [^115LJ8bo]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Storage symptoms are often undertreated in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

- **Objective**: To evaluate the combination of an antimuscarinic (solifenacin) with an α-blocker (tamsulosin) versus tamsulosin alone in the treatment of men with LUTS.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A double-blind, 12-week, phase 2 study was conducted involving 937 men with LUTS lasting for at least 3 months, a total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 13 or greater, and a maximum urinary flow rate between 4.0 and 15.0 ml/s.

- **Intervention**: The study involved eight treatment groups: tamsulosin oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) 0.4 mg; solifenacin at doses of 3, 6, or 9 mg; solifenacin at 3, 6, or 9 mg combined with tamsulosin OCAS 0.4 mg; or placebo.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in total IPSS. Secondary endpoints included micturition diary and quality-of-life (QoL) parameters. Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed based on baseline storage symptom severity, with statistical comparisons presented only for tamsulosin OCAS alone versus combination therapy due to the small sample size of the solifenacin monotherapy and placebo subgroups.

- **Results and limitations**: Combination therapy showed significant improvements in micturition frequency and voided volume compared to tamsulosin OCAS alone in the total study population; however, improvements in total IPSS were not significant. Statistically significant improvements were observed in urgency episodes, micturition frequency, total urgency score, voided volume, IPSS storage subscore, IPSS-QoL index, and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition in a subset of the study population.

Comparison with other studies

A study in the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system used data mining strategies of spontaneous reports to assess potential safety signals with α adrenergic antagonists. Concern for dizziness or vertigo and orthostatic hypotension were raised for tamsulosin in addition to alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin. A recent Cochrane review also found higher rates of dizziness with larger tamsulosin dosages (0.8 mg, 17% dizziness; 0.4 mg, 9%; 0.2 mg, 3%), suggesting a dose dependent effect.

In a prospective cohort study of 5872 participants, Parsons and colleagues found a significantly increased risk of falls at one year in community dwelling men aged 65 years and older with moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms, based on the validated American Urological Association symptom index. But they did not find any difference when stratifying patients on the basis of use of urological drug treatments. However, all urological drugs were grouped together in the analysis (α blockers, 5ARIs, anticholinergics), and more importantly, drug use was only collected at baseline — therefore, a first dose phenomenon could not be assessed. The population-based case-control study by Jacobsen and colleagues found an increased risk of hip fractures among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia taking α blockers but not 5ARIs. Notably, this risk was only observed in men initiating treatment with an α blocker within 30 days (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.49). Our study suggests that this increased risk of hip fractures with α blockers is significant.

### Pumpkin seed oil (Cucurbita pepo) versus tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia symptom relief: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^115pCX4j]. BMC Urology (2021). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common age-dependent chronic disease resulting from the progressive enlargement of the prostate gland due to the non-malignant proliferation of epithelial prostate cells and smooth muscle cells. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, including data from 25 countries, reported a lifetime prevalence of 26.2% for BPH. Patients with BPH become symptomatic when the tissue overgrowth around the urethra constricts its opening, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). These include incomplete urination, frequency, urgency, nocturia, and decreased urine flow. The prevalence of BPH-associated LUTS increases with age, with reports indicating that approximately 80% of men experience BPH-associated LUTS by the age of 70. However, not every man with BPH symptoms seeks medical attention; most often, BPH patients only seek medical care when BPH-associated LUTS become bothersome or intolerable.

There is a variety of treatment strategies for BPH symptoms depending on symptom severity, along with patient discomfort and preference. These treatment strategies include lifestyle alterations, medical therapy, and surgical treatment. Alpha-blockers, such as tamsulosin, are excellent first-line options for medical therapy. Recently, there has been an increasing tendency towards the use of herbal medicines for different medical conditions. Pumpkin (Cucurbita) seeds are traditionally known around the world for their remedial effects on urinary tract complications, such as nocturia, urinary frequency, and stress urinary incontinence.

### The use of alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists in lower urinary tract symptoms: beyond benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115ZWUqB]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The first empirical use of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists in urology occurred about 25 years ago in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or LUTS/BPH. Today, many randomized, controlled trials have provided evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists in LUTS/BPH, and they are the most frequently used initial treatment option for this cause of LUTS.

For many years, alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists have also been used empirically in other types of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD), such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and neurogenic LUTD (NLUTD). Several investigators have shown that alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists may be useful in patients with CP/CPPS. This was recently confirmed by a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin in 58 CP/CPPS patients. Further well-designed and well-powered research into the use of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists in patients with CP/CPPS is currently ongoing.

Several small-scale, predominantly open-label studies have suggested that alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists may be of benefit in patients with NLUTD. Data from two recent large-scale studies with tamsulosin in patients with NLUTD caused by suprasacral spinal cord injury suggest that long-term tamsulosin treatment improves bladder storage and emptying and also reduces symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. Tamsulosin has also shown promise in ameliorating early storage symptoms and urinary retention.

### Long-term, open-label, phase III multicenter study of tamsulosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111bhGYX]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of tamsulosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and to monitor changes in therapeutic response over time, this study was conducted. Tamsulosin is a uroselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist used for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. It targets alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptors of prostatic smooth muscle with greater affinity than the vascular alpha(1B) receptors. Since the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor subtype mediates prostatic smooth muscle tension, alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonists may reduce toxicity, causing fewer unwanted effects on blood pressure while providing effective treatment.

- **Methods**: This study extended two 13-week trials and one 40-week extension trial for an additional 64 weeks. On study entry, all patients (n = 949) received 0.4 mg/day tamsulosin. Baseline values were taken from either the previous trials for patients who had been treated with tamsulosin or the first visit of this study for patients not previously exposed to the drug. The primary efficacy parameters were changes in the total American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, mean peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), and the percentage of patients having 25% or greater improvement in the total AUA symptom score and 30% or more improvement in Qmax. Safety was assessed primarily based on the incidence and severity of adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events.

- **Results**: Improvements from baseline were observed in all primary efficacy parameters and were maintained throughout the study period.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1114xvuj]. BMC Urology (2019). High credibility.

The results of our research found 184 articles, and after reviewing the abstracts and titles, 150 articles were excluded. From the remaining 34 articles, we excluded 21 due to a lack of effective data, and one article because its focus on drug management was unclear. Eight articles described the same data and thus, 7 of these were excluded. Ultimately, 5 articles containing 5 RCTs were included to analyze the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride versus tamsulosin alone in treating BPH over a treatment cycle of at least 1 year.

- **Characteristics of individual studies**: The details of each study are summarized, showing that patients with symptomatic BPH exhibited similar evaluation indicators across studies.

- **Quality of the individual studies**: All studies included were randomized control trials, with two studies specifying a random protocol, and four studies having an appropriate calculation of sample size.

- **Note**: Table details and baseline characteristics are described without the tables being shown here. Abbreviations and their full forms include BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), 5ARI (5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor), and more. Data is presented as mean ± SD, but specific table details are not provided.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of tamsulosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111SKnvg]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

We evaluated the long-term (up to 6 years) safety and efficacy of the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

A total of 609 patients were enrolled in a 4-year multicenter open label extension study. Subjects entered the study after completion of a 1-year open label trial that included patients who had previously completed up to 57 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Maintenance doses (0.4 mg or 2 x 0.4 mg daily) established in the 1-year study were continued. Efficacy and safety were assessed every 3 months.

- **Primary efficacy evaluations**: Changes from baseline maximum urine flow rate and total American Urological Association symptom index, and the responder rates for these two endpoints.
- **Secondary endpoints**: Changes in American Urological Association subset scores, Boyarsky symptom scores, average urine flow rate, post-void residual urine volume, quality of life index, and investigator global assessment.

Of the 609 patients who entered the 4-year extension study, 159 had a 2-year or greater prior experience with tamsulosin, yielding a potential 6-year experience on the medication. Of this 159 patient subset, 109 completed the whole 6 years.

Initial rapid improvements from baseline in primary and secondary endpoints were maintained each year throughout the duration of the study. Tamsulosin was well tolerated, confirming the safety profile demonstrated in earlier studies. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 1.3% of patients.

### Non-surgical urologic management of neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury [^116RVmoP]. World Journal of Urology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for neurogenic bladder, specifically concerning alpha-blockers, the ICUD/SIU 2018 guidelines recommend considering the use of tamsulosin or other adrenergic blockers in combination with anticholinergics to improve bladder capacity and compliance in patients with spinal cord injury.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^115jqWEm]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the transition zone of the prostate that can cause lower urinary tract symptoms and could lead to bladder outlet obstruction in men. Lower urinary tract symptoms can include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitancy, or nocturia, and can result in a marked decrease in quality of life. It has been estimated that 50% of men in the United States over the age of 50 have this condition.

First-line medical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia consists of α1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (α blockers) and 5α reductase inhibitors (5ARIs). α blockers relieve bladder outlet obstruction by relaxing the periurethral prostatic smooth muscle and allowing for improved urinary flow. 5ARIs have been shown to reduce disease progression, prevent complications from benign prostatic hyperplasia, including acute urinary retention and prostate-related surgery, and improve lower urinary tract symptoms starting after six months of treatment. Although effective, when initiated, α blockers can induce marked orthostatic hypotension and syncope. This effect was labeled the "first dose phenomenon" by Bendall and colleagues in men using prazosin in 1975, and subsequently has been reported in antagonists to the α1 adrenergic receptor, terazosin and doxazosin. This effect is a consequence of inadvertent vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. A recent study found an increased risk of hip fracture among men taking α blockers but not 5ARIs, suggesting that it may have resulted from an increased risk of hypotension-induced falls.

### New alpha blockers to treat male lower urinary tract symptoms [^115JEVxR]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, it is unclear whether the selectivity of new alpha-blockers to alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes translates into more clinical benefits and fewer adverse effects in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review of the two new alpha-blockers, silodosin and naftopidil. With the availability of numerous alpha-blockers to treat lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia, the findings of this review will be highly relevant to the field of urology.

- **Recent findings**: Silodosin was found to be more effective than placebo in improving International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life scores and as effective as other alpha-blockers. Although the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events of silodosin was similar compared with placebo and other alpha-blockers (tamsulosin, naftopidil, alfuzosin), the sexual adverse events were more common with silodosin. No placebo-controlled randomized trial exists investigating the effects of naftopidil in men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Naftopidil had similar efficacy with regard to IPSS and quality of life compared with tamsulosin. The rate of adverse events was similar compared with tamsulosin.

- **Summary**: The two new selective alpha-blockers, silodosin, and naftopidil showed similar efficacy in IPSS and quality of life compared with other alpha-blockers. However, silodosin has more sexual adverse events.

### Avodart [^116KEDYr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Combination with alpha-blocker therapy (CombAT)**: The efficacy of combination therapy (Avodart 0.5 mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day, n = 1,610) was compared with Avodart alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611) in a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial. Trial entry criteria were similar to the double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy efficacy trials described in Section 14.1. Eighty-eight percent of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the combination group, 67% in the group receiving Avodart, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

- **Effect on symptom score**: Symptoms were quantified using the first seven questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), which are identical to the AUA-SI. The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24, the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for combination, -4.9 (± 6.81) for Avodart, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and Avodart of -1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.69, -0.86]), and between combination and tamsulosin of -1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.23, -1.40]).

### Cardura [^115PAvZW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

For the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), initiate therapy at 1 mg once daily. The dose may be titrated at 1 to 2-week intervals, up to 8 mg once daily.

For the treatment of hypertension, initiate therapy at 1 mg once daily. The dose may be titrated as needed, up to 16 mg once daily.

- **Dosing information**: Following the initial dose and with each dose increase of Cardura, monitor blood pressure for at least 6 hours following administration. If Cardura administration is discontinued for several days, therapy should be restarted using the initial dosing regimen.

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia**: The recommended initial dosage of Cardura is 1 mg given once daily, either in the morning or evening. Depending on the individual patient's urodynamics and BPH symptomatology, the dose may be titrated at 1 to 2-week intervals to 2 mg, and thereafter to 4 mg and 8 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose for BPH is 8 mg once daily. Routinely monitor blood pressure in these patients.

- **Hypertension**: The initial dosage of Cardura is 1 mg given once daily. The daily dosage may be doubled, up to 16 mg once daily, as needed, to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure.

### Cialis [^116MGY3n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Do not split CIALIS tablets; the entire dose should be taken.

- **Cialis for use as needed for erectile dysfunction**: The recommended starting dose of CIALIS for use as needed in most patients is 10 mg, taken prior to anticipated sexual activity. The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day in most patients. CIALIS for use as needed was shown to improve erectile function compared to placebo up to 36 hours following dosing; therefore, when advising patients on the optimal use of CIALIS, this should be taken into consideration.

- **Cialis for once daily use for erectile dysfunction**: The recommended starting dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 2.5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to the timing of sexual activity. The CIALIS dose for once daily use may be increased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability.

- **Cialis for once daily use for benign prostatic hyperplasia**: The recommended dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day. When therapy for BPH is initiated with CIALIS and finasteride, the recommended dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day for up to 26 weeks.

- **Cialis for once daily use for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia**: The recommended dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to the timing of sexual activity.

### The effects of dutasteride, tamsulosin and combination therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic enlargement: 2-year results from the CombAT study [^113cuh32]. The Journal of Urology (2008). High credibility.

We investigated whether combination therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin is more effective than either monotherapy alone for improving symptoms and long-term outcomes in men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement (30 cc or greater). This report presents preplanned 2-year analyses.

The CombAT study is an ongoing, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. Men aged 50 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia, an International Prostate Symptom Score of 12 points or greater, prostate volume of 30 cc or greater, total serum prostate-specific antigen of 1.5 ng/ml or greater to 10 ng/ml or less, and peak urinary flow greater than 5 to 15 mL per second or less with a minimum voided volume of 125 mL or greater were randomized to receive 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.4 mg tamsulosin, or the combination once daily for 4 years. Symptoms were assessed every 3 months and peak urinary flow was assessed every 6 months. The primary endpoint at 2 years was the change in International Prostate Symptom Score from baseline.

Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater improvements in symptoms compared to dutasteride from month 3 and tamsulosin from month 9, and in benign prostatic hyperplasia-related health status from months 3 and 12, respectively. There was a significantly greater improvement from baseline in peak urinary flow for combination therapy versus dutasteride and tamsulosin monotherapies from month 6. There was a significant increase in drug-related adverse events with combination therapy compared to monotherapies.

### Interaction between the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, tadalafil and 2 alpha-blockers, doxazosin and tamsulosin in healthy normotensive men [^116mmB2a]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is an effective therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with ED have a high incidence of comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are safe when administered with most medications, sildenafil combined with doxazosin and vardenafil with terazosin can evoke orthostatic hypotension in some patients. We examined the hemodynamic interactions of tadalafil with the alpha-blockers doxazosin and tamsulosin.

In separate double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover studies (18 patients in each study), we evaluated the hemodynamic effects of doxazosin 8 mg with tadalafil 20 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg with tadalafil 10 and 20 mg. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were recorded before dosing and for 24 hours after dosing.

Tadalafil 20 mg augmented the hypotensive effect of doxazosin by producing a mean maximal decrease in standing systolic BP (SBP) that was significantly greater than placebo (a mean difference of 9.8 mm Hg). Analysis of BP outliers showed that the number of subjects with a standing SBP of less than 85 mm Hg was greater after doxazosin plus tadalafil (28%) versus doxazosin plus placebo (6%). In subjects on tamsulosin, tadalafil 10 and 20 mg produced mean maximal decreases in standing SBP that were similar to placebo (mean difference of 1.7 and 2.3 mm Hg, respectively). No subject taking tamsulosin had a decrease in standing SBP less than 85 mm Hg.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117QgGFW]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Regarding clinical progression after drug administration, the combination therapy can markedly lower the risk of BPH-related symptom progression and acute urinary retention compared to tamsulosin monotherapy. In other BPH-related clinical progressions, such as urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, and renal insufficiency, no significant differences were found between the two treatment groups. Tamsulosin can selectively block the α1-adrenergic receptor in the prostate, which helps relax the smooth muscles of the prostate. This action expands the prostatic part of the urethra, alleviates urinary symptoms, and reduces the possibility of acute urinary retention. Meanwhile, 5ARI inhibits the growth of prostate volume by suppressing the generation of DHT and relieves pressure on the urethra caused by a large prostate gland. Consequently, the combined action of the two drugs results in a reduced risk of clinical progression.

Furthermore, the CombAT study demonstrated that the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride is more effective than monotherapy in improving clinical symptoms, with an IPSS difference of 0.4, and improving urine flow rate beginning at nine months of treatment. It is also superior to tamsulosin in reducing the incidence of urinary retention by 68% and the need for surgery by 71%, starting from eight months of treatment. Overall, while the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride offers preferable therapeutic effects for BPH, it is associated with a higher incidence of sexual side effects. However, the combination therapy can markedly reduce the risk of BPH-related symptom progression and acute urinary retention relative to tamsulosin monotherapy.

### Recommendations of apex health bodies remain localized: not in conformity with international implementation policy for urological disorders [^111z6zFY]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). Low credibility.

The prevalence of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) has been reported to increase with age, from 14.8% in younger males aged 40 to 36.8% in males aged 80 and above. Selective alpha-1-blockers are used to treat BPH and essential hypertension in older adults. While tachycardia and tremulousness are less common with selective alpha-1-blockers, they can cause first-dose hypotension, syncope, dizziness, and headache in older people, increasing the risk of falls. While the AUA remains silent, the EAU recommends these as the first-line medical treatment for BPH, whereas the STOPP/START criteria recommend avoiding them in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension or micturition syncope.

- **Drugs with anti-muscarinic and anti-cholinergic properties**: The incidence of anti-muscarinic drug use has been reported to increase with age. Various muscarinic receptor antagonists like darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, and tolterodine are licensed for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Some drugs, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antihistamines, with anticholinergic properties, have non-life-threatening side effects including dry mouth, constipation, dry/itchy eyes, blurred vision, dyspepsia, urinary tract infections, urinary retention, and impaired cognitive function. Rarely, life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmias have been reported.

The concurrent use of other anti-cholinergic medications may potentiate the side effects of the anti-muscarinic OAB medications. Consequently, these drugs should be prescribed with caution, and regular monitoring is advised.

### Solifenacin plus tamsulosin combination treatment in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction: a randomized controlled trial [^111spmtF]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Alpha blockers are prescribed to manage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Antimuscarinics are prescribed to treat overactive bladder (OAB).

- **Objective**: To investigate the safety of a combination of solifenacin (SOLI) and tamsulosin oral controlled absorption system (TOCAS) in men with LUTS and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in men aged over 45 years with LUTS and BOO for at least 3 months. These men had a total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of at least 8, a BOO index of at least 20, a maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)) of 12 ml/s or less, and a voided volume of at least 120 ml.

- **Interventions**: Participants received once-daily coadministration of TOCAS 0.4 mg plus SOLI 6 mg, TOCAS 0.4 mg plus SOLI 9 mg, or a placebo for 12 weeks.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: The primary safety measurements included Q(max) and detrusor pressure at Q(max) (P(det)Q(max)). Other safety assessments included postvoid residual (PVR) volume. Secondary end points included bladder contractile index (BCI) score and percent bladder voiding efficiency (BVE). An analysis of covariance model compared each TOCAS plus SOLI combination with placebo.

- **Results and limitations**: Both active treatment groups were noninferior to placebo at the end of treatment (EOT) for P(det)Q(max) and Q(max). The mean change from baseline PVR was significantly higher at all time points for TOCAS 0.4 mg plus SOLI 6 mg, and at weeks 2, 12, and EOT for TOCAS 0.4 mg plus SOLI 9 mg versus placebo. Both treatment groups were similar to placebo for BCI and BVE.

### Phase IIb/III dose ranging study of tamsulosin as treatment for children with neuropathic bladder [^111sBSL3]. The Journal of Urology (2011). High credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin hydrochloride in children with increased detrusor leak point pressure associated with neuropathic bladder. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with detrusor leak point pressure of 40 cm H(2)O or greater were stratified by age (2 to less than 5 years, 5 to less than 10 years, 10 to 16 years) and concomitant anticholinergic use. They were randomized to receive various doses of tamsulosin or placebo. A 2-week titration was followed by a 12-week maintenance treatment period. The primary end point was response, defined as detrusor leak point pressure less than 40 cm H(2)O from 2 evaluations on the same day at week 14. Secondary end points included detrusor leak point pressure change from baseline, hydronephrosis and hydroureter responses, change in catheterization volumes, and adverse events.

A total of 161 patients received 1 or more treatment doses between January 2008 and February 2009, and 135 were evaluable for the primary end point. A total of 51 patients (37.8%) were detrusor leak point pressure responders, with no statistically significant difference in response rates between each tamsulosin dose and placebo. Adjusting for stratification variables, mean detrusor leak point pressure changes from baseline to week 14 for placebo and low, medium, and high dose groups were -11.4, -17.6, -4.6, and -14.3 cm H(2)O, respectively. In 141 evaluable patients, hydroureter/hydronephrosis improvement rates were 7.1% and 5.7% in left and right kidneys (hydroureter), respectively.

### Safety and tolerability of solifenacin add-on therapy to α-blocker treated men with residual urgency and frequency [^113ybf1K]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The VICTOR was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety and tolerability of solifenacin plus tamsulosin in men with residual overactive bladder symptoms after tamsulosin monotherapy. The efficacy of solifenacin plus tamsulosin versus placebo plus tamsulosin was also evaluated.

A total of 398 men, 45 years old or older, were randomized to 12 weeks of solifenacin plus tamsulosin or placebo plus tamsulosin once daily. The study population experienced eight or more micturitions per 24 hours and one or more urgency episodes per 24 hours after taking tamsulosin for four or more weeks. Additionally, participants had a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 13 or greater, a Patient Perception of Bladder Condition score of 3 or greater, a post-void residual of 200 mL or less, and a peak flow rate of 5 mL per second or greater. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

- **Primary efficacy endpoint**: Mean change from baseline to week 12 in micturitions per 24 hours.
- **Secondary measures**: Mean change in urgency episodes per 24 hours and changes in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Urgency Perception Scale, and total International Prostate Symptom Scores.

The most frequent adverse events in the solifenacin plus tamsulosin and placebo plus tamsulosin groups were dry mouth (7% and 3%, respectively) and dizziness (3% and 2%, respectively). Of the patients on solifenacin plus tamsulosin, 7 (3%) reported retention, and 3 required catheterization. No patients on placebo plus tamsulosin reported retention.

### Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin and oral controlled adsorption system formulation of tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115trNa1]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

This de novo model may have some limitations. First, due to the lack of published data, some assumptions were made using expert opinion only, including resource use and the proportion of patients going on to have surgery. Other key assumptions were required, for example, due to the absence of persistence data on FDCs or free combinations in LUTS, and owing to no head-to-head studies for the combinations assessed in the present study.

Additionally, the primary trials for the combination therapies evaluated in our analysis had some notable differences in the patient populations and outcome measures that prohibit an indirect treatment comparison. Patients in these trials had IPSS ≥ 12 or 13, ≥ 2 or 3 urgency episodes/24 hours, and ≥ 8 micturitions/24 hours. In contrast to NEPTUNE, TIMES had an inclusion criterion for overactive bladder symptoms but not one for voiding symptoms. In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint in TIMES was the Perception of Treatment Benefit question, and the secondary endpoints included bladder diary variables and change in episodes/24 hours of urgency urinary incontinence, urgency, total micturitions, and night-time micturitions. In NEPTUNE, the co-primary endpoints were total IPSS and TUFS.

Second, although the model included tamsulosin, solifenacin, and tolterodine, which are commonly prescribed for men with LUTS, other common α-blockers (e.g. alfuzosin) and antimuscarinics (e.g. oxybutynin) were not considered in our model. Additionally, although men with LUTS may receive α-blocker or antimuscarinic monotherapy, our model was restricted to evalu…

### Dutasteride plus tamsulosin fixed-dose combination first-line therapy versus tamsulosin monotherapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: A budget impact analysis in the Greek healthcare setting [^117WNVyS]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The medical resource use regarding the management of patients with BPH in Greece was not available from existing literature or valid national data sources; thus, this information was retrieved from a local expert panel using the Delphi technique. A panel of nine clinical experts in urology was assembled to collect primary data regarding patient management patterns for BPH in the local healthcare setting. The synthesis of the panel was geographically representative and consisted of urologists from academic institutions and major city hospitals in Greece. The questions related to medical resource use were projected on a screen, and the expert panel was asked to enter their estimates using a handheld tele-voting system. Consensus was achieved using the Delphi method with up to two iterations of open discussion followed by re-voting from the panelists. The average of the experts' answers was then included in the model grouped by routine care of patients with BPH, treatment of AUR, and TURP consultations.

No Ethics Committee approval was requested for the primary research component of the study, as the conduct of interviews with physicians and experts' panels are not subject to any approval according to Greek legislation.

Costs used in the model are in nominal 2013 Euros and were not discounted nor inflated, as recommended by international guidelines for BIA. Drug costs for tamsulosin and DUT + TAM FDC were based on the retail prices (Price Bulletin 15 February 2013, ΥΥКА 2013/2). Specifically, DUT + TAM FDC was priced at

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117Remrq]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

We performed a meta-analysis to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) during a treatment cycle of at least 1 year.

- **Methods**: Randomized controlled trials were searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. The data were evaluated and statistically analyzed using RevMan version 5.3.0.

- **Results**: Five studies including 4,348 patients were analyzed. The analysis found that the combination group exhibited a significantly greater effect in the international prostate symptom score (mean difference [MD], -1.43; 95% confidence interval, -2.20 to -0.66; P = 0.0003), prostate volume (MD, -10.13; 95% CI, -12.38 to -7.88; P < 0.00001), transitional zone volume (MD, -3.18; 95% CI, -3.57 to -2.79; P < 0.0001), maximum urine flow rate (MD, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.29; P < 0.00001), prostate-specific antigen (MD, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.29; P < 0.0001) and post-void residual volume (MD, -3.85; 95% CI, -4.95 to -2.76; P < 0.00001) compared with the tamsulosin group. In terms of safety, adverse events (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.17; P = 0.001), erectile dysfunction (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.73 to 2.92; P < 0.00001), ejaculation disorder (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.97 to 5.79; P < 0.0001), retrograde ejaculation (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.93; P = 0.03), and decreased libido (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.65; P < 0.001) occurred with a higher incidence in the combination group.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic tamsulosin (Flomax) in reducing urinary symptoms in patients undergoing 125I prostate implantation (PI) for prostate adenocarcinoma.

- **Methods and materials**: This single-institution, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial compared prophylactic tamsulosin versus placebo in patients undergoing PI for prostate adenocarcinoma. Eligibility criteria included patients not taking tamsulosin or other alpha-blockers treated with PI. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either tamsulosin (0.8 mg, orally once a day) or a matched placebo. All patients began the medication 4 days before PI and continued for 60 days. The American Urologic Association (AUA) symptom index questionnaire was used to assess urinary symptoms. It was administered before PI for a baseline score and weekly for 8 weeks following PI. Patients were withdrawn from the study if they developed urinary retention, experienced intolerable urinary symptoms, or chose to discontinue participation.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study from November 2001 to January 2003, with 118 evaluable participants (58 in the tamsulosin arm and 60 in the placebo group). Pretreatment and treatment characteristics were comparably matched between the two groups. The urinary retention rate was 17% (10 patients) in the placebo group compared to 10% (6 patients) in the tamsulosin group (p = 0.3161). Of those who developed urinary retention, 88% (14 patients) experienced it within 2 weeks after the PI.

### Jalyn [^114X7AXF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Effect on acute urinary retention (AUR) or the need for BPH-related surgery: After 4 years of treatment, coadministration therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin did not provide benefit over dutasteride monotherapy in reducing the incidence of AUR or BPH-related surgery.

In separate 2-year randomized, double-blind trials compared with placebo, dutasteride monotherapy was associated with a statistically significantly lower incidence of AUR (1.8% for dutasteride versus 4.2% for placebo; 57% reduction in risk) and a statistically significantly lower incidence of BPH-related surgery (2.2% for dutasteride versus 4.1% for placebo; 48% reduction in risk).

- **Effect on maximum urine flow rate**: The baseline Qmax was approximately 10.7 mL/sec for each treatment group. Coadministration therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in increasing Qmax at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24, the mean increases from baseline (± SD) in Qmax were 2.4 (± 5.26) mL/sec for the coadministration group, 1.9 (± 5.10) mL/sec for dutasteride, and 0.9 (± 4.57) mL/sec for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of 0.5 mL/sec (P = 0.003; [95% CI: 0.17, 0.84]) and between coadministration and tamsulosin of 1.5 mL/sec (P < 0.001; [95% CI: 1.19, 1.86]). This difference was seen by Month 6 and continued through Month 24.

The additional improvement in Qmax of coadministration therapy over dutasteride monotherapy was no longer statistically significant at Month 48.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112uhWvq]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis suggests that the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride provides a preferable therapeutic effect for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with a higher incidence of sexual side effects. However, the combination therapy can markedly reduce the risk of BPH-related symptom progression and acute urinary retention compared to tamsulosin monotherapy.

We identified 297,596 new users of tamsulosin and 85,971 new users of 5ARIs, with a mean age of 62 and 64 years, respectively. During follow-up, 26,659 patients switched to or initiated new adjunct treatment with tamsulosin, while 47,628 patients switched to or initiated new adjunct treatment with 5ARIs. The mean duration of tamsulosin treatment was 39 weeks (standard deviation 54 weeks), while the median duration was 14 weeks (interquartile range 5–50 weeks). In contrast, the mean duration for 5ARI treatment was 56 weeks (standard deviation 61 weeks), with a median duration of 34 weeks (interquartile range 13–78 weeks).

### Flomax [^112ZpCvz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tamsulosin hydrochloride produced no evidence of mutagenic potential in vitro in the Ames reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, unscheduled DNA repair synthesis assay, and chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells or human lymphocytes. There were no mutagenic effects in the in vivo sister chromatid exchange and mouse micronucleus assay.

Studies in rats revealed significantly reduced fertility in males dosed with single or multiple daily doses of 300 mg/kg/day of tamsulosin hydrochloride (AUC exposure in rats about 50 times the human exposure with the maximum therapeutic dose). The mechanism of decreased fertility in male rats is considered to be an effect of the compound on the vaginal plug formation, possibly due to changes in semen content or impairment of ejaculation. The effects on fertility were reversible, showing improvement by 3 days following a single dose and 4 weeks after multiple dosing. Effects on fertility in males were completely reversed within nine weeks of discontinuation of multiple dosing. Multiple doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg/day tamsulosin hydrochloride (1/5 and 16 times the anticipated human AUC exposure) did not significantly alter fertility in male rats. Effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated.

Studies in female rats revealed significant reductions in fertility after single or multiple dosing with 300 mg/kg/day of the R-isomer or racemic mixture of tamsulosin hydrochloride, respectively. In female rats, the reductions in fertility after single doses were consistent.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1141f9L8]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Two RCTs with a sufficient sample size of 3,963 participants assessed the extent of BPH clinical progression after drug administration. In view of BPH-related symptom progression, which was the most common progression event in each group, the study found that the tamsulosin group had a larger number (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.67, P < 0.00001) compared with the combination group.

- **Forest plots**:
	- **Forest plots showed numbers in**:
	- (a) BPH-related symptom progression
	- (b) BPH-related acute urinary retention
	- (c) BPH-related urinary incontinence
	- (d) BPH-related urinary tract infection
	- (e) BPH-related renal insufficiency

	- M-H, Mantel-Haenszel; CI, confidence interval; df, degrees of freedom.

In terms of BPH-related acute urinary retention, the tamsulosin group had a higher incidence than the combination group (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.98, P = 0.04). In other aspects of BPH-related clinical progression, mainly consisting of urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, and renal insufficiency, no significant differences were found between the two treatment groups.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116jgVJd]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

The Jadad Scale was used to assess the quality of each RCT. Additionally, the methods of quality assessment, including the method of patient allocation, concealment of allocation, blinding method, and the number of lost to follow-up, were used to analyze the quality of individual studies. Individual studies were assessed based on guidelines published in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions v5.10. Every article was evaluated and classified based on quality assessment criteria:

- **(A) Satisfying almost all of the quality criteria**: Considered to have a low probability of bias.
- **(B) Ambiguous about one or more quality criteria**: Considered to have a secondary probability of bias.
- **(C) Barely met the quality criteria**: Considered to have a high probability of bias.

All authors participated in the quality assessment of RCTs retrieved, and eventually, everyone agreed with the results of the assessment. Differences regarding the quality assessment were resolved by discussion among the researchers.

Two authors independently collected data from the articles based on predetermined criteria. The following information was collected for each study:

- **(A) Publication time**.
- **(B) Name of first author**.
- **(C) Patient's received therapy**.
- **(D) Capacity of sample**.
- **(E) Data on international prostate symptom score (IPSS), prostate volume (PV), transitional zone volume (TZV), maximum urine flow rate (Qmax), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), post-void residual urine volume (PVR), adverse events, total effectiveness rate, etc**.

The trial supporting the efficacy of Jalyn was a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (CombAT trial) investigating the efficacy of the coadministration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg/day (n = 1,610) compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611). Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the coadministration group, 67% in the dutasteride group, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

### Safety and tolerability of solifenacin add-on therapy to alpha-blocker treated men with residual urgency and frequency [^112Yy3m7]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

The VICTOR study was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that assessed the safety and tolerability of solifenacin plus tamsulosin in men experiencing residual overactive bladder symptoms after tamsulosin monotherapy. The efficacy of solifenacin plus tamsulosin was also evaluated against placebo plus tamsulosin.

A total of 398 men aged 45 years or older were randomized to receive either solifenacin plus tamsulosin or placebo plus tamsulosin once daily for 12 weeks. The study population had 8 or more micturitions per 24 hours and at least 1 urgency episode per 24 hours after taking tamsulosin for 4 or more weeks. Participants had a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 13 or greater and a Patient Perception of Bladder Condition score of 3 or greater. They also exhibited a post-void residual of 200 mL or less and a peak flow rate of 5 mL per second or greater. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline to week 12 in micturitions per 24 hours. Secondary measures included the mean change in urgency episodes per 24 hours, as well as changes in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Urgency Perception Scale, and total International Prostate Symptom Scores.

The most frequent adverse events in the solifenacin plus tamsulosin and placebo plus tamsulosin groups were dry mouth (7% and 3%, respectively) and dizziness (3% and 2%, respectively). Of the patients on solifenacin plus tamsulosin, 7 (3%) reported retention, and 3 required catheterization. No patients on placebo plus tamsulosin reported retention.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: Risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^11655Gjd]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Patients were considered exposed to study drugs from the dispensing date until the end of the day supply. We used time-varying definitions for drug exposure for all analyses, allowing patients to fluctuate between exposure classifications or contribute time to multiple exposure categories simultaneously, depending on prescribing patterns. As conducted by a previous study, we formed a discrete time dataset for computational efficiency, where follow-up time was segmented into seven-day increments. For each increment, one of seven exposure classifications was assigned for tamsulosin based on the majority of exposed days during the week.

- **Exposure classifications**: Mutually exclusive classifications for exposure were as follows: weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12 after drug initiation; weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12 after restarting treatment (following a four-week treatment gap); and maintenance drug use (that is, exposed person time not categorized as another exposure covariate). This methodology for exposure categorization allowed us to explicitly model risk for the study outcome within set risk windows during the course of drug treatment, and it has been used in a previous pharmacoepidemiological study.

Figure 2 shows person time allocation among exposure covariates. The schematic illustrates an example characterization of person time into exposure covariates for a given patient. Included person time starts at the initiation of drug treatment and ends when healthcare eligibility finishes. The patient in this schematic contributes person time to three new use covariates, maintenance u…

### Efficacy and safety of mirabegron versus placebo add-on therapy in men with overactive bladder symptoms receiving tamsulosin for underlying benign prostatic hyperplasia: A randomized, phase 4 study (PLUS) [^117RAmV5]. The Journal of Urology (2020). High credibility.

The PLUS study investigated the efficacy and safety of mirabegron add-on therapy in men with overactive bladder symptoms who were receiving tamsulosin for underlying lower urinary tract symptoms attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Materials and methods**: In this phase 4 study, a 4-week 0.4 mg tamsulosin run-in period was followed by a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, treatment period where patients initially received 25 mg mirabegron or placebo add-on therapy. At 4 weeks, doses were titrated to 50 mg mirabegron or placebo equivalent. Efficacy endpoints included changes from baseline to end of treatment in mean number of micturitions per day (primary), mean volume voided per micturition, number of urgency episodes per day, total urgency and frequency score, and total International Prostate Symptom Score (secondary). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, post-void residual volume, and maximum urinary flow measurements.

- **Results**: Of the 676 men, most were 65 years old or older (380, 56.2%). Tamsulosin plus mirabegron was statistically superior to tamsulosin plus placebo in reducing the mean number of micturitions per day (-2.00 vs. -1.62; adjusted difference -0.39; 95% CI -0.76, -0.02). Statistically superior results were noted for tamsulosin plus mirabegron in mean volume voided per micturition, urgency episodes per day, and total urgency and frequency score, though not for the International Prostate Symptom Score. Higher overall treatment-emergent adverse event rates were observed with tamsulosin plus placebo, although higher rates of drug-related treatment emergent adverse events were noted with tamsulosin plus mirabegron.

### Terazosin [^117VWahA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: If terazosin capsules administration is discontinued for several days, therapy should be reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen.

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia**:
	- **Initial dose**: 1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded as an initial dose. Patients should be closely monitored during initial administration to minimize the risk of severe hypotensive response.
	- **Subsequent doses**: The dose should be increased in a stepwise fashion to 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg once daily to achieve the desired improvement of symptoms and/or flow rates. Doses of 10 mg once daily are generally required for a clinical response. Therefore, treatment with 10 mg for a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks may be required to assess whether a beneficial response has been achieved. Some patients may not achieve a clinical response despite appropriate titration. Although some additional patients responded at a 20 mg daily dose, there was an insufficient number of patients studied to draw definitive conclusions about this dose. There are insufficient data to support the use of higher doses for those patients who show inadequate or no response to 20 mg daily. If terazosin administration is discontinued for several days or longer, therapy should be reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen.

- **Use with other drugs**: Caution should be observed when terazosin capsules are administered concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, especially the calcium channel blocker verapamil, to avoid the possibility of developing significant hypotension.

### Alpha blockers: Are all created equal [^117QyjRV]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Drug therapy with alpha blockers has become the standard treatment for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Medical treatment is often preferred by patients over minimally invasive therapy or transurethral resection of the prostate. Alpha blockers reduce urethral pressure by blocking the motor sympathetic adrenergic nerve supply to the prostate. Several alpha blockers are available for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including alfuzosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. Different meta-analyses have shown these agents to be comparable in terms of efficacy in improving symptom scores and increasing urinary flow rates.

The clinical uroselectivity of these agents differs, however, and translates into differences in side effects. Side effects that have been reported with some alpha blockers include dizziness, headache, postural hypotension, and retrograde ejaculation.

### Free combination of dutasteride plus tamsulosin for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in South Korea: Analysis of drug utilization and adverse events using the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database [^1117AFGF]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common non-malignant conditions in older men. A nationwide survey from the United States (US) reported a BPH prevalence of 25% in men over 50 years of age. In a population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in the US, the United Kingdom (UK), and Sweden, symptoms suggestive of possible BPH were highly prevalent in men, reported in up to 46% of the population studied. Notably, BPH prevalence increases with age, from 14.8% in men aged 40–49 years to 36.8% in those aged 80 years and older. Although data are limited for Southeast Asia, the overall incidence of BPH in South Korea was reported to be 2105 per 100,000 men based on data from patients diagnosed with BPH in 2008, using a nationwide South Korean database, Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA). As expected, the prevalence of BPH increased with age; the highest incidence was in patients aged 70 years and older.

A common manifestation of BPH is lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including difficulty in voiding and nocturia. These have considerable negative impacts on health-related quality of life and sexual functioning. The short-term aim of LUTS/BPH therapy is to provide relief of symptoms by improving the flow of urine; long-term treatment goals are to alleviate bothersome LUTS, prevent acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk of complications.

A fixed-dose combination of dutasteride 0.5 mg plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg therapy (5α-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) and α1-blocker) is currently approved in over 90 countries, including the US, UK, and Australia.

### Dosage and duration of medication for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: Two questions without definitive answers [^114zKk6Z]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

In this review, the dosage and duration of medication in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia are discussed. There is no official guideline, however, and even no professional agreement on these points.

- **Recent findings**: Considering the dosage, dose-titration is probably not a drawback as there is a high risk of undertreatment or overtreatment when using a single dosage for every patient. The duration of treatment is a matter of concern. A quarter of patients discontinue their treatment early. For others, a long period of treatment may be mandatory for those patients who are at risk of progression. After a course of medication (6 months to 1 year), a trial without treatment may help to decide whether treatment must be continued if symptoms relapse.

For men with lower urinary tract symptoms, there seems to be no definitive answer about the appropriate dosage and duration of medicine.

### Dutasteride plus tamsulosin fixed-dose combination first-line therapy versus tamsulosin monotherapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: A budget impact analysis in the Greek healthcare setting [^111zMWha]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common benign neoplasm in men, is a chronic condition with age-dependent epidemiology. It is associated with progressive lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and affects 75% of men older than 70. Although many epidemiological clinical studies have been conducted worldwide over the last 20 years, the prevalence of clinical BPH remains difficult to determine. A broadly accepted clinical definition of BPH is lacking, and thus performance of adequate epidemiological studies is hampered. A commonly occurring condition in men with underlying BPH is acute urinary retention (AUR). AUR is an uncomfortable and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden inability to urinate, associated with intense suprapubic discomfort. Medical intervention is often required to relieve the severe discomfort experienced by patients with AUR. Overall, the common clinical manifestations attributed to BPH include LUTS, urinary tract infection, incomplete bladder emptying, acute and chronic urinary retention, chronic renal insufficiency, urosepsis, and hematuria.

Therapeutic interventions for LUTS due to BPH provide sustained improvement in clinical symptoms and quality of life (QoL), while inhibiting progression of the condition. The two main pharmacological agents for the management of BPH/LUTS are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) and alpha-blockers. Dutasteride is a 5-ARI and works by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, thus reducing cellular growth and in turn reducing the size of the prostate.

### Tamsulosin for treating lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic obstruction: A systematic review of efficacy and adverse effects [^112JtBbt]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

We systematically reviewed the effectiveness and adverse effects of tamsulosin for lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic obstruction.

- **Materials and methods**: Studies were included in the analysis when they involved a randomized trial of at least 1 month in duration, men with lower urinary tract symptoms, and a comparison of tamsulosin with placebo or an active control. Study, patient, and outcome data were extracted onto standard forms using a prospective protocol.

- **Results**: Of the 13 series involving 3,418 men with a mean age of 64 years, all met our inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4 to 26 weeks. Baseline symptom scores and flow rates indicated moderate lower urinary tract symptoms. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow compared with placebo. The weighted mean difference in the mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 and 0.8 mg tamsulosin versus placebo was -1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.49 to -0.72 or 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI -2.3 to -1.0 or 16% improvement), respectively. The weighted mean difference in the mean change from baseline in peak urine flow was 1.1 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.51) and 1.1 mL per second (95% CI 0.65 to 1.48) for 0.4 and 0.8 mg, respectively. The 0.2 to 0.4 mg tamsulosin dose was as effective as other alpha-antagonists for improving symptoms and the flow rate, although the doses of all alpha-antagonists evaluated may not have been optimal. Treatment withdrawals and adverse effects increased markedly as the tamsulosin dose increased.

- **Conclusions**: Tamsulosin improves lower urinary tract symptoms and flow rates, although higher doses are associated with increased withdrawals and adverse effects.
