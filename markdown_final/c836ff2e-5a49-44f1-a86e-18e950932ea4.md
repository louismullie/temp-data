## Question

What is the optimal frequency of vitamin B12 injections for maintenance therapy in patients with pernicious anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal maintenance frequency of vitamin B12 injections in pernicious anemia, with attention to guidelines, patient variability, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines actually recommend for maintenance dosing. Then, I should verify how much interpatient variability exists and whether current guidance reflects it. Next, I will review evidence for individualized dosing based on symptoms rather than serum levels. After that, I should examine whether alternative routes can substitute for injections in maintenance. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, evidence-based recommendation and note special populations and monitoring cautions, making sure to double-check for any internal contradictions in the literature before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the guideline baseline. Multiple authoritative sources converge on a maintenance interval of about every 2 to 3 months for hydroxocobalamin 1 mg intramuscularly in pernicious anemia, with the British National Formulary advising 1 mg every 2 months after stabilization and BSH recommending lifelong maintenance with clinical follow-up, while FDA labeling for cyanocobalamin historically proposed 100 mcg monthly, which is a lower dose and not directly comparable to the 1 mg hydroxocobalamin regimens used in the UK and many specialty practices [^117Np1Dp] [^112GdEpt] [^11528EQ1] [^116DtbDb] [^116T2ko8].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of patient-to-patient variability before I anchor on a fixed interval. Contemporary patient surveys and clinical observations indicate that up to half of patients with pernicious anemia require more frequent injections than every 2 to 3 months to remain asymptomatic, with many needing intervals ranging from twice weekly to every 2 to 4 weeks, and symptom recurrence often precedes the next scheduled dose under standard intervals, suggesting that a uniform 8 to 12 week schedule is inadequate for a substantial subset [^114x6QiK] [^1122vrnA] [^114QQraS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether biomarkers can guide titration. The BMJ guidance explicitly advises that serum B12 and methylmalonic acid are not helpful for monitoring clinical response or for adjusting injection frequency, and that dosing should be symptom-driven rather than biomarker-driven, which means I need to avoid over-relying on periodic B12 levels to decide when to give the next injection [^116HYE4W] [^114QQraS].

> I need to check whether alternative maintenance routes can replace injections. High-dose oral cyanocobalamin at 1,000 mcg daily can normalize serum B12 in many patients, including some with pernicious anemia, but symptom control is less predictable than with parenteral therapy, and switching too early or in those with active neurological disease risks incomplete neurologic recovery. Thus, while oral therapy may be considered in select stable patients, it is not a universal substitute for injections in maintenance, particularly when symptoms recur or absorption is uncertain [^111A3cQx] [^117QK8e8] [^115cgzUs].

> Let me consider practical implementation. Shared decision-making to individualize injection frequency, teaching self-administration to improve access and reduce healthcare burden, and cautious interval extension only when symptoms remain stable are key. Importantly, if symptoms recur when extending the interval, I should promptly shorten the interval again rather than waiting for biomarkers to change, and I should remember that abrupt dose reductions can worsen symptoms, so tapering the interval gradually with close symptom monitoring is prudent [^114QQraS] [^115er476].

> But wait, what if the patient has neurological involvement or is pregnant or has renal impairment? I should double-check those nuances. In patients with active neurological symptoms, more frequent parenteral dosing is appropriate until improvement plateaus, and in pregnancy, B12 therapy is mandatory and safe; in renal insufficiency, cyanocobalamin may be contraindicated and hydroxocobalamin is preferred, which can influence formulation choice even if it does not directly change the maintenance interval logic [^1129gYP1] [^114QQraS] [^1122vrnA].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. The optimal maintenance frequency is not a single fixed interval. Start with guideline-concordant every 8 to 12 weeks as a baseline, but actively titrate to symptoms, recognizing that many patients require every 2 to 4 weeks, some even more frequently, and that symptom-guided dosing is superior to biomarker-guided adjustments. Maintain lifelong therapy, prefer hydroxocobalamin when available, and reserve oral high-dose regimens for carefully selected, stable patients after shared decision-making and close monitoring [^117Np1Dp] [^111b7Xx4] [^114QQraS] [^111A3cQx] [^1122vrnA].

---

The optimal frequency of vitamin B12 injections for pernicious anemia is **every 2–3 months** (hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM) for most patients, as supported by BSH and BNF guidance [^111b7Xx4] [^117Np1Dp]. However, **individualized dosing** is essential: patients with neurological symptoms or persistent fatigue may require more frequent injections (e.g. every 1–2 months or even every 2–4 weeks) until symptoms stabilize, then taper to the lowest effective interval [^1129gYP1] [^114x6QiK]. Routine monitoring should be **symptom-based**, not biomarker-driven, and shared decision-making is recommended to tailor frequency to patient needs and preferences [^114QQraS] [^116HYE4W].

---

## Standard maintenance frequency

- **BSH guidelines**: Lifelong maintenance with hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM every 2–3 months is recommended for pernicious anemia [^112GdEpt].

- **BNF guidance**: After neurological stabilization, hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM every 2 months is advised [^117Np1Dp].

- **FDA labeling**: Cyanocobalamin 100 mcg IM monthly is a traditional regimen, though hydroxocobalamin is preferred in many countries [^116DtbDb].

---

## Individualized dosing based on clinical response

- **Neurological involvement**: More frequent injections (e.g. 1 mg IM every 2–4 weeks) may be needed until symptoms stabilize, then taper to every 2–3 months [^117Np1Dp] [^111b7Xx4].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Fatigue, cognitive effects, or neuropathy may warrant increased frequency (e.g. every 1–2 months) until controlled, then individualized maintenance [^1122vrnA] [^114x6QiK].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making and self-administration can improve adherence and outcomes, allowing flexible scheduling [^114QQraS] [^115er476].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting individualized dosing

Limited but consistent evidence shows that **many patients require more frequent injections** than standard 2–3 month intervals to remain asymptomatic, with some needing weekly to monthly dosing [^1122vrnA] [^114x6QiK]. Symptom-based titration — adjusting frequency to clinical response — is recommended because biomarkers (B12, MMA) do not reliably reflect symptom control [^114QQraS] [^116HYE4W].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Monitoring should be **symptom-focused**, with regular assessment of fatigue, neuropathy, cognition, and hematologic parameters; avoid relying on serum B12 or MMA to guide frequency [^114QQraS] [^116HYE4W]. Adjust the interval based on symptom recurrence or persistence, increasing frequency if symptoms return and decreasing once stable [^1122vrnA] [^114x6QiK].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|
| Standard maintenance | Hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM every 2–3 months [^111EjPbA] |
| Neurological involvement | 1 mg IM every 2–4 weeks until stable, then every 2–3 months [^notfound] |
| Persistent symptoms | Increase to every 1–2 months until controlled, then individualized [^notfound] |
| Individualized care | Adjust based on symptoms and patient preference [^114QQraS] |

---

The optimal frequency is **every 2–3 months** for most, but **individualized dosing** based on symptoms and response is essential; more frequent injections are appropriate for neurological or persistent symptoms, with tapering once stable.

KDOQI Guideline 5 — Implementation considerations for folate and vitamin B12 in CKD — states that because absorption of vitamin B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor and normal gut function and the latter is often at least partially impaired in older individuals, assessment of serum vitamin B12 may be necessary if folate supplementation is considered, and that Vitamin B deficiencies may be identified by clinical signs and symptoms and assessment of serum vitamin B12 should be considered if folate supplementation is administered. The guideline notes that high folic acid intake may mask signs of pernicious anemia and undetected progression of neurologic disease, and thus folate and vitamin B12 levels should be monitored if folate is being supplemented, and that suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (eg, RDA) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Individualization of therapy, including supplementation of folate, should be based on monitoring of severity of nutrient depletion, and individualization should include patient age because adults older than 50 years may have increased needs due to the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in this population. For monitoring and evaluation, serum/plasma/RBC folate and serum vitamin B12 levels should be assessed as appropriate.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^116c7P8k]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The publication of the 2024 NICE guidelines on B 12 deficiency represents progress but falls short by proposing to rename 'pernicious anaemia' with 'autoimmune gastritis'. This change does not adequately address the distinct nature of PA as an advanced stage of AIG, characterised by IF deficiency requiring lifelong B 12 treatment. Although severe and life-threatening anaemia due to PA is rare today, PA remains a specific condition that requires recognition and appropriate management. The guidelines currently lack detailed protocols for diagnosing PA, especially in patients without typical gastrointestinal symptoms, and rely on tests with limited sensitivity and specificity. Despite these limitations, the guidelines do highlight the importance of a symptom-based approach and prioritise critical research initiatives to address many of the current shortcomings associated with the patient journey. Future revisions should better distinguish PA from AIG, incorporate comprehensive diagnostic pathways that can be implemented in practice, and emphasise educating medical students and professionals to improve diagnosis, effective management and prognosis of PA.

### Comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a new daily oral vitamin B12 formulation and intermittent intramuscular vitamin B12 in normalizing low cobalamin levels: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study [^112GQcN7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is routinely treated with parenteral dosing and less often with high-dose oral vitamin B(12). Oral vitamin B(12) formulations have low bioavailability in patients with malabsorption and are considered less reliable than parenteral treatments.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a new proprietary oral vitamin B(12) formulation (oral B(12)) with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B(12) (IM B(12)) in restoring normal serum B(12) concentrations in patients with low cobalamin levels (< 350 pg/mL).

Methods

Patients were recruited from 5 centers and randomly assigned to receive oral B(12) 1000 μg, taken daily for 90 days, or IM B(12) 1000 μg, given on study days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90. The patients were aged ≥ 60 years or aged ≥ 18 years and had gastrointestinal abnormalities or were on a restricted diet. The primary efficacy outcome compared the proportion of patients in each treatment arm in whom cobalamin levels were normalized (≥ 350 ng/mL) following 60 days of treatment. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of the 2 formulations after 90 days of treatment, assessing time to normalization of B(12) levels, and evaluating the changes in the levels of biomarkers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC). The effect on holotranscobalamin II (active B(12)) levels was assessed as an exploratory end point and correlated to serum cobalamin levels in both treatment groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1) and on days 15, 31, 61, and 91.

Results

Fifty patients were recruited. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) completed the study (22 patients [91.7%] in the oral B(12) group and 26 patients [100%] in the IM B(12) group). All patients (100%) in both treatment groups and in both populations had a cobalamin level ≥ 350 pg/mL on day 61 and maintained it on day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) for mean percent change from baseline (PCFB) in serum cobalamin levels on day 61 and day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 61. There was a statistical difference between the IM and oral treatment groups for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 91 (P = 0.033), with lower values in the oral B(12) group. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in plasma HC levels on day 61 and day 91. All patients in each treatment group achieved normalization of serum cobalamin levels by day 15. All patients in both treatment groups and in both populations had plasma holotranscobalamin levels ≥ 40 pmol/L on day 61 and on day 91. No statistical analysis was planned or performed for safety end points, which were reported only descriptively. Most observed adverse effects were considered mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse effects that were considered severe in intensity were also considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug.

Conclusions

In this selected study population comprising individuals with low cobalamin levels but who otherwise were in good health, patients received oral B(12) (1000 μg/d) or IM B(12) (1000 μg in 9 injections over 3 months) for a total of 3 months. Both the oral and IM formulations were effective in restoring normal levels of serum cobalamin in all patients studied (100%). Both formulations used in this study were well tolerated at the dose studied. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01312831.

### Oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency [^1155La4y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common and rises with age. Most people with vitamin B12 deficiency are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B12 which is a considerable source of work for health care professionals. Several case control and case series studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B12 but it is rarely prescribed in this form, other than in Sweden and Canada. Doctors may not be prescribing oral formulations because they are unaware of this option or have concerns regarding effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency.

Search Strategy

Searches were undertaken of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Lilacs in early 2005. The bibliographies of all relevant papers identified using this strategy were searched. In addition we contacted authors of relevant identified studies and Vitamin B12 research and pharmaceutical companies to enquire about other published or unpublished studies and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the use of oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 to treat vitamin B12 deficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

All abstracts or titles identified by the electronic searches were independently scrutinised by two reviewers. When a difference between reviewers arose, we obtained and reviewed a hard copy of the papers and made decisions by consensus. We obtained a copy of all pre-selected papers and two researchers independently extracted the data from these studies using piloted data extraction forms. The whole group checked whether inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, and disagreement was decided by consensus. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers and disagreements were brought back to the whole group and resolved by consensus.

Main Results

Two RCT's comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to four months. High oral doses of B12 (1000 mcg and 2000 mcg) were as effective as intramuscular administration in achieving haematological and neurological responses.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin B12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B12 deficient patients.

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

This article has been shared with Martyn Hooper, chairperson of the Pernicious Anaemia Society (PAS), for comments and feedback. Input from Martyn and other patients, some being members of the PAS, is much appreciated. They suggested recommendations for reporting specific signs and symptoms often mentioned by members/patients; however, as this is a therapeutics article, these recommendations are not included. They also reported on the barriers patients experience in healthcare (which can also be found in the scientific literature,) and several additional case descriptions.

Search strategy

We searched PubMed (NLM database) with the terms "B12" OR "cobalamin" AND "deficiency" OR "therapeutics" OR "supplementation" for relevant publications of clinical observations and studies published from 1950 to 2022. We prioritised systematic reviews and studies on the benefits, harms, and cost effectiveness of B 12 supplementation. We also searched clinical guidelines and our personal archives of references, and screened the reference lists of studies retrieved by the searches.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^1163gAMw]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

Fish tapeworm infestation

Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

### Oral vs. intramuscular vitamin B12 for treating vitamin B12 deficiency… [^116xjJpX]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question 12supplementation compared with intramuscular supplementation in patients with vitamin B 12deficiency. Evidence-Based Answer 12levels, oral and intramuscular vitamin B 12supplementation are equivalent after one to four months. For increasing vitamin B. 12levels, oral supplementation at 2, 000 mcg per day is more effective than intramuscular supplementation at 1, 000 mcg per day; however, 1, 000 mcg per day orally is equivalent to 1, 000 mcg per day intramuscularly. Oral vitamin B 12is also effective at maintaining normalization of vitamin B 12levels. 12 in patients from Spain who were older than 65 years with vitamin B 12 deficiency.

2 The average age of participants was 75 years, and 58. 3% were women. The intramuscular treatment regimen was 1 mg per day of cyanocobalamin on alternate days for two weeks, then 1 mg per week during weeks 3 to 8, and 1 mg per month during weeks 9 to 52. The oral regimen was 1 mg per day of cyanocobalamin for eight weeks, followed by 1 mg per week during weeks 9 to
52. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as normalization of vitamin B 12 serum concentration measured at eight, 26, and 52 weeks. After patients received the final hydroxocobalamin injection, their vitamin B 12 levels were monitored at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and then every 12 weeks. When serum vitamin B 12 levels were measured at the 25th percentile of the reference range, patients were switched to 1, 000 mcg of oral cyanocobalamin per day.

What you need to know

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of results of blood tests assessing cobalamin (B 12) status because there is no "gold standard" test to define deficiency
Neurological symptoms resulting from B 12 deficiency may take several months or even years to resolve completely
Measuring serum biomarkers such as B 12 or methylmalonic acid is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement, neither is titration of injection frequency based on biomarker assessment
Self-administration of intramuscular B 12 injections can lead to greater patient satisfaction and better health outcomes

PARP inhibitors — anemia management notes that anemia is macrocytic with mean corpuscular volumes that can reach > 105 (units) and "is not a vitamin B12–dependent pernicious anemia functionally". Interventions include "drug hold, dose reduction, transfusion, and consideration of growth factor support", with the latter "recommended to follow existing ASCO guidelines". Because "drug holding without associated other change will result in recurrence of the anemia upon reinstitution of the agent", "dose modification with or without transfusion to acutely ameliorate effects of anemia is recommended".

2.1 Testing and Other Considerations
Prior to Dosing

Prior to treatment, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug Interactions (7)].

In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12prior to use of NASCOBAL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended initial dose of NASCOBAL is one spray (500 mcg) administered in ONE nostril once weekly. Administer NASCOBAL at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids since hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of NASCOBAL in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided.

2.3 Monitoring, Dosage Modifications, and
Treatment Duration

Monitoring for Response and Safety

Monitor serum B12levels periodically during therapy to establish adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B12level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Dosage Modifications

If serum levels of B12decline after one month of treatment with NASCOBAL, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy (e.g., intramuscular or subcutaneous vitamin B12therapy).

Treatment Duration

In patients whose underlying cause of vitamin B12deficiency has been corrected and are deemed no longer at risk for vitamin B12deficiency, discontinue NASCOBAL. The safety and effectiveness of continued long-term use in these individuals has not been established.

In patients with pernicious anemia, continue appropriate vitamin B12treatment indefinitely.

2.4
Administration of NASCOBAL with
Other Therapy

NASCOBAL should be administered with other therapy(ies) in:

Patients with concurrent folate and vitamin B12deficiency:Administer folic acid in addition to NASCOBAL
Patients with concurrent iron and vitamin B12deficiency:Administer iron in addition to NASCOBAL

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^111EjPbA]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pernicious anaemia (PA) is an underdiagnosed complex autoimmune condition characterised by vitamin B 12 (B 12) malabsorption. This occurs secondary to gastric atrophy which leads to a reduction or absent production of intrinsic factor (IF). While PA is linked to the end stages of autoimmune gastritis (AIG), they are not synonymous. PA remains largely under-researched in clinical practice, contributing to gaps in diagnosis, management, and patient care. Its management typically involves regular and lifelong intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. An injection frequency of 1 mg every 2–3 months is often 'recommended'. However, this dosing schedule does not have a strong evidence base, and many individuals with PA / B 12 deficiency / PA report requiring more frequent injections for adequate symptom relief. Furthermore, recent data, which is consistent with prior work by Hooper et al. from a large survey we conducted on over 1100 PA patients shows that 40% of PA patients wait two years or longer for diagnosis, further complicating patient outcomes and satisfaction (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837).

The 2024 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on B 12 deficiency raise important questions about PA, particularly regarding its nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, and appropriate follow-up care. Here we review the NICE guidelines, with a specific focus on their implications for PA, and highlightareas for improvement in addressing the needs of such individuals.

### Primary neurologic symptoms: have you considered pernicious anemia? [^115NAKWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is a nutrient that is vital for metabolic function. Absorption of ingested B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor, which is secreted by parietal cells within the stomach. Pernicious anemia is caused by an intrinsic factor deficiency or autoantibodies against intrinsic factor. The presence of parietal cell antibodies can destroy parietal cells, which can also lead to a deficiency in intrinsic factor. Both lead to megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The typical presentation of pernicious anemia includes fatigue, pale appearance, tingling sensation, depression, alterations to vision and smell, urinary incontinence, psychotic episodes, and weakness. The most effective treatment for pernicious anemia is intramuscular B12.

Case Report

A 27-year-old woman with a history of vitiligo presented to the emergency department (ED) with bilateral lower extremity weakness, clumsiness, numbness, and tingling. Physical examination revealed ataxia, no sensation below her umbilicus, decreased strength, and hyperreflexia in both lower extremities. Complete blood count in the ED revealed low hemoglobin and hematocrit and elevated mean corpuscular volume, concerning for pernicious anemia. Further laboratory testing upon inpatient admission revealed a low vitamin B12 level and parietal cell antibodies in the blood. The patient's pernicious anemia was treated with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections, which led to near complete resolution of her symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Early suspicion and detection of pernicious anemia in the ED can prevent serious and permanent hematologic and neurologic damage and the development of other autoimmune disorders.

### Oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^115cgzUs]. Family Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, increasing with age. Most people are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B(12). Several studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B(12).

Objectives

We set out to identify randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the effectiveness of oral versus intramuscular vitamin B(12) to treat vitamin B(12) deficiency.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review searching databases for relevant RCTs. Outcomes included levels of serum vitamin B(12), total serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, haemoglobin and signs and symptoms of vitamin B(12) deficiency.

Results

Two RCTs comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B(12) met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to 4 months. In one of the studies, mean serum vitamin B(12) levels were significantly higher in the oral (643 ± 328 pg/ml; n = 18) compared with the intramuscular group (306 ± 118 pg/ml; n = 15) at 2 months (P < 0.001) and 4 months (1005 ± 595 versus 325 ± 165 pg/ml; P < 0.0005) and both groups had neurological responses. In the other study, serum vitamin B(12) levels increased significantly in those receiving oral vitamin B(12) and intramuscular vitamin B(12) (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 microg doses of oral vitamin B(12) daily and 1000 microg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short-term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B(12)-deficient patients.

### Hydroxocobalamin [^111kERyi]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Protect from light.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Hydroxocobalamin injection should be given only intramuscularly.

In patients with Addisonian Pernicious Anemia, parenteral therapy with vitamin B12is the recommended method of treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. Oral therapy is not dependable. In other patients with vitamin B12deficiency, the duration of therapy and route of administration will depend upon the cause and whether or not it is reversible.

Confirmatory diagnostic studies should be performed prior to initiating therapy, if possible, and the patient should be followed with appropriate studies to demonstrate hematologic improvement (Hgb, hematocrit, RBC, reticulocyte count). A diagnostic trial utilizing physiologic doses of vitamin B12(1 mcg daily) and observing daily reticulocyte counts after establishing a baseline may also be performed. The observation of reticulocytosis which usually occurs between the third and tenth day of therapy confirms the diagnosis of vitamin B12deficiency.

In seriously ill patients it may be advisable to administer both vitamin B12and folic acid while awaiting the results of distinguishing laboratory studies. It is not necessary to withhold vitamin B12therapy until the precise cause of B12deficiency is established since absorption studies can be performed at any time.

Serum potassium should be closely observed the first 48 hours and potassium should be administered if necessary.

Treatment of Vitamin B12Deficiency

Thirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may be expected with a dosage of vitamin B12sufficient to produce good hematologic response. Children may be given a total of 1 to 5 mg over a period of 2 or more weeks in doses of 100 mcg, then 30 to 50 mcg every 4 weeks for maintenance.

Patients who have normal intestinal absorption may be treated with an oral therapeutic multivitamin preparation, containing 15 mcg vitamin B12daily.

Schilling Test

The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes.

Folic acid alone is unwarranted in the treatment of pure vitamin B12 deficiency states, such as pernicious anemia. Folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia in that the blood picture may revert to normal while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

As with all preparations containing intrinsic factor, resistance may develop in some cases of pernicious anemia to the potentiation of absorption of physiologic doses of vitamin B12. If resistance occurs, parenteral therapy or oral therapy with so-called massive doses of vitamin B12 may be necessary for adequate treatment of the patient. No single regimen fits all cases, and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential and are recommended.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^113mYihi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for Folate Deficiency

Low folate levels usually occur in the context of a restricted diet, bariatric surgery, or malabsorption. Increased cell turnover such as pregnancy, severe eczema, chronic hemolysis, or exfoliative skin disease can contribute as well. Folate losses can occur with chronic hemodialysis or external biliary drainage.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency

Evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency often occurs simultaneously. A complete evaluation for deficiency would evaluate vitamin B12, folate, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine levels. Anti-intrinsic factor and anti-parietal cell antibodies should be considered to evaluate for pernicious anemia. Patients on chronic dialysis should have RBC folate levels evaluated rather than serum folate. Homocysteine levels are increased in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies however MMA is only elevated in B12 deficiency. Of note, although elevated homocysteine is associated with increased thrombosis, folic acid supplementation has not been showed to reduce the risk of such events.

A vitamin B12 value < 200pg/ml is indicative of deficiency. Vitamin B12 levels 200–300pg/ml and folate levels between 2–4ng/mL are considered borderline and may warrant further investigation. Vitamin B12 levels may be normal in those with nitrous oxide overuse as the underlying etiology is inactivation rather than deficiency. However homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated.

Vitamin B12 repletion should factor the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. Intramuscular route is preferred in patients with malabsorption or severe hematologic or neurologic symptoms. Initial dose can range from 1000mcg of intramuscular cyanocobalamin one to three times a week for 4 weeks or once daily for the first week followed by once a week doses for 4 weeks. Once symptoms improve, patients can be maintained on intramuscular preparation of 1000mcg once a month. Oral supplementation of 1000mcg can be used in those with milder symptoms and an intact gastrointestinal tract. A supratherapeutic oral dose has been used to promote passive absorption, bypassing the active transport mediated by intrinsic factor, in those with malabsorption who are unable to take intramuscular injections.

Folate repletion can start at 1 to 5mg a day until anemia improves followed by maintenance dose of 400mcg if the reason for deficiency persists. Vitamin B12 levels should be closely monitored as prolonged high dose folic acid supplementation may improve anemia but worsen an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to neurologic damage.

### Cyanocobalamine injection (Cyanocobalamine) [^114D8XYm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B1 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

### Cyanocobalamine injection (Cyanocobalamine) [^112xC54x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

- Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

- Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

- Fish tapeworm infestation

- Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

- Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

### How can cobalamin injections be spaced in long-term therapy for inborn errors of vitamin B (12) absorption? [^116fLJ5f]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Inborn errors of cobalamin (Cbl, vitamin B(12)) absorption include hereditary intrinsic factor deficiency (HIFD) and Imerslund-Gräsbeck disease (IGD). HIFD is secondary to mutations in the HIF gene while IGD is due to mutations in one of the 2 subunits of the intrinsic factor receptor that is cubilin (CUBN) or amnionless (AMN). These disorders lead to intracellular Cbl depletion which in turn causes megaloblastic bone marrow failure, accumulation of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA), and methionine depletion. The clinical presentation reflects Cbl deficiency, with gastrointestinal symptoms, pancytopenia, and megaloblastic anemia. Mixed proteinuria, when it is present is strongly suggestive of IGD. Accurate diagnosis is always an emergency because early detection and treatment with life-long parenteral pharmacological doses of hydroxocobalamin are life saving and prevent further deterioration. However, the optimal frequency for cobalamin injections as a maintenance therapy is poorly reported. In order to evaluate the optimal maintenance schedule of cobalamin injections, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, molecular and treatment data on 7 patients affected with congenital Cbl malabsorption. Unlike previous recommendations, we showed that a maintenance dosage of 1 mg cobalamin twice a year was enough to ensure a normal clinical status and keep the hematological and metabolic parameters in the normal range. These data suggest that patients affected with inborn errors of cobalamin absorption may be safely long-term treated with cobalamin injections every 6 months with careful follow-up of hematological and metabolic parameters. This maintenance regime is beneficial because the patients' quality of life improves.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113AAYBz]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients may also present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper that may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged > 60 years are at highest risk for developing pernicious anemia (autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells). A B12 level of < 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrants a diagnostic trial of B12. Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency with normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg, daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

### Oral versus intramuscular cobalamin treatment in megaloblastic anemia: a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label study [^116kRstw]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency, the most common cause of megaloblastic anemia, is treated with intramuscular (IM) cobalamin. It has been suggested by some investigators that oral (p.o.) cobalamin treatment may be as effective in the treatment of this condition, with the advantages of ease of administration and lower cost.

Objective

This study assessed the effects and cost of p.o. versus i.m. cobalamin treatment in patients with megaloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency.

Methods

This was a 90-day, prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted at the Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Adnan Menderes University Research and Practice Hospital (Aydin, Turkey). Patients aged ≥ 16 years with megaloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency were randomized to receive 1000-microg cobalamin p.o. once daily for 10 days (p.o. group) or 1000-microg cobalamin i.m. once daily for 10 days (i.m. group). After 10 days, both treatments were administered once a week for 4 weeks, and after that, once a month for life. Patients were assessed for the presence of reticulocytosis between treatment days 5 and 10 until it was detected. Therapeutic effectiveness was assessed by measuring hematologic parameters on days 0, 10, 30, and 90 and serum vitamin B12 concentration on days 0 and 90. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used before and after the B12 therapy for cognitive function assessment and 125-Hz diapozone was used for vibration threshold testing. Neurologic sensory assessment, including soft-touch and pinprick examinations, was used to identify neuropathy at baseline and study end. Tolerability was assessed using laboratory tests and patient interview. Cost was assessed using the cost of the study drug and of the injection.

Results

Sixty patients completed the study 26 in the p.o. group (16 men, 10 women; mean [SD] age, 60 [15] years) and 34 in the i.m. group (17 men, 17 women; mean [SD] age, 64 [10] years). Reticulocytosis was observed in all patients. In the p.o. group, at days 30 and 90, all hematologic parameters changed significantly versus day 0 (mean hemoglobin levels increased [both P < 0.001]; mean corpuscular volume decreased [both P < 0.001]; mean white blood cell count increased [day 30, P < 0.01; day 90, P < 0.001]; and mean platelet count increased [both P < 0.001]). The mean serum vitamin B12 concentration increased significantly from day 0 to 90 (P < 0.001). These hematologic parameters and the recovery patterns were similar between the 2 groups. Neurologic findings included sensitive peripheral neuropathy in 9 patients (15.0%), alteration of cognitive function (loss of memory, impaired concentration) in 7 patients (11.7%), and loss of sense of vibration in 5 patients (8.3%). Neurologic improvement was detected in 7 of 9 patients (77.8%) in the p.o. group and 9 of 12 patients (75.0%) in the i.m. group at day 30.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with megaloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency, p.o. cobalamin treatment was as effective as i.m. cobalamin treatment. P.o. treatment also was better tolerated and less expensive compared with IM treatment. However, because of the small sample size and the short term of this study, further long-term studies are needed to determine the efficacy of p.o. cobalamin treatment.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: the great masquerader [^115UcM5t]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare in children, with nonspecific symptoms including failure to thrive, vomiting, anorexia, and neurologic changes with or without hematologic disturbances. The neuropathy can be severe and irreversible. We report four cases of children with B12 deficiency secondary to adult type pernicious anemia, a presumed transport protein abnormality, and a metabolic defect. All demonstrated neurologic compromise that improved after initiation of B12 therapy. Hematologic manifestations may be preceded by constitutional, gastrointestinal, or neurologic changes, and must raise concern for B12 deficiency. Therapy should be initiated promptly in this setting to prevent irreversible neuropathy.

Medical management

There is limited guidance on the management of non-neoplastic complications of AIG/PA, including frequency of interval surveillance and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency and iron deficiency. Importantly, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of anemia and if not addressed can lead to irreversible neurologic deficits. Parenteral rather than oral supplementation is preferred, especially if neurologic symptoms are present. Appropriate supplementation of vitamin B12 and iron is important, along with workup of other etiologies for these not uncommon deficiencies based on the clinical scenario.

### Treatment of vitamin b (12)-deficiency anemia: oral versus parenteral therapy [^1111nLjr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of oral cyanocobalamin therapy in the treatment of cobalamin (vitamin B(12))-deficient anemia.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-May 2000) and through secondary sources.

Data Synthesis

Cobalamin-deficient anemia is among the most common diagnoses in older populations. Cobalamin-deficient anemia may be diagnosed as pernicious anemia, resulting from the lack of intrinsic factor required for cobalamin absorption or as protein malabsorption from the inability to displace cobalamin from protein food sources. Several studies provide evidence that daily oral cyanocobalamin as opposed to monthly parenteral formulations may adequately treat both types of cobalamin-deficient anemias.

Conclusions

Daily oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 1000–2000 microg can be used for treatment in most cobalamin-deficient patients who can tolerate oral supplementation. There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of oral cyanocobalamin replacement in patients with severe neurologic involvement.

### Oral vitamin B12 supplementation in pernicious anemia: a prospective cohort study [^111A3cQx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The absorption of vitamin B12 is hindered in pernicious anemia (PA) owing to intrinsic factor deficiency. Traditionally, intramuscular vitamin B12 injections were the standard treatment, bypassing the impaired absorption. Although there is potential for oral vitamin B12 supplementation through passive enteral absorption, it is not commonly prescribed in PA owing to limited studies assessing its efficacy.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the efficacy of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in PA.

Methods

We enrolled participants diagnosed with incident vitamin B12 deficiency related to PA. The diagnosis of PA was based on the presence of classical immune gastritis and of anti-intrinsic factor and/or antiparietal cell antibodies. To evaluate the vitamin B12 status, we measured total plasma vitamin B12, plasma homocysteine, and plasma methylmalonic acid (pMMA) concentration and urinary methylmalonic acid-to-creatinine ratio. Participants were treated with oral cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 1000 μg/d throughout the study duration. Clinical and biological vitamin B12 deficiency related features were prospectively and systematically assessed over the 1-y study duration.

Results

We included 26 patients with vitamin B12 deficiency revealing PA. Following 1 mo of oral vitamin B12 supplementation, 88.5% of patients were no longer deficient in vitamin B12, with significant improvement of plasma vitamin B12 [407 (297–485) compared with 148 (116–213) pmol/L; P < 0.0001], plasma homocysteine [13.5 (10.9–29.8) compared with 18.6 (13.7–46.8) μmol/L; P < 0.0001], and pMMA [0.24 (0.16–0.38) compared with 0.56 (0.28–1.09) pmol/L; P < 0.0001] concentrations than those at baseline. The enhancement of these biological parameters persisted throughout the 12-month follow-up, with no patients showing vitamin B12 deficiency by the end of the follow-up period. The median time to reverse initial vitamin B12 deficiency abnormalities ranged from 1 mo for hemolysis to 4 mo for mucosal symptoms.

Conclusions

Oral supplementation with 1000 μg/d of cyanocobalamin has been shown to improve vitamin B12 deficiency in PA.

Symptomatic deficiency in people with B 12 malabsorption

Suggested treatment schemes differ considerably between countries. The British National Formulary (BNF), for example, differentiates the prescription of hydroxocobalamin according to presenting symptoms, eg, "For neurological involvement, it is advised to administer hydroxocobalamin by intramuscular injection, initially 1 mg once daily on alternate days until no further improvement, then 1 mg every 2 months". In the Netherlands, pharmacotherapeutic guidelinesrecommend (for the same neurological symptoms or abnormalities) administration of 1000 mcg once or twice weekly for up to two years. Little robust, reliable evidence supports current recommended dosing schedules, and no clinical studies assess the effectiveness and optimal dosing of intramuscular cobalamin preparations for symptom relief, other than studies assessing attained serum B 12 concentrations and sometimes haematological response. Studies as early as the 1960s reported considerable differences between individuals in pharmacodynamicsand dose requirements. Some patients may require a more frequent injection regimen, especially those with neurological symptoms, varying from twice weekly to every 2–4 weeks to become and remain asymptomatic. A possible explanation may be the large inter-individual difference in biliary B 12 excretion. More than two thirds of the B 12 excreted in bile is reabsorbed in the small intestine, but this reabsorption is reduced in people with pernicious anaemia or other causes of B 12 malabsorption.

Nitrous oxide toxicity

The Association of British Neurologists has recently issued guidance on recognising and managing nitrous oxide toxicity associated with B 12 deficiency. It recommends rapid initiation of alternate-day intramuscular hydroxocobalamin therapy, and maintenance of this treatment until all symptoms have resolved or there is no further neurological improvement, with long term B 12 therapy depending on the presence of deficiency on presentation, together with total abstinence from the use of nitrous oxide.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^115fNUkC]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Screening for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T1DM

Among patients with T1DM, there are no clear guidelines regarding screening for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, due to the high prevalence of pernicious anaemia and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency among T1DM patients reported in most cross sectional studies, it would be pragmatic to screen at diagnosis and then later yearly for 3 years, then five yearly thereafter or in presence of any clinical indication since vitamin B12 deficiency can develop at anytime. Screening should involve assessment of serum vitamin B12 levels and markers of gastric autoimmunity like PCA and AIF especially among T1DM patients with GAD-65 and thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Presence of these auto antibodies increases the propensity to developing vitamin B12 deficiency.

Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients

Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency does not differ regardless of the aetiology. All patients deficient of vitamin B12 should receive replacement therapy with either oral or parenteral vitamin B12. Both formulations have been demonstrated to induce comparable desirable haematological and neurological improvements regardless of the aetiology of the deficiency. In adult patients with T2DM, intra muscular or oral vitamin B12 in doses of 1000 μg daily for a week then once every week for 4 weeks are sufficient to correct vitamin B12 deficiency.

Among young patients with T1DM and co-existing vitamin B12 deficiency, replacement therapy with daily intra muscular or oral vitamin B12 in the dose of 100μg for a week and then monthly is satisfactory. In severe cases, parenteral or oral administration of 1000 μg/day of vitamin B12 for a week, followed by the similar dose given every week for 1 month and then later monthly is advised.

Concomitant folate deficiency should be treated with oral folate replacement in doses of 5 mg daily for 1–4 months. Folate administration prior to correcting vitamin B12 deficiency should be avoided because it results into progression and / worsening of the associated neurological manifestations.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Avoid using the intravenous route. Use of this product intravenously will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine.

Pernicious Anemia

Parenteral vitamin B12is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed.

Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption

Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated.

Schilling Test

The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Vitamin B [^1142nVEF]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B12regularly. The need for Vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5th to 7th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Cyanocobalamine injection (Cyanocobalamine) [^117TUHfk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Vitamin B [^115er476]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How cost effective is B 12?

Oral cyanocobalamin is cost effective for treating diet related B 12 deficiency. A hydroxocobalamin vial for parenteral administration containing 1000 mcg costs less than £1. The main costs of intramuscular B 12 therapy are associated with the administration of the injection itself, when this is done by a nurse specialist or GP. Many patients have successfully learnt to self-administer B 12 by intramuscular injection, which reduces both healthcare costs and burden on GP practices, and allows people who are B 12 deficient to optimise their treatment regimen.

Case example

A man in his 70s presents with a nine month history of difficulty walking and climbing stairs, numbness and pain in his lower limbs, and paraesthesia in his hands. He received a diagnosis of B 12 deficiency 10 years ago, and during the covid-19 pandemic he switched from intramuscular hydroxocobalamin 1000 mcg once monthly to oral B 12 supplementation. At the current presentation he has serum B 12 (209 pmol/L), which is within the normal range (148–600 pmol/L), however MMA is elevated at 1100 nmol/L (a measurement taken in 2017 was 117 nmol/L, normal < 300 nmol/L). He had no other haematological abnormalities at initial presentation or at his current relapse. Hydroxocobalamin injections are resumed twice weekly (self-administrated) because of the severity of the neuropathy. It takes more than 12 months for his symptoms to resolve.

Tips for patients.

If you have limited dietary intake of B 12 and experience symptoms listed in box 1, you might have B 12 deficiency.
Consider regular oral supplementation if you have a limited dietary intake of B 12 or are taking medications that interfere with B 12 absorption.
Where possible, avoid suddenly reducing the B 12 dose or injection frequency, as too rapid dose reduction may worsen symptoms or lead to symptom recurrence. Instead, gradually increase the interval between B 12 injections over the course of several months while monitoring symptoms.
If you require regular intramuscular B 12 injections, consider being taught how to self-administer these.
Consider creating an individualised treatment plan with the support of your doctor tailored to help you become or remain symptom-free (dose and frequency will vary between individuals from twice weekly to once every two to three months).

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^115g1XBY]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

In one sense, this statement is correct: the term 'pernicious anaemia', when taken literally, implies a severe, life-threatening form of anaemia, which is uncommon in modern practice due to improvements in testing and treatment, such severe manifestations are typically prevented, as the condition is more likely to be diagnosed earlier or treated with B 12. However, changing the name overlooks the broader clinical context of PA, which is not just an issue of anaemia but rather a condition characterised by the autoimmune-mediated destruction of parietal cells leading to IF deficiency and lifelong B 12 malabsorption. Three other points warrant mentioning. First, there is also a separate autoimmune-mediated attack on IF that will lead to PA. Second, not all AIG diagnoses translate to PA. PA occurs in only about 15–20% of AIG patients, highlighting the inaccuracy of using AIG as a substitute for PA. The life-course of PA development has not been studied, but there is sufficient information to highlight that the timelines are highly varied among patients. For instance, some individuals may develop PA as early as 1 year after the onset of AIG, while others may not progress to PA until 15 or more years after AIG onset. Thus, whilst PA is acknowledged as a consequence of AIG, conflating the two terms risks oversimplifying the disease process and ignoring the clinical specificity of PA as an advanced manifestation. Third, over 50% of individuals with symptomatic B deficiency test negative for IF or parietal cell auto-antibodies, and the true prevalence of AIG in the UK is not known, as individuals with B deficiency rarely undergo endoscopy.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116Ty2Y8]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the significantly lower HbA1c levels in the M group (p = 0.004) highlight metformin's efficacy in improving glycaemic control, as previously demonstrated in a randomised controlled study by González‐Ortiz et al. which reported a marked reduction in HbA1c levels after 2 months of metformin therapy compared with the control group. These findings reaffirm metformin's role as a cornerstone in managing hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM, effectively lowering HbA1c by an average of 1.3%.

Given the significant reduction in vitamin B12 levels among metformin users, we recommend annual screening for vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2DM on metformin therapy. Early detection and timely supplementation with vitamin B12, including intramuscular injections, when necessary, are critical to preventing complications, such as megaloblastic anaemia and neurological deficits. Long‐term prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better elucidate the relationship between metformin dose, treatment duration, and the progression of vitamin B12 deficiency.

5.1 Study Limitations

The study was done retrospectively and essential data, such as the patient's duration of metformin usage could not be obtained from the patient's records. The number of participants was limited, especially the control group. Additionally, the use of methylmalonic acid to assess serum vitamin B12 levels was challenging because of cost‐effectiveness reasons.

### Update on transcobalamin deficiency: clinical presentation, treatment and outcome [^114gJfsw]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Transcobalamin (TC) transports cobalamin from blood into cells. TC deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder usually presenting in early infancy with failure to thrive, weakness, diarrhoea, pallor, anemia, and pancytopenia or agammaglobulinemia. It can sometimes resemble neonatal leukemia or severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Diagnosis of TC deficiency is suspected based on megaloblastic anemia, elevation of total plasma homocysteine, and blood or urine methylmalonic acid. It is confirmed by studying the synthesis of TC in cultured fibroblasts, or by molecular analysis of the TCN2 gene. TC deficiency is treatable with supplemental cobalamin, but the optimal type, route and frequency of cobalamin administration and long term patient outcomes are unknown. Here we present a series of 30 patients with TC deficiency, including an update on multiple previously published patients, in order to evaluate the different treatment strategies and provide information about long term outcome. Based on the data presented, current practice appears to favour treatment of individuals with TC deficiency by intramuscular injections of hydroxy- or cyanocobalamin. In most cases presented, at least weekly injections (1 mg IM) were necessary to ensure optimal treatment. Most centres adjusted the treatment regimen based on monitoring CBC, total plasma homocysteine, plasma and urine methylmalonic acid, as well as, clinical status. Finally, continuing IM treatment into adulthood appears to be beneficial.

Patient experiences

Data from a review of patient experiences and surveys involving more than 2200 patients with B 12 deficiency in the UK indicate that many patients have concerns related to healthcare quality, safety, and treatment, with nearly two thirds of respondents reporting that their treatment is insufficient to manage symptoms. Some patients may experience recurrence or worsening of symptoms when the interval between injections is extended or extended too quickly, and report that continuation of frequent intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections, varying between twice weekly and once every three to four weeks, is needed to remain asymptomatic. Why certain patients require more frequent treatment is not understood.

In an online survey, almost one third of 683 participants reported cancellation of B 12 injections during the covid-19 lockdowns, with subsequent worsening of symptoms and often with negative emotions and feelings including anger, fear, disappointment, feeling let down, and feeling undervalued. In contrast, those who were self-administering B 12 injections or who were rapidly taught to do so reported a noticeable improvement in their symptoms and quality of life, with some benefiting from increasing the frequency of injections to suit their personal need.

What are the harms?

Strong evidence, from decades of treating individuals with inborn errors of B 12 metabolism, supports the safety of parenteral, lifelong, even high dose hydroxocobalamin, sometimes even at very high doses. Long term epidemiological studies also indicate that treatment with pharmacological B 12 doses and the corresponding increase in serum B 12 do not increase mortality. Data on the safety of cyanocobalamin, when administered with high frequency (ie, one to two times a week) for a longer period of time, are lacking.

Adverse drug reactions include skin reactions like acne or rosacea; their frequency is unknown. In our experience, some people have successfully switched to a cobalamin preparation without benzylalcohol (a preservative in some parenteral B 12 preparations) and have seen their skin problems resolve. Isolated allergy cases are reported, with some successfully treated by desensitisation. Transient hypokalaemia during initial B 12 treatment in individuals with severe anaemia is usually mild and without clinical consequences.

Contraindications

Preparations containing benzylalcohol are contraindicated for use in children and pregnant women. Cyanocobalamin is associated with worsening of visual problems, and is therefore contraindicated in people with the mitochondrial disorder Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Cyanocobalamin (but not hydroxocobalamin) is also contraindicated in renal insufficiency.

Tips for safer prescribing

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

Continued or new B12 therapy of women with deficiency during pregnancy and lactation is mandatory and safe.B 12 deficiency increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including early pregnancy loss, neural tube defects, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, as well as insulin resistance and adiposity. It also may lead to neurological complications in newborns, such as hypotonia, failure to thrive, central apnoeas, and seizures.

Children

Evidence based treatment advice on treatment in children is lacking; each case is judged individually. Solid evidence on the safety of parenteral, lifelong, high dose hydroxocobalamin is available from decades of treating patients with inborn errors of B 12 metabolism (eg, cobalamin C deficiency).

Symptom monitoring

Monitor symptoms regularly (eg, every two to three months) as they may reappear, even after several months, if injection frequency is reduced. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B 12 or MMA is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement. Base the injection frequency on symptoms, and not on biomarker assessment.

Shared decision making

Use shared decision making to establish a long term frequency of B 12 injections for each patient and teach them how to self-inject.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^1137RxyH]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^115EeVa1]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clinical and biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with both types 1 and 2 DM. Future large and well designed studies on screening for vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation and optimal supplementation dose among type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients are warranted to help guide formulation of guidelines in diabetes clinical care. Annual screening for vitamin B12 deficiency using more sensitive methods like serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentrations (in clinical settings where they are accessible) and supplementation should be adopted among diabetic patients with specific risk factors of vitamin B12 deficiency.

How well does B 12 therapy work?

Treatment with B 12 injections is efficacious in restoring normal metabolism, alleviating symptoms, and reversing haematological and some neurological complications of deficiency. Anaemia usually resolves within six to eight weeks, but coexisting iron deficiency may be present and need oral iron supplementationand, in severe cases, parenteral iron infusion. Neurological symptoms may take several months or even years to resolve completely. Evidence from observational studies suggests that with longer symptom duration and more profound B 12 deficiency, the likelihood that neurological symptoms will not completely resolve increases. People often continue to experience mild neurological symptoms such as poor memory, impaired concentration, and fatigue even after "adequate" B 12 replacement (eg, therapy according to the BNF suggested treatment regimen)and many patients report they need additional treatment. Biomarkers normalise more rapidly than an improvement or reversal of (neurological) symptoms. Additionally, symptoms may reappear without changes in biomarker status.

Some controversies exist about long-term parenteral B 12 treatment. These are outlined below.

Oral versus intramuscular administration

It is suggested that passive absorption of B 12 following sufficiently high oral doses (2000 mcg) can result in up to 10–12 mcg being absorbed dailyand may allow serum B 12 concentrations to normalise. However, passive absorption may be well below 1% in many patients, and high biliary B 12 excretion may add to a negative B 12 balance. Prospective studies on this topic have focused mainly on normalising serum B 12 concentrations and should be interpreted with caution since the specific goal of treatment in symptomatic B 12 deficiency is alleviating symptoms. A recent Cochrane Review found that available studies only provide very low quality evidence that oral B 12 is as efficacious as intramuscular B 12 in improving symptoms. A recent survey of 204 patients suggested that oral B 12 was associated with less effective symptom improvement than parenteral treatment. In practice, some patients may be able to switch to very high dose (ie, 2000 mcg daily) oral supplementation instead of continuing parenteral administration, but it is impossible to predict in whom this can be done safely, and many are at risk of worsening symptoms which may become permanent.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^114QB96w]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

For women with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes who become pregnant, a recent consensus statement recommends the following as optimal glycemic goals, if they can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia:
premeal, bedtime, and overnight glucose 60–99 mg/dl (3.3–5.4 mmol/l)
peak postprandial glucose 100–129 mg/dl (5.4–7.1 mmol/l)
A1C < 6.0%

3. Approach to treatment

a. Therapy for type 1 diabetes.

The DCCT clearly showed that intensive insulin therapy (three or more injections per day of insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII] or insulin pump therapy) was a key part of improved glycemia and better outcomes. At the time of the study, therapy was carried out with short- and intermediate-acting human insulins. Despite better microvascular outcomes, intensive insulin therapy was associated with a high rate in severe hypoglycemia (62 episodes per 100 patient-years of therapy). Since the time of the DCCT, a number of rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogs have been developed. These analogs are associated with less hypoglycemia with equal A1C lowering in type 1 diabetes.

Recommended therapy for type 1 diabetes therefore consists of the following components: 1) use of multiple dose insulin injections (3–4 injections per day of basal and prandial insulin) or CSII therapy; 2) matching of prandial insulin to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated activity; and 3) for many patients (especially if hypoglycemia is a problem), use of insulin analogs. There are excellent reviews available that guide the initiation and management of insulin therapy to achieve desired glycemic goals.

Because of the increased frequency of other autoimmune diseases in type 1 diabetes, screening for thyroid dysfunction, vitamin B12 deficiency, or celiac disease should be considered based on signs and symptoms. Periodic screening in the absence of symptoms has been recommended, but the effectiveness and optimal frequency are unclear.

Take biopsies from the greater and lesser curves since atrophic gastritis affects the corpus in pernicious anemia.

There are also several positives for PA patients from the 2024 NICE guidelines

The guidelines' emphasis on a symptom-based approach to treatment is an urgent and necessary shift that could positively influence current practice. They also stress the importance of individualised care, suggesting that B 12 replacement dosage, frequency, and delivery method may need to be tailored to ensure treatment efficacy. However, many patients require treatment more frequently than current guidelines suggest. Survey data indicates that up to 50% of patients require more frequent injections to manage their symptoms effectively (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837). This is consistent with findings from Hooper et al. where 65% of patients received B 12 injections according to current guidelines (every 2–3 months). Further qualitative evidence from interviews also highlights that many PA patients considered the current guidelines too restrictive, with symptoms reoccurring well before the next planned injection.

### Treatment of pernicious anemia with orally administered cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) [^115sEMKo]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction Parenteral injection of cyanocobalamin is well established as an effective and reliable treatment for pernicious anemia. In contrast, currently available preparations for oral use have proved to be much less dependable. 1 A study was initiated in 1950 in the hematology clinic of The Johns Hopkins Hospital to determine whether relatively large amounts of pure cyanocobalamin, when administered orally without intrinsic factor or other adjuvants, would provide adequate therapy for patients with pernicious anemia. The early results of this investigation2–4 as well as those obtained in other clinics 5–11 were favorable. This paper provides further observations on a group of patients receiving various doses of orally administered cyanocobalamin for periods of up to six and one-half years. Materials and Methods The diagnosis of pernicious anemia had been well established by clinical and hematological criteria in each patient chosen to participate in this study.

Whilst renaming PA as AIG can add confusion and uncertainty, the name PA has its own shortcomings, which is perhaps why NICE proposed to change it. The term 'pernicious anaemia' suggests that anaemia is a defining characteristic of the disease. However, anaemia is present in only 15–20% of PA diagnoses. Practitioners unfamiliar with PA are commonly misled by the term 'anaemia', as all ICD-10 (D51.0–9) codes for B deficiency incorrectly include the term anaemia. The term 'pernicious' is also an anachronism, predating the 1948 discovery of B as an effective treatment. It was first coined by Anton Biermer in 1871 to describe the fatal anaemia cases seen prior to the discovery of effective treatments. It is important to note that even though anaemia occurs in a minority of PA patients, this represents an important subgroup of patients that requires a different management approach. The current guidelines do not address how to specifically diagnose and manage this subgroup of patients, representing a significant gap in knowledge and warranting further research.

The definition and our understanding of the condition has evolved significantly since Biermer's original description. We now know that PA often presents with predominantly neurological symptoms. Therefore, if a name change is warranted, it should be one that better reflects the current clinical presentation of the disease.

The persistent use of the term 'pernicious anaemia' in both clinical practice (primary, secondary and tertiary care) and state-of-the-art research highlights a disconnect between these guidelines and current clinical practice. It is important to highlight that the adoption of new and more appropriate terminology would require universal acceptance by clinicians, carers and patients who would have lived with the name PA for most of their lives. While changing established medical terminology may take decades — potentially one to two generations of doctors — before it is fully adopted in clinical language, emphasising that such a change, if it were to happen, would be gradual and require effective dissemination.

However, a name change could offer significant advantages by reflecting the current understanding of PA and encouraging clinicians to investigate neurological symptoms associated with PA. This would be achieved through a concerted effort to educate doctors by incorporating this knowledge into the curriculum, which will dispel misconceptions commonly ascribed to PA patients by doctors and promote a deeper understanding of PA's complexity.
