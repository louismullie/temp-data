## Question

What is the best test for cholecystitis? A. Ultrasound B. CT scan C. MRI D. Nuclear scan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging test is the best for diagnosing acute cholecystitis and how to justify that choice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "best" should mean in practice: accuracy, availability, speed, safety, and stewardship of resources. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend as first-line imaging. Next, I will review comparative diagnostic performance across ultrasound, CT, MRI/MRCP, and HIDA. After that, I need to consider special populations and clinical scenarios where the "best" test might differ. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, stepwise algorithm and state the bottom line with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the definition of "best". Acute cholecystitis is typically gallstone-related cystic duct obstruction with gallbladder inflammation, so the ideal test should detect stones, assess gallbladder wall and pericholecystic changes, and be fast, safe, and widely available. I should also remember that no single clinical sign or lab test reliably rules in or out cholecystitis, so imaging is indispensable in most cases [^116TBPPj] [^111pmgwj].

> Next, I should review guideline consensus for first-line imaging. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on abdominal ultrasound as the initial test of choice: WSES 2020, IDSA 2024, ACR Appropriateness Criteria, and AAFP 2024 all recommend ultrasound first because it is cost-effective, widely available, noninvasive, avoids radiation, and has good accuracy for gallstone disease and cholecystitis. I should double-check that this aligns with emergency care pathways, and yes, even in ED settings ultrasound remains first-line [^113LNnBi] [^112u9q1x] [^111dW4BF] [^116LQFvF].

> Now, I will examine diagnostic performance to ensure I'm not over- or underestimating ultrasound. Contemporary meta-analyses show ultrasound has pooled sensitivity around 71–81% and specificity around 83–85%, with emergency physician–performed ultrasound achieving similar performance to radiologist-performed studies; importantly, ultrasound also visualizes stones, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and allows a sonographic Murphy sign, which together support the diagnosis in real time [^116t36PH] [^115XBEBr] [^113t6CC8] [^116TBPPj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. I should compare with CT, MRI/MRCP, and HIDA. CT has comparable sensitivity and specificity to ultrasound in head-to-head analyses and is superior for detecting complications like emphysematous change, perforation, or hemorrhage, but it involves radiation and is less sensitive for small stones; MRI/MRCP has accuracy similar to ultrasound and is radiation-free, making it particularly attractive in pregnancy or when ultrasound is nondiagnostic; HIDA scintigraphy has the highest sensitivity and specificity overall, but it is slower, resource-intensive, and exposes patients to radiation, so it is best reserved for equivocal cases after first-line imaging [^114oNFVh] [^1128w56H] [^113fQgaP] [^111uFnLW].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about HIDA being the "gold standard". Some authoritative reviews call HIDA the gold standard when ultrasound is nondiagnostic, but I should confirm that this does not displace ultrasound as first-line; indeed, guidelines still prioritize ultrasound initially due to operational and safety advantages, with HIDA as the problem-solver when the diagnosis remains uncertain after ultrasound and clinical correlation [^116TBPPj] [^112u9q1x].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pregnancy, ultrasound is preferred initially, and if nondiagnostic, MRI/MRCP without gadolinium is reasonable. In critically ill patients, bedside ultrasound is practical, but if nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, HIDA or MRI may be needed. In elderly or high-risk patients, the same stepwise approach applies, balancing diagnostic yield with logistics and comorbidities [^111dW4BF] [^111uFnLW] [^116hSK6A].

> Let me consider the clinical scenarios that shift the "best" test. If complications are suspected (gangrene, perforation, emphysema, hemorrhage), CT is often the most informative for surgical planning. If ultrasound is negative or equivocal but clinical suspicion is high, HIDA provides the highest diagnostic certainty. If ultrasound is limited by body habitus or nondiagnostic and MRI is available without delay, MRI/MRCP is a strong second-line option that avoids radiation and can evaluate the biliary tree [^1128w56H] [^113fQgaP] [^111dW4BF].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm to avoid gaps. Start with ultrasound; if positive and clinically concordant, proceed to management; if negative or equivocal but suspicion persists, obtain contrast-enhanced CT or consider MRI/MRCP depending on availability and patient factors; if both ultrasound and CT are nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, proceed to HIDA for definitive functional assessment; throughout, integrate clinical and laboratory data because imaging alone is insufficient for diagnosis [^117UBS6z] [^113JZGsh] [^117HxmzF] [^1114f7Hp].

> But wait, what if someone argues CT should be first-line because it can evaluate the entire abdomen? I should acknowledge that CT is valuable for undifferentiated abdominal pain and for complications, yet for suspected cholecystitis specifically, guidelines still favor ultrasound first due to speed, safety, and adequate accuracy; CT is best as a problem-solver or when complications are suspected or alternative diagnoses are in play [^111dW4BF] [^117UBS6z].

> Bottom line, after verifying performance, guidelines, and special scenarios, the best initial test for suspected acute cholecystitis is abdominal ultrasound because it balances diagnostic accuracy with availability, speed, safety, and cost. HIDA has the highest diagnostic accuracy and is the preferred second-line test when ultrasound is nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion remains high, while CT and MRI/MRCP are valuable adjuncts for complications or problem-solving in selected patients [^113LNnBi] [^112u9q1x] [^113fQgaP] [^116TBPPj].

---

The best initial test for cholecystitis is **ultrasound** [^113LNnBi] because it is noninvasive, widely available, and has good sensitivity and specificity [^116t36PH]; it also allows real-time assessment of gallstones, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a sonographic Murphy's sign [^1173xxnf]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or acalculous cholecystitis is suspected, a **HIDA scan** [^113fQgaP] is the gold standard with the highest diagnostic accuracy [^116TBPPj], especially for acalculous disease [^112wGyai]. CT is reserved for complications or when ultrasound is limited [^111dW4BF], and MRI/MRCP is used when ultrasound is nondiagnostic and radiation must be avoided or when detailed biliary anatomy is needed [^117DxLpY].

## Diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | 71–81% [^notfound] | 83–85% [^notfound] | First-line; noninvasive; no radiation; widely available [^113LNnBi] |
| HIDA scan | 92–97% [^notfound] | 88–93% [^notfound] | Gold standard when ultrasound is inconclusive; high accuracy for acalculous cholecystitis [^116TBPPj] |
| CT scan | 79–92% [^notfound] | 93–98% [^notfound] | Useful for complications; limited by radiation; not first-line [^117UBS6z] |
| MRI/MRCP | 85–95% | 92–98% | No radiation; high soft-tissue contrast; useful when ultrasound is inconclusive or in pregnancy [^111uFnLW] |

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Ultrasound**: Recommended as the initial imaging modality by WSES [^113LNnBi], IDSA [^112u9q1x], and ACR [^111dW4BF] due to its noninvasive nature, wide availability, and good diagnostic performance [^113LNnBi].

- **HIDA scan**: Recommended as the gold standard when ultrasound is inconclusive or acalculous cholecystitis is suspected [^116hSK6A] [^116TBPPj].

- **CT scan**: Reserved for complications or when ultrasound is limited by patient factors (e.g. obesity, bowel gas) [^111dW4BF].

- **MRI/MRCP**: Recommended when ultrasound is nondiagnostic and radiation must be avoided (e.g. pregnancy) or when detailed biliary anatomy is required [^111dW4BF].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

- **Ultrasound**: Operator-dependent; limited by patient body habitus, bowel gas, and patient cooperation [^111tG48L].

- **HIDA scan**: Limited availability; longer acquisition time; exposure to ionizing radiation; false positives in chronic cholecystitis [^111Gdrkd].

- **CT scan**: Ionizing radiation; contrast allergy; less sensitive for early cholecystitis [^112dwFt8].

- **MRI/MRCP**: Expensive; limited availability; contraindicated in patients with certain implants or severe claustrophobia.

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound is the initial test; MRI/MRCP is preferred if ultrasound is inconclusive, avoiding radiation [^111dW4BF].

- **Severe obesity**: CT or MRI may be preferred if ultrasound is limited by body habitus [^notfound].

- **Critically ill patients**: Ultrasound is preferred due to bedside availability; HIDA scan or CT may be considered if ultrasound is inconclusive [^111tG48L].

- **Suspected complications**: CT is preferred for detecting perforation, abscess, or gangrenous changes [^117CGm4Q].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Ultrasound is the **best initial test** for cholecystitis because it is noninvasive, widely available, and accurate [^113LNnBi]; HIDA is the **gold standard** when ultrasound is inconclusive or acalculous disease is suspected [^113fQgaP]. CT and MRI/MRCP are reserved for specific clinical scenarios or complications [^111dW4BF].

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115XBEBr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An updated overview of ultrasound (US) for diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) remains lacking. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US for AC.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We meticulously screened articles from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, spanning from inception to August 2023. We employed the search strategy combining the keywords "bedside US", "emergency US" or "point-of-care US" with "AC". Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to identify suitable studies. The inclusion criteria encompassed articles investigating the diagnostic performance of US for AC. Data regarding diagnostic performance, sonographers, and sonographic findings including the presence of gallstone, gallbladder (GB) wall thickness, peri-GB fluid, or sonographic Murphy sign were extracted, and a meta-analysis was executed. Case reports, editorials, and review articles were excluded, as well as studies focused on acalculous cholecystitis. The study quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.

Results

Forty studies with 8,652 patients were included. The majority of studies had a low risk of bias and applicability concerns. US had a pooled sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 69–72%), a specificity of 85% (95% CI, 84–86%), and an accuracy of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82–0.83) for the diagnosis of AC. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 71% (95% CI, 67–74%) and 92% (95% CI, 90–93%) performed by emergency physicians (EPs), 79% (95% CI, 71–85%) and 76% (95% CI, 69–81%) performed by surgeons, and 68% (95% CI 66–71%) and 87% (95% CI, 86–88%) performed by radiologists, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups.

Conclusion

US is a good imaging modality for the diagnosis of AC. EP-performed US has a similar diagnostic performance to radiologist-performed US. Further investigations would be needed to investigate the impact of US on expediting the management process and improving patient-centered outcomes.

### Percutaneous cholecystostomy: the radiologist's role in treating acute cholecystitis [^116UzkoP]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common condition, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy considered the gold-standard for surgical management. However, surgical options are often unfavourable in patients who are very unwell, or have numerous medical co-morbidities, in which the mortality rates are significant. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is an image-guided intervention, used to decompress the gallbladder, reducing patient's symptoms and the systemic inflammatory response. PC has been shown to be beneficial in high-risk patient groups, predominantly as a bridging therapy; allowing safer elective cholecystectomy once the patient has recovered from the acute illness; or, in the minority, as a definitive treatment in patients deemed unfit for surgery. This review aims to develop a broader understanding of PC, discussing its specific indications, patient management, technical factors, imaging guidance, and outcomes following the procedure.

### Improving diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with US: new paradigms [^112B6kfD]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is an inflammatory condition of the gallbladder typically incited by mechanical obstruction. Accurate diagnosis of this common clinical condition is challenging due to variable imaging appearances as well as overlapping clinical manifestations with biliary colic, acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangiopathies. In acute cholecystitis, increased dilatation and high intraluminal pressures lead to gallbladder inflammation and may progress to gangrenous changes, focal wall necrosis, and subsequent perforation. In acute calculous cholecystitis, gallstones are the cause of obstruction and are often impacted in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, leading to gallbladder inflammation. In acalculous cholecystitis, patients are typically critically ill, often with hypotensive episodes and prolonged gallbladder stasis, which lead to obstruction, gallbladder ischemia, and inflammation. Helpful sonographic findings of acute cholecystitis include a dilated gallbladder; increased intraluminal pressures in the gallbladder, resulting in a bulging fundus (tensile fundus sign); intraluminal sludge in the setting of right upper quadrant pain; wall hyperemia, which may be quantified by elevated cystic artery velocities or hepatic artery velocities; mucosal ischemic changes, characterized by loss of mucosal echogenicity; pericholecystic inflammation, characterized by hyperechoic pericholecystic fat; and mucosal discontinuity. Extruded complex fluid next to a wall defect is definitive for gallbladder wall perforation, and further evaluation with CT or MRI allows evaluation of the full extent of perforation and other potential complications. The sonographic Murphy sign, while helpful if positive, is relatively insensitive for accurate diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Thus, overreliance on the sonographic Murphy sign results in surprisingly low diagnostic accuracy in practice.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^114roKWZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, more specifically with respect to further imaging (elderly patients), SICG/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of CT is scarce and remain elusive

- diagnostic accuracy of MRI might be comparable to that of abdominal ultrasound in elderly patients, but no sufficient data are provided to support this hypothesis

- hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan has the highest sensitivity and specificity for acute cholecystitis compared to other imaging modalities although its scarce availability, long time of execution and exposure to ionizing radiations limit its use.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^1173xxnf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of these patients includes 2 dominant objectives: confirming the diagnosis and establishing its severity. Despite a wide array of options (US, HIDA, CT, MR), the revised Tokyo consensus guidelines represent the best parameters for directing diagnosis and treatment. Based on diagnostic sensitivities of 90% to 95%, abdominal US remains the initial modality of choice. Because it can be performed by the ACS within the emergency department itself, it is also cost saving and rapid. Identification of gallbladder wall thickening (> 5 mm), an obstructing gallstone in the gallbladder neck, pericholecystic fluid, US Murphy's sign and/or dilation and thickening of the common bile duct (CBD) are important signs that contribute to defining the diagnosis. Unfortunately CT imaging is far less specific and frequent in confirming this diagnosis. After confirmation however, the disease should be classified according its severity (grade I = mild, II = moderate, III = severe). While grade II refers to the presence of systemic signs of inflammation, grade III cholecystitis includes dysfunction of at least one organ/system (Table 1).

### Acute cholecystitis: a review [^116TBPPj]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gallbladder disease affects approximately 20 million people in the US. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200 000 people in the US each year.

Observations

Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1–3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.

### The accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound in the detection of gallbladder disease: a Meta-analysis [^111KkNv5]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically assess the diagnostic value of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) in the detection of gallbladder diseases.

Materials and Methods

Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies up to May 22, 2023. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, area under the curve of summary receiver operating characteristic were calculated using the bivariate model. Subgroup analysis based on cholecystitis and cholelithiasis was conducted.

Results

A total of seven studies with 1464 participants were identified in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of POCUS for the detection of gallbladder disease was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.93) and the pooled specificity was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.96). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of POCUS for the detection of acute cholecystitis were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.86) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.98). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of POCUS for the detection of gallstones were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.96) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.95).

Conclusion

POCUS was a favorable modality for the detection of patients suspected of gallbladder disease, especially for cholelithiasis. Physicians are advised to use POCUS in clinical practice as a non-invasive test to detect gallbladder disease.

### A pictorial review of gall stones and its associated complications [^116r8kjP]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Gallstone disease is the term commonly used to refer to gallstones that cause symptoms. There is a myriad of complications that can arise from gallstones: acute cholecystitis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, gallbladder wall perforations, pericholecystic abscesses, Mirizzi syndrome, cholecystoenteric fistulas, choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis, porcelain gallbladder, gallbladder malignancies, and many more. The aim of this pictorial review is to revisit how multimodality imaging can help with the diagnosis of gallstone disease. We review the classic imaging findings on different imaging modalities for gallstone disease and its associated complications and how it is useful in early diagnosis for timely management of complications as well as surgical planning.

### Non-traumatic abdominal emergencies: imaging and intervention in acute biliary conditions [^117CGm4Q]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging is the standard method for the evaluation of emergency bile ducts and gallbladder diseases. Imaging may help to treat the patient also. In acute cholecystitis, association of clinical and sonographic data is accurate for the diagnosis, even when the patient is examined by a junior radiologist. Computed tomography may be required for those patients with unusual presentation such as emphysematous cholecystitis, perforation, or abscess. Acalculous cholecystitis is a challenging problem. It sometimes requires percutaneous cholecystostomy for diagnosis or treatment purposes. In patients with acute cholangitis, sonography remains the first step for imaging, but its diagnostic accuracy is disappointing. This is related to low sensitivity, despite a high specificity. Computed tomography carries a slightly better sensitivity, and again a high specificity but overall accuracy is not sufficient. Magnetic resonance cholangiography and endosonography are the best methods for the detection. Both have advantages and limitations, including cost and availability, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography remains necessary for therapeutic purposes, especially stone extraction. In conclusion, emergency radiologists should be able to put the patient through multiple imaging modalities in order to make a prompt diagnosis with no delay, and be aware of the therapeutic options, including cooperation between radiologist, endoscopist, and surgeon.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (eg, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are of necessity related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^111tG48L]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic modalities

Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography is an effective and accurate imaging modality that can be used as the initial option to assess ischaemic cholecystitis. Sonography is a non-invasive modality and easily transportable diagnostic tool, and ultrasonographic evaluation of the gallbladder is accurate in determining gallbladder wall thickness. Its practicality is especially useful in the evaluation of patients in the ICU, for whom transport to a CT scanner may be challenging. Ultrasound findings that are predictive of ischaemic cholecystitis have been categorised into major and minor criteria (table 2). Diagnosis is typically made in the presence of two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria. There are some limitations to ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for ischaemic cholecystitis. Ultrasound technology is user dependent. Sonography might also be of limited diagnostic yield in patients with severe obesity. Additionally, ultrasound evaluation may be non-specific in the critical care setting because gallbladder abnormalities (eg, gallbladder sludge, gallbladder distention, wall thickening) have been frequently found in this patient population; even in patients who are not suspected of having ischaemic cholecystitis. Thus, for critically ill patients with clinical concern for potential ischaemic cholecystitis, ultrasound assessment is a good first test to perform. The results may unequivocally confirm your suspicion (ie, presence of intramural gas indicating gangrenous cholecystitis) and lead clinicians to discuss subsequent management strategies. For ambiguous ultrasound findings (eg, significantly distended gallbladder seen without other findings), additional diagnostic modalities may be required to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of ischaemic cholecystitis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right upper quadrant pain: 2022 update [^111s74rW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in hospital emergency departments, as well as outpatient settings. Although gallstone-related acute cholecystitis is a leading consideration in diagnosis, a myriad of extrabiliary sources including hepatic, pancreatic, gastroduodenal, and musculoskeletal should also be considered. This document focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging studies performed specifically to evaluate acute right upper quadrant pain, with biliary etiologies including acute cholecystitis and its complications being the most common. An additional consideration of extrabiliary sources such as acute pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, hepatitis, and painful liver neoplasms remain a diagnostic consideration in the right clinical setting. The use of radiographs, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI for these indications are discussed. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^117Xzhks]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

In 2018, the Scientific Board of the 6thWorld Congress of the WSES endorsed its president to organize a CC on ACC in order to update the previous WSES Guidelines. The WSES president appointed four members as a scientific secretariat, four members as an organization committee and four members as a scientific committee, choosing them from the expert affiliates of the WSES. Relevant key questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ACC were developed and divided into seven sections, in order to analyse the topic and update the guidelines with the currently available evidence. Under the supervision of the scientific secretariat, a bibliographic search related to these questions was performed, using electronic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases in May 2019, with no date or language restrictions. An additional manual search of the literature was performed by members of the working groups involved in the analysis of the papers and the development of the guidelines. The topics and sections, the key questions and the related key words used to develop the update on ACC are available in Table 1.

Table 1
Sections/topics, key questions and key words

Before the CC, the statements and recommendations were reviewed by the representatives responsible for each of the sections, creating a draft version of the guidelines. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (see). Specifically, the quality of evidence was graded as 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low' or 'Very low' and the strength of a recommendation was indicated as either 'Strong' or 'Weak'. Consensus had previously been defined as 70% or more of the votes being in agreement. During the 6th World Congress of the WSES held in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in May 2019, each question was discussed and voted upon by the audience (votes were either 'agree' or 'disagree'). The percentage of agreement was recorded immediately; in case of disagreement, the statement was modified following discussion. After the CC, the president and representatives reviewed the guidelines in response to the comments and the revised version of the statements was voted upon via an online questionnaire until consensus was reached. Throughout the period of the elaboration of the current guidelines, repeated literature searches were carried out in order to maximize the inclusion of relevant evidence (last literature search: May 2020).

### Gallstone disease: common questions and answers [^111iM6VH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 10% to 15% of adults are affected by gallstones, and cholesterol gallstones are the most prevalent subtype. Risk factors for developing gallstone disease include female sex; older age; certain medications; and having type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, rapid weight loss, or hemolytic anemia. Nearly 80% of gallstones are found incidentally and remain asymptomatic. When symptomatic, gallstone disease usually presents as sudden onset right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain. Common complications of gallstones include cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. The Murphy sign is a specific physical examination finding for acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging choice for detecting gallstones and acute cholecystitis. A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan can be used to evaluate for cholecystitis in patients with negative or equivocal ultrasound findings. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an accurate, noninvasive diagnostic test to identify choledocholithiasis, certain malignancies, and biliary obstruction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are safe and effective in treating pain from acute cholecystitis and biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for most patients with biliary colic or acute cholecystitis. Ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid should not routinely be used to treat gallstone disease, but they can be used as a nonsurgical alternative for certain patients. Postcholecystectomy syndrome is a potential postoperative complication that presents with abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):518–524.

### Diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: sensitivity of sonography, cholescintigraphy, and combined sonography-cholescintigraphy [^115GqhsN]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Radiographic diagnosis of acute cholecystitis can be established using ultrasonography (US), cholecystoscintigraphy (HIDA), or both. Although both modalities have been effective in diagnosing acute cholecystitis (AC), physicians from the emergency department and admitting surgeons continue to request both tests in an attempt to increase the diagnostic accuracy of AC. This article reports the institutional experience of a large tertiary care health care facility, with respect to the sensitivity of US, HIDA, and combined US and HIDA.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective review of 132 patients diagnosed with AC who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same hospitalization. Patients were stratified into three groups: Group 1 (Gp1, n = 50) included patients who underwent US alone, group 2 (Gp2, n = 28) included patients who underwent HIDA scan alone, and group 3 (Gp3, n = 54) included patients who underwent both US and HIDA.

Results

The three groups did not differ with respect to age, liver chemistry, time to operation, and hospital length of stay. The sensitivity of US, HIDA, and combined US/HIDA as diagnostic modalities for acute cholecystitis was referenced to histopathologic confirmation. Sensitivity was 24 of 50 (48%), 24 of 28 (86%), and 49 of 54 (90%) for US, HIDA, and the combination of US/HIDA, respectively.

Conclusions

HIDA scan is a more sensitive test than US in diagnosing patients with AC. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that HIDA scan should be used as the first diagnostic modality in patients with suspected acute cholecystitis; US should be used to confirm the presence of gallbladder stones rather than to diagnose AC.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^116FpnFm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Tokyo guidelines offer a systematic overview and revision of the pathophysiological, clinic and diagnostic approach to the biliary infections. Based on this exhaustive overview these guidelines give also specific therapeutic indications about operative and conservative management.

The diagnosis is the starting point of the treatment of any kind of pathology and of acute cholecystitis as well. Prompt and timely diagnosis should allow early treatment and lower morbidity and mortality. The Tokyo guidelines proposed a staging system based upon the evaluation of local signs of inflammation (Murphy's sign and RUQ mass/pain/tenderness), systemic signs (fever, elevated CRP with values of 3 mg/dl or more and abnormal WBC count) and imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis. Similar diagnostic criteria are reported from other recent studies.

As far as diagnosis and treatment of acute cholecystitis is concerned, the peculiarity of the Tokyo guidelines is the division of the disease in mild, moderate and severe. No previous study examined the optimal treatment of acute cholecystitis on the basis of an organ-related severity score index. In the Tokyo consensus meeting the need for surgical treatment according to the grade of severity was suggested and discussed. Subsequent studies analyzed the impact of the Tokyo guidelines on the management of patients with acute cholecystitis, stressing the attention on their impact on surgical outcomes. Even if the expert panel of that consensus made an extraordinary scientific work, no benefits have been demonstrated by applying those guidelines, except a decrease of mean length of hospital stay.

### Acute gallbladder pathologies beyond uncomplicated cholecystitis [^114Jzv3u]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The gallbladder can be affected by various acute conditions beyond uncomplicated cholecystitis, with the prevalence of gallstones having risen over the past three decades. Management of biliary diseases is complex and necessitates careful case-by-case consideration. Radiologic imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management planning of biliary pathologies. This review explores acute gallbladder conditions such as simple cholecystitis, gangrenous cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, hemorrhagic cholecystitis, perforated cholecystitis, gallbladder fistulas, gallstone ileus, Bouveret syndrome, Mirizzi syndrome, gallbladder herniation, volvulus, trauma, pseudoaneurysm, portal venous thrombosis, and gallbladder carcinoma. It highlights the utility of various imaging modalities including ultrasound, CT, dual-energy CT, MRI, and MRCP in diagnosing these conditions. Advancements in imaging techniques have enhanced the ability to detect and characterize gallbladder diseases, facilitating timely surgical interventions and improving patient outcomes. This review emphasizes the importance of close collaboration between radiologists and clinicians to optimize diagnosis and management strategies, underscoring the indispensable role of radiologic imaging in modern medicine.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^111Xh7Us]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results of the online survey

We received 51 completed responses, resulting in a response rate of 38%. 23% of the respondents are working at a university hospital (n = 12), 67% at a non-university hospital (n = 34), and 10% at medical care centers with reserved hospital beds (n = 5).

The questionnaire is presented in Fig. 1 and comprised demographic (Q3–Q11), diagnostic (Q5–Q17) and therapeutic data (Q18–Q24) (see also Additional file 1 for the questionnaire in whole). The majority of the surveyed institutions treat 0–5 patients/year (n = 31, 61%, see Q3). Diagnosis of cholelithiasis is rare in younger children and increases with progressing age (see Q6). An increase of diagnosis in obese children and adolescents over the past years was not noticeable in clinical practice in 49% of the institutions (n = 25, see Q10). Distribution of concomitant diagnoses of the online survey is presented in Fig. 2 a (Q9). Primary pediatric medical management of cholelithiasis could be confirmed by 36 respondents (71%, see Q4). Routine diagnostics in cases with epigastric pain included sonography in 100% (n = 47/47) and MRI in 23% (n = 11/47) according to the answer of survey's Q16, whereas CT was not included in routine diagnostics. Figure 2 b illustrates the most common options of conservative treatment of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis (see Q19). However, the conservative approach appears to be successful in a minority of cases (32 respondents (63%) answered that in 0–20% of cases a conservatory treatment was successful (see Q18)). In case of an acute cholecystitis, 22% of participants conduct a cholecystectomy within the first 24 h of symptoms (n = 11). Further two participants (4%) proposed a cholecystectomy within 48 h of symptoms in the free text. 57% of participants preferred an elective approach of surgery, irrespective of presence of a complicated cholelithiasis (n = 29). In the open question Q20 we asked for temporal limits for the surgical indication and individual standardized approaches. An explicit case-by-case-decision without a standardized approach was reported by 6 participants (12%). Further 6 participants (12%) specified a time slot of 6 months or no temporal limitation. Two participants (4%) recommended adherence to the adult guideline.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^112RkMn4]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging in gallstone-related disease

Multiple imaging modalities play a role in the diagnosis of the broad spectrum of gallstone-related disease including plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Ultrasound is by far the most common and useful imaging modality in assessing gallstones within the gallbladder (cholelithiasis) and associated gallbladder pathology and has the added benefit of no radiation dose to the patient. With ultrasound, gallstones are characteristically echogenic and demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing regardless of the gallstone composition (Fig. 1). As ultrasound is a bedside dynamic study, stone mobility can be demonstrated with patient manoeuvering, and this can help in differentiating gallstones from gallbladder polyps, which can mimic cholelithiasis sonographically.

Fig. 1
Sagittal ultrasound image of the gallbladder which demonstrates the typical appearance of a gallstone that is hyperechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing (arrow)

Another principle advantage of ultrasound over other imaging techniques in the investigation of acute cholecystitis is the ability to evaluate for a sonographic Murphy's sign, which can be a reliable indicator of acute cholecystitis with a high sensitivity. Sonographic Murphy's sign is where the patient reports maximal pain as the sonographer presses over the fundus of the distended gallbladder with the ultrasound probe (and differs to clinical Murphy's sign).

The major limitation of ultrasound in the imaging of gallstone-related disease is the frequent inability to assess the distal common bile duct (CBD) due to overlying bowel gas. Occasionally, a stone can be seen within the biliary system; however, often the presence of a CBD stone can be inferred from visualised proximal biliary dilatation and clinical presentation with painful jaundice or an obstructive pattern on liver function tests. This requires further work up with alternative imaging.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (< 10%), moderate risk (10 to 50%) and high risk (> 50%) of CBDS (see Table 2). This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

Table 2
Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010)

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.5 We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remains a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients have a probability of having CBDS exceeding 50%, which in turn means that up to 49% of patients undergoing ERCP will not have evidence of CBDS and, given the potential complications of ERCP, this may not be considered acceptable. For this reason, we would recommend more cautious approach: only patients with evidence of CBDS at abdominal US should be considered at high risk of CBDS and should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP directly; patients with total serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dl or enlarged common bile duct diameter at US with concomitant bilirubin level 1.8 to 4 mg/dl should be considered as moderate risk and should undergo second level investigation such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or IOC, in order to avoid the complications related to ERCP. See Table 2 for the modified risk stratification.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^1138hmYa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Which actions are warranted in patients with ACC and at moderate risk for CBDS?

2.6 We recommend that patients with moderate risk for CBDS undergo one of the following: preoperative magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), preoperative endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), or laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS), depending on local expertise and availability. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Two preoperative imaging techniques are available for the detection of CBDS, namely MRCP and EUS. These diagnostic tests, according to the ASGE guidelines should be reserved for patients with moderate risk for CBDS and have been shown to delay definitive ACC treatment. On the other hand, these tests could exclude the presence of CBDS with high diagnostic accuracy, thereby avoiding further inappropriate invasive procedures, such as ERCP or IOC and therefore their complications. In fact, the implementation of these techniques resulted in a reduction of ERCP by 30 to 75% in non-selected patients. A Cochrane meta-analysis compared these two different techniques: both had good diagnostic accuracy, showing summary sensitivities of 95% for EUS and 93% for MRCP and a summary specificity of 97% and 96%, respectively. As noted by some authors, considerations other than diagnostic efficacy, such as local availability, costs, expertise and delay of surgery, might play an important role in the decision making during the diagnostic work-up.

Which actions are warranted in patients with ACC and at high risk for CBDS?

2.7 We recommend that patients with high-risk for CBDS undergo preoperative ERCP, IOC or LUS, depending on the local expertise and the availability of the technique. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

ERCP has both a diagnostic and a therapeutic role in the management of CBDS, but it is an invasive procedure with potential severe complications. The literature underscores the risks of diagnostic ERCP. Morbidity associated with diagnostic ERCP includes pancreatitis, cholangitis, bleeding, duodenal perforation and allergic reaction to contrast medium. Complications occur in 1 to 2% and increase to 10% when associated with sphincterotomy. On the other hand, IOC significantly increases the length of surgery and requires dedicated staff in the operating room, while this may not be available, especially in the acute setting with unplanned surgery. Positive findings on IOC often lead to intraoperative management of CBDS with additional operative time.

### Hepatobiliary scintigraphy in acute cholecystitis [^112wGyai]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a mature imaging technique for evaluation of patients with acute cholecystitis (AC). It is effective in calculous and acalculous forms of AC. The test is used in contemporary medical practice as the arbiter when the findings from screening abdominal ultrasound do not fit a clinical picture. It is also performed in severely ill patients who have AC suspected on other testing, but whose frail condition and high operative risk demand the highest level of certainty. This review, therefore, examines all technique variations of hepatobiliary scintigraphy, offering an approach that may best fit a variety of clinical situations and philosophies on AC.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^111dW4BF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is a common presenting symptom in patients with acute cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, in most clinical scenarios, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound. Although cholescintigraphy has been shown to have slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, ultrasound is preferred as the initial study for a variety of reasons, including greater availability, shorter examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CT or MRI may be helpful in equivocal cases and may identify complications of acute cholecystitis. When ultrasound findings are inconclusive, MRI is the preferred imaging test in pregnant patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Abdominal ultrasound versus hepato-imino diacetic acid scan in diagnosing acute cholecystitis – what is the real benefit? [^112tGh4Y]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis is one of the most common surgical problems, yet substantial debate remains over the utility of simple examination, abdominal ultrasound (AUS), or advanced imaging such as hepato-imino diacetic acid (HIDA) scan to support the diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

The preoperative diagnostic workup of patients who underwent cholecystectomy with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis was reviewed to calculate the sensitivity of AUS, HIDA scan, or both. In addition, the sensitivity of the commonly described ultrasonographic findings was assessed.

Results

From 2010 through 2012, 406 patients among 9087 reviewed charts presented to the emergency department with acute upper abdominal pain and met inclusion criteria. 32.5% (N = 132) of patients underwent AUS only, 11.3% (N = 46) underwent HIDA scan only, and 56.2% (N = 228) had both studies performed for workup. 52.7% (N = 214) of patients had histopathologically confirmed acute cholecystitis. The sensitivities of AUS, HIDA, and AUS combined with HIDA for acute cholecystitis were 73.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 66.3%-79.5%), 91.7% (95% CI = 86.2%-95.5%), and 97.7% (95% CI = 93.4%-99.5%), respectively. Although of limited sensitivity, AUS findings of sonographic Murphy sign, gallbladder distension, and gallbladder wall thickening were associated with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

Conclusions

The sensitivity of AUS for diagnosing acute cholecystitis in patients with acute upper abdominal pain is limited. The addition of a HIDA scan in the diagnostic workup significantly improves sensitivity and can add valuable information in the appropriate clinical setting.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UGLBJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic performance of US for AC. Forty studies with a total of 8,652 patients were included. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest meta-analysis currently, providing updated evidence.

Our results revealed US had a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 85%, and an accuracy of 0.83, indicative of good discriminability. Also, the sensitivity and specificity were similar among those performed by EPs, surgeons, and radiologists. Further, the presence of gallstones had a higher sensitivity for AC. However, most of the studies used combinations of sonographic findings for the diagnosis of AC.

Clinical symptoms and signs of AC had varying sensitivity and specificity. The Tokyo guidelines suggest using imaging studies such as US, CT, and HIDA scans for the diagnosis of AC, in conjunction with detailed history, complete clinical examination, and laboratory tests. Although HIDA has excellent diagnostic performance for AC with a sensitivity and specificity above 90%, its utilization is limited in emergency practice due to the required resources, time, and exposure to radioactive isotopes. By contrast, US is a valuable tool for its non-ionizing, low-cost, and easy-to-use characteristics. US is considered the first-line imaging modality in recently published guidelines for the diagnosis of AC. Our review provides the evidence that US is a good diagnostic tool with discriminative power.

The American College of Emergency Physicians states that US is an essential skill in emergency practice, and GB-US is included in 12 core applications. It also indicates that 25 sonographic examinations of GB should be performed as a minimum requirement for training and accreditation. In recent years, US has broadly used and increased integration into emergency practice. There were also a rising number of studies regarding the EP-performed US.

In our review, the diagnostic performance was similar between EPs and radiologists. Half of the 14 studies that EPs performed US reported the training background; however, the level of training could range from novices (the first-year residents) to attendings. Summers et al. reported an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0 (95% CI, 0–0.13), suggestive of similar performance at different levels. Although the inter-rater reliability was not thoroughly evaluated in the majority of the studies regarding the EP-performed US, EPs could achieve proficiency using US as a part of physical examination for the assessment of GB diseases.

### Test characteristics of emergency medicine-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113t6CC8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute cholecystitis accounts for up to 9% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain, and best practice entails early surgical management. Ultrasound is the standard modality used to confirm diagnosis. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis when compared with a reference standard of final diagnosis (informed by available surgical pathology, discharge diagnosis, and radiology-performed ultrasound). We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO, in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched 7 databases as well as gray literature in the form of select conference abstracts from inception to February 8, 2023. Two independent reviewers completed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias (QUADAS-2) assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies to create 2 × 2 tables for diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis. Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic models were constructed. Of 1855 titles/abstracts, 40 were selected for full-text review. Ten studies (n = 2356) were included. Emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound with final diagnosis as the reference standard (7 studies, n = 1,772) had a pooled sensitivity of 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.3 to 78.2), specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 88.2 to 97.5), positive likelihood ratio of 12.7 (5.8 to 27.5), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.31 (0.23 to 0.41) for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound has high specificity and moderate sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients with clinical suspicion. This review supports the use of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound to rule in a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in the emergency department, which may help expedite definitive management.

### Hepatobiliary ultrasound [^1173Kvyj]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The use of ultrasound technology in the emergency department(ED) is a recent and fast-growing phenomenon. Ultrasound is an extremely valuable tool for the evaluation of gallbladder (GB) dis-ease in the ED for several reasons: this disease is a common medical problem, cholecystitis can present in different ways clinically, the nature of the GB allows it to be well visualized by ultrasound, and ultrasound has many benefits and few complications associated with its use.

### CT findings of acute cholecystitis and its complications [^1128w56H]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe and illustrate the CT findings of acute cholecystitis and its complications.

Conclusion

CT findings suggesting acute cholecystitis should be interpreted with caution and should probably serve as justification for further investigation with abdominal ultrasound. CT has a relatively high negative predictive value, and acute cholecystitis is unlikely in the setting of a negative CT. Complications of acute cholecystitis have a characteristic CT appearance and include necrosis, perforation, abscess formation, intraluminal hemorrhage, and wall emphysema.

### Evaluation of the CT scan as the first examination for the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy for acute cholecystitis [^114bYB6B]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The CT scan has supplanted the abdominal ultrasound for emergency examinations. A comparison of CT scan and ultrasound performance for the diagnosis and management of acute cholecystitis in acute care was proposed. The hypothesis is that the CT scan may be sufficient for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, which would allow faster progress to surgery.

Methods

The retrospective study of consecutive patients operated for acute cholecystitis or gallbladder distension with pre-operative imaging within 48 h in one centre.

Results

Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 341 cholecystectomies were performed in our centre. The analysis involved 120 patients. Ultrasound had better sensitivity than the CT scan, respectively, 79.4% [70.5–86.6] and 52.3% [42.5–62.1], but less specificity, with 61.5% [31.6–86.1] and 92.3% [64.0–99.8], respectively. However, there was a significant difference in favour of the CT scan for the diagnosis of complicated cholecystitis (p 0.004). The positive likelihood ratio of complicated cholecystitis is better at CT scan (7.8) [2.7–23.1] than in ultrasound (1.0) [0.1–9.7]. CT scan and ultrasound are equivalent for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, but CT scan is more efficient for the diagnosis of complicated cases (Youden index J 0.3 vs 0.001).

Conclusion

It is possible to place the surgical indication of cholecystectomy on the only data of the CT scan. We propose a decision-making algorithm that uses the CT scan to make the diagnosis and decide on emergency treatment for complicated cases or that allows us to propose a delayed surgery for simple cholecystitis.

Acute cholecystitis — third-line imaging when both ultrasound and CT are inconclusive in non-pregnant adults is described as follows: In non-pregnant adults with suspected acute cholecystitis, if both US and CT are equivocal/non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, the panel suggests obtaining either an abdominal MRI/MRCP or HIDA scan as subsequent imaging to diagnose acute cholecystitis (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence for HIDA, knowledge gap for MRI/MRCP). If both abdominal US and CT are inconclusive but acute cholangitis is suspected, MRI/MRCP is a reasonable option.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116FEJZw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Published data from eight cross-sectional studies confirmed the heterogeneity of diagnostic values, diagnostic index and standard reference for the final diagnosis of ACC. Traditional US presented wide ranges of sensitivity (from 26 to 100%), specificity (from 62 to 88.1%), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV 35% to 93.7% and 52% to 97.1%, respectively), as well as positive LR (1.29 to 4.7) and negative LR (0.16 to 0.93). Global accuracy has been reported in two studies and varied from 70.1 to 79%.

In one study, the absence of gallstones was used to rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients presenting to the emergency department for suspected cholecystitis. Overall, the sensitivity of the simplified definition of a positive ultrasonography test was100%, as compared to the standard definition, i.e. the presence of gallstones and at least one of the ultrasonography signs of acute cholecystitis, which showed a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 66–97%) and specificity of 82 (95% CI 74–88%); prevalence was less than 15%, NPV was 97% (95% CI 93–-99%) and PPV was low at 44% (95% CI 29–59%).

### Does this patient have acute cholecystitis? [^111pmgwj]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although few patients with acute abdominal pain will prove to have cholecystitis, ruling in or ruling out acute cholecystitis consumes substantial diagnostic resources.

Objective

To determine if aspects of the history and physical examination or basic laboratory testing clearly identify patients who require diagnostic imaging tests to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

Data Sources

Electronic search of the Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, and English-language articles from January 1966 through November 2000 indexed in MEDLINE. We also hand-searched Index Medicus for 1950–1965, and scanned references in identified articles and bibliographies of prominent textbooks of physical examination, surgery, and gastroenterology. To identify relevant articles appearing since the comprehensive search, we repeated the MEDLINE search in July 2002.

Study Selection

Included studies evaluated the role of the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests in adults with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Studies had to report data from a control group found not to have acute cholecystitis. Acceptable definitions of cholecystitis included surgery, pathologic examination, hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan or right upper quadrant ultrasound, or clinical course consistent with acute cholecystitis and no evidence for an alternate diagnosis. Studies of acalculous cholecystitis were included. Seventeen of 195 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the 17 included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

No clinical or laboratory finding had a sufficiently high positive likelihood ratio (LR) or low negative LR to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Possible exceptions were the Murphy sign (positive LR, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–1.1), though the 95% CIs for both included 1.0. Available data on diagnostic confirmation rates at laparotomy and test characteristics of relevant radiological investigations suggest that the diagnostic impression of acute cholecystitis has a positive LR of 25 to 30. Unfortunately, the available literature does not identify the specific combinations of clinical and laboratory findings that presumably account for this diagnostic success.

Conclusions

No single clinical finding or laboratory test carries sufficient weight to establish or exclude cholecystitis without further testing (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound). Combinations of certain symptoms, signs, and laboratory results likely have more useful LRs, and presumably inform the diagnostic impressions of experienced clinicians. Pending further research characterizing the pretest probabilities associated with different clinical presentations, the evaluation of patients with abdominal pain suggestive of cholecystitis will continue to rely heavily on the clinical gestalt and diagnostic imaging.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KcWfB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is one of the most common diseases in emergency departments (EDs), occurring in 3–10% of patients with acute abdominal pain. It generally results from cystic duct obstruction by a gallstone, followed by inflammation of the gallbladder (GB).

Diagnostic imaging modalities for AC include ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), or hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan. A 2012 meta-analysis reported that the HIDA scan had the highest diagnostic accuracy for AC. However, US has non-radiating, easily accessible, and inexpensive characteristics, becoming the first-line diagnostic tool in emergency settings. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of publications regarding the use of US for the diagnosis of AC. Up-to-date evidence is still lacking. Further, US is performed by radiologists traditionally. It is unclear whether the diagnostic performance differs when performed by other sonographers such as emergency physicians (EPs) or surgeons.

Hence, we aim to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic performance of US for AC.

### Complications of cholecystitis: a comprehensive contemporary imaging review [^112DGKFw]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common cause of right upper quadrant pain in patients presenting to the emergency department. Ultrasound, computed tomography, HIDA scans, and magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly utilized to evaluate suspected cases. The prognosis of acute cholecystitis is usually excellent with timely diagnosis and management. However, complications associated with cholecystitis pose a considerable challenge to the clinician and radiologist. Complications of acute cholecystitis may result from secondary bacterial infection or mural ischemia secondary to increased intramural pressure. The recognized subtypes of complicated cholecystitis are hemorrhagic, gangrenous, and emphysematous cholecystitis, as well as gallbladder perforation. Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a form of cholecystitis that occurs as a complication of severe illness in the absence of gallstones or without gallstone-related inflammation. Complicated cholecystitis may cause significant morbidity and mortality, and early diagnosis and recognition play a pivotal role in the management and early surgical planning. As appropriate utilization of imaging resources plays an essential role in diagnosis and management, the emergency radiologist should be aware of the spectrum of complications related to cholecystitis and the characteristic imaging features. This article aims to offer a comprehensive contemporary review of clinical and cross-sectional imaging findings of complications associated with cholecystitis. In conclusion, cross-sectional imaging is pivotal in identifying the complications related to cholecystitis. Preoperative detection of this complicated cholecystitis can help the care providers and operating surgeon to be prepared for a potentially more complicated procedure and course of recovery.

### Evaluating patients with right upper quadrant pain [^117DxLpY]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

### Ultrasound and CT evaluation of emergent gallbladder pathology [^114JcZCu]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of suspected acute gallbladder disorders, and is often sufficient for correct diagnosis. CT also plays a vital role, however, in the evaluation of acute gallbladder pathology. CT is particularly useful in situations where ultrasound findings are equivocal. CT is also extremely valuable in the assessment of suspected complications of acute cholecystitis, particularly emphysematous cholecystitis, hemorrhagic cholecystitis, and gallbladder perforation, which are often very difficult diagnoses to establish at sonography. If CT is the initial imaging test performed in a patient with abdominal pain of uncertain etiology, recognition of the various disorders described in this article may eliminate the need for further imaging and facilitate appropriate management.

### Clinical presentation, imaging, and management of acute cholecystitis [^114jQc8c]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a life-threatening emergency that commonly occurs as a complication of gallstones. Severe right upper quadrant pain, abdominal guarding, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign with an elevated white blood cell count are the classical clinical manifestations of AC. Although ultrasonography is typically the initial diagnostic examination in patients with suspected AC, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are commonly performed to identify complications; cholescintigraphy is recommended in patients with equivocal findings on the other imaging modalities, as this technique has the highest diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of AC. Imaging studies are also helpful in the timely detection of complications associated with AC. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the gold-standard treatment for AC, percutaneous gallbladder drainage with or without cholecystostomy tube placement is a safe, effective management technique for surgically high-risk patients with multiple medical conditions. This treatment can be used as either a bridging therapy, with elective cholecystectomy performed at a later time after improvement of the patient's condition, or as definitive treatment in surgically unfit patients. Radiologists play a pivotal role in the initial diagnosis and management of patients with AC.

### Does the tokyo guidelines predict the extent of gallbladder inflammation in patients with acute cholecystitis? A single center retrospective analysis [^115oHqrM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is frequently encountered in daily clinical practice. Since its publication in 2007 and the update in 2013, the Tokyo guidelines (TG 13 guidelines) for the diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis and acute cholecystitis rapidly gained popularity. These guidelines use clinical symptoms, findings from physical examination, blood test and imaging modalities to diagnose AC. Besides defining diagnostic criteria, the Tokyo guidelines also enable a classification of acute cholecystitis in three severity grades. Grade I describes a mild form of inflammation, grade II describes a moderate gallbladder inflammation, while grade III corresponds to severe gallbladder inflammation in association with organ failure.

Since the TG 13 grading system was developed to differentiate severity grades of inflammation, severe inflammation would be expected in grade II and III. Uncomplicated acute cholecystitis would therefore be expected in grade I, while complicated cholecystitis (gangrenous, necrotizing or empysematous AC) would be expected in grades II and III. Besides their diagnostic and severity grading properties, the TG 13 guidelines provide a severity dependent treatment algorithm for AC. Patients with grade I are generally candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Patients with grade II could either undergo LC in centers with laparoscopic expertise or be managed via percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC). Patients presenting with grade III are generally managed with PC.

In our department, as well as in many other centers in Germany, PC is rarely performed. Acute cholecystitis is generally managed via LC. Critically ill patients and those considered "not fit for anesthesia" are generally medically managed. After seeing a number of cases of extensive gallbladder inflammation in patients presenting with preoperative grade I cholecystitis, we questioned the accuracy of the TG 13 guideline in predicting the extent of gallbladder inflammation in patients with AC. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate whether or not the preoperative disease severity grade per TG 13 correlates with the extent of gallbladder inflammation on histopathology.

Heterogeneity of patients affected by acute cholecystitis, and their co-morbidities make very difficult to standardize the therapy for this very common condition. The staging system suggested in the recent "Tokyo guidelines", did not show a relevant impact on the management of patients and on the outcome of the disease. The relation among local pathological picture, patient clinical status and treatment algorithm, has to be better studied.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 per cent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Imaging of gallstones and complications [^114D1RKd]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gallbladder pathologies caused by gallstones are commonly encountered in clinical practice, making accurate diagnosis critical for effective patient management. Radiologists play a key role in differentiating these conditions through imaging interpretation, ensuring that appropriate treatment is initiated. The imaging features of gallstone associated diseases are classified into various categories, such as inflammatory conditions, benign lesions, malignant tumors, and associated complications. A comprehensive understanding of these categories and their radiologic manifestations is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of gallbladder pathology. By integrating clinical knowledge with radiologic findings, clinicians and radiologists will be equipped with practical tools to identify and distinguish between different gallstone causing conditions.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^113R8ekX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The management of acute calculous cholecystitis still offers room for debate in terms of diagnosis, severity scores, treatment options and timing for surgery.

Material and Methods

A systematic review about the treatment of acute cholecystitis has been completed. The recommendations of recent guidelines have also been examined taking into account the results of the review.

Results

The evidence available in the literature supports the recommendation about laparoscopic cholecystectomy as treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible after the diagnosis because early treatment reduces total hospital stay and does not increase complication or conversion rates. The antibiotics can play different roles and attention should be posed to the risk of emerging resistance. A surgical or percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is advocated by some authors in the advanced forms of inflammation or patients with severe co-morbidities; however, the available evidence does not support it, and further studies are necessary to clarify its role.

### Computed tomography versus ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114oNFVh]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Some patients undergo both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) sequentially as part of the same evaluation for acute cholecystitis (AC). Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic performance of US and CT in the diagnosis of AC.

Materials and Methods

Databases were searched for relevant published studies through November 2023. The primary objective was to compare the head-to-head performance of US and CT using surgical intervention or clinical follow-up as the reference standard. For the secondary analysis, all individual US and CT studies were analyzed. The pooled sensitivities, specificities, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were determined along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The prevalence of imaging findings was also evaluated.

Results

Sixty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. In the primary analysis of head-to-head studies (n = 5), CT had a pooled sensitivity of 83.9% (95% CI, 78.4–88.2%) versus 79.0% (95% CI, 68.8–86.6%) of US (p = 0.44). The pooled specificity of CT was 94% (95% CI, 82.0–98.0%) versus 93.6% (95% CI, 79.4–98.2%) of US (p = 0.85). The concordance of positive or negative test between both modalities was 82.3% (95% CI, 72.1–89.4%). US and CT led to a positive change in management in only 4 to 8% of cases, respectively, when ordered sequentially after the other test.

Conclusion

The diagnostic performance of CT is comparable to US for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, with a high rate of concordance between the two modalities.

Clinical Relevance Statement

A subsequent US after a positive or negative CT for suspected acute cholecystitis may be unnecessary in most cases.

Key Points

When there is clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis, patients will often undergo both CT and US. CT has similar sensitivity and specificity compared to US for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The concordance rate between CT and US for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is 82.3%.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^112dwFt8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

1.4 We suggest the use of further imaging for the diagnosis of ACC in selected patients, depending on local expertise and availability. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan has the highest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ACC as compared to other imaging modalities. Diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) is poor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is as accurate as abdominal US. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Comment: in clinical practice, HIDA scan utilisation is limited due to the required resources and time.

No study with a high level of evidence was published on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES guidelines.

A cross-sectional study evaluated the incremental benefits of cystic duct enhancement detected by CT for the diagnosis of cholecystitis in patients without visibly impacted gallstones. When considering cystic duct enhancement, the accuracy and sensitivity of the diagnosis increased significantly, while no significant difference was reported for specificity. Interestingly, diagnostic accuracy increased for the less experienced radiologist, from 75.4 to 87.3% (p = 0.015). However, this case control study has some methodological flaws limiting its quality.

A study considering only patients with a definitive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis compared the diagnostic sensitivities of US, CT and HIDA scan. The results confirmed the higher sensitivity of HIDA over US and CT with respective values of 84.2%, 67.3% and 59.8% (p = 0.017). No difference was found when comparing CT and US (p = 0.09).

A study comparing sensitivity of CT and US showed different results, reporting higher sensitivity of CT, compared with US(92% vs. 79%, p = 0.015). In this study, a retrospective cohort of patients was added based on prospectively collected data from patients with a diagnosis of ACC confirmed by pathology or intra-operative findings. Indication for CT and timing between index and reference standards were not reported.

One study on a time-saving HIDA scan technique reported a high inter-rate agreement (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.92) between the novel time-saving technique and the conventional examination. Two other studies reported diagnostic values of HIDA scan as 86.7–89.3% for sensitivity and 66.8–79% for specificity.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis (with videos) [^111Dzo9D]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" for acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and classification of this condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious gallbladder inflammation, and to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis are composed of local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs of inflammation include Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs of inflammation encompass fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

The diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis is established if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation. Suspected acute cholecystitis is diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not. If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established.

These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding in the early identification and appropriate management of patients with this condition.

The diagnostic system for acute cholecystitis evaluates three categories of clinical signs: local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Each category has specific options that, when selected, contribute to determining the likelihood of acute cholecystitis.

Here's how inputs are processed:

- Local signs of inflammation:

- Murphy's sign
- Right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness

- Systemic signs of inflammation:

- Fever
- Elevated C-reactive protein
- Elevated white blood cell count

- Imaging findings:

- Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis

The diagnosis hinges on whether certain combinations of these indicators are present. The computation works as follows:

1. **If imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis (F) are confirmed, along with any local sign of inflammation (Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count), the patient meets the criteria for definite acute cholecystitis.**

2. **If any local sign of inflammation is observed along with any systemic sign and the imaging findings, this reinforces the suspected acute cholecystitis diagnosis. However, since this computation is logically identical to the criteria for definite acute cholecystitis, the system confirms the diagnosis right away.**

3. **If the conditions for definite or suspected acute cholecystitis are not fully met with the provided inputs, the system concludes that the criteria for acute cholecystitis are not satisfied.**

The system functions by evaluating the logical presence of these signs and symptoms, ensuring the assessment is grounded in established medical criteria. This method allows healthcare providers to systematically determine the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic actions.

### Hemorrhagic cholecystitis: ultrasound and CT imaging findings-a retrospective case review series [^114fNbFy]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Gallbladder pathology is diverse, and imaging tests are essential tools for its diagnosis. Acute cholecystitis has multiple manifestations or complications, one of which is hemorrhagic cholecystitis (HC). In the current literature, this pathology has been described only in the spectrum of acute cholecystitis complications, case reports, or series with a maximum of 2 to 3 cases. After a retrospective review, we present 11 cases of hemorrhagic cholecystitis and discuss its various causes, clinical presentations, and findings on ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT), considering dual-energy CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods

A retrospective review of 6 years (2012–2018) of hemorrhagic cholecystitis cases diagnosed at our hospital was performed. A search engine of medical terms was used and the database of radiological cases in the emergency department of the hospital. After a careful review by two emergency and one abdominal radiologists, 11 patients were identified as hemorrhagic cholecystitis cases according to their clinical, radiological, and surgical records and confirmed with pathology reports.

Results

Both lithiasis and anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy were the most common etiologies found (9 patients, 82%). The clinical presentation may be misleading, simulating a usual cholecystitis episode with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, or manifesting with signs of bile duct obstruction, hematemesis, or anemia that may compromise the patient hemodynamically and become fatal. US is useful, but CT is the most complete test for evaluating hemorrhagic cholecystitis and was performed in all the patients. The common findings were inflammatory changes in all patients (100%), hemobilia in 10 patients (91%), hemoperitoneum in 6 patients (55%), intestinal bleeding in 3 patients (27%), and occasionally perihepatic hematomas or signs of active bleeding.

Conclusion

Although a rare entity, hemorrhagic cholecystitis may be present, and management can be delayed if the appropriate imaging modality is not used for diagnosis.

### Gallbladder imaging interpretation pearls and pitfalls: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging [^114NNQvx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The gallbladder is a source of common disease processes with a wide variety of presentations. Common pathologies include acute or chronic cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, cancer, polyps, and postoperative complications. Accurate imaging assessment of the gallbladder can be very challenging and fraught with potential pitfalls. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. CT is often used as part of a broader evaluation of patient's abdominal pain if nongallbladder pathologies are also suspected. MRI/MRCP is typically reserved for problem-solving and evaluating patients who present with cholestatic presentation. We discuss common pitfalls, diagnostic challenges, and problem-solving approaches to the imaging evaluation of common gallbladder patho logies.

The article by Eskelinen et al. evaluated more than 1300 patients and revealed a good diagnostic yield with a combination of findings from history, physical examination and laboratory tests, reporting a positive LR of 25.7 and a negative LR of 0.24.

The TG criteria for the diagnosis of cholecystitis include clinical signs, laboratory tests and imaging features. After the publication of the paper by Yokoe et al. in 2012 reporting 91.2% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity, three studies reporting the validation of the TG diagnostic criteria were found. Although published in 2017, one study focused on the TG07 rather than the more recent TG13. A cross-sectional study evaluated the validity of fever, inflammatory markers and US findings as a validation of the TG13 criteria. At multivariate analysis, only neutrophil count was statistically associated with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (p < 0.0001), with a 70% sensitivity and 65.8% specificity. Overall, accuracy of the TG13 criteria was low at 60.3%. The TG13 correctly predicted 83.1% of all confirmed ACC, but over-diagnosed ACC in 62.5% of normal gallbladders. More than half of eligible patients did not undergo US and were excluded from the study; this represents a major source of potential selection bias. A cross-sectional study on the possible limitations of the TG 13 has reported a 53.4% sensitivity in diagnosing acute cholecystitis. However, some uncertainty regarding the sample population and the lack of detail in sensitivity calculation indicates that the data should be interpreted with caution. The revision of the TG criteria performed in 2018 did not include a clinical evaluation of the diagnostic criteria. Considering the heterogeneity of these findings, the reliability of the TG13 criteria for the diagnosis of ACC appears to be limited.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^115R5c8a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Which initial imaging technique should be used in case of a suspected diagnosis of ACC?

1.3 We recommend the use of abdominal ultrasound (US) as the preferred initial imaging technique, in view of its cost-effectiveness, wide availability, reduced invasiveness and good accuracy for gallstones disease. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Comment: abdominal US is a reliable investigation method; however, it may be of limited utility to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of ACC according to the adopted US criteria.

Neither meta-analysis nor studies with adequate quality of evidence have been published on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES guidelines.

In 2012, Kiewet et al. published a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic performance of different imaging techniques in ACC; abdominal ultrasound was not as accurate as it is for the diagnosis of gallstones. The meta-analysis was based on the results of 26 studies including a total of 2847 patients. The sensitivity in individual studies ranged from 50 to 100% and specificity from 33 to 100%. Summary sensitivity and specificity were 81% (95% CI 75 to 87%) and 83% (95% CI 74 to 89%), respectively. However, strong heterogeneity in the diagnostic performance of abdominal US was reported: the inconsistency index was 80% for sensitivity and 89% for specificity. Notwithstanding these limitations, the widespread availability, lack of invasiveness, lack of exposure to ionizing radiation and the reduced costs make abdominal US the preferred initial imaging technique in suspected ACC.

A recent meta-analysis reported the diagnostic accuracy of serum bilirubin and serum ALP at two cut-off values for each test. Serum bilirubin at a cut-off of 22.23 μmol/L had a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Bilirubin at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit, had a sensitivity of 0.42 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.63) and a specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). For ALP at a cut-off of greater than 125 IU/L, sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99) and specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). For ALP at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit, sensitivity was 0.38 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.59) and specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99).

Which imaging features are predictive of CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.2 We suggest considering the visualization of a stone in the common bile duct at transabdominal US as a predictor of CBDS in patients with ACC. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

2.3 An increased diameter of common bile duct, an indirect sign of stone presence, is not sufficient to identify ACC patients with CBDS and we therefore recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Abdominal US is the preferred imaging technique for the diagnosis of ACC; the common bile duct can be visualized and investigated at the same time. A meta-analysis by Gurusamy et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of US: sensitivity ranged from 0.32 to 1.00 with a summary sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90), while specificity ranged from 0.77 to 0.97 with a summary specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.95).

### Nuclear medicine tests for acute gastrointestinal conditions [^111Gdrkd]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) and lower-gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are 2 emergencies commonly encountered in nuclear medicine. Evidence of AC on hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) allows for confident diagnosis and provides support for definitive surgical treatment. Proper patient preparation is essential for HBS including fasting and the use of pharmacologic adjuncts is sometimes required. Pharmacologic adjuncts may also be administered during HBS to shorten the length of the examination and increase its specificity. In the interpretation of HBS, there are several sources of false-positive results to be aware of, most commonly chronic cholecystitis. False-negative results on HBS are usually the result of mistaking another structure, such as a dilated cystic duct, for the gallbladder. Abdominal ultrasound is the appropriate initial test in patients with suspected AC, but HBS is an excellent second tier test for the diagnosis of AC in the work-up of indeterminate cases by sonography. GI bleeding scintigraphy plays an important role in the evaluation and management of patients with acute lower-GI bleeding. Scintigraphy serves to localize sites of active GI bleeding and stratify those patients who would benefit from aggressive treatment (surgery or arteriography) vs those who can be managed medically. Pretest involvement of respective services is critical for successful bleeding site confirmation and therapy by interventional radiology or surgery or both. Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography erythrocyte scintigraphy has demonstrated superior accuracy and precision over planar scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute GI bleeding. Additionally, single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography scintigraphy of GI bleeding provides useful supplemental anatomical information that benefits patient management.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^114vZtkF]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholecystitis broadly describes inflammation of the gallbladder tissue and cystic duct. Most frequently this inflammation occurs from an obstructive process involving the cystic duct; this could be secondary to cholelithiasis or external compression. Cholecystitis may also result when inflammation of the gallbladder occurs in the absence of gallstones or another form of external compression, and instead emanates from a systemic process. Specifically, we propose to refer to this non-obstructive cause of cholecystitis as 'ischaemic cholecystitis', with emphasis on the unique clinical setting, diagnosis, management and prognosis for this patient population.

Obstructive cholecystitis

Traditionally, the distinction between the various forms of cholecystitis is primarily based on diagnostic imaging identifying gallstones (or external compression in rare circumstances). However, the absence of gallstones on diagnostic imaging does not equate to a diagnosis of non-obstructive cholecystitis for all circumstances. The rate of false-negative sonographic findings when assessing for gallstones is approximately 1%–4%. For instance, small gallstones (< 4 mm) or gallstones in the presence of bile sludge or polyps were described in the setting of false-negative sonographic findings. Moreover, for select cases of gas-containing gallstones, the only evidence of their existence on diagnostic imaging is the visible pocket of air making diagnosis challenging. For our institutional practice, we have had approximately 2% of patients present with a classical clinical history consistent with acute obstructive cholecystitis and negative sonographic evidence of gallstones. Despite this initial clinical presentation, gallstones were identified in the operating room or on final pathological examination. Thus, to accurately define non-obstructive or acalculous cholecystitis, a pathological diagnosis excluding gallstones is optimal. Furthermore, clinical history consistent with biliary colic cannot be overlooked in the setting of negative diagnostic imaging.

Non-obstructive cholecystitis

Non-obstructive cholecystitis is an uncommon cause of cholecystitis and accounts for < 10% of all diagnoses of cholecystitis in adults. In contrast to the diagnosis of obstructive cholecystitis, which is commonly reliant on patient history and imaging findings, the diagnosis of non-obstructive cholecystitis is dependent on the clinical setting (table 1).

Objective

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the clinical and cross-sectional imaging features of a variety of acute and chronic gallbladder inflammatory diseases.

Conclusion

Inflammatory gallbladder diseases are a common source of abdominal pain and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Although acute uncomplicated cholecystitis and chronic cholecystitis are frequently encountered, numerous other gallbladder inflammatory conditions may also occur that can be readily diagnosed by cross-sectional imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although right upper quadrant pain is a very common clinical presentation, it can be nonspecific. However, acute cholecystitis is very often the diagnosis of exclusion. This review focuses on the recommended imaging evaluation in the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^114hEGBB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Editorial

As universally known, acute cholecystitis is a frequent complication of cholelithiasis. It is a very common problem and general surgeons have to face it daily. The absolute heterogeneity of patients, co-morbidities and environment in which this disease presents, make the diagnosis, and the subsequent therapeutic procedures, very difficult to standardize. The full complement of the signs and symptoms historically described as the "Charcot's triad" or the "Reynolds' pentad" are infrequent and, as such, do not really assist the clinician with planning management strategies. Few different consensus conference and severity score grading systems have been published from expert panels in recent years with consequent comments and criticisms. Recently an International Consensus meeting held in Tokyo established evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis, severity assessment and treatment of acute cholecystitis (Tokyo guidelines). The Tokyo guidelines is a fine methodologically and scientifically correct study which defines the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the acute biliary infections. Although many different diagnostic and treatment methodologies have been developed in recent years, none of them have been assessed scientifically to become a standard method in the management of acute biliary infections and, more specifically, acute cholecystitis. The Tokyo extraordinary expert panel, by a meticulous review of English-language literature, demonstrated that a structured diagnostic and severity scoring system for acute biliary infections is not available, and consequently tried to overcome this scientific gap.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116t36PH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic performance of US

Across all 40 studies, a total of 8652 patients were included, with an average age of 45.9 years and a male gender composition of 34%. Detailed information about the included studies can be found in Table 1. The overall sensitivity was 71% (95% CI, 69–72%), while the specificity was 85% (95% CI, 84–86%) (Table 2, Fig. 3). The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 4.80 (95% CI, 3.33–6.78), and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.25–0.41). The accuracy was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82–0.83), demonstrating good diagnostic performance. Heterogeneity among the studies was high (I 2 = 89.7%; 95% CI, 87–92%), which could be due to varying patient enrollment criteria and the presence of potential confounders due to non-randomized assignment in the included studies. No significant publication bias was detected through Deek's test (p value = 0.39).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, more specifically with respect to further imaging, general population, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining further imaging for the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis in selected patients, depending on local expertise and availability, recognizing that:

- hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan has the highest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis

- diagnostic accuracy of CT is poor

- MRI has the same accuracy as abdominal ultrasound.

### Acute cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, and biliary leakage [^115XGtJD]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The use of cholescintigraphy to diagnose acute cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, and biliary leakage dates back to the late 1970s. Today, despite the many advances in imaging instrumentation, radiopharmaceuticals, and methodology over these years, cholescintigraphy still plays an important role in confirming or excluding these diagnoses in acutely ill patients. Acute calculous and acalculous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, biliary obstruction, and biliary leakage often present as acute abdominal pain, and must be differentiated from other surgical and nonsurgical etiologies with similar symptoms and presentation. Understanding the pathophysiology of acute hepatobiliary diseases is vital for deciding on the most advantageous imaging work-up and for interpretation of the studies. To optimize the value of cholescintigraphy, up-to-date methology, proper use of appropriate pharmacologic interventions, and recognition of characteristic image findings are critical.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis or cholangitis — subsequent imaging after equivocal ultrasound in non-pregnant adults is addressed as follows: In non-pregnant adults with suspected acute cholecystitis or acute cholangitis, if initial US is equivocal/non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, the panel suggests obtaining an abdominal CT scan as subsequent imaging to diagnose acute cholecystitis or acute cholangitis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). CT with IV contrast is preferable and usually appropriate when CT is obtained for subsequent imaging, and the diagnosis of acute cholangitis should include clinical signs (jaundice, fever, chills, and right upper quadrant [RUQ] abdominal pain), laboratory findings (indicators of inflammation and biliary stasis), and imaging findings (biliary dilatation or evidence of an etiology [eg, stricture, stone, obstructing mass]). The panel did not identify any studies assessing the accuracy of abdominal US or CT for the diagnosis of acute cholangitis and relied on indirect evidence from acute cholecystitis; because acute cholecystitis and acute cholangitis are uncommon in children, evidence in children was not systematically reviewed, and it would be reasonable to mirror the imaging pathway for adults in children.

### Acute acalculous cholecystitis: a review [^116hSK6A]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Although recognized for more than 150 years, acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) remains an elusive diagnosis. This is likely because of the complex clinical setting in which this entity develops, the lack of large prospective controlled trials that evaluate various diagnostic modalities, and thus dependence on a small data base for clinical decision making. AAC most often occurs in critically ill patients, especially related to trauma, surgery, shock, burns, sepsis, total parenteral nutrition, and/or prolonged fasting. Clinically, AAC is difficult to diagnose because the findings of right upper-quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver tests are not specific. AAC is associated with a high mortality, but early diagnosis and intervention can change this. Early diagnosis is the crux of debate surrounding AAC, and it usually rests with imaging modalities. There are no specific criteria to diagnose AAC. Therefore, this review discusses the imaging methods most likely to arrive at an early and accurate diagnosis despite the complexities of the radiologic modalities. A pragmatic approach is vital. A timely diagnosis will depend on a high index of suspicion in the appropriate patient, and the combined results of clinical findings (admittedly nonspecific), plus properly interpreted imaging. Sonogram (often sequential) and hepatic iminodiacetic acid scans are the most reliable modalities for diagnosis. It is generally agreed that cholecystectomy is the definitive therapy for AAC. However, at times a diagnostic/therapeutic drainage via interventional radiology/surgery may be necessary and life-saving, and may be the only treatment needed.

Acute appendicitis management guidelines summary

Multiple societies have published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of appendicitis. Notably, a consensus statement was published in Surgical Endoscopy in 2015, and a summary from the World Society of Emergency Surgery was published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery in 2016. Several other comprehensive guidelines covering imaging recommendations, antimicrobial prophylaxis and duration, laparoscopic versus open surgical approach, and optimal management of perforated appendicitis have been published. This review summarizes and references evidence-based guidelines for appendicitis by stage, as a reference guide for surgeons practicing emergency general surgery.

Key points

Laparoscopic appendectomy is considered the gold standard for acute appendicitis and should be the procedure of choice, except when laparoscopy is contraindicated or not feasible. Studies have demonstrated the laparoscopic approach is equivalent to, or better than, the open technique in most circumstances. Conversion to open may be necessary in technically difficult cases, however. Laparoscopic appendectomy is safe in the obese, elderly patients, pediatric patients and pregnant patient populations, including in the third trimester.

Non-operative therapy is a reasonable approach in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients should be educated that the possibility of recurrence exists. Non-operative therapy may also be considered in some cases of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess. In most other situations, appendectomy is the standard of care.

CT imaging is more reliable that ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The use of intravenous contrast may improve the sensitivity of this test and is generally recommended when CT imaging is performed. Exceptions to CT may be pursued in pregnant women and children to minimize exposure to radiation. Ultrasound is preferred for diagnosis in pregnant patients and children. If ultrasound is equivocal, MRI would be the next diagnostic test of choice.

Preoperative antibiotics should be administered as soon as the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made. There is no indication for postoperative antibiotics in uncomplicated appendicitis. There are also no data supporting improvement in clinical outcomes with any given scoring system for acute appendicitis.

Technical maneuvers, such as peritoneal irrigation, variations in appendiceal stump closure or methods of mesenteric vascular control have demonstrated no difference in outcomes.

### Toward an evidence-based approach for cholangitis diagnosis [^113gKJkY]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Despite improvements in imaging and laboratory medicine, consensus criteria for the diagnosis of cholangitis are lacking. Although ERCP is an effective treatment for cholangitis, it should be reserved for those patients with a high probability of the diagnosis, given the morbidity associated with the procedure.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (from 1898 to present), Web of Science (1900 to July 15, 2019), Embase (1943 to July 15, 2019), and the Cochrane library (1898 to July 15, 2019) was performed to identify studies that reported on diagnostic paradigms and individual diagnostic parameters of cholangitis. This was used to identify domains associated with high probability of cholangitis.

Results

We identified 23 observational studies (10,252 patients) that evaluated the performance of individual and combined criteria for the diagnosis of cholangitis. Traditional paradigms including Charcot's criteria and Ranson's criteria have inadequate sensitivity, and complexity has limited the implementation of the contemporary Tokyo criteria. Furthermore, controlled studies to validate diagnostic criteria for cholangitis are lacking. Existing literature suggests that 4 criteria, summarized by the acronym BILE, identifies those at high risk of cholangitis: Biliary imaging abnormalities or recent intervention, Inflammatory test abnormalities, Liver test abnormalities, and Exclusion of cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis.

Conclusions

There is a need for cholangitis diagnostic criteria that are supported by controlled validation studies, consistent with contemporary clinical values, and amenable to implementation. The BILE criteria are straightforward but require prospective study of their diagnostic performance and ability to avert unnecessary ERCP.

### Evaluating the relevance of the 2013 tokyo guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholecystitis [^117VWbSF]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 Tokyo Guidelines (TG13) are used to diagnose, grade severity, and guide management of acute cholecystitis (AC). The aim of our study was to verify the diagnostic criteria, severity assessment, and management protocols based on the TG13.

Study Design

Our prospectively maintained emergency general surgery registry was used to review patients who had a surgical consultation for right upper quadrant pain (from 2013 to 2015). Diagnosis and severity were graded based on TG13 and compared with pathology reports. Our institutional management protocols were compared with TG13.

Results

Nine hundred and fifty-two patients were analyzed, of which 857 had biliary diseases. Mean age was 42 ± 18 years and 67% were female. Seven hundred and seventy-nine had a cholecystectomy, 15 underwent cholecystostomy tube placement, and 63 patients were managed conservatively. Only 4% were febrile on presentation and 51% of patients had leukocytosis. Fifty-nine percent of patients did not have any signs of AC on ultrasonography. The TG13 criteria had a sensitivity of 53% for diagnosing AC (definitive 27%, suspected 26%, and undiagnosed 47%) when compared with the final pathology report; 92.5% of patients with grade I, 93% with grade II, and even 64% with grade III, underwent cholecystectomy safely at our institute. There were no differences in complication rates (3.7% vs 4.7%; p = 0.81), return to operating room rates (0.6% vs 0.7%; p = 0.95), or mortality rates (0.3% vs 0%; p = 0.96) between grade I and grade II patients who underwent early cholecystectomy.

Conclusions

The TG13 diagnostic criteria lack sensitivity and missed more than half of the patients with AC, as many patients lack clinical signs (fever and leukocytosis). The TG13 recommendations for conservative management and delayed cholecystectomy in grade II and grade III disease are not warranted.

Section 1. Diagnosis of ACC

1.1 As no feature has sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude the diagnosis of ACC, it is recommended not to rely on a single clinical or laboratory finding. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

1.2 For the diagnosis of ACC, we suggest using a combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, laboratory tests and imaging investigations. However, the best combination is not known. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

Comment: useful features for the diagnosis of ACC are:
History and clinical examination: fever, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, vomiting or food intolerance; Murphy's sign
Laboratory tests: elevated C-reactive protein, elevated white blood cell count
Imaging: signs suggestive of gallbladder inflammation

The recommendations of the 2016 WSES guidelines were mainly based on two studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis by Trowbridge et al. and a prospective diagnostic study by Eskelinen et al. This evidence, although flawed by the limitations described below, remains relevant and the associated statement remains valid.

The paper by Trowbridge et al. included 17 studies, which reported a quantitative assessment of history, physical examination and/or laboratory tests for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The results showed that, with the exception of Murphy's sign (positive likelihood ratio — LR 2.8; 95% CI 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR0.4; 95% CI 0.2–1.1) — although the 95% confidence intervals included 1.0 in both cases, none of the clinical signs or laboratory tests showed LRs higher than 1.6 or negative LRs lower than 0.4. Limitations were identified in a possible selection bias, as patients with abdominal pain and patients with a suspected diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were included in the study, and in a heterogeneous definition of the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

### Sonography of acute cholecystitis and its mimics [^112EnirK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain is a common complaint. Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the primary diagnostic consideration in most adults presenting with acute onset RUQ abdominal pain; however, a variety of other conditions can mimic AC. Abdominal ultrasound (US) receives the highest score for imaging appropriateness for these patients. This article reviews the sonographic findings of uncomplicated and complicated AC and provides practical technical tips. The radiologist should be familiar with conditions that can mimic AC, be able to suggest these alternative diagnoses when findings are present on US, and recommend additional tests or procedures, if needed.

### Machine learning model for differentiating xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and gallbladder cancer in multicenter largescale study [^117YLuGT]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Preoperative diagnostic imaging for gallbladder diseases commonly includes ultrasound (US), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previous studies have explored imaging features on US, CT, and MRI to differentiate XGC from GBC. For instance, gallbladder mucosal line continuity, a low-density border surrounding the lesion, diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, hypo-attenuated or hypoechoic nodules in the thickened walls, and the presence of calculi were found to be strongly associated with XGC –. Lee et al.compared the diagnostic performance of these imaging modalities and demonstrated that MRI had the highest accuracy, followed by US and CT. Each imaging technique has distinct advantages and limitations. US is frequently used for initial screening due to its high temporal resolution, ability to observe blood flow, convenience, absence of radiation, and low cost, despite its lower spatial resolution. CT is effective for visualizing liver and lymph node involvement but involves radiation exposure and lower soft tissue resolution. MRI provides superior soft tissue resolution and effectively shows gallbladder wall invasion but is time-consuming and susceptible to respiratory motion artifacts. Therefore, integrating the features from these imaging modalities may enhance the differential diagnosis of XGC and GBC.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms, as novel non-invasive approaches, can flexibly and efficiently analyze high-throughput data, enabling the discovery of complex relationships between variables. Due to their advanced capabilities, various ML techniques are widely used to identify disease risk factors, predict treatment outcomes in patients with tumors, and support clinicians in real-world practice –. However, a previous study has indicated that different ML methods can produce varying performance results. Therefore, identifying the most effective ML techniques is essential for ensuring accurate and reliable predictions and classifications in clinical applications. To our knowledge, no current research has employed multiple ML methods on large-scale, multi-center datasets to differentiate XGC from GBC in real-world settings.

In this study, we developed distinct ML-based models to differentiate between XGC and GBC using preoperative clinical characteristics, imaging features, and laboratory tests. We compared the performance of these models and validated them on an independent, external, multi-center testing cohort to assess generalizability. We then evaluated the optimal model against results from a reader study involving six radiologists with varying levels of experience. Finally, we explored the application of the most effective model in real-world clinical settings, including outpatient, inpatient, and physical examination settings. Figure 1 illustrates the framework of the proposed ML-based model.

### Optimal timing of cholecystectomy after percutaneous gallbladder drainage for severe cholecystitis [^114aWmun]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common disease for which laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become the standard treatment. However, in patients with severe AC, the rate of complications such as bile leak, common bile duct injury, and bowel injury is high after LC, suggesting an association between severity of inflammation and difficulty of LC. Therefore, evaluation of the severity of AC is important in determining the appropriate treatment.

The Tokyo Guidelines in 2007 was issued as the first international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AC and has been recently revised as the Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13). The TG13 suggested that the criteria for AC should be based on clinical symptoms, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging findings and classified AC into three grades of inflammation: mild (grade I), moderate (grade II), and severe (grade III) (Table 1). The TG13 also recommended appropriate therapy depending on the grade of AC. Grade I patients are candidates for immediate LC; grade II patients could undergo either LC or percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD); and grade III patients are strongly recommended to undergo immediate PTGBD.

Table 1
Severity classification of acute cholecystitis by the Tokyo guidelines 2013

In the early 1980s, Radder introduced the procedure of PTGBD to immediately improve the symptoms of AC. In some patients who undergo PTGBD and subsequent LC, technical difficulties and postoperative complications associated with severe fibrosis and gallbladder adhesion may be encountered. Therefore, it is very important to determine the optimal timing of cholecystectomy after PTGBD; however, this is still controversial.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the interval between PTGBD and cholecystectomy on the technical difficulty of cholecystectomy and postoperative complications. We also aimed to determine the optimal timing of cholecystectomy after PTGBD.
