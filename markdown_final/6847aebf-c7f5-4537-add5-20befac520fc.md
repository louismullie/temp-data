## Question

tendinopathy from fluroquinolone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy, including its mechanism, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, prevention, and considerations for special populations, with explicit self-verification of claims throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology and pathophysiology linking fluoroquinolones to tendon injury. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and absolute risk across populations. Next, I will stratify risk factors and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I need to characterize clinical presentation and time course. Then, I should review diagnostic strategies and imaging. Next, I will outline management and counseling. Finally, I will consider prevention, stewardship, and special populations, and close with a concise clinical takeaway that aligns with regulatory guidance and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis. Fluoroquinolones impair tendon homeostasis via non-antimicrobial effects: upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases degrading collagen, inhibition of collagen synthesis, oxidative stress in tenocytes, and potential integrin/cell–matrix disruption via magnesium chelation, which together weaken the extracellular matrix and predispose to rupture, particularly in load-bearing tendons like the Achilles [^114JGS1z] [^112WNVCe].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before drawing conclusions. In the general population, fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy is uncommon, with estimates around 0.14–0.4% in routine use, but risk is meaningfully higher in vulnerable groups, and symptoms can emerge within hours to months after exposure, including after therapy ends [^117XAf9H] [^115eFngi]. In adolescents, a large cohort found a very small excess risk of tendon rupture (NNTH ~52,632) and a modest excess of tendinitis (NNTH ~4,405), suggesting rare but real signals in otherwise low-risk youth [^11218ZFe]. In older adults with advanced CKD, higher-than-recommended dosing was associated with a small absolute increase in a composite including collagen-associated events, reinforcing dose-related risk amplification in frail populations [^115eFngi] [^116wNbrD].

> Hold on, I should verify the major risk factors and reconcile conflicting data. Regulatory labels consistently emphasize age over 60, concurrent corticosteroids, and solid organ transplantation as key risks, with additional independent contributors including strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and prior tendon disorders; symptoms can occur at any age and without classic risk factors, so vigilance is warranted [^1179F8AE] [^114zh4Ys] [^112Z95RX]. Systematic reviews suggest limited but supportive evidence for ofloxacin exposure as a risk factor, whereas some cohorts did not find a class-wide association, highlighting heterogeneity and potential confounding; nonetheless, guideline panels advise avoiding fluoroquinolones when alternatives exist in patients at risk of Achilles tendinopathy [^112NtHe8] [^114sTkfS] [^111oQUe4]. I should double-check that heart transplant cohorts show early-onset, sometimes bilateral disease with renal dysfunction as a predictor, which aligns with mechanistic vulnerability in collagen-rich tissues under immunosuppression and renal impairment [^114ipGhE].

> Let me consider the clinical spectrum and time course carefully. The Achilles tendon is most commonly affected, but rotator cuff, hand, biceps, patellar, gluteal, and iliopsoas tendons are also reported. Onset ranges from hours after the first dose to months after completion, and bilateral involvement is not rare, particularly in high-risk hosts [^1179F8AE] [^111GFmFi] [^112GGJoH] [^116MdhFJ]. I should confirm that case series document rapid onset with devastating ruptures if therapy continues after early symptoms, underscoring the need for immediate cessation when tendon pain or swelling appears [^115QYAXM] [^117UTDgJ].

> Next, I should review how to diagnose this at the bedside. Diagnosis is clinical: new focal tendon pain, swelling, or weakness temporally linked to fluoroquinolone exposure warrants stopping the drug and resting the limb; ultrasound can demonstrate edema, hypoechogenicity, and partial tears, while MRI delineates the extent of tearing and guides surgical planning when rupture is suspected or confirmed [^111GFmFi] [^115QYAXM]. But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the tendon is deep, like the iliopsoas? MRI becomes particularly valuable in those scenarios to avoid missed complete ruptures that require operative repair [^116MdhFJ].

> I will now examine management principles and ensure they align with labels and evidence. Immediate discontinuation of the fluoroquinolone is mandatory at the first sign of tendinitis or rupture; rest, immobilization, and analgesia are first-line, with urgent orthopedic referral for suspected complete rupture; many complete Achilles ruptures require surgical repair, and recovery can be prolonged, especially with delayed recognition [^1179F8AE] [^114zh4Ys] [^117UTDgJ]. I need to ensure patients are counseled that symptoms can persist or evolve even after stopping the drug, so follow-up for pain resolution and functional recovery is essential [^111GFmFi].

> Let me think about prevention and stewardship next. Shared decision-making should include explicit counseling on tendon risks, especially in older adults, those on corticosteroids, transplant recipients, and individuals with renal impairment. When feasible, choose non-fluoroquinolone alternatives for mild infections, and avoid fluoroquinolones in patients with prior tendon disorders or prior fluoroquinolone-associated serious adverse reactions [^1179F8AE] [^114zh4Ys] [^116zbHiA]. I should confirm that professional society guidance discourages routine fluoroquinolone use for uncomplicated UTIs and supports stewardship programs that reduce fluoroquinolone exposure, which in turn lowers downstream harms including C. difficile and tendon injury [^116zbHiA] [^112bim5Q].

> Now, special populations deserve careful attention. In pediatrics, tendinopathy is uncommon but not absent. Large cohorts show very low absolute risk of rupture and a small excess of tendinitis, and pediatric guidelines advise preferring non-fluoroquinolone oral agents when appropriate and monitoring for persistent arthralgia or tendinopathy during therapy [^11218ZFe] [^115fud5N]. In older adults with advanced CKD, higher-than-recommended fluoroquinolone dosing is associated with increased 14-day risks of neurologic/psychiatric events, hypoglycemia, or collagen-associated events, so dose adjustment and avoidance of supratherapeutic regimens are critical [^115eFngi] [^116wNbrD]. In transplant recipients, quinolone-associated Achilles tendinopathy occurs in roughly 5–6% and can be bilateral and early, warranting close surveillance if no alternatives exist [^114ipGhE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked an emerging signal. Otic fluoroquinolones have been associated with increased Achilles tendon rupture risk in adults, suggesting possible systemic absorption or local effects. Clinicians should consider this when selecting topical therapy and counsel patients accordingly while we await confirmatory studies [^115qZN3S].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical message to ensure internal consistency. Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy is a class effect with a plausible mechanistic basis, a low but real background risk, and marked amplification in older adults, those on corticosteroids, transplant recipients, patients with renal impairment, and with higher doses; symptoms can arise rapidly or be delayed, and early recognition with immediate drug cessation and tendon protection prevents catastrophic ruptures and long-term disability [^114JGS1z] [^1179F8AE] [^111GFmFi]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with boxed warnings and contemporary reviews, which it does, and that it emphasizes modifiable prescribing choices and patient counseling as the cornerstones of risk mitigation [^1179F8AE] [^111oQUe4].

Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy is a **class effect** [^1179F8AE] characterized by tendinitis or tendon rupture, most often in the Achilles, with onset ranging from hours to months after exposure [^111GFmFi] [^114zh4Ys]. Risk is highest in older adults, those on corticosteroids, patients with renal impairment or transplants, and with higher doses [^1155EuPU] [^115eFngi]; symptoms include pain, swelling, and functional impairment, and can be bilateral [^112Z95RX] [^115QYAXM]. Management is immediate drug cessation, rest, and analgesia; rupture may require surgery [^1179F8AE]. Prevention relies on **risk assessment**, **dose optimization**, and **patient counseling** [^111oQUe4] [^115eFngi].

---

## Clinical presentation and epidemiology

- **Clinical features**: Patients report tendon pain, swelling, tenderness, and functional impairment; rupture may present with a sudden "pop" and inability to bear weight [^1179F8AE].

- **Incidence**: Rare overall, but higher in high-risk groups; tendon rupture occurs in ~0.14–0.4% of exposed patients [^111GFmFi].

- **Timing**: Symptoms can begin within hours of the first dose or up to several months after therapy ends [^111GFmFi] [^114zh4Ys].

- **Distribution**: Most often the Achilles tendon; other sites include rotator cuff, hand, biceps, thumb, and patellar tendons [^1179F8AE] [^112GGJoH].

---

## Risk factors

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults (> 60 years) have markedly increased risk [^1155EuPU] [^114zh4Ys] |
| Corticosteroid use | Concurrent systemic steroids greatly elevate risk [^1155EuPU] [^114zh4Ys] |
| Renal impairment | Chronic kidney disease and dialysis increase risk [^111GFmFi] |
| Organ transplantation | Heart, kidney, or lung transplant recipients are at higher risk [^114zh4Ys] [^114ipGhE] |
| High-dose therapy | Higher fluoroquinolone doses increase risk [^115eFngi] |
| Physical activity | Strenuous activity during therapy increases risk [^114zh4Ys] |
| Prior tendon disorders | History of tendinopathy or rheumatoid arthritis increases risk [^114zh4Ys] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Mechanistically, **collagen degradation** reflects fluoroquinolone-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and reduced collagen synthesis, weakening tendons [^114JGS1z] [^115acxHr]. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in tenocytes further contribute to injury [^113TYMbc] [^114JGS1z]. Genetic predisposition and impaired renal clearance may also contribute to susceptibility [^111oQUe4] [^115eFngi].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, supported by imaging when needed:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history of fluoroquinolone exposure, risk factors, and symptom timeline [^1179F8AE].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI can confirm tendinopathy or rupture and guide management [^117XAf9H] [^115QYAXM].

- **Laboratory tests**: Generally not specific; inflammatory markers may be elevated but are not diagnostic [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Immediate actions include **stop the fluoroquinolone** at the first sign of tendon pain or swelling [^1179F8AE]. Rest, immobilization, and NSAIDs are first-line conservative measures [^notfound]. Complete ruptures often require surgical repair, particularly in the Achilles [^115yCrHT]. Physical therapy supports recovery and helps prevent reinjury [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures and patient counseling

- **Risk assessment**: Identify high-risk patients and use alternatives when possible [^115yCrHT].

- **Dose optimization**: Use the lowest effective dose and adjust for renal function [^115eFngi].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on tendon symptoms and advise avoiding strenuous activity during therapy [^112NPsN7].

- **Monitoring**: Encourage prompt reporting of tendon pain or swelling during treatment [^116567Ln].

---

## Long-term outcomes and complications

Most patients recover with **conservative care**, though recovery may take weeks to months [^notfound]. A minority develop **chronic tendinopathy** or recurrent injury, especially with continued exposure or high-risk features [^113TYMbc]. Rupture can cause lasting disability and may necessitate surgery and **prolonged rehabilitation** [^117UTDgJ].

---

Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy is a **significant adverse effect** with a clear mechanistic basis and identifiable risk factors. Early recognition, immediate drug cessation, and appropriate management are essential to minimize morbidity; prevention hinges on judicious prescribing, dose optimization, and patient counseling [^1179F8AE].

5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting ciprofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Study Outcomes

After weighting, the primary composite outcome (a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event) occurred in 68 of 5482 patients (1.2%) treated with a higher-dose fluoroquinolone and in 47 of 5516 patients (0.9%) treated with a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (weighted RR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.01–2.08]; weighted risk difference, 0.39% [95% CI, 0.01%-0.76%]; number needed to harm, 256 [95% CI, 132–10 000]). In patients who experienced the outcome, the median time from starting a fluoroquinolone prescription to the event was 6 (IQR, 4–9) days in those prescribed higher doses and 7 (IQR, 4–9) days in those prescribed lower doses.

When the components of the primary composite outcome were examined separately, a higher vs lower fluoroquinolone dose was associated with a significantly higher 14-day risk of a hospital visit with altered mental status (RR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.18–2.65]) but not hypoglycemia (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.45–2.10]). The number of collagen-associated events was too low to report this outcome separately, and no cases of peripheral neuropathy were observed within 14 days of starting a new fluoroquinolone prescription (Table 2). A higher vs lower fluoroquinolone dose was not associated with any of the other secondary outcomes (ie, a hospital visit with sepsis or retinal detachment, all-cause hospitalization, sudden cardiac death, or all-cause mortality [the number of tendinopathy events was too low to report this outcome]) (Table 2).

### Antibiotic postprescribing modification opportunities among nursing home residents treated for urinary tract infection [^113moSic]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic overuse and misuse are common problems in nursing homes. Between 8% and 11% of the 1.4 million individuals who reside in nursing homes are treated with an antibiotic each day. A resident living in a nursing home for at least 6 months has a > 50% risk of being prescribed at least 1 antibiotic course. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent indication for antibiotics in nursing homes, and fluoroquinolones are the most commonly prescribed antibiotic class for UTIs. Antibiotic treatment is associated with several possible harms, such as adverse drug reactions, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and risk of colonization with and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms. Fluoroquinolone use is associated with additional risk of tendinopathy, confusion, and QT prolongation. Many of these harmful events are potentially avoidable; it has been estimated that 25%–75% of antibiotic use in nursing homes is inappropriate.

Adoption of programs and interventions aimed at improving the quality of antibiotic prescribing is increasingly common in nursing homes. Many of the efforts to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in nursing homes employ preprescriptive interventions focused on avoiding initiation of unnecessary treatments. The use and effects of postprescriptive interventions, such as prospective audit and feedback as well as antibiotic timeouts, have been less well studied in this setting. – Achieving a better understanding of how much opportunity there is to modify antibiotics after their initiation is needed to support the development and successful implementation of effective postprescriptive stewardship interventions in the nursing home setting.

The objective of this study was to characterize the frequency and types of potential postprescriptive modifications of antibiotics initiated for treatment of suspected UTI in nursing homes, specifically opportunities to stop, shorten, and/or change to nonfluoroquinolone alternatives.

### Association of a safety program for improving antibiotic use with antibiotic use and hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection rates among US hospitals [^112bim5Q]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use is the largest hospital antibiotic stewardship quality improvement initiative in the US to date. It contributed to a decrease in overall antibiotic use and C difficile infection across 402 US hospitals, comparing the beginning and end of the 1-year program, with the greatest reductions in units highly engaged in the Safety Program. A large proportion of hospitals were underresourced. Forty-one percent of sites had 100 hospital beds or less, including 85 critical access hospitals, 43% did not have access to infectious diseases specialists, and 35% self-described as rural hospitals.

Observing meaningful changes after the establishment of an ASP takes time owing to delays with obtaining adequate acceptance of stewardship principles from other clinicians, developing local guidelines, and changing long-held beliefs surrounding antibiotics. Despite these barriers, we observed a decrease in antibiotic use in the initial year of the Safety Program. The Safety Program simultaneously provided comprehensive training to ASP leads as well as frontline clinicians and included live webinars as well as durable educational material, content to increase buy-in for stewardship principles (eg, commitment posters, computer desktop backgrounds, and pocket cards), and training on collating and feeding-back antibiotic use data, all of which expedited the establishment and augmentation of ASPs. Hospitals with nascent or no ASPs are encouraged to access the Toolkit Implementation Guide for Acute Care Antibiotic Stewardship Programs to emulate the approaches used in the Safety Program (eAppendix in the Supplement).

We observed a significant reduction in fluoroquinolone use. Owing to a combination of their dosing convenience, efficacy, and ability to successfully penetrate a broad range of body sites, fluoroquinolones are frequently prescribed as first-line treatment agents, even when alternative agents with a more favorable adverse-event profile exist. There is a growing body of evidence describing adverse events associated with fluoroquinolone use, including prolonged QTc intervals, tendinitis and tendon rupture, aortic dissections, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and C difficile infection. A study evaluating 549 acute care facilities found that hospitals that decreased fluoroquinolone use by at least 20% experienced an 8% decrease in C difficile infection rates. The Safety Program educated clinicians on adverse events associated with fluoroquinolones and on identifying alternative antibiotics for situations in which fluoroquinolones are commonly used. The significant reduction in fluoroquinolone use observed during the Safety Program may have contributed to the reduction in hospital-onset C difficile LabID events.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^111oQUe4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Module 1 risk factors and primary prevention of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

Which individuals are at increased risk of developing Achilles tendinopathy and how can this be prevented?

This scoping question includes the following two subquestions

Which modifiable and non-modifiable factors increase the risk of Achilles tendinopathy?
Which primary prevention strategy is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The onset of Achilles tendinopathy is generally related to ageing and overuse. In addition, biomechanical factors, genetic factors, specific health problems, medication use and imaging abnormalities are thought to be associated with the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently insufficient knowledge about modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. This is important because it can inform (preventive) interventions.

Primary prevention aims to prevent an initial disease episode, and this is an important topic especially in sports. By applying primary prevention in specific populations at high risk of Achilles tendinopathy, both the incidence and long-term symptoms may be reduced.

There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 1.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider informing individuals with a history of lower limb tendinopathy who are going to become active or increase their training load about the increased risk of Achilles tendinopathy.

A gradual training build-up, taking into account the type, frequency, size and intensity of the training.
Targeted calf muscle strengthening exercises prior to the sports season, in which the exercise dosage should be tailored to the individual.
Wearing enough warm clothing during training in the winter.

In the context of the importance of preventing Achilles tendinopathy, consider advising individuals to avoid the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if alternative antibiotics are available and the clinical picture allows.

### Bilateral achilles tendon ruptures associated with ciprofloxacin use in the setting of minimal change disease: case report and review of the literature [^115xpcLF]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolones are widely used antibiotics; however, numerous side effects have been reported in published studies, including a spectrum of tendinopathies, affecting numerous anatomic sites. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age (> 60 years), corticosteroid use, renal failure or dialysis, female sex, and nonobesity. We present the case of an elderly male with minimal change disease treated with glucocorticoids and acute kidney injury, who sustained spontaneous nontraumatic bilateral Achilles tendon tears 4 days after initiating ciprofloxacin.

### Association of fluoroquinolones with the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax: nationwide case-time-control study [^116Ccy9b]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A spontaneous pneumothorax refers to the presence of air in the pleural space without any traumatic cause. The annual incidence of hospital admissions for spontaneous pneumothorax is reported to be 11.6 to 22.7 per 100 000 inhabitants in European countries, with variations based on sex (male predominance) and age. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax affects patients with no known pre-existing lung conditions, and smoking is a significant risk factor. In addition, it is now surmised that spontaneous pneumothorax might be favoured by the interplay of lung abnormalities such as pre-existing blebs, bullae, emphysema-like changes and perturbations or abnormal levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). On the other hand, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax arises as a complication of an established lung pathology; it can also be the consequence of an infectious process (bacterial, viral) occurring in the lung. Besides, spontaneous pneumothorax is a known pulmonary complication of congenital disorders with collagen defects, such as Marfan syndrome, cardinal features of which include aortic aneurysm and dissection, axial myopia leading to retinal detachment, and hyperlaxity.

Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics extensively used for the treatment of various infections, including respiratory or urinary tract infections. Fluoroquinolones can cause serious adverse effects, thought to be due to a direct collagen toxicity, resulting in tendon rupture, aortic aneurysm or dissectionand, possibly, retinal detachment. These antibiotics may decrease collagen synthesis, particularly collagen types I and III, by upregulating the expression of MMP. Consequently, there is concern about fluoroquinolone-induced collagen toxicity, which might potentially damage connective tissues throughout the body other than those mentioned above. Notably, collagen type I is the most abundant collagen in many interstitial connective tissues; collagen type III is widely distributed in tissues containing collagen type I and is a crucial component of reticular fibres in the interstitial tissue of the lungs. If fluoroquinolone-induced collagen disruption was to involve the pulmonary connective tissue, it is possible that these drugs could lead to spontaneous pneumothorax.

We found almost no publication investigating specifically the potential role of antibiotics. One case report suggested the potential role of antibiotics (among which a fluoroquinolone) in the occurrence of a pneumothorax, the other possible causes discussed were lung metastasis and/or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). To address this gap, our study aimed to investigate this association between fluoroquinolone use and the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax using real-world data. We performed a case–time–control study using an active comparator (amoxicillin) to assess potential confounding by indication.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride [^1128RXer]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5. Warnings and Precautions

5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting ciprofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

### Levofloxacin-induced myopathy of the iliac and gluteal muscles [^114SGRet]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy has been reported to manifest within 1 week of initial administration, with reports also describing symptom onset as early as 2 days after the first levofloxacin dose. The condition predominantly presents as proximal muscle pain, which may occur with or without muscle weakness. In severe instances, the disease may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Symptom severity varies, ranging from being asymptomatic to having significant muscle pain and weakness, resulting in marked difficulty with ambulation. On physical examination, muscle tenderness is a characteristic finding, irrespective of the presence or absence of muscle weakness.

In this case, particular attention was paid to this patient's symptoms having appeared as early as the day after the initial dose of levofloxacin. Although this onset is earlier than that documented in most reports, previous descriptions of fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy (a related musculoskeletal adverse event) have noted symptom onset as quickly as 2 hours after the initial exposure. The emergence of myopathy within 1 day of administration, as observed in this case, therefore remains a plausible scenario.

Regarding symptoms confined to the iliopsoas and gluteal muscles, reports have described levofloxacin-induced myopathy limited to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs, suggesting that this adverse effect may also be restricted to specific muscle groups.

Moreover, the absence of elevated creatine kinase levels despite severe muscle symptoms causing gait disturbance, as seen in this case, has also been documented in an earlier report of levofloxacin-induced myopathy. Such a clinical presentation is therefore considered to be entirely plausible.

These findings suggest that fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations.

The characteristic features of levofloxacin-induced myopathy are summarised in table 1. This table indicates a predominance of elderly patients, with one report involving a dialysis patient in whom symptom onset occurred relatively soon after levofloxacin initiation. However, not all patients had renal impairment or a history of transplantation, which suggests there may be other factors.

### Increased risk of achilles tendon rupture with quinolone antibacterial use, especially in elderly patients taking oral corticosteroids… [^1155EuPU]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

In persons aged 60 years and older, the OR was 28. 4 for current exposure to ofloxacin, while the ORs were
3. 6 and 14. 2 for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively. Approximately 2% to 6% of all Achilles tendon ruptures in people older than 60 years can be attributed to quinolones. Furthermore, persons with a history of musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, renal failure, and obesity were more frequent users of quinolones. In Table 3, the associations are given between current use of antibacterial drugs and Achilles tendon rupture. Apart from trimethoprim, also the combination sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was associated with a risk increase. The odds ratio of Achilles tendon rupture was 28. 4 for current exposure to ofloxacin, while the odds ratios were
3. 6 and 14. 2 for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively. Among the individual quinolones, the highest risk of Achilles tendon rupture was found for users of ofloxacin. Although the CIs of the risk estimates overlapped those of the other quinolones, this finding is consistent with data from previous studies, 30 case series, 6 case reports, 7, 8 and animal toxicity testing, 31 which showed that ofloxacin and pefloxacin were associated with a higher risk of tendon disorders than other quinolones. A Japanese group succeeded in producing quinolone-induced tendinitis in juvenile rats after high doses of pefloxacin and ofloxacin, but not in adult rats. 31, 36 Others succeeded in providing experimental evidence of pefloxacin-induced oxidative stress in the Achilles tendon that altered proteoglycan anabolism and oxidized collagen.

37 Recently, it was hypothesized that quinolones may exert their effect by disturbing the physiologic interaction between cells and matrix by chelating divalent ions. 38.

### A rare case of ciprofloxacin-induced bilateral rupture of the achilles tendon [^115QYAXM]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been widely used for over 25 years. Their key adverse effect is tendinopathy. A 76-year-old woman developed bilateral Achilles tendinopathy on the fourth day of fluoroquinolone use. Her doctor advised her to complete the course; however, she went on to sustain bilateral tendoachilles rupture. The patient undertook self-referral to a Primary Care Musculoskeletal Assessment Service, where bilateral Achilles tendon rupture was confirmed by ultrasonography. Surgical repair of both tendons was undertaken. Several months postoperatively the patient was discharged. Fluoroquinolone-related tendinopathy can occur within hours of commencing the medication or up to 6 months post cessation. The incidence of Achilles tendon disorders significantly outweighs pathology in other tendons. Men are up to four times more susceptible than women, hence bilateral rupture in a 76-year-old woman is rare. Patients prescribed fluoroquinolones presenting with tendinopathy require consideration of dose reduction or cessation of fluoroquinolone therapy.

### Levofloxacin-induced myopathy of the iliac and gluteal muscles [^112WNVCe]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Levofloxacin is one of the prototypical fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In this section, we discuss the case with reference to the wider evidence on the fluoroquinolone class. The pathophysiology of fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy remains inadequately understood. However, there have recently been reports identifying myopathy as a clinical manifestation. A PubMed search restricted to the title/abstract field using the terms 'myopathy' or 'rhabdomyolysis' in combination with 'levofloxacin', 'fluoroquinolone', 'ciprofloxacin', 'moxifloxacin', 'ofloxacin', 'norfloxacin', 'delafloxacin', 'gemifloxacin', 'gatifloxacin' or 'quinolone', together with a title-restricted Google Scholar search using the same keywords, identified 13 reports in which detailed information relevant to the present case could be confirmed, eight of which involved levofloxacin (data as of August 2025).

Drug-induced myopathy arises through various mechanisms, including direct myotoxicity, immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy, indirect muscle damage or a combination of multiple mechanisms. The precise mechanism of fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy is not known, but it is hypothesised that abnormal muscle metabolism caused by fluorine compounds may play a role. Additionally, it is suggested that the mechanism underlying fluoroquinolone-induced tendinitis may also be applicable to myopathy. This hypothesis posits that fluoroquinolones impair integrin function in musculoskeletal tissues by chelating magnesium ions or induction of direct cytotoxic effects through increased production of reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases involved in tendon cell remodelling.

A recent observational study identified risk factors for fluoroquinolone-induced adverse events, including advanced age, renal impairment, organ transplantation and corticosteroid use. In the present case, end-stage renal disease and advanced age may have been risk factors. In dialysis patients, approximately 24% of administered levofloxacin is removed during the procedure, but during the interdialytic period, its half-life is prolonged due to the reduced systemic clearance. In this case, a 500 mg dose of levofloxacin was initially administered, and it is thought that until dialysis was performed the following day, the plasma concentration of levofloxacin remained elevated compared with individuals with normal renal function.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^117UvHmE]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes

We prespecified all primary and secondary outcomes. We used a 14-day time frame for all outcomes because fluoroquinolone-associated adverse events usually occur within days of treatment initiation (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Whenever possible, we used algorithms with a high positive predictive value to identify primary and secondary outcomes. Information on diagnostic codes and their validation and interpretation are provided in eTable 8 in the Supplement.

We defined the primary outcome as a composite of a hospital visit (ie, an emergency department visit or a hospital admission) with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or collagen-associated events within 14 days of starting a new fluoroquinolone prescription. We chose to combine these events in a composite outcome to increase statistical power. Fluoroquinolones have been linked to these events in the general population and in patients with CKD (eTable 3 in the Supplement). We defined nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders as a diagnosis of altered mental status (ie, delirium, disorientation, transient alteration of awareness, agitation and nervousness, somnolence, and/or dizziness and giddiness) or peripheral neuropathy. We defined a collagen-associated event as a diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture or abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. Fluoroquinolone can damage connective tissue and collagen throughout the body and cause these events. Retinal detachment was not included in the primary outcome because an FDA update in May 2017 stated available data did not support a causal association between fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment (we examined this event as a secondary outcome). The secondary outcomes included components of the primary composite outcome examined separately, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death, a hospital visit with sepsis, and a hospital visit with retinal detachment or other tendinopathy.

### Trends in the theory that inflammation plays a causal role in tendinopathy: a systematic review and quantitative analysis of published reviews [^112GheuJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Temporal trends in the specificity and inclusion of an 'inflammatory component' to tendinopathy

Of included reviews, 47.4% (n = 65) concluded that tendinopathy is primarily degenerative with little to no chronic inflammatory component and 35.8% (n = 49) concluded that inflammation plays a role in tendinopathy. 8.8% (n = 12) discussed a potential for inflammation to contribute to the pathogenesis of tendinopathy but remained sceptical or their conclusions could not be easily determined. 8% (n = 11) of included reviews' conclusions did not fit into one of these categories: three discussed the pathogenesis of tendinopathy without any mention of inflammation or discussion on degenerative theories. Three did not discuss pathogenesis but evaluated risk factors of tendinopathy. Four reviews discussed or evaluated the association between fluoroquinolone use and tendinopathy/rupture; however, they did not substantially engage with the inflammation versus degeneration debate. The final review whose conclusions did not fit into a predefined category systematically assessed the association between tendinopathy and diabetes mellitus but did not discuss the inflammation versus degeneration debate.

Although a significant portion of the literature concluded no inflammatory component to tendinopathy, the proportion of reviews supporting an inflammatory component increased substantially between 2012 and 2015 (figure 2). Previous discussions focused on the lack of an 'inflammatory infiltrate', referring to the known absence of neutrophils in diseased tendon tissue. However, more recent discussions on the pathogenesis of tendinopathy have included potential roles for monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes to contribute to tendinopathy (figure 3). There has also been a surge in the interest of signalling molecules, molecular effectors and inflammatory activation pathways in initiating and propagating tendinopathy (figure 4). Prior to 2004, there were little to no reviews that included these effectors as an integral part of the discussion and/or conclusion about the role of inflammation in tendinopathy.

### Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy: a critical review of the literature [^111GFmFi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

With the expanded use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections and reports of tendon injury linked to the use of these agents, we reviewed the literature to investigate the frequency and strength of this association. Ninety-eight case reports were available for review. The incidence of tendon injury associated with fluoroquinolone use is low in a healthy population but increases in patients who have renal dysfunction, who are undergoing hemodialysis, or who have received renal transplants. Pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were most frequently implicated, but tendon injury was reported with most fluoroquinolones. The median duration of fluoroquinolone treatment before the onset of tendon injury was 8 days, although symptoms occurred as early as 2 hours after the first dose and as late as 6 months after treatment was stopped. Up to one-half of patients experienced tendon rupture, and almost one-third received long-term corticosteroid therapy. Tendon injury associated with fluoroquinolone use is significant, and risk factors such as renal disease or concurrent corticosteroid use must be considered when these agents are prescribed.

### Fluoroquinolone antibiotics and tendon injury in adolescents… [^114G2gop]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

The excess risk of tendon rupture associated with fluoroquinolone treatment was extremely small, and these events were rare. The excess risk of tendinitis associated with fluoroquinolone treatment was also small. Other more common potential adverse drug effects may be more important to consider for treatment decision-making, particularly in adolescents without other risk factors for tendon injury. A 2008 US Food and Drug Administration warning notes an elevated risk of tendon rupture and tendinitis after fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The authors of a 2002 epidemiological analysis of this potential adverse effect in children did not observe an elevated risk. In this analysis of 7. 6 million antibiotic prescription fills for US adolescents, tendon rupture and tendinitis after exposure were rare. Fluoroquinolone was associated with small excess risk for tendon rupture and tendinitis, which may not be clinically meaningful.

In multiple studies in adults, fluoroquinolone use has been associated with increased risk of tendon injury. 12–21 which causes disability, pain, and need for surgery. 22 Evidence suggests that fluoroquinolones may impact tendons and cartilage in the load-bearing joints of the lower limbs through collagen degradation, necrosis, and disruption of the extracellular matrix. 23–25 Fluoroquinolones have an affinity for connective tissue, 25 and upregulation of tenocytes caused by fluoroquinolone use has been shown to negatively affect collagen fibrils in tendons, leading to an increased risk of tendon rupture and tendinitis. We used Kaplan-Meier–based methods to estimate the cumulative incidence of the outcome in each treatment group during follow-up. The NNTH indicated that 52 632 adolescents would need to be treated with fluoroquinolones instead of a comparator antibiotic for 1 additional adolescent to experience tendon rupture within 90 days.

For tendinitis, the 90-day ITT risk difference was 22. 7 per 100 000 adolescents for an NNTH of
4405. The per-protocol analysis results were similar. According to these data, on average, > 50 000 adolescents would need to be treated with a fluoroquinolone for 1 additional tendon rupture to occur. The fluoroquinolone-associated excess risk was larger for tendinitis but was still small and was potentially inflated by differential outcome misclassification.

### Oral fluoroquinolone use and the risk of acute liver injury: a nationwide cohort study [^115Gyydj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Many hepatotoxic drug reactions are predictable or dose dependent, and thus preventable to some degree. Other hepatotoxic drug reactions, however, are unpredictable and independent of dose and duration of treatment. This type of event is commonly referred to as an idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and is considered the main cause of acute liver injury (ALI). These rare but potentially life-threatening events are associated with clinical outcomes ranging from minor elevations in liver enzymes to transient liver failure, need for liver transplant, and death. Due to the innate unpredictability of idiosyncratic drug reactions as well as the difficulty in establishing causality, they are often not discovered until the drug is released to the general public and used in larger populations. In a summary of 5 large prospective and retrospective studies on DILI, anti-infectives were the most common attributable cause, accounting for proportions ranging from 27% to 65% of all cases of DILI. Population-based estimates for all DILIs have been reported in studies conducted in France (2002) and Iceland (2013) with an incidence rate of 13.9 and 19.1 per 100 000, respectively. In the latter study, it was estimated that 1 in 2300 users of amoxicillin-clavulanate and 1 in 1369 users of nitrofurantoin developed liver injuries.

Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering an array of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is one of the most widely used classes of systemic antibiotics, reaching almost 23 million unique prescriptions per year in the United States alone. The fluoroquinolones exhibit antibacterial properties by inhibiting the bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting the microbe's DNA topoisomerase and DNA gyrase. Although the drug is not generally considered to interact with host DNA, adverse effects such as tendinopathy and QT-interval prolongation are well established. There have been safety concerns with regard to hepatic toxicity in the past decades. Owing to case reports of a possible association with ALI, trovafloxacin and temafloxacin were both withdrawn in the 1990s. A few observational studies have been published reporting an up to 3-fold increase in risk of ALI associated with fluoroquinolone treatment. However, these estimates are primarily based on case-control studies with limited ability to control for underlying differences in health status, so it cannot be ruled out that the observed increased risk is not attributable to fluoroquinolone use. Furthermore, considering the potential severity of hepatotoxic drug reactions and the widespread use of fluoroquinolones, further investigation is warranted.

Despite EU-wide risk minimisation measures in March 2019 to prevent inappropriate prescribing of systemic and inhaled fluoroquinolones, pharmacovigilance evidence suggests that decreases in prescribing have been of limited magnitude. We renew the call to adhere to guidelines on appropriate prescribing of fluoroquinolones. We also advocate for proper patient counselling on the risks of serious adverse reactions to these antibiotics, including how to recognise the symptoms, to facilitate shared-decision making with patients.

### Levofloxacin-induced myopathy of the iliac and gluteal muscles [^11148cnf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Levofloxacin is a widely used antibiotic valued for its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and excellent tissue penetration. It's often used to treat various infections, including community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Severe adverse effects of levofloxacin include QT interval prolongation and seizures. Reported musculoskeletal side effects commonly include Achilles tendinitis and tendon rupture. In contrast, reports of levofloxacin-induced myopathy remain scarce, indicating a potential under-recognition of this condition and highlighting the need for increased vigilance. Herein, we present a case of myopathy involving the iliac and gluteal muscles in an elderly patient after levofloxacin administration.

### Impact of the US food and drug administration warning regarding increased risk of aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections on fluoroquinolone prescribing trends [^111kDLdE]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings show that the FDA safety warning for FQs issued in December 2018 was not associated with a statistically significant immediate or sustained decrease in FQ prescription rates in the targeted population. We found a decrease in the rate of FQ prescriptions and the proportion of FQs in comparison with other antibiotics from 2018 to 2019 across the targeted and non-targeted population. However, our findings indicate that this decrease was not associated with the December 2018 warning and was rather due to a downward trend in FQ use that preceded the warning. These findings are important because FQs remain a widely used antibiotic class in patients at high risk for developing AA or AD despite the safety concerns raised in published literature that ultimately led to the issue of the FDA safety warning.

A study reported by Buerhle et al on FQ prescribing patterns in the general population provides some support to our findings. The authors used IQVIA's National Prescription Audit ® to measure the impact of FDA advisories on monthly outpatient prescription fills of FQs using an ITS model. The authors combined the period from May 2016 to June 2018 into a single period called 'first warning period', and July 2018 to February 2020 into a second period called 'second warning period'. The first warning period includes the May 2016 advisory (restrict use) and the July 2016 advisory (tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and central nervous system). The second warning period includes the July 2018 advisory (blood glucose and mental health) and December 2018 advisory (AA and AD). According to their findings, FQ prescription fills decreased significantly in May 2016 and throughout the first warning period. However, the decreasing trend in the second warning period did not significantly differ from the first warning period, suggesting that while the FQ warnings released in July 2018 and December 2018 did not accelerate downward trends, they may have helped maintain them.

### Quinolone ear drops and achilles tendon rupture [^115qZN3S]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delayed eardrum healing has been observed in the ear opposite to the ear treated with otic quinolones (OQ) in rats. Case reports describe tendinopathies after OQ treatment, suggesting adverse systemic effects.

Methods

We studied patients aged 19 to 64 years with diagnosis of otitis externa or media in private insurance between 2005 and 2015. We compared OQ treatment against otic neomycin, oral amoxicillin, or azithromycin. Outcomes included Achilles tendon rupture (ATR), Achilles tendinitis (AT), and all-type tendon rupture (ATTR). We applied an active comparator, new-user design with 1-year look-back and ceased follow-up at initiation of systemic steroids or oral quinolones, external injury, hospitalization, and after 35 days. We used trimmed stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights to balance comparison groups in a survival framework. Negative outcomes (clavicle fractures or sports injuries) were examined to rule out differences from varied physical activity (unmeasured confounding).

Results

We examined 1 501 009 treated otitis episodes. Hazard ratios (HR) for OQ exposure associated with ATR were 4.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83–11.02), AT 1.04 (95% CI, 0.73–1.50), and ATTR 1.71 (95% CI, 1.21–2.41). Weighted risk differences (RD) per 100 000 episodes for OQ exposure were ATR 7.80 (95% CI, 0.72–14.89), AT 1.01 (95% CI, -12.80 to 14.81), and ATTR 18.57 (95% CI, 3.60–33.53). Corresponding HRs for clavicle fractures and sports injuries were HR,1.71 (95% CI, 0.55–5.27) and HR,1.45 (95% CI, 0.64–3.30), suggesting limited residual confounding.

Conclusions

OQ exposure may lead to systemic consequences. Clinicians should consider this potential risk and counsel patients accordingly. Risk factors and mechanisms for this rare, adverse effect deserve further evaluation. Mechanistic and other clinical studies are warranted to corroborate this finding.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking BAXDELA if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with BAXDELA or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions that may occur together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of fluoroquinolones and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking BAXDELA immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.
Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue BAXDELA treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.
Peripheral Neuropathy: Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with BAXDELA use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue BAXDELA and tell them to contact their physician.
Central Nervous System Effects: (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to BAXDELA before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.
Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that BAXDELA can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue BAXDELA at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.
Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection: Inform patients to seek emergency medical care if they experience sudden chest, stomach, or back pain.
Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BAXDELA Tablets and Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When BAXDELA Tablets and BAXDELA Injection are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BAXDELA Tablets and BAXDELA Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established. AVELOX causes arthropathy in juvenile animals [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.9), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as AVELOX. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing AVELOX to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue AVELOX and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.2).]

In controlled multiple-dose clinical trials, 23% of patients receiving oral AVELOX were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 9% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of oral AVELOX in patients aged 65 or older compared to younger adults.

In trials of intravenous use, 42% of AVELOX patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 23% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that the safety of intravenous AVELOX in patients aged 65 or older was similar to that of comparator-treated patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Therefore, AVELOX should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia).

### Fluoroquinolone antibiotics and tendon injury in adolescents [^11218ZFe]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the association between fluoroquinolone use and tendon injury in adolescents.

Methods

We conducted an active-comparator, new-user cohort study using population-based claims data from 2000 to 2018. We included adolescents (aged 12–18 years) with an outpatient prescription fill for an oral fluoroquinolone or comparator broad-spectrum antibiotic. The primary outcome was Achilles, quadricep, patellar, or tibial tendon rupture identified by diagnosis and procedure codes. Tendinitis was a secondary outcome. We used weighting to adjust for measured confounding and a negative control outcome to assess residual confounding.

Results

The cohort included 4.4 million adolescents with 7.6 million fills for fluoroquinolone (275767 fills) or comparator (7365684) antibiotics. In the 90 days after the index antibiotic prescription, there were 842 tendon ruptures and 16750 tendinitis diagnoses (crude rates 0.47 and 9.34 per 1000 person-years, respectively). The weighted 90-day tendon rupture risks were 13.6 per 100000 fluoroquinolone-treated adolescents and 11.6 per 100000 comparator-treated adolescents (fluoroquinolone-associated excess risk: 1.9 per 100000 adolescents; 95% confidence interval -2.6 to 6.4); the corresponding number needed to treat to harm was 52632. For tendinitis, the weighted 90-day risks were 200.8 per 100000 fluoroquinolone-treated adolescents and 178.1 per 100000 comparator-treated adolescents (excess risk: 22.7 per 100000; 95% confidence interval 4.1 to 41.3); the number needed to treat to harm was 4405.

Conclusions

The excess risk of tendon rupture associated with fluoroquinolone treatment was extremely small, and these events were rare. The excess risk of tendinitis associated with fluoroquinolone treatment was also small. Other more common potential adverse drug effects may be more important to consider for treatment decision-making, particularly in adolescents without other risk factors for tendon injury.

Covariates

Baseline covariates were assessed during a 180-day baseline period before the index antibiotic prescription. Potential confounders of the association between antibiotic exposure and ADE outcomes were identified a priori based on clinical knowledge, and included age, sex, health insurance plan type, urban vs rural residence, geographic region, month and year of index, provider specialty, provider location, number of emergency department encounters, and number of unique medication therapeutic groups. Additional potential confounders incorporated into the expenditure analyses included mean monthly medical and prescription expenditures, number of office visits, frailty markers (eTable 7 in the Supplement), and comorbid conditions defined using the Elixhauser classification (eTable 8 in the Supplement).

Data analyses were performed from August to November 2021. We used stabilized inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weights to balance treatment groups within each cohort with respect to potential confounding factors. We used logistic regression to estimate the propensity of appropriate (vs inappropriate) antibiotic agent, conditional on baseline covariates. Propensity scores were used to create weighted cohorts to estimate the treatment effects in the total population, ie, the average treatment effect (eMethods in the Supplement). We assessed the balance of observed covariates between treatment groups; absolute standardized mean differences of less than 10% in the weighted population were considered adequate.

To examine the association between inappropriate antibiotic agents and each ADE outcome, we used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate unadjusted and weighted hazard ratios (HRs). We used robust variance estimators to calculate 95% CIs. Children were censored at the end of the outcome-specific follow-up period, end of continuous coverage, subsequent antibiotic prescription for a different agent (eTable 5 in the Supplement), hospitalization, or end of study (December 31, 2018). We selected tendinopathy (including tendon rupture) as a negative control outcome because it is known to be causally unrelated to the exposure (ie, nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics commonly prescribed to children to treat the infections of interest). Although fluoroquinolone antibiotics are associated with tendinopathy, fluoroquinolones are rarely prescribed to treat the pediatric conditions under study. Given the absence of a biologically plausible mechanism for nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics to cause tendinopathy, estimates of tendinopathy should be null in the absence of confounding.

PROQUIN®XR (pro-kwin)

(ciprofloxacin hydrochloride

extended-release) Tablets

Read the Medication Guide that comes with Proquin®XR before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Proquin XR?

Proquin®XR belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. Proquin®XR can cause side effects that may be serious or even cause death. If you get any of the following serious side effects, get medical help right away, and talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take Proquin®XR.

Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendonitis)

Tendons are the tough cords of tissue that connects muscles to bones.
Pain, swelling, inflammation of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites can happen in people of all ages who take fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including Proquin®XR. The risk of getting tendon problems is higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Swelling of the tendon (tendonitis) and tendon rupture (breakage) have also happened in patients who take fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors.
Other reasons for tendon ruptures include:
physical activity or exercise
kidney failure
tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Call your healthcare provider right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation. Stop taking Proquin®XR until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider. Avoid exercise and using the affected area. The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons. Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of Proquin®XR. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking Proquin®XR. Tendon ruptures have happened up to several months after patients have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
bruising right after an incident in a tendon area
unable to move the affected area or bear weight
See the section " What are the possible side effects of Proquin XR? " for more information about side effects.

### Ciprofloxacin tablets (ciprofloxacin) [^112NPsN7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone use:

- Disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that may occur together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of ciprofloxacin tablets and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.

- **Tendinitis and tendon rupture**: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue ciprofloxacin tablets treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.

### Fluoroquinolone use and risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection: nationwide cohort study [^114JGS1z]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Fluoroquinolones remain among the most commonly used antibiotics globally, and about 30 million outpatient prescriptions for fluoroquinolones are issued per year in the United States alone. Fluoroquinolone use is associated with an increased risk of tendon disorders, including Achilles tendon rupture and tendinopathy. The mechanisms behind these adverse events, which are recognised in a boxed warning, are thought to implicate non-antimicrobial properties of fluoroquinolones. These antibiotics have been shown to induce degradation of collagen and other structural components of the extracellular matrix by stimulating the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, reduce de novo production of collagen, and induce oxidative stress in tendon cells.

Rupture and dissection of the aorta are life threatening medical emergencies that need prompt intervention, often involving surgery. The integrity of the human aorta heavily depends on an intact extracellular matrix, and the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysm is known to involve excessive tissue breakdown through matrix metalloproteinases. Two recent observational studies have raised concern that fluoroquinolone antibiotics could increase the risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection. Although limitations in study design have not resulted in firm conclusions, with both studies reporting more than a twofold increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection associated with fluoroquinolone exposure, these data have prompted the European Medicines Agency to initiate a safety assessment.

We conducted a nationwide, register based cohort study in Sweden to investigate the risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection, comparing treatment episodes of fluoroquinolone use with episodes of amoxicillin use.

### The incidence of collagen-associated adverse events in pediatric population with the use of fluoroquinolones: a nationwide cohort study in Taiwan [^115YzBTb]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Fluoroquinolones are highly effective antimicrobial agents with the following advantages: a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity, ideal bioavailability, both oral and intravenous formulations, high serum levels and a large volume of distribution. These advantages increase the FQs usage in a wide variety of infectious diseases, including skin and respiratory infections for adults. However; the post-marketing surveillance data indicates that FQs may cause subsequent collagen-associated adverse events. Since year 2008, the U.S. FDA has declared several warnings about the association of FQs with disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system in succession. Additionally, due to the toxic effects observed from juvenile animals treated with FQs, the use of FQ-related drugs became rather limited in pediatric population. Only ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of inhalation anthrax, complicated UTIs, and pyelonephritis in children aged 1 to 17 years old. Furthermore, with the overuse of antimicrobial agents in clinical practice, the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is rising in Taiwan. To overcome the surge of drug resistant issues, the use of FQs is also increasing. To evaluate the safety issue of FQs, it is necessary for us to investigate serious collagen-associated adverse events in pediatric population.

### Ciprofloxacin-induced tendinopathy of the gluteal tendons [^117XAf9H]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy most commonly affects the Achilles tendon; however, involvement of several other tendons has been described. This is a case report of ciprofloxacin-induced tendinopathy of the gluteal tendons with MRI findings. An obese 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history was diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis and was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. Shortly after her first dose of ciprofloxacin, she developed severe left hip pain and decreased range of motion. MRI of the hips showed bilateral tendinopathy of the gluteal muscle insertion. A diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced tendinopathy was made based on her MRI and a Naranjo score of 7. Ciprofloxacin was stopped and her pain quickly resolved. Fluoroquinolones cause tendinopathy in 0.14% to 0.4% of patients using these agents. Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy is a serious adverse reaction that can affect many tendons and should be considered in any patient presenting with new musculoskeletal complaints and in whom there is a history of fluoroquinolone use within the preceding 6 months.

### Ciprofloxacin safety in paediatrics: a systematic review [^116m22n5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Controlled studies

Only two studies estimated the risk of development of arthropathy in paediatric patients receiving ciprofloxacin compared to a control group. A prospective cohort study of 264 cases and 249 controls matched for age and presence of cystic fibrosis, followed up patients for 15 days after the last dose of treatment. An estimated crude OR for musculoskeletal AEs in the fluoroquinolone group (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and perfloxacin) compared to other antibiotics was 9.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 195, p = 0.02). Considering cystic fibrosis patients alone within the same study (approximately 90 patients in each group), the OR for musculoskeletal AEs in the fluoroquinolone group compared to other antibiotics was 1.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 35, p = 0.99). The ORs estimated were not adjusted for possible influence of age and sex.

Second, a retrospective cohort study using a pharmacy database of patients exposed to fluoroquinolones and azithromycin, checked for potential joint or tendon disorder diagnosed within 60 days of exposure to drug. The joint or tendon disorders were verified from medical records of the patients by three blinded specialists. The study had over 4500 patients receiving ciprofloxacin and over 1500 patients receiving ofloxacin compared to over 15 000 patients receiving azithromycin. The estimated RR for verified tendon or joint disorder for ciprofloxacin was 1.04 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.51) and for ofloxacin was 1.04 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.84). The age and sex adjusted RR were 1.08 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.58) for ciprofloxacin and 1.13 (95% CI 0.63 to 2.03) for ofloxacin.

Safety data of all randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials and cohort studies in our review were pooled together. Analysis of 23 controlled studies (7 controlled studies were excluded because ciprofloxacin or another fluoroquinolone was administered in the comparator arm) comprising 6481 cases and 17 441 controls showed that there is a 57% increased risk of arthropathy in patients who received ciprofloxacin compared to the comparator arm (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97). Further analysis of five controlled studies that included only cystic fibrosis patients (227 cases and 391 controls) estimated a 67% increased risk of arthropathy (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.45).

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^112SVy45]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous research showed the relationship between BMI, body weight or waist circumference and tendon pathology. The hypothesis of this relationship is primarily based on the fact that the absolute tendon load is increased and that increased cytokine levels (Prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor-α and Leukotriene B4) cause low-grade inflammation in obese individuals. In our systematic review, we were not able to find an association between being overweight and AT. It should be noted that more than half of the cohort studies that investigated BMI as a risk factor were in adolescent populations, in which being overweight is less common. Arnoczky and colleagues hypothesised based on an animal model that being underweight is associated with AT, as a consequence of a catabolic state causing a decreased collagen production. This could lead to a U-shaped relationship for the BMI and AT, making it less likely that an association be found. More cohort studies are needed in heterogeneous populations.

Another striking finding is the limited evidence for the absence of an association between physical activity level and AT. Inconclusive results regarding physical activity level were previously also demonstrated in patellar tendinopathy. In the majority of the scientific literature, tendinopathy is described as 'overuse injury'. It could be that 'overuse' or 'physical activity level' is not measured accurately enough to detect associations. It could also be hypothesised that a sudden change in load is more important than the absolute load that is currently being measured in studies. To date, there is, however, no convincing evidence that AT is a result of overuse.

Moderate alcohol use and increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease were potential risk factors for AT. It is hard to hypothesise why these determinants are risk factors for AT. They might be a confounding factor, with lifestyle factors that influence AT risk. Another reason might be that these findings have been detected by chance. When a high number of analyses are performed, the chance of statistical significance findings increases. Adequate statistical methods can prevent possible coincidental findings. Another potential risk factor that is lacking a clear explanation is training during cold weather. The direct cause-effect relationship is not known, as the results might be influenced by temperature or type of surface. This particular study did not report information on the temperature or training surface during the training period. These results are therefore difficult to extrapolate.

### Comparative safety profile of levofloxacin in 2523 children with a focus on four specific musculoskeletal disorders [^112gqhX2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have not been recommended for use in children largely because studies in juvenile laboratory animals suggest there may be an increased risk of fluoroquinolone-associated cartilage lesions. A large prospective trial is needed to assess the risks associated with using levofloxacin in children.

Objective

Assess the safety and tolerability of levofloxacin therapy in children based on observations for 1 year after therapy.

Methods

Safety data were collected in children who participated in 1 of 3 efficacy trials (N = 2523) and a subset of these children who also subsequently participated in a long-term 1-year surveillance trial (N = 2233). Incidence of adverse events in children randomized to receive levofloxacin versus nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics was compared. Based on assessments by treating physicians and an independent data safety monitoring committee, events related to the musculoskeletal system were further categorized as 1 of 4 predefined musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, gait abnormality) considered most likely clinical correlates of fluoroquinolone-associated cartilage lesions observed in laboratory animals.

Results

Levofloxacin was well tolerated during and for 1 month after therapy as evidenced by similar incidence and character of adverse events compared with nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics. However, incidence of at least 1 of the 4 predefined musculoskeletal disorders (largely due to reports of arthralgia) was greater in levofloxacin-treated compared with nonfluoroquinolone-treated children at 2 months (2.1% vs. 0.9%; P = 0.04) and 12 months (3.4% vs. 1.8%; P = 0.03) after starting therapy.

Conclusions

The incidence of 1 or more of the 4 predefined musculoskeletal disorders identified in nonblinded, prospective evaluations, was statistically greater in levofloxacin-treated compared with comparator-treated children.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^116ocGJE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main findings

This is the first high-quality systematic review of clinical risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy. We identified 10 cohort studies, all of which had a high risk of bias and 45 cross-sectional studies.

There is limited evidence for the following nine risk factors: (1) prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, (2) use of ofloxacin antibiotics, (3) increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, (4) moderate alcohol use, (5) training during cold weather, (6) decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, (7) abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, (8) more lateral foot-roll over at the forefoot flat phase and (9) a creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min in heart transplant patients.

Although other potential risk factors such as body weight or BMI, static foot posture measurements and physical activity level are often said to be risk factors in clinical practice, there is currently no scientific evidence that they are associated with AT.

Clinical implications

Our systematic review indicates that for AT prevention and treatment, the advice to patients might include: (1) to reduce the use of alcohol to less than 7 units per week for men and less than 4 units for women, (2) to avoid the use of ofloxacin if alternatives are available and (3) to improve plantar flexor strength by performing strengthening exercises of the calf muscles.

Whether these interventions will be effective is unknown. For example, calf muscle exercises seem a plausible preventive intervention as decreased plantar flexor strength is a risk factor. However, eccentric calf muscle exercises did not decrease AT incidence in soccer players in a randomised trial. Further research is needed before we can state whether the logical interventions work or not.

Abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of the propulsion and a more lateral foot roll-over at the forefoot flat phase were found to be risk factors for AT in novice runners. Van Ginckel et al stated that more research is needed to confirm these findings, since this gait pattern with a decreased forward progression might be commonly used in well-trained athletes to improve gait economy. Since the gait pattern was determined barefoot, it is also not known whether these findings can be extrapolated to the running population, as running shoes might alter running gait. Biomechanical characteristics in AT are discussed in more detail in a recent systematic review.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^116aBxWs]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common problem, but its exact aetiology remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association between potential clinical risk factors and Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

The databases Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched up to February 2018.

Eligibility Criteria

To answer our research question, cohort studies investigating risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy in humans were included. We restricted our search to potential clinical risk factors (imaging studies were excluded).

Results

We included 10 cohort studies, all with a high risk of bias, from 5111 publications identified. There is limited evidence for nine risk factors: (1) prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, (2) use of ofloxacin (quinolone) antibiotics, (3) an increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, (4) moderate alcohol use, (5) training during cold weather, (6) decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, (7) abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, (8) more lateral foot roll-over at the forefoot flat phase and (9) creatinine clearance of < 60mL/min in heart transplant patients. Twenty-six other putative risk factors were not associated with Achilles tendinopathy, including being overweight, static foot posture and physical activity level.

Conclusion

From an ocean of studies with high levels of bias, we extracted nine clinical risk factors that may increase a person's risk of Achilles tendinopathy. Clinicians may consider ofloxacin use, alcohol consumption and a reduced plantar flexor strength as modifiable risk factors when treating patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^1155xXt4]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — etiology, presentation, and imaging highlight Achilles insertional pathology and retrocalcaneal bursitis. The posterior heel is the second most common location of mechanically induced heel pain, and pathology in this area is categorized as (1) Achilles insertional tendinopathy or enthesopathy, and (2) Haglund's deformity with or without retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles enthesopathy most commonly presents with an insidious onset and frequently leads to chronic posterior heel pain and swelling. Pain is aggravated by increased activity (eg, walking, running) and increased pressure caused by the shoe's heel counter. A palpable prominence may be appreciated both medially and laterally to the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Other proximal pathologies of the Achilles tendon must be ruled out. Achilles-related tendinopathy and rupture have also been related to fluoroquinolone use. Radiographic findings commonly show insertional proliferative spurring and/or erosion or intra-tendinous calcifications.

### Impact of FDA black box warning on fluoroquinolone and alternative antibiotic use in southeastern US hospitals [^116ttw6s]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

We analyzed antibiotic use data from 29 southeastern US hospitals over a 5-year period to determine changes in antibiotic use after the fluoroquinolone US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory update in 2016. Fluoroquinolone use declined both before and after the FDA announcement, and the use of select, alternative antibiotics increased after the announcement. Fluoroquinolones are among the 4 most commonly prescribed antibiotic classes.1,2 Postmarketing reports of serious adverse events linked to fluoroquinolones include tendonitis, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, psychiatric side effects, and possible aortic vessel rupture, leading to safety label changes in July 2008 and August 2013.3 In July 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strengthened the "black box" warning following an initial safety announcement in May 2016, recommending avoidance of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated infections such as acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, uncomplicated urinary tract infections, and acute bacterial sinusitis.4 Concerns over safety and the association with Clostridiodes difficile infection have led inpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) to develop initiatives to promote avoidance of quinolones. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the 2016 FDA "black box" update on inpatient antibiotic use among a cohort of southeastern US hospitals.

### BET 2: Do fluoroquinolones increase the incidence of tendinopathy? [^1149hATv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A shortcut review of the literature was carried out to establish whether the use of fluoroquinolones was associated with an increased risk of tendinopathy in adult patients. 10 trials were found to be directly relevant to the three-part question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that there is an association between the use of fluoroquinolones and a broad range of tendinopathies.

### Ciprofloxacin-associated bilateral iliopsoas tendon rupture: a case report [^116MdhFJ]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolone use is associated with the development of tendinopathy, most commonly affecting the Achilles tendon. Here we present the first reported case of bilateral iliopsoas tendon rupture associated with prolonged ciprofloxacin use. This older woman presented with non-traumatic, sudden onset hip pain which was diagnosed as a right iliopsoas rupture on MRI. Despite stopping ciprofloxacin, she went on to develop rupture of the contralateral iliopsoas tendon. This case highlights the time lag between fluoroquinolone use and susceptibility to this rare but important complication.

### Fluoroquinolone-mediated achilles rupture: a case report and review of the literature [^117AGgzY]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolone use for the treatment of bacterial infections is a common practice for foot and ankle surgeons because of its rather broad-spectrum coverage against common pathogens, good tissue penetration, and high bioavailability. An associated risk of tendinopathy has been reported in published studies, although tendon rupture has been much less frequent. In addition, tendinopathy has been more commonly reported with earlier generations of fluoroquinolones. We present a case of levofloxacin-mediated Achilles rupture that was complicated by the presence of an infected hematoma and abscess and subsequent long-term postoperative follow-up data, with a review of the literature.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^116a7Qcv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There is a lack of high-quality prospective studies investigating risk factors for AT. We found limited evidence for nine determinants as risk factor for Achilles tendinopathy: a history of lower limb injury, season of training, calf muscle strength, gait analysis parameters, moderate alcohol use, fluoroquinolone antibiotic treatment and suboptimal renal function in a specific heart transplant population. Research funding agencies should prioritise research into modifiable determinants as these could prove useful for AT prevention and treatment. Quality studies will use valid clinical examination (focal Achilles tendon pain in relation to load with impaired load-bearing capacity) as outcomes, valid and reliable risk factor measurements and adequate statistical analysis in heterogeneous populations.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is considered to be an overuse injury. However, the exact aetiology remains unclear.
The disorder is most frequently seen in runners and running sports in the age range from 30 years old to 60 years old.
Being overweight, chronic diseases that affect tendon quality (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or hypercholesterolaemia), the use of fluoroquinolones or statins, a reduced plantar flexor strength and a reduced ankle dorsiflexion are generally considered to be risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy. To date, conclusive evidence is missing.

What are the new findings

There is a lack of high-quality studies regarding risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy.
Ten cohort studies were identified, all with a high risk of bias.
There is limited evidence for nine determinants as risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy: (1) prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, (2) use of ofloxacin antibiotics, (3) increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, (4) moderate alcohol use, (5) training during cold weather, (6) decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, (7) an abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, (8) more lateral foot roll-over at the forefoot flat phase and (9) creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min in heart transplant patients.

### Diplopia and fluoroquinolones [^116mDXUt]. Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a possible association between fluoroquinolones and diplopia.

Design

Database study.

Participants

A total of 171 subjects were studied.

Methods

Spontaneous reports from the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects, World Health Organization, and Food and Drug Administration were collected on fluoroquinolones and diplopia.

Main Outcome Measures

Data garnered from the spontaneous reports include the type of fluoroquinolone, age, gender, adverse drug reaction (ADR), dosage, duration of therapy until onset of ADR, concomitant drugs, other systemic disease, and dechallenge and rechallenge data.

Results

A total of 171 case reports of diplopia associated with fluoroquinolones were reported, including 76 men, 91 women, and 4 case reports in which the gender was not specified. The median age was 51.6 years. Dosage varied between the different fluoroquinolone drugs, with the median dosage within the range recommended in the package insert for each different fluoroquinolone. Median time from beginning of therapy to appearance of the ADR was 9.6 days (range 1 day to 5 months). Seventeen subjects also had concomitant tendinitis, 49 patients were 60 years or older, 1 patient had renal cysts, and 4 patients were taking systemic anti-inflammatory steroids. There were 53 positive dechallenge and 5 positive rechallenge case reports.

Conclusions

According to World Health Organization criteria, the relationship between fluoroquinolone therapy and diplopia is "possible". This causality assessment is based on the time relationship of drug administration and ADR development, the multiple positive dechallenge and rechallenge reports, and the plausible mechanism by which diplopia could occur: possible tendinitis of the extraocular muscles.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^112JjBCh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy in acute diarrheal infections (adults) — indications and comparative evidence: Antibiotics should be used for cases of dysentery and moderate-to-severe traveler's diarrhea where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence), and use of antibiotics for community-acquired diarrhea should be discouraged as most community-acquired diarrhea is viral and is not shortened by antibiotics (Strong recommendation, very low level evidence). For travelers' diarrhea, the evidence for the use of anti-microbial therapy is strongly supported, with antibiotics shortening the overall duration of moderate-to-severe TD to a little over 24h and reducing time to last unformed stool by 1–3 days compared with no therapy or placebo; combination of an antibiotic with loperamide further shortens duration of illness. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin have been the primary antibiotics of choice, but resistance — particularly among Campylobacter — means the use of macrolides such as azithromycin for treatment is recommended, and azithromycin was shown to be more effective than ciprofloxacin for all cases of TD in travelers to Thailand. For all antibiotics, either single-dose therapy or treatment for up to 3 days is usually sufficient; studies show that once daily therapy is as effective as 3-day therapies for TD due to noninvasive pathogens, and a 3-day therapy is recommended for patients presenting with fever or dysentery. Short-course fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotic use has demonstrated risks of development of Clostridium difficile infection and risks for tendinopathies and arthropathies.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking levofloxacin if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with levofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions That May Occur Together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of levofloxacin and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking levofloxacin immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.

Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue levofloxacin treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.

### Levofloxacin-associated achilles tendon rupture [^112iMnvd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of levofloxacin-induced partial Achilles tendon rupture; this occurred in the presence of known risk factors and acute renal failure.

Case Summary

A 79-year-old white man received levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia, developed acute renal failure in the setting of dehydration, and began having ankle pain on the 12th day of admission. Levofloxacin was discontinued, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 6-cm partial tear and degenerative changes.

Discussion

The Naranjo probability scale indicates a possible association between levofloxacin and tendon rupture because the event occurred in the setting of known risk factors such as steroid use, renal failure, older age, and male gender.

Conclusions

Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, may cause Achilles tendon rupture, and this may be particularly likely with known risk factors.

Medication

Fluoroquinolones

There is limited evidence that the use of ofloxacin is associated with AT. One cohort study found an increased risk to develop AT when using ofloxacin compared with other antibiotic drugs (without fluoroquinolones). This cohort study found no associations for fluoroquinolones as a group, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Another cohort study found no association between levofloxacin use and AT specifically in heart transplant patients compared with no use of levofloxacin.

Corticosteroids

There is limited evidence that daily oral prednisone dose is not associated with AT based on one cohort study.

Training factors

Training season

There is limited evidence that training during cold weather is associated with AT. One cohort study found that the incidence of AT increased during recruit winter training compared with summer training.

Potential risk factors evaluated in cross-sectional studies

In the 45 cross-sectional studies, 296 risk factors were investigated. One hundred and fifteen associations were found, mostly consisting of biomechanical factors (56 associations) or genetic factors (30 associations). All data are presented in online supplementary appendix 2.

### Fluoroquinolones and the risk of achilles tendon disorders: update on a neglected complication [^115DGZVH]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the current evidence and to identify associated risk factors that increase the incidence of this complication. Fluoroquinolone (FQ) has been considered the first-line therapy for uncomplicated urinary infections. FQ has been associated with Achilles tendon disorders, especially during the first month of treatment.

Methods

Data sources searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus from January 1988 to June 2017.

Results

A total of 79 articles were used, with ciprofloxacin representing the most common drug.

Conclusion

We found that male gender, advanced age, normal body mass index, chronic renal failure, and concurrent use of corticosteroids increase the risk of Achilles tendon disorders.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis are discouraged due to safety risks. The use of fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, for prophylactic antibiotic use is not recommended in current clinical practice. In 2008, the FDA issued a black box warning on the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture associated with ciprofloxacin. These serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone use, which also include QT interval prolongation, seizures, and C. difficile infection, generally outweigh the benefits of its use for localized UTI.

### FDA calls for boxed warning for fluoroquinolones… [^116wDbar]. publications.aap.org (2008). Low credibility.

A recent Food and Drug Administration analysis reconfirmed an increased risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture in patients taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which will be required to carry a boxed warning. Concomitant steroid treatment may increase this risk. The Achilles tendon is the most common location for this problem, but other tendons also may be affected. Two fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, have been studied and approved for use in children with serious infections. Both agents are indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Ciprofloxacin also is approved for complicated urinary tract infections. In pediatric trials, an increased risk of musculoskeletal adverse events was observed in children receiving levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin compared to non-fluoroquinolone therapy.

Other possible serious adverse events reported with fluoroquinolones include convulsions, hallucinations, neuropathy and QT prolongation. Due to these concerns and the potential for musculoskeletal adverse.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Click here to enter Warnings and Precautions

5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting ciprofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Spontaneous simultaneous bilateral patellar tendon rupture [^1163isZd]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Bilateral patellar tendon rupture is an extremely rare occurrence, especially in otherwise healthy individuals without systemic disease. The authors report the case of a man who presented with simultaneous, spontaneous bilateral rupture of his patellar tendons. He had a history of unilateral patellar tendinopathy but no other predisposing risk factors such as steroid or fluoroquinolone use. He underwent surgical repair and following intensive rehabilitation, he returned to baseline physical activity 6months post injury.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting levofloxacin or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid levofloxacin in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of levofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^112fU8aH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study designed to assess the risk of adverse events associated with starting a higher- vs lower-dose fluoroquinolone prescription in patients with advanced CKD not receiving dialysis. The study was conducted in the setting of usual clinical care. It included a representative sample of older adults with advanced CKD in Ontario, Canada, where all residents 66 years and older have universal prescription drug coverage. We were able to produce comparison groups that were balanced on 147 baseline characteristics after using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We conducted several sensitivity analyses, and all results supported the main findings.

This study also has some limitations. First, although we used a robust statistical technique to control for confounding by indication and the results were consistent in sensitivity analyses, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. The e-values for the lower confidence bound for the primary outcome were small, which implies that little unmeasured confounding would be needed to reduce the observed association or its 95% CI to the null. Second, despite the use of highly accurate information on fluoroquinolone dispensing, administrative data cannot provide information on the proportion of patients who took their pills as prescribed. Third, we studied patients 66 years and older with advanced CKD, so our findings may not apply to younger patients or those receiving dialysis. Fourth, we examined renally excreted fluoroquinolones as a class, and there were too few prescriptions to perform independent analyses by fluoroquinolone type. Fifth, fluoroquinolone dosing can vary with the type of infection (eTable 1B in the Supplement); however, we could not perform subgroup analysis by infection type owing to small sample sizes. Sixth, misclassification of some study outcomes is expected for codes with low sensitivity, which would also underestimate the number of events (eTable 8 in the Supplement); however, differential misclassification between exposure groups is unlikely. Seventh, the small number of collagen-associated events and other tendinopathies precluded further analysis of these outcomes. Eighth, 926 of 11 917 patients (7.7%) had an eGFR of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m², and this small sample precluded any meaningful comparisons between CKD stages. Ninth, much of the data regarding adverse effects are derived from passive reporting systems and small observational studies, which are prone to confounding. Therefore, we chose to include adverse events reported in population-based drug safety studies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials and observational studies that resulted in FDA safety warnings. Although we believe that this algorithm for identifying fluoroquinolone-related adverse events is highly specific and robust, we may have missed some outcomes reported in case reports or pharmacovigilance reporting systems and some adverse events that did not result in safety warnings. Last, the magnitude of the risk and fragility of the statistical significance of many of the results may compromise the clinical relevance of our findings. Our study had 80% power to detect a relative risk increase of at least 58% for the primary outcome based on a feasibility analysis results. Although our study requires replication before definitive conclusions can be reached, the magnitude of the risk will likely be small. We did not consider fluoroquinolone effectiveness in this study, and in some cases, physicians may decide to prescribe a higher-dose fluoroquinolone because the potential benefits outweigh the risk.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^113vi38m]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy — risk factors: A systematic review included 10 cohort studies and identified 9 risk factors comprising prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, use of ofloxacin (quinolone) antibiotics, increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, moderate alcohol use, training during cold weather, decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, more pressure on the lateral side of the plantar surface of the foot while running, and creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min in heart transplant patients. The review noted that 26 other commonly identified risk factors were not associated with Achilles tendinopathy, including being overweight, abnormal static foot posture, and physical activity level, and concluded there remains a high risk of bias making definitive clinical recommendations difficult, though quinolone treatment, alcohol consumption, and ankle plantar flexor strength are modifiable factors that may be useful for patient education purposes.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting levofloxacin or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid levofloxacin in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of levofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin hydrochloride. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue moxifloxacin tablets and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In controlled multiple-dose clinical trials, 23% of patients receiving oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 9% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients aged 65 or older compared to younger adults.

In trials of intravenous use, 42% of moxifloxacin hydrochloride patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 23% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that the safety of intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients aged 65 or older was similar to that of comparator-treated patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Therefore, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.5), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Adverse events for common urinary tract infection (UTI) antibiotics — Nitrofurantoin has reported adverse event rates of 5%–34% and should be avoided if CrCl < 30 mL/min, with pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity risk with long-term use. TMP-SMX has adverse event rates of 1.4%–38%, with hyperkalemia and AKI more likely with TMP-SMX use in patients taking ACE inhibitors and potassium supplements, and hemolysis can occur with G6PD deficiency. Fosfomycin has adverse event rates of 5.3%–8%, with half-life of single dose 30–40 h and serious adverse events rare. Ciprofloxacin has adverse event rates of 4%–28%, and risk of use outweighs benefit if an alternative is available; tendinopathy risk is increased if age > 60 y, with corticosteroid use, or prior heart, kidney, and lung transplant. β-Lactams have adverse event rates of 10%–27% and, compared with other UTI antimicrobials, typically have inferior efficacy and more adverse effects and are associated with higher risk of collateral damage including ESBL selection, multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

### Levofloxacin-induced tendinopathy of the hip [^1123x5nN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe what we believe to be the first reported possible case of tendinopathy of the hip in a patient receiving levofloxacin.

Case Summary

A 58-year-old male with recurrent otitis media was admitted for left lateral hip pain of 10 on a scale of 10. He had started a 5-day course of levofloxacin 750 mg/day 10 days before he began experiencing pain. He also took simvastatin 20 mg/day and walked 90 minutes each day. He was treated with oxycodone with acetaminophen and physical therapy. His pain had improved significantly at a 10-day recheck.

Discussion

Fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy has been well-reported in the literature, but most cases involve pefloxacin and affect the Achilles tendon. Only 11 cases of tendinopathy have been reported with levofloxacin based on a MEDLINE search (1966-December 2011). This is the first known case reported that involved tendinopathy of the hip believed to be caused by fluoroquinolones. The Naranjo probability scale revealed a possible adverse reaction of levofloxacin-induced tendinopathy of the hip. Contributing factors likely included the high dose of levofloxacin, concomitant use of a statin, and strenuous physical activity.

Conclusions

Health care professionals should be aware of the possibility of tendinopathy of the hip in patients who receive fluoroquinolones. Thorough history for possible risk factors should be obtained. Patients on fluoroquinolones at risk for tendinopathy should be counseled to avoid strenuous physical activity.

### Fluoroquinolone-induced serious, persistent, multisymptom adverse effects [^113TYMbc]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We present a case series of four previously healthy, employed adults without significant prior medical history in each of whom symptoms developed while on fluoroquinolones (FQs), with progression that continued following discontinuation evolving to a severe, disabling multisymptom profile variably involving tendinopathy, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorder, cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disturbance. Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential for FQ-induced severe disabling multisymptom pathology that may persist and progress following FQ use. Known induction by FQs of delayed mitochondrial toxicity provides a compatible mechanism, with symptom profiles (and documented mechanisms of FQ toxicity) compatible with the hypothesis of an exposure-induced mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy.

Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur (see Boxed Warning, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Adverse Events).

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin tablets with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia).

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Avelox) [^112Z95RX]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. AVELOX should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3).]

5.2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid AVELOX in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)].

WARNINGS

Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects:

Fluoroquinolones, including FACTIVE have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting FACTIVE. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions (See WARNINGS, Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy and Central Nervous System Effects).

Discontinue FACTIVE immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including FACTIVE, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Fluoroquinolones, including FACTIVE, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days after starting FACTIVE, or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

### Quinolone-related achilles tendinopathy in heart transplant patients: incidence and risk factors [^114ipGhE]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A high incidence of Achilles tendinopathy — tendinitis or rupture — has been observed after quinolone treatment in lung and kidney transplant patients. In the absence of relevant published data, we aimed to determine its incidence, clinical features, risk factors and outcome among heart graft recipients.

Methods

We studied the clinical records of all adult heart transplant patients who were prescribed quinolones at our center between August 1995 and September 2006. Achilles tendinopathy had been diagnosed clinically, with ultrasound assessment when necessary. In all cases, quinolone treatment had been terminated upon diagnosis of tendinopathy.

Results

During this period, quinolones had been given on 242 occasions to 149 heart transplant patients (33 women, 116 men). Achilles tendinopathy developed on 14 occasions (5.8%; 95% confidence interval: 2.8% to 8.7%), affecting 13 men and 1 woman (mean age: 62 years). Three cases involved tendon rupture, and bilateral tendinopathy was present in 8 cases. The median time between the start of treatment and onset of symptoms was 2.5 days, with 12 patients being asymptomatic 2 months after drug withdrawal. Independent risk factors for tendinopathy were renal dysfunction (p = 0.03) and increased time between transplantation and treatment (p = 0.005). Incidence was not influenced by the type, dose or previous administration of quinolones, or by the immunosuppressive regimen.

Conclusions

Quinolone-related Achilles tendinopathy is frequent among heart transplant patients, especially in the presence of renal dysfunction or lengthy post-transplantation survival. If no alternative anti-bacterial therapy is available for high-risk patients, close clinical surveillance should be warranted.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115eFngi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Population-based data are needed to inform the safe prescribing of fluoroquinolone antibiotics to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

To quantify the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event in patients with advanced CKD newly prescribed a fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2008, to March 17, 2020) used linked health care data to identify new users of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Participants included adults 66 years or older with advanced CKD (an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 but not receiving dialysis). Data analysis was performed from January 1 to April 30, 2021.

Exposures

A new prescription for a higher-dose fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 501–1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, 501–750 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 401–800 mg/d) vs a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 500 mg/d; levofloxacin, 250–500 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 400 mg/d).

Main Outcomes and Measure

The primary outcome was the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event. Secondary outcomes included a hospital visit with sepsis, retinal detachment or other tendinopathies, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and sudden cardiac death. Inverse probability of treatment weighting on the propensity score was used to balance comparison groups on baseline health. Weighted risk ratios and risk differences were obtained using modified Poisson regression and binomial regression, respectively.

Results

Of 11 917 patients (median age, 83 years [IQR, 77–89 years]; 7438 women [62.4%]; median eGFR, 25 [IQR, 21–28] mL/min/1.73 m2) included in the analysis, 5482 (46.0%) received a higher-dose and 6435 (54.0%) received a lower-dose fluoroquinolone. After weighting, the primary composite outcome-a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event-occurred in 68 of 5482 patients (1.2%) treated with a higher-dose fluoroquinolone and in 47 of 5516 (0.9%) treated with a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (weighted risk ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.01–2.08]; weighted risk difference, 0.39% [95% CI, 0.01%-0.76%]). The risk of sepsis, retinal detachment, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and sudden cardiac death did not differ significantly between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that older patients with advanced CKD who were prescribed a fluoroquinolone at a higher-than-recommended dose were significantly more likely to experience the composite outcome of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event, although the absolute risk of these events was less than 2%.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride [^117R1ods]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)].

5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of ciprofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1, 6.2)].

### Fluoroquinolone use and risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection: nationwide cohort study [^115acxHr]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Our findings suggest that the magnitude of the association between fluoroquinolones and aortic aneurysm, when assessed in a risk period longer than the common duration of a treatment course (usually 7–14 days), might not be as pronounced as indicated by these two previous studies. The studies both reported more than a twofold increase in risk (although confidence intervals between our and the other studies are overlapping). Our results also indicate that the association could be largely driven by aneurysm, and not dissection.

Furthermore, our study provides some degree of characterisation of the timing of this association, suggesting that the risk associated with fluoroquinolones might be most pronounced in the first 10 days after start of treatment; this would correspond to when treatment is ongoing. If the association is causal, these data indicate that a potential mechanism is relatively acute in onset, largely waning after treatment cessation. Consistent with this finding, the risk of Achilles tendon disorders is highest in the first 15–30 days following start of fluoroquinolone treatment. Lending some support to the possibility of a mechanism with acute onset, experimental studies in tendon cells have found that several matrix metalloproteinases, which are known to degrade critical components of the extracellular matrix, are promptly up regulated following exposure to ciprofloxacin. Although a mechanism implicating matrix metalloproteinases has been proposed to be involved in the association between fluoroquinolones and aortic aneurysm, and metalloproteinases are known to have a role in the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysm, future experimental work will have to determine how fluoroquinolones interact with the aorta.

Our study supports the notion that fluoroquinolone use could be associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection. Before these results are used to guide clinical decision making, the collective body of data on this safety issue should be scrutinised by drug regulatory authorities and weighed, together with other safety issues with this drug class, against the benefits of treatment; this will support appropriate clinical treatment recommendations.

### Analysis of pooled phase 3 safety data for delafloxacin in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^115HQ7rx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Despite some challenges with the class, persistent efforts have been made over the years to produce quinolones with superior antimicrobial properties enabled by the understanding of how molecular modification of the core quinolone structure affect the antimicrobial agent's activity progressed rapidly. With the advent of newer agents, FQ prescribing increased 3-fold in the United States from 1995 to 2002 as they became the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults by 2002.

With such widespread use and overuse came the recognition of a range of risks and AEs that were associated with the class. In 2008, the FDA issued a black box warning for tendon rupture and most recently, in 2016, required changes to the label for all oral and injectable FQs, including a boxed warning related to disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.

### Acute patellar tendon ruptures: an update on management [^1171Dmkh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Several risk factors for acute patellar tendon rupture have been reported. Systemic medical conditions that compromise tendon integrity, such as connective tissue disorders, chronic renal failure, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, as well as corticosteroid use increase the risk of tendon rupture. Although the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning of elevated risk of tendon rupture after use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, several studies have shown that tendon rupture after fluoroquinolone exposure is rare and not clinically meaningful. Increasing age and black race have also been identified as risk factors in the military population. For local factors, intratendinous corticosteroid injection is believed to stimulate bony or adipose formation within the patellar tendon, predisposing it to rupture. However, there are limited data or case reports of this related to the patellar tendon specifically. Another local risk factor involves repeated overuse and microtrauma, particularly in jumping athletes, which can lead to patellar tendinopathy. This is otherwise known as "jumper's knee" and may predispose to partial or complete rupture.ln the general population, the reported incidence of patellar tendon ruptures ranges between 0.48 and 1.09 per 100,000 person-years. However, in the active military population, the incidence reaches as high as six per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of the injury is reported to be increasing and can potentially be explained by a more active aging population.

### Tendon or joint disorders in children after treatment with fluoroquinolones or azithromycin [^114W8ZQQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been infrequently used in children, largely because of concern that these agents can cause lesions of the cartilage in juvenile animals. However, the relevance of this laboratory observation to children treated with FQs is unknown. A retrospective, observational study was conducted to assess the incidence and relative risk of tendon or joint disorders (TJDs) that occur after use of selected FQs compared with azithromycin (AZ), a drug with no known effect on cartilage or tendons in humans or animals.

Methods

An automated database was searched to identify patients younger than 19 years who had been prescribed ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPX), or AZ. Potential cases of TJD occurring within 60 days of a prescription of one of the study drugs were identified based on assignment of a claims diagnosis consistent with a TJD within this period. Verified cases were identified by a blinded review of abstracts of medical records from subjects identified as potential cases.

Results

The incidence of verified TJD was 0.82% for OFX (13 of 1593) and CPX (37 of 4531) and was 0.78% for AZ (118 of 15,073). The relative risk of TJD for OFX and CPX compared with AZ was 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.84) and 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.51), respectively. The distributions of claims diagnoses and time to onset of TJD were comparable for all groups. The most frequently reported category of TJD involved the joint followed by tendon, cartilage and gait disorder.

Conclusions

In this observational study involving more than 6000 FQ-treated children, the incidence of TJD associated with selected FQ use in children was < 1% and was comparable with that of the reference group, children treated with AZ.

### Safety concerns with fluoroquinolones [^111AeJuH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the chemistry, pharmacology, and safety of fluoroquinolones.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-July 2007) was conducted using the key words fluoroquinolones or quinolones with safety, adverse effects, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, dysglycemia, QTc prolongation, torsades, seizures, phototoxicity, tendon rupture, Clostridium difficile, and pseudomembranous colitis for articles published in the English language.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Medicinal chemistry, in vitro, animal, and human trials were reviewed for information on the chemistry, pharmacology, and safety of each fluoroquinolone. Clinical trials were reviewed and included to compare the safety of systemic fluoroquinolones on the market. Literature on the pathology of serious adverse effects was also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Gatifloxacin has been shown to increase the risk of hospitalization for dysglycemia in patients with and without diabetes. Hyperglycemia may occur with any fluoroquinolone, especially if not properly dose adjusted. Hypoglycemia may occur with any fluoroquinolone and has a higher frequency in patients receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin. Use of any fluoroquinolone should be avoided in patients with risk factors for QTc interval prolongation or tendinopathy. All fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorders and may cause phototoxicity or C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of possible alterations in blood glucose, QTc interval prolongation, seizures, phototoxicity, tendinopathy, or CDAD with the use of any fluoroquinolone, especially in patients with other risk factors for these conditions. Clinicians should closely monitor for these adverse effects and appropriately adjust doses to minimize these risks. To provide safe treatment for patients needing antibiotic therapy, an assessment of the risk-benefit ratio may be warranted in the decision to use a fluoroquinolone.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (ciprofloxacin) [^114zq1c1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### The incidence of collagen-associated adverse events in pediatric population with the use of fluoroquinolones: a nationwide cohort study in Taiwan [^112ewo8f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are effective antimicrobial agents by directly inhibiting the process of bacterial DNA synthesis. With the broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage, they are widely used in bacterial infections, like acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections for adults. In addition to the strength of broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage, other advantages, such as high oral bioavailability, large volume of distribution, ideal tissue penetration and long-lasting medicine, make FQs a favorable choice in treating infectious diseases.

However, FQs are not the first choice in clinical guideline for treating infectious diseases, since they have been reported to be associated with collagen degradation, which may lead to severe and detrimental adverse effects like tendon ruptures, retinal detachments, gastrointestinal tract perforation, even aortic aneurysms in adults. FQs were previously found to cause apoptotic changes in extracellular matrix and significantly decrease collagen type I and the β1-integrin receptors. Collagen defects-related tissue damages are found not only in tendons, but also tissues composed of collagen, such as aortic wall, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and retina. All of these findings attribute to the cause of collagen-associated adverse effects. To alarm the risks of adverse effects of FQs, the U.S. FDA declared several warnings containing potential tendinitis, tendon ruptures, and even irreversible peripheral neuropathy.

WARNINGS

Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture: Fluoroquinolones, including Proquin XR, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Proquin XR should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non- quinolone antimicrobial drug.

### Increase in the community circulation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli despite reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [^112vYpyG]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones (FQ) had been, for many years, the most often prescribed antibiotics for UTI treatment and, commonly, for other infections. Against E. coli infections resistant to FQ and other antibiotics, third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) are commonly used. Wide use of FQ has led to the documentation of several concerning side effects, including neurotoxicity and tendinopathy, as well as the development of Clostridiodides difficile infections –. Most importantly, in the last two decades, there has been a rampant rise in FQ-resistant E. coli (FQREC) causing extra-intestinal infections and the FQREC occurrence has been strongly associated with the rates of hospitalization and mortality from sepsis. The FQREC occurrence being strongly associated with the rates of hospitalization and mortality from sepsis. The non-susceptibility to FQ is primarily associated with chromosomal point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) coding the main targets of FQ — bacterial DNA topoisomerases GyrA (residues S83 and D87) and ParC (residues S80 and E84). A set of at least three QRDR mutations — at both positions 83 and 87 in GyrA and position 80 in ParC — typically results in the highest resistance level. The FQR phenotype is also mediated by mobile, i.e. transferrable, elements, including chromosome-located transposons, insertion sequences, genomic islands, and, most often, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. Genes carried on mobile genetic elements are also primarily responsible for resistance to 3GC, mostly mediated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL).

### Ciprofloxacin safety in paediatrics: a systematic review [^114TBmXH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review about the safety of ciprofloxacin is the first review that has pooled together all reported suspected AEs due to ciprofloxacin use in paediatric patients. Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in paediatrics because juvenile animals developed arthropathy after use. However, our review has identified over 16 000 children who have received ciprofloxacin. It is likely that the number of children who have received ciprofloxacin in practice is significantly greater than this.

Our review confirms that musculoskeletal toxicity is the most frequently reported AE following the use of ciprofloxacin. There is, however, a wide range of toxicity that has been reported and it is important to recognise that, like all anti-infective agents, ciprofloxacin can be associated with a broad spectrum of AEs. The toxicity profile in table 2 is pooled safety data of reported suspected AEs by individual authors; however, these AEs may not be adverse drug reactions in all cases. From our review, there is an estimated risk of one musculoskeletal AE in every 62.5 patients, and a 57% increased risk of arthropathy in patients exposed to ciprofloxacin. The musculoskeletal AEs appear reversible with management.

The term arthropathy has been used broadly for various musculoskeletal AEs. Juvenile animals were noted to have gait stiffness, particularly in the hind limbs; reluctance to rise from a sitting, lateral or sternal recumbence position; exudation of synovial fluid; and blistering and ulcerative erosions of articular cartilage in the limb joints. However, our review suggested that arthralgia was the commonest symptom of arthropathy (50%) in paediatric patients, affecting mostly the knee joint. Tendon or joint disorders and reduced movement also accounted for a significant proportion of arthropathy cases (19% and 15%, respectively). Although the specific tendon disorder could not be ascertained, tendinitis or tendon rupture could be implied as this represents the most frequent presentations in the literature.–The only specific report of tendon disorder in our review was a case of Achilles tendinitis in a patient (age not specified). Tendon disorders have been thought to occur more frequently in patients over 60 years. However, our review suggests it is also reported in paediatric patients, and clinicians should be aware of such possibility.

Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Adverse Event Reports).

### Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy of the hand and wrist: a systematic review and case report [^112GGJoH]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolone use has been known to be associated with tendinopathy and tendon rupture for over 30 years. Hand and wrist involvement has been reported rarely, yet without early recognition and withdrawal of the fluoroquinolone, there is potential for significant morbidity.

Methods

We searched Medline using a comprehensive search strategy for fluoroquinolones and tendinopathy of the hand and wrist, and provide a case report of a possible levofloxacin-related tendon rupture in a patient with a previous mutilating hand injury.

Results

We located 10 previously reported cases of fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy in the hand or wrist ranging from 1983 to 2015. Unlike Achilles tendinopathy, women were no more likely than men to have tendon rupture affecting the hands or wrists. Our patient was a 59-year-old man with prior tendon repair but otherwise noncontributory medical history who experienced spontaneous tendon rupture on an extended course of levofloxacin and required extensive pulley and boutonnière repair.

Conclusions

Given the extensive damage that may be caused to weakened tissue, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion of tendinopathy in patients taking fluoroquinolones who have had previous tendon repairs, particularly in the setting of unexplained changes in recovery trajectory.

### Antimicrobial safety: focus on fluoroquinolones [^1132kCRR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Infrequent toxicities associated with certain drugs and drug classes have recently gained much attention from different health-care perspectives. To protect the patient, continued surveillance of safety and tolerability data is essential. Data from preclinical testing, phase 1–3 trials, and postmarketing surveillance may be used to objectively assess the risks associated with a specific drug or family of compounds. This review summarizes safety and tolerability data for the quinolones.

Main Findings

The most common adverse events associated with the quinolone class involve the gastrointestinal tract (nausea and diarrhea) and central nervous system (CNS) (headache and dizziness). These adverse events are usually mild and do not require discontinuation of therapy. Uncommon and potentially serious quinolone-related adverse events involve the cardiovascular system (rate-corrected electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation), musculoskeletal system (tendinitis and tendon rupture), endocrine system (glucose homeostasis dysregulation), renal system (crystalluria, interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure), and the CNS (seizures). Severe idiosyncratic adverse events are specific to individual agents that may share some structural congruity, such as the 1-(2,4)-difluorophenyl group shared by trovafloxacin (associated with hepatitis), temafloxacin (associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome), and tosufloxacin (associated with eosinophilic pneumonitis). Overall, discontinuation rates from clinical trials were < 4% for the currently marketed quinolones. Quinolones with higher discontinuation rates, such as trovafloxacin (7.0%) and grepafloxacin (6.4%), are no longer available for general use.

Conclusions

The currently marketed quinolones are well tolerated, with safety profiles similar to those of other antimicrobial classes. Although adverse effects are unusual, some, including tendinitis and CNS-related effects, are more common with quinolones than with other antimicrobial classes. Rare adverse effects attributed to some members of the quinolone family (e.g. Torsades de Pointes, hepatotoxicity, and dysglycemias) are more likely to occur in select "susceptible" populations. These adverse events can often be circumvented by avoiding exposure to the specific quinolone. In some cases, the therapeutic value offered by a quinolone may outweigh its potential risks.

5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting ciprofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Ciprofloxacin reduces the stimulation of prostaglandin E (2) output by interleukin-1beta in human tendon-derived cells [^115MpTju]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin can induce tendon pathology and have various effects on tendon-derived cells in culture. We are investigating whether ciprofloxacin modifies signalling responses in tendon cells.

Methods

Human Achilles tendon-derived cells were preincubated with or without ciprofloxacin (50 mug/ml) and were then challenged with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta, 1 ng/ml) for up to 48 h. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) output was assayed by ELISA. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was examined by Western blotting.

Results

IL-1beta stimulated a substantial and prolonged increase in the output of PGE2. Preincubation with ciprofloxacin reduced IL-1beta-induced PGE2 output at all times tested; the reduction at 48 h was 69% (99% confidence interval 59–79%; 15 experiments). Norfloxacin and ofloxacin also reduced PGE2 output. However, ciprofloxacin did not affect the induction of COX-2 by IL-1beta, measured at 4 or 48 h.

Conclusions

Ciprofloxacin reduces IL-1beta-induced PGE2 output in tendon-derived cells. The reduction in PGE2 output could modulate various cellular activities of IL-1beta, and may be implicated in fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy.

### Ofloxacin [^1169XW9L]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of ofloxacin PO (also known as Ocuflox):
- **Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis**: avoid using ofloxacin in patients with myasthenia gravis.
- **Tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that can occur together, including tendinitis and tendon rupture (most commonly affecting the Achilles tendon), peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects (including convulsions, increased ICP, and psychosis). Reserve moxifloxacin for acute exacerbation of COPD and uncomplicated cystitis only when no alternative treatment options are available. Discontinue ofloxacin immediately and avoid the use of fluoroquinolones in patients who experience any of these serious adverse reactions.

5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy and Central Nervous System Effects

Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions could occur within hours to weeks after starting a fluoroquinolone. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3 and 5.4)].

Discontinue BAXDELA immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting a fluoroquinolone, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

This risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over age 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and, in patients with kidney, heart, and lung transplant. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors.

Discontinue BAXDELA immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Advise patients, at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation, to stop taking BAXDELA, to avoid exercise and use of the affected area, and to promptly contact their healthcare provider about changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid BAXDELA in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture.

### Effectiveness and safety of tetracyclines and quinolones in people with: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Ust16]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study represents the inaugural and most comprehensive meta-analysis to date, examining the efficacy of tetracyclines and quinolones treating M. pneumoniae infections in people and their safety in children. By integrating data from multiple countries, it delivers the latest evidence supporting the utilisation of these antibiotics. The utilization of tetracyclines and quinolones in paediatric patients is restricted due to age-specific safety issues. We broadened the efficacy evaluation to encompass the entire population without imposing age restrictions. However, due to concerns regarding child safety, we specifically focus on conducting drug safety evaluations for children.

In terms of age, quinolones use in children is associated with high AEs signalling in gastrointestinal reactions, hematologic and lymphatic disorders, cardiac, neurological, and musculoskeletal disorders. In particular, patients aged 12–18 years reported the most in studies of fluoroquinolone (FQ)-induced tendinopathy, with tendon rupture occurring one week after administration and tendinopathy within the first month. Quinolones have also been associated with seizures in children, with increased seizures (0.63%) in children without central nervous system disease (0.02%). In previous data, the incidence of tooth discolouration caused by different tetracyclines varied between 23% and 92% in children. Doxycycline and minocycline are at significantly increased risk of dermatological adverse effects, and may cause hypersensitivity syndrome, serum sickness-like reactions, and drug-induced lupus.

SAFETY AND PHARMACOLOGY

Fluoroquinolones have a long history of adverse effects with several of them being considered as class-related such as tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. As a result, all fluoroquinolones approved in the United States (including delafloxacin) carry a general boxed warning about these effects (significant decreases in blood sugar and certain mental health side effects have been added recently or will be soon). Both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are also concerned with rare but severe and permanent or long-lasting serious side effects (see, which led to the FDA statement that risks of fluoroquinolones may outweigh benefits for patients with mild infections such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Likewise, the EMA may reduce the indications of fluoroquinolones to "severe infections when other antibiotics cannot be used". Most of these class-related adverse effects and/or permanent effects were uncommon in the safety data bases of registration and post-marketing studies undertaken by or under the control of Industry (see, for example, the safety profile of moxifloxacin as compiled from such studies involving about 15 000 patients). The observation period in these studies is limited and they usually exclude patients with known risk factors. In this context, although the FDA label mentions that peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system effects have been observed with delafloxacin (also hypersensitivity, and Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea), these were not specifically observed or reported more frequently in the delafloxacin arm than in the comparator arm in the clinical trials published to date. The current developer of delafloxacin undertook a series of studies aimed at examining specific fluoroquinolone-related side effects. In this context, cardiac safety was examined in clinical models that showed that neither a therapeutic (300 mg administered by IV) nor a supratherapeutic (900 mg IV) dose of delafloxacin was associated with clinically meaningful disturbances in cardiac repolarization (as measured by the corrected QT [QTc] interval) under conditions in which moxifloxacin, used as comparator, gave an unambiguous signal demonstrwating that the study was adequately sensitive to assess QTc prolongation. Also, no relationship was reported between plasma concentrations and the placebo-corrected change from pre-dose baseline in the QTc (ΔΔQTcF). Because of concern about photosensitivity, commonly associated with a halogen substituent in position C8 (see for review), a study of the photosensitizing potential of delafloxacin to ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) and visible radiation was conducted in 52 healthy volunteers. Neither delafloxacin given for 7 days at 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day (0.22 and 0.44 times the approved recommended daily oral dosage, respectively, nor placebo demonstrated clinically significant phototoxic potential at any wavelengths tested (295 to 430 nm), including solar simulation. The active comparator (lomefloxacin, which possesses a fluorine substituent in C8) demonstrated a moderate degree of phototoxicity at UVA 335 nm and 365 nm and solar simulation wavelengths. Finally, significant drug-drug interactions are unlikely, which is a consideration when choosing non-fluoroquinolone alternatives such as macrolides.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^112NtHe8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common problem, but its exact aetiology remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association between potential clinical risk factors and Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Systematic review.

Data sources

The databases Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched up to February 2018.

Eligibility criteria

To answer our research question, cohort studies investigating risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy in humans were included. We restricted our search to potential clinical risk factors (imaging studies were excluded).

Results

We included 10 cohort studies, all with a high risk of bias, from 5111 publications identified. There is limited evidence for nine risk factors: (1) prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, (2) use of ofloxacin (quinolone) antibiotics, (3) an increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, (4) moderate alcohol use, (5) training during cold weather, (6) decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, (7) abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, (8) more lateral foot roll-over at the forefoot flat phase and (9) creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min in heart transplant patients. Twenty-six other putative risk factors were not associated with Achilles tendinopathy, including being overweight, static foot posture and physical activity level.

Conclusion

From an ocean of studies with high levels of bias, we extracted nine clinical risk factors that may increase a person's risk of Achilles tendinopathy. Clinicians may consider ofloxacin use, alcohol consumption and a reduced plantar flexor strength as modifiable risk factors when treating patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^116uK4oi]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as Proquin XR. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing Proquin XR to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue Proquin XR and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur (See Boxed Warning, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS/ Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports).

Clinical experience with Proquin XR did not include sufficient number of subjects 65 years of age or older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Reported clinical experience with other formulations of ciprofloxacin has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using Proquin XR with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia).

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^115fud5N]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) antibiotic-specific safety and preferences: Clindamycin is notably associated with Clostridioides difficile-associated colitis in adults, and prospective data on the risk of C. difficile colitis in otherwise healthy children receiving clindamycin therapy for 2 to 3 weeks for ABA do not exist, but the risk is likely lower than that documented in adults; colonization with C. difficile in children under the age of 2 years is common and its detection in young children with diarrhea does not necessarily indicate causation. In prospective pediatric pre-licensure evaluations of linezolid, hematologic abnormalities occurred but were no more frequent than with other antibiotics; long-term adverse events, such as optic and peripheral neuropathies, have been described in both adults and children receiving more than 4 weeks of linezolid, and linezolid is a reversible, nonspecific inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and should be used with caution in patients who are on an SSRI medication. For children, non-fluoroquinolone oral antimicrobial agents are preferred if appropriate for the clinical scenario; however, for convalescent therapy, oral therapy with a fluoroquinolone is preferred over parenteral therapy with a non-fluoroquinolone β-lactam. During fluoroquinolone therapy, attention is required for development of arthritis/arthralgia, primarily in weight-bearing joints, and families should return for evaluation should symptoms consistent with a persistent arthropathy or tendinopathy occur for more than 2–3 days during therapy. TMP/SMX may cause drug-related rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), as well as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
