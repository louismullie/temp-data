## Question

3. The sledge run consists of a straight slope $AB$ and a horizontal section $BC$. Point $A$ is 5 m away from the nearest point $H$ on the horizontal ground surface. The distance $HC$ is 3 m, and point $B$ lies on the segment $HC$. Find the distance from point $H$ to point $B$ so that the time of the sledge's motion from rest along the broken line $ABC$ is minimized. Assume a uniform gravitational field, neglect friction, air resistance, and any change in the magnitude of the sledge's velocity vector at the junction point $B$. The acceleration due to gravity is considered to be $10 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{c}^{2}$.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the distance from point H to point B that minimizes the total travel time from rest along the broken line ABC, given the geometry and idealized physics assumptions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry and define variables. Then, I should derive expressions for the time spent on the inclined segment AB and the horizontal segment BC. Next, I will set up the total time function and take its derivative to find the critical point. After that, I should verify the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum. Finally, I will calculate the numerical answer and double-check the units and reasonableness of the result.

> Let me first confirm the geometry and set up variables. Point A is 5 m vertically above the horizontal ground, and H is the foot of the perpendicular from A to the ground, so AH = 5 m. HC is 3 m horizontally, and B lies on HC, so I will let HB = x, which makes BC = 3 − x. The inclined segment AB has length sqrt(AH² + HB²) = sqrt(25 + x²), and the horizontal segment BC has length 3 − x, with x constrained to 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.

> Now, I need to derive the time on AB. The sledge starts from rest and accelerates down the incline with acceleration a = g sin θ, where θ is the angle of inclination. Wait, let me verify the acceleration component: along the incline, the net acceleration is indeed g sin θ, and sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse = AH/AB = 5/sqrt(25 + x²). So a = 10 × 5/sqrt(25 + x²) = 50/sqrt(25 + x²) m/s². Using constant acceleration kinematics, the time t1 to traverse AB is t1 = sqrt(2s/a) = sqrt(2 × sqrt(25 + x²) / (50/sqrt(25 + x²))) = sqrt(2(25 + x²)/50) = sqrt((25 + x²)/25) = sqrt(1 + x²/25).

> Hold on, I should verify the velocity at B because it affects the time on BC. The speed at B is vB = a t1 = (50/sqrt(25 + x²)) × sqrt((25 + x²)/25) = 50/5 = 10 m/s. Interesting, the speed at B is constant regardless of x, which simplifies the BC time calculation. The time on BC is simply t2 = distance/speed = (3 − x)/10 seconds.

> Next, I should write the total time function and minimize it. Total time T(x) = t1 + t2 = sqrt(1 + x²/25) + (3 − x)/10. To find the minimum, I take the derivative dT/dx and set it to zero. dT/dx = (1/2)(1 + x²/25)^(−1/2) × (2x/25) − 1/10 = x/(25 sqrt(1 + x²/25)) − 1/10. Setting this equal to zero gives x/(25 sqrt(1 + x²/25)) = 1/10. Rearranging, 10x = 25 sqrt(1 + x²/25), then 2x = 5 sqrt(1 + x²/25). Squaring both sides, 4x² = 25(1 + x²/25) = 25 + x², so 3x² = 25 and x = 5/sqrt(3) ≈ 2.887 m.

> I should confirm this is a minimum, not a maximum or inflection. The second derivative is d²T/dx² = 25/(25 + x²)^(3/2), which is always positive, so the critical point is indeed a minimum. I also need to check the boundary behavior: at x = 0, T ≈ 1 + 0.3 = 1.3 s, and at x = 3, T ≈ sqrt(1 + 9/25) + 0 ≈ 1.28 s, while at x = 5/sqrt(3), T ≈ sqrt(1 + 25/75) + (3 − 2.887)/10 ≈ 1.155 + 0.011 ≈ 1.166 s, which is smaller than both endpoints, confirming the interior minimum is global within the domain.

> But wait, what if I made an algebraic slip in solving for x? Let me double-check the squaring step. From 2x = 5 sqrt(1 + x²/25), squaring yields 4x² = 25(1 + x²/25) = 25 + x², so 3x² = 25, hence x = 5/sqrt(3), which is correct. Rationalizing, x = 5 sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 2.887 m, and since 0 ≤ 5/sqrt(3) ≤ 3, the solution lies within the feasible interval.

> Final answer: The distance from H to B that minimizes the total time is 5/sqrt(3) meters, which is approximately 2.89 meters.

The optimal distance from point H to point B is **2.89 m** (exactly (\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}) m). This minimizes the total travel time along the path ABC by balancing the time spent on the inclined segment AB and the horizontal segment BC. The solution is derived using calculus to minimize the total time function, considering the geometry and constant speed on the horizontal segment.

---

## Geometric setup

Let:

- (AH = 5) m (vertical height from A to H)
- (HC = 3) m (horizontal distance from H to C)
- (HB = x) m (horizontal distance from H to B, the variable to optimize)
- (BC = 3 - x) m (horizontal distance from B to C)

The inclined segment AB has length:

[
AB = \\sqrt{AH^2 + HB^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{25 + x^2}
]

---

## Time calculation

### Time on the inclined segment AB

The sledge accelerates from rest down the incline. The acceleration along AB is (a = g \\sin \\theta), where (\\theta) is the angle of inclination and (g = 10, \\text{m/s}^2). We have:

[
\\sin \\theta = \\frac{AH}{AB} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}}
]

Thus:

[
a = g \\sin \\theta = 10 \\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}} = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}}, \\text{m/s}^2
]

Using kinematics, the time (t_1) to traverse AB is:

[
t_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot AB}{a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sqrt{25 + x^2}}{\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (25 + x^2)}{50}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25 + x^2}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}}{5}
]

---

### Time on the horizontal segment BC

The speed at B is:

[
v_B = a t_1 = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}}{5} = 10, \\text{m/s}
]

Since speed is constant on BC, the time (t_2) is:

[
t_2 = \\frac{BC}{v_B} = \\frac{3 - x}{10}
]

---

### Total time function

The total time (T(x)) is:

[
T(x) = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{25 + x^2}}{5} + \\frac{3 - x}{10}
]

---

## Minimizing the total time

To minimize (T(x)), take the derivative and set it to zero:

[
\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{x}{5 \\sqrt{25 + x^2}} - \\frac{1}{10} = 0
]

Solving:

[
\\frac{x}{5 \\sqrt{25 + x^2}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\implies 2x = \\sqrt{25 + x^2}
]

Square both sides:

[
4x^2 = 25 + x^2 \\implies 3x^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 = \\frac{25}{3} \\implies x = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\approx 2.89, \\text{m}
]

---

## Verification of minimum

The second derivative is:

[
\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = \\frac{25}{5 (25 + x^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{5}{(25 + x^2)^{3/2}} > 0
]

Since the second derivative is positive, this critical point is a **minimum**.

---

## Final answer

The optimal distance from H to B is **(\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}) m**, or approximately **2.89 m**.

### Sources of path integration error in young and aging humans [^001b363d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The log-likelihood is approximated as

Model with constant reporting noise (Full-RN+CRN): This model is the same as the full model (Eq. (10)), except that the reporting error is drawn from a distribution of constant size, instead of being Weber-like (proportional to the reported quantity). Thus, Eq. (2) is replaced by

The model can be fit in the same way as the full model, when reporting noise is proportional to the internal estimate, except that noise is added linearly in polar coordinates instead of log-polar coordinates. Specifically, the first component of the observation z s defined as the reported distanceinstead of its logarithm, so that Eq. (12) is replaced byand we replace the observation functionin Eq. (11) by the transformation from cartesian to polar coordinates:and the Jacobian H s +1 in Eq. (15) by

The rest of the calculation of the log-likelihood function is exactly the same as for the full model.

Fitting by age group : For this analysis, instead of fitting model parameters individually for each participant, participants in each age group are constrained to have the same model parameters.

Full model with time accumulation (ongoing noise is proportional to elapsed time rather than displacement; same reporting noise model as for the full model): This model assumes that the mean and variance of the internal location estimate is determined by the elapsed time of each trajectory segment, Eq. (3), instead of the distance of each trajectory segment, Eq. (4). In the case of zero leak, the time model predicts that the variance of the internal location estimate increases proportionally to elapsed time instead of traveled distance.

To fit the time model we replace Eq. (10) bywhere Δ t is the elapsed time of each trajectory segment. In addition, the Jacobian of the transition function F s +1 in Eq. (15) is replaced by

For trials without intermediate stopping points, only the total elapsed time of the trajectory, but not the elapsed time Δ t of individual segments was recorded. For these trials we estimated Δ t by linear interpolation using the traveled distance |Δ x | and assuming a constant walking speed.

The observation functionand its Jacobian H s +1 are identical to the standard Weber reporting noise model as specified in Eqs. (11) and (15), respectively.

Approximate Bayesian computation

We employed approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate model parameters from simulated and real data (see below). We performed a two-step approximate Bayesian computation procedure in which we simulatedforward trajectories with uniformpriors where,, and. We restricted ourprior to values expected to produce mutations that would then have time to sweep in the population within the relevant time frame of 100 generations.

We used rejection sampling, which accepts a certain percentage of trials (given by the tolerance) that minimize the Euclidean distance between the observed summary statistics and those summary statistics generated by the prior as implemented in the R package ‘abc’. The parameter combinations that result in the lowest distances form the posterior. We first perform ABC to estimate the posteriors forand s, using targeted summary statistics as discussed in.

Forwe use the best fit θ under Ewens’ Sampling Formula for when the populations are combined at each time point. Note, combining two population allele frequencies with limited migration overestimates the value of θ (i.e. increases diversity relative to a single population), but this does not affect our procedure because the best fit θ is used only as a summary statistic.

To estimate s, we fit the observed frequency of the derived allele at the sampled time points to a logistic curve with y-intercept ofthat minimized mean squared error from the observed data. In the cases of ties, we used the shallowest slope that could explain the data equally well.

From our first fit ABC, we get posteriors overand s. We then take the range of values within the 95% posterior for these two parameters and use those as a flat prior for a second fit (see Figure S12). For our second fit ABC, we use four summary statistics at each time point:,, the absolute value of the difference in heterozygosities between the two subpopulations, and the number of variants shared at any frequency. For a schematic illustration of the two-step process, see Figure S12. This two-step procedure drastically improved our estimates for m as compared to a one-step procedure (data not shown).

### Personalizing exoskeleton assistance while walking in the real world [^a797119b]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

On the second day, participants performed outdoor and treadmill validation tests to evaluate the benefits provided by Real-world Optimized assistance. For the outdoor validation, participants walked along a 566-m path in the same public setting with a fixed ordering of bouts of specific distances and corresponding speed prompt commands that were selected to match real-world distributions,. Distances were set using cones to mark stopping locations, which ensured consistent distances for each bout. Participants completed this outdoor course once for each condition, including Real-world Optimized assistance, Generic Speed-adaptive assistance and Normal Shoes. The ordering of the conditions was randomized to minimize effects of testing order (Extended Data Table 1). The double-reversal protocol, used in the first three laboratory experiments, was not used because the outdoor experiments took significantly more time owing to the longer trial time, varying self-selected walking speeds, short bouts of walking, and rest periods between bouts and conditions. Each real-world condition required about 15 min, compared with about 8 min for each treadmill condition. Outdoor and indoor tests of Real-world Optimized assistance were conducted on the same day to avoid confounding effects from differing respirometry system calibrations. The total walking time for these two experiments was about 1.5 h, and we found that participants were not able to complete the additional 1.5 h of walking that would have been required for a double-reversal approach without experiencing fatigue. For the 3 min following completion of the path, participants stood at rest while respirometry data were collected to capture the total metabolic cost of completing the course. The duration of walking for each bout was timed with a stopwatch. Walking speed for each bout was computed by dividing the fixed distance for that bout by the time spent walking during that bout. Walking speed for each condition was calculated as the total distance travelled divided by the total time spent walking while navigating the course.

High-altitude travel and altitude illness—preventing severe altitude illness or death emphasizes that the goal is to prevent severe illness, need for evacuation, or death, and there is no reason for anyone to die from altitude illness unless descent is impossible and treatment is inaccessible. Travelers can adhere to 3 rules: Know the early symptoms of altitude illness and acknowledge them; never ascend to sleep at a higher altitude when experiencing symptoms of altitude illness; and descend if symptoms worsen despite rest or treatment at the same elevation.

Travel—risks should be carefully considered at both origin and destination because many countries, states, and cities have specific limitations or requirements; travelers should not only consider infection rates at their destination but also ensure they have a plan if they become ill or need to quarantine after an exposure; some areas may face limitations in hospital or ICU bed capacity making travel riskier; those at higher risk of severe illness should consider carefully whether the need to travel outweighs the risk; some important questions to consider include whether quarantine is needed before arrival or upon return, whether a COVID-19 test or face covering is required, what is opened or closed, and whether temperature checks will be needed; for air travel, the same core principles to minimize spread of SARS-CoV-2 should be followed: physical distancing, hand washing or alcohol-based sanitizer use, wearing a face covering or appropriate PPE and using it properly, symptom monitoring, and avoiding contact with ill people; it is important to ensure rest stops, accommodations, client locations, and restaurants are available and following appropriate steps, and to have a plan if illness or exposure occurs while away; different modes of travel carry different risk, and the safest is probably driving a personal vehicle.

### Spontaneous traveling waves naturally emerge from horizontal fiber time delays and travel through locally asynchronous-irregular States [^53fe68a1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We next measured the distribution of estimated wavelengths in the data and compared this to the wavelength distribution in the model. LFP data in the cortex are not independent across electrodes (as it is in our simulation), but rather pools signals from a cortical volume of ~250 μm in a radius around the electrode tip, and has correlations that fall off with distance. To emulate these properties of cortical LFP recordings, we applied a smoothing kernel that expanded the area of integration from each simulated LFP point and reduced the independence of the signal. After smoothing our simulated LFP and quantifying wave properties, the distribution of simulated wavelengths closely approximated the distribution observed in the cortex (dotted gray and blue lines, Fig. 6c). Similarly, the distribution of observed speeds in both the network simulation and the data covered the range of conduction velocities in the horizontal fibers, peaking at ~0.2 m/s (Fig. 6d). Thus, across four different measures (spike rate, spike variability, wave size, wave velocity), the distributions characterizing activity in the network model were in close alignment with experimental recordings.

Radiation emergencies and unknown radiation sources—protective actions for travelers include following official instructions, applying basic protection principles, and exercising caution around possible sources. In case of such an emergency, travelers should follow instructions provided by local authorities, and if such information is not forthcoming, travelers should seek advice from their nearest embassy or consulate. The basic radiation protection measures include time (minimizing the amount of time one is exposed), distance (the further from the exposure, the lower the dose), and shielding (the more material between a person and the source, the lower the dose). Natural disasters (e.g., floods) might displace industrial or clinical radioactive sources; in all circumstances, travelers should exercise caution when they encounter unknown objects or equipment, especially if the objects have the basic radiation trefoil symbol or other radiation signs. Travelers who encounter a questionable object should avoid touching or moving the object and should notify local authorities as quickly as possible. Floods in the area of radioactive waste disposal areas may result in the dispersion of contamination into waters, soils, and sediments, and contact with these environmental media should be avoided.

Altitude acclimatization recommendations—Wilderness Medical Society guidance and protective staging—note that acclimatizing for a minimum of 2–3 nights at around 2,450 to approximately 2,750 m (8,000–9,000 ft) before proceeding to a higher altitude is markedly protective against acute mountain sickness (AMS). The Wilderness Medical Society recommends avoiding ascent to a sleeping altitude of 2,750 m (≥9,000 ft) in a single day; ascending at a rate of no greater than 500 m per night in sleeping altitude once above 3,000 m; and allowing an extra night to acclimatize for every 1,000 m of sleeping altitude gain, while acknowledging these recommendations can still be too fast for some travelers and too slow for others.

### An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs [^3493f5a4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.

### An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs [^04954b73]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We introduced a novel definition of distance between pairs of temporal graphs. This definition entails two steps. First, the temporal graphs are embedded in Euclidean space, and then a distance is defined in the embedding space. For the first step, we use an embedding based on time-respecting random walks over the temporal graph. Such walks are known to depend on and to encode important structural and temporal properties of time-varying graphs,,,,. For the second step, we proposed two possibilities for the distance definition: if a mapping is known between the nodes of the graphs to be compared, we consider a distance definition that leverages such mapping; in the more general case, when such a mapping is unavailable, we put forward a definition that makes it possible to compare graphs with arbitrarily different sizes (numbers of nodes). In both cases, since the size of the embedding matrix we use does not depend on the graph’s temporal span, it is possible to embed temporal graphs with different durations in the same embedding space and thus compute a distance between them. The evaluation of our approach on both synthetic and empirical data shows that the proposed distance is sensitive to structural differences (e.g. degree distribution, clustering coefficient, or presence of communities) as well as to temporal differences (e.g. burstiness or node activity patterns) of the temporal graphs being compared.

Network analysis

The strategic decision problem to solve is a p median facility location–allocation problem with an imposed maximum travel time constraint for road ambulance patient transportation, and a minimum allocation of 50 MT interventions per year and CSC.Let H be the set of hospitals where a CSC can be located, P is the set of patients, and T is a matrix with travels times from each patient to every hospital, where t ph =the time from patient case p to hospital h. The objective is then to minimize the sum of the times to transport patients to hospitals:, subject to the aforementioned constraints (figure 1A).

The presence of a neurosurgical clinic is set as a prerequisite for hospitals to qualify as candidate facilities for CSC location in the model; this gave seven university hospitals. Each of the 18 793 patients was represented by its point location for EMS pick-up of the patient in the national road network that covers a land area of 403 865 km 2.

The model limits the symptom onset to treatment time (OTT) window for MT to 360 min. The median time from symptom onset to EMS arrival at the patient location was 62 min for the study population. The reported median time from hospital arrival to treatment start with MT is 58 min in Sweden.After deducting the two latter time intervals from the OTT window for MT, 240 min remained for EMS transportation of patient from the pick-up point of location to the nearest CSC. Thus the model dismisses patients with estimated travel times beyond 240 min of road transportation to a CSC as ineligible for treatment with MT. In accordance with the fitted linear associations between OTT and the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days (mRS-90d score) in predictive generalized linear models, the solver is set to minimize a p median objective function, which translates into minimizing the total sum of time spent on transporting patients to a CSC.Thus the solutions for one and up to seven CSCs, respectively, suggest the CSC locations that minimize the overall travel time for EMS patient transportations.

Adventure travel risk factors for illness and injury include that climate, terrain, and weather can be extreme, communication often is limited, even with modern technology, and destinations can be remote and lack access to medical care; physical exertion increases caloric, fluid, sleep, and thermoregulation requirements. Trips may span several weeks, months, or years and may be goal-oriented, which can cause travelers to exceed safety limits, and unexpected complications can occur with flight schedules, vehicle breakdowns, weather delays, and other factors.

Avoid going directly from low altitude (1,200 m or <4,000 ft) to 2,750 m (≥9,000 ft) sleeping altitude in 1 day; once above 3,000 m, move sleeping altitude by no more than 500 m per day and plan an extra day for every additional 1,000 m of sleeping altitude gain. Consider using acetazolamide to speed acclimatization if abrupt ascent is unavoidable. For the first 48 hours at altitude, avoid alcohol and participate in only mild exercise, and if a regular caffeine user, continue caffeine to avoid a withdrawal headache that could be confused with an altitude headache. A high-altitude exposure (≥2,750 m) for ≥2 nights within 14 days before the trip is useful, with timing closer to departure being better.

2.3 Landscape/Topographical Data

We captured data on digitized and geo-referenced road networks and paths as well as features such as rivers and lakes. We obtained the DEM of the region, which assisted in identifying natural barriers such as hills and valleys as well as undulating land that would inform the decision on estimating travel distance and time. All the above data was obtained from Adu Manu Kwame (AMK) Consultancy. We juxtaposed these data with the data obtained from the University of Ghana Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems laboratory to validate accuracy. Following this, we reclassified DEM into highlands (more than 200 m high) and flatlands (between 119 m and 200 m high). This was determined by the DEM data which showed that the highest point in the region was about 470 m, while the lowest point was identified as 119 m.

2.4 Developing a Model for Estimating Cost Distance and Travel Time

A model for estimating cost was accomplished using a sequence of algorithms with the final output resulting from the cost distance tool in ArcGIS 10.4. Cost distance calculates the shortest time to a source based on a cost dataset. To realize this, we designed a cost surface algorithm with the following parameters: a grid cell with the size of 10 m was assigned to the spatial features and values were then assigned to the predetermined grids. We assigned roads low values because traveling on roads is faster than travel via paths or impediments. Assigning of values to spatial features was done via the map algebra tool and, since cost distance requires the cost surface dataset and the source, the calibrated spatial dataset served as the cost surface dataset and referral facilities served as the source for calculating the cost distance. The output is a map showing the shortest travel time (cell by cell) from any point in the map to referral facilities in the region. Algorithms which allowed for carrying out conversion of data from vector to raster, map algebra (cost surface models) and cost distance were developed using Python 2.7. All the algorithms were consolidated into a single algorithm. Based on the earlier information on transportation options for longer distances (motorized tricycle), we pegged the travel speed at 20 km/h. This served as a guide for determining travel time from each PHC clinic to the referral facility. Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram for the procedures undertaken to arrive at the results of this study.

### Accessibility of HIV services in Philadelphia: location-allocation analysis [^f45d483d]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the first step in the HIV care continuum, timely diagnosis is central to reducing transmission of the virus and ending the HIV epidemic. Studies have shown that distance from a testing site is essential for ease of access to services and educational material. This study shows how location-allocation analysis can be used to improve allocation of HIV testing services utilizing existing publicly available data from 2015 to 2019 on HIV prevalence, testing site location, and factors related to HIV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Methods

The ArcGIS Location-Allocation analytic tool was used to calculate locations for HIV testing sites using a method that minimizes the distance between demand-point locations and service facilities. ZIP code level demand was initially specified on the basis of the percentage of late HIV diagnoses and in a sensitivity analysis on the basis of a composite of multiple factors. Travel time and distance from demand to facilities determined the facility location allocation. This analysis was conducted from 2021 to 2022.

Results

Compared with the 37 facilities located in 20 (43%) Philadelphia ZIP codes, the model proposed reallocating testing facilities to 37 (79%) ZIP codes using percent late diagnoses to define demand. On average, this would reduce distance to the facilities by 65% and travel time to the facilities by 56%. Results using the sensitivity analysis were similar.

Conclusions

A wider distribution of HIV testing services across the city of Philadelphia may reduce distance and travel time to facilities, improve accessibility of testing, and in turn increase the percentage of people with knowledge of their status.

Diving and air travel—flying after diving—The risk of developing decompression sickness (DCS) increases when divers ascend to increased altitude too soon after a dive, and commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to the equivalent of approximately 1,830–2,440 m (6,000–8,000 ft) above sea level. Asymptomatic divers should wait before any altitude exposures >610 m (>2,000 ft), with recommended pre-flight surface intervals of ≥12 hours after surfacing from a single no-decompression dive, ≥18 hours after multiple dives or multiple days of diving, and 24–48 hours after a dive that required decompression stops. These recommended pre-flight surface intervals reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk for DCS; longer surface intervals further reduce this risk. Symptomatic divers should seek evaluation to rule out possible decompression illness before attempting any exposure to increased altitude, and a diagnosis of decompression illness generally requires appropriate treatment before any flight or ascent to altitude.

### Time-efficient and flexible design of optimized multishell HARDI diffusion [^48b3619c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

These improvements and novel developments have all been realized individually for specific purposes. Achieving effective and efficient diffusion acquisitions that take advantage of the available approaches requires a number of disparate factors to be balanced, resulting in a complicated design problem. This work presents a comprehensive robust framework that combines key technical capabilities with an optimization process that addresses both gradient hardware constraints and vulnerability to interrupted or incomplete examinations. It is designed to acquire dMRI data with maximal time efficiency combined with flexibility to operate in different regimes where there are differing balances between conflicting goals and/or constraints and has the following key features:
A MB capability combined with an optimized slice interleave pattern to accelerate and limit spin history effects.
An optimized order and completely flexible sampling of diffusion encoding (b ‐value shell and direction of sensitization within a shell) and PED, with option to freely mix all three in one single scan promoting consistency and usability of data acquired even in cases where sporadic movement and/or early scan termination may lead to data loss.
A flexible diffusion preparation scheme that includes both ST and SDG patterns to allow TE minimization.
A restart facility, allowing continuation of an interrupted scan to completion rather than requiring repetition from the start or a fixed break point.
A thermal model that can be used to optimize the acquisition by adjusting all the above factors to minimize the impact of gradient duty cycle limits.

For thermal modelling, optimized order and slice acquisition order, scripts are provided in the additional material. The used symbols are found in.

In general, the inputs into these various optimization techniques depend on the study goals (these may fix the shells and ratios between shells), the population (which may define T 1, T 2, acceptable scan time and expected motion patterns), and the available hardware (described by G max, slew rate and thermal heating models). The framework was carefully validated and applied under different conditions, and then used to design two quite different protocols: a multishell HARDI protocol for use in the dHCP project and a higher spatial resolution shorter duration protocol for neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) 5 analysis. The approach and its ability to deliver input to different advanced analysis tools are demonstrated in the following sections.

### Medical advice for commercial air travel [^67c4b473]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Air travel is generally safe, but the flight environment poses unique physiologic challenges such as relative hypoxia that may trigger adverse myocardial or pulmonary outcomes. To optimize health outcomes, communication must take place between the traveler, family physician, and airline carrier when there is any doubt about fitness for air travel. Travelers should carry current medications in their original containers and a list of their medical conditions and allergies; they should adjust timing of medications as needed based on time zone changes. The Hypoxia Altitude Simulation Test can be used to determine specific in-flight oxygen requirements for patients who have pulmonary complications or for those for whom safe air travel remains in doubt. Patients with pulmonary conditions who are unable to walk 50 m or for those whose usual oxygen requirements exceed 4 L per minute should be advised not to fly. Trapped gases that expand at high altitude can cause problems for travelers with recent surgery; casting; ear, nose, and throat issues; or dental issues. Insulin requirements may change based on duration and direction of travel. Travelers can minimize risk for deep venous thrombosis by adequately hydrating, avoiding alcohol, walking for 10 to 15 minutes every two hours of travel time, and performing seated isometric exercises. Wearing compression stockings can prevent asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis and superficial venous thrombosis for flights five hours or longer in duration. Physicians and travelers can review relevant pretravel health information, including required and recommended immunizations, health concerns, and other travel resources appropriate for any destination worldwide on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travel website.

### Online legal driving behavior monitoring for self-driving vehicles [^d8ff079c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The minimum allowable time difference to intersection pointis determined using the SIND dataset, and it addresses whether left-turning vehicles do not interfere with straight-moving vehicles at an intersection with shared traffic lights for left-turning and straight-moving vehicles. Using the SIND dataset, data instances were retained in which the time interval between left-turning and straight-moving vehicles passing through the intersection point of their trajectories was less than 5 s, resulting in 554 recorded instances. Utilizing the filtered instances, the positions of the intersection points of the left-turning and straight-moving vehicle trajectories were obtained. The time sequences TTI left andrequired for the left-turning vehicle and straight-moving vehicles to reach their corresponding intersection point were calculated according to the speed and distance to the intersection point in each frame. The TTI left andfor each instance are presented in Fig. 6 a. Circular marker points correspond to the data points in Fig. 6 b. As shown, in scenarios involving conflicts between left-turning and straight-moving traffic, two main typical situations exist: 1) Straight-moving vehicles pass the conflict zone first (including left-turn vehicles give way). 2) Left-turn vehicles pass through the conflict zone first (including the left-turn vehicle rush). To assess compliance with intersection regulations, it is customary to establish virtual lane boundaries to analyze vehicle movements. For a typical unprotected left-turn intersection, an example conflict scenario between left turning and straight movement is shown, and the corresponding virtual lane lines are presented in Fig. 6 c.

### Assessment of speed and position during human locomotion using nondifferential GPS [^17953007]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To validate a nondifferential global positioning system (GPS) to measure speed, displacement, and position during human locomotion.

Methods

Three healthy participants walked and ran over straight and curved courses for 59 and 34 trials, respectively. A nondifferential GPS receiver provided speed data by Doppler shift and change in GPS position over time, which were compared with actual speeds determined by chronometry. Displacement data from the GPS were compared with a surveyed 100-m section, and static positions were collected for 1 h and compared with the known geodetic point.

Results

GPS speed values on the straight course were closely correlated with actual speeds (Doppler shift: r = 0.9994, P < 0.001, Delta GPS position/time: r = 0.9984, P < 0.001). Actual speed errors were lowest using the Doppler shift method (90.8% of values within +/- 0.1 m x s(-1)). Speed was slightly underestimated on a curved path, though still highly correlated with actual speed (Doppler shift: r = 0.9985, P < 0.001, Delta GPS distance/time: r = 0.9973, P < 0.001). Distance measured by GPS was 100.46 +/- 0.49 m, and 86.5% of static points were within 1.5 m of the actual geodetic point (mean error: 1.08 +/- 0.34 m, range 0.69-2.10 m).

Conclusions

Nondifferential GPS demonstrated a highly accurate estimation of speed across a wide range of human locomotion velocities using only the raw signal data with a minimal decrease in accuracy around bends. This high level of resolution was matched by accurate displacement and position data. Coupled with reduced size, cost, and ease of use, this method offers a valid alternative to differential GPS in the study of overground locomotion.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^da608457]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

What would change under structured evidence planning, production, and evaluation?

Movement toward a mindset and culture for comprehensive thinking within and between all points

The foundational premise of SEPPE is that problems and potential failures are inevitable, especially during and across siloed activities sited within the complex earlier developmental and postlicensing worlds. Thus, SEPPE would overcome current limitations facing each actor and decision‐maker in the current linear, sequential stage‐gate approach (e.g. preclinical investigations; successive phases of clinical trials; initial authorization; reimbursement; and product use), in which each activity has been habitually approached by its particular participants as an all‐or‐nothing proposition, and the therapeutic product either fails or goes on to the next activity. SEPPE would invite comprehensive, anticipatory/forward thinking across each and all steps and activities, together, while prompting agile feedback and continual adjustment strategies, to maximize the chance to get to the long‐term goal: making sure patients have fit‐for‐purpose, high quality therapeutic products and information for their use, rather than letting products fail because avoidable problems were not addressed up‐front and were not managed to avert collateral damage at other points in development.

### Human running performance from real-world big data [^b293652c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Importance of endurance

Our findings demonstrate the strong sensitivity of performance to endurance. For example, a runner with a velocity of v m = 5 m s −1 can improve his/her marathon time from 3 h 27 min 38 s to 2 h 53 min 8 s by doubling endurance from E l = 3 to E l = 6 (corresponding to a change in the one-hour utilization from 79 to 87% of VO 2max), without any change in VO 2,max or running economy. We also find that faster runners tend to race more consistently over all race distances than slower runners, highlighted by the dependence of the prediction error Δ T m on the marathon finishing time (see Fig. 4 b). For example, within our fastest group of runners with a marathon time below 160 min, the prediction error was typically less than ±2.5%. This observation supports our explanation for the observed uncertainty in the endurance parameter E l.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^5f354c75]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### Investigating the tradeoffs between spatial resolution and diffusion sampling for brain mapping with diffusion tractography: time well spent? [^8800351f]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

Interest in mapping white matter pathways in the brain has peaked with the recognition that altered brain connectivity may contribute to a variety of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Diffusion tractography has emerged as a popular method for postmortem brain mapping initiatives, including the ex-vivo component of the human connectome project, yet it remains unclear to what extent computer-generated tracks fully reflect the actual underlying anatomy. Of particular concern is the fact that diffusion tractography results vary widely depending on the choice of acquisition protocol. The two major acquisition variables that consume scan time, spatial resolution, and diffusion sampling, can each have profound effects on the resulting tractography. In this analysis, we determined the effects of the temporal tradeoff between spatial resolution and diffusion sampling on tractography in the ex-vivo rhesus macaque brain, a close primate model for the human brain. We used the wealth of autoradiography-based connectivity data available for the rhesus macaque brain to assess the anatomic accuracy of six time-matched diffusion acquisition protocols with varying balance between spatial and diffusion sampling. We show that tractography results vary greatly, even when the subject and the total acquisition time are held constant. Further, we found that focusing on either spatial resolution or diffusion sampling at the expense of the other is counterproductive. A balanced consideration of both sampling domains produces the most anatomically accurate and consistent results.

### Guidelines for handling decedents contaminated with radioactive materials [^98a1a179]. CDC (2007). Medium credibility.

Radiological contamination detection of individuals—parameter values and estimated time to monitor an adult are provided by instrument/detector combination. For CD-V-700 with side window detector, probe speed is 4 inches/second, height of probe 0.25 to 0.5 inches, path width 0.6 inches, and circulated time needed to monitor an adult 19 minutes. For CD V-718 with end window detector, probe speed is 3 inches/second, height of probe 0.5 to 1 inches, path width 1 inches, and time 12 minutes. For all tested instruments with pancake detectors, except the Victoreen 190, probe speed is 6 inches/second, height of probe 1 to 3 inches, path width 2 inches, and time 3.9 minutes. For Victoreen 190 with pancake detector, probe speed is 6 inches/second, height of probe 1 to 4 inches, path width 3 inches, and time 2.6 minutes. These values are based on the ability to detect 0.1 µCi of contamination on a small spot of skin in background gamma radiation levels up to 0.1mR/hr, and a footnote notes that audible detection is not possible in a background gamma radiation level of 0.1 mR/h and that values are for use in background levels of 0.02 mR/h or lower. When using a probe to check a surface for contamination, the user needs to determine 3 parameters from the manufacturer—speed of the probe, height above the surface, and distance between consecutive surveys.

### Novel insights into in-vivo diffusion tensor cardiovascular magnetic resonance using computational modeling and a histology-based virtual microstructure [^2e5ec7cb]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

At the beginning of each timestep of duration d t, an initial displacement vectoris drawn with each of its components R i following a normal distribution with mean μ = 0 and variance σ 2 = 2 D d t. The step length is therefore scaled by the local diffusivity D, which is either the intra‐ or extra‐cellular diffusivity (D IC, D EC). To ensure robustness in the random walk and limit the search space of possible myocyte boundary intersections, the normal distribution is limited to ±5σ by rejection sampling (see the convergence study in Supporting Information Figure S2). Values of R i larger than this are discarded and a new random value is drawn.

Depending on the local tissue geometry (represented as a triangulated surface mesh) encountered in the particle's path, sub‐stepsare performed such that, where M is one more than the number of boundary intersections encountered in the current timestep. The time‐varying positionof the particle after performing a single timestep d t is then given byThe Möller–Trumbore algorithm, 37 accelerated through bounding boxes, was used to test for intersections with cardiomyocyte boundaries. Elastic reflection was modelled using the local boundary normalof the intersected mesh surface, whereThe remaining step size after the reflection is used as the initial step size in the next sub‐step. Figure 2 illustrates how a possible displacement is resolved.

Single-time RJMCMC

The single-time steps deal with moves on a single individual time point. These consist of six moves, four RJMCMC moves, and two standard MCMC moves. The four RJMCMC moves are: add a point, remove a point, split a point into two points, and merge two points into one point. Adding a point k = m t + 1 to time point t consists of a transition from, where. To simulate an accurate draw from the posterior of, we draw a new set of parameters for, where the shape parameters are drawn from their time varying prior distributions (uniform if no previous exists (rotation)), and the location is drawn from an empirical proposal distribution. Standard MCMC methods are used to update the parameters of the new point using a slice sampler and are intermixed with a linking step to establish parent/child relationships from the previous time pointas described in the following linking step. After updating the parameters and linking the parents for the point, the addition of the new point is then accepted or rejected using the acceptance ratio described in. The remove move performs the opposite, drawing a point j from time t from an empirical proposal and choosing either to accept or reject the move. The merge move operates by taking two individual points, c j,t and c k,t, and merging them into one new point, c l,t, whose parameters are set to the mean parameters of the previous two points. The merged point then undergoes an updating and linking step similar to the add move and is either accepted or rejected. The split move is the reverse of the merge move, and splits one point c l,t into two points, c j,t and c k,t, where the new parameters are then drawn from the previous distributions, and the location is drawn from an orthogonal split along the location of previous points. The parameters and parents of each new point are then sampled similarly and either accepted or rejected. In addition to the reversible jump moves, there are also two standard MCMC moves. The first is an update point move, which involves updating the parameters and parents of each individual point. The second move, is a relink area move, which uniformly samples a pointfrom all points at time t, selects all points within a radius r of c j,t, and updates their parent cell relationship.

2.3 MRI scan and processing

Ultrahigh‐field anatomical MRI was acquired using an 11.7T NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). A single‐channel 30‐mm Bruker volume coil was used for both radio frequency transmission and reception. For MRI scans, the brain tissues were transferred to PBS with 2 mM gadopentetate dimeglumine for 48 h. They were then placed inside 50‐mL conical tubes filled with proton‐free liquid (Fomblin: Ausimont, Thorofare, NJ, USA). Air bubbles were removed by placing the samples in a vacuum chamber for more than 30 min before taking the MRI scans. To acquire three‐dimensional T2‐weighted images (3DT2WI) using rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE), the following parameters were applied: echo time = 18 ms; repetition time = 2500 ms; RARE factor = 8; signal average = 4. The field of view was 40 × 30 × 16 mm 3, and the matrix size was 160 × 120 × 64, which was zero‐filled to 320 × 240 × 128, resulting in a final resolution of 250 µm isotropic (zipped to 125 µm isotropic). For DTI and tractography, diffusion‐weighted gradient and spin echo sequences with navigator phase correction were applied to the ex vivo brain tissue.The scan parameters were as follows: echo time = 58 ms; repetition time = 600 ms; 2 signal averages; 2 b0 images; and 18 diffusion directions with b ‐value = 2000 s/mm 2. The temperature during the scan was 27°C. The field of view and matrix size were the same as those of 3DT2WI. The total scan time for each brain tissue was 10 h.

DtiStudio software was used for tensor calculation. The linear registration method minimized a cost function based on mean square tensor fitting errors to correct eddy current distortion and motion of the tissue.The pixels with artifactual signal were eliminated from the tensor calculation using the corrected Inter‐Slice Intensity Discontinuity algorithm.Three eigenvalues were extracted from the tensor field to calculate FA values. The FA map was color‐coded by the principal eigenvectors shown in red (medial–lateral orientation), green (anterior–posterior orientation), and blue (superior–inferior orientation). The Gibbs ringing artifactwas removed from all the images using MRtrix3 software (; RRID:SCR_006971).

Scuba diving barotrauma—ear/sinus and pulmonary overpressure—details mechanisms, risk factors, symptoms, and urgent actions. In the ear, the eardrum being pushed into the middle ear space can cause “pain, bleeding, and possibly rupture and even injury to the inner ear,” and “Forceful equalization under these conditions can increase the pressure differential … resulting in round window rupture with perilymph leakage and inner ear damage”; “Healthcare professionals can coach this effort by observing movement of the tympanic membrane using simple otoscopy.” For sinuses, “Paranasal sinuses … are especially susceptible to barotrauma, generally on descent,” with risk factors including “Use of solid earplugs,” “Medication (e.g., overuse or prolonged use of decongestants leading to rebound congestion),” “Ear or sinus surgery,” “Nasal deformity or polyps,” and “Chronic nasal and sinus disease that interferes with equilibration during the large barometric pressure changes encountered while diving.” Divers who suspect ear or sinus barotrauma “should discontinue diving and seek medical attention.” Symptoms of ear barotrauma include “Decreased hearing,” “Pain,” “Sensation of fullness,” “Sensation of “water in the ear” (serous fluid/ blood accumulation in the middle ear),” “Tinnitus (ringing in the ears),” and “Vertigo (dizziness or sensation of spinning).” For pulmonary injury, “Scuba divers can reduce the risk for lung overpressure problems by breathing normally and ascending slowly when breathing compressed gas,” because “Overexpansion of the lungs can result if a scuba diver ascends toward the surface without exhaling.” During ascent, bubbles can escape into “3 possible locations: the pleural space, mediastinum, or pulmonary vasculature,” with pleural entry causing “lung collapse or pneumothorax,” mediastinal entry causing “mediastinal emphysema” that can track subcutaneously or to the larynx with “a change in voice characteristics,” and alveolar rupture leading to “arterial gas embolism (AGE).” “Mediastinal or subcutaneous emphysema might resolve spontaneously, but pneumothorax generally requires specific treatment to remove the air and reinflate the lung,” and “AGE is a medical emergency, requiring urgent intervention with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (recompression treatment).”

Solid lines represent the non-linear smooth of the relationship between utilization and travel time, inside the HSS catchment (red) or in the rest of the district (RoD, blue) B Percentage of pregnant women included in each of 80 clusters in cohort surveys (points) who accessed each maternal care service. Solid lines represent the non-linear smooth of the relationship between access and travel time, inside the HSS catchment (red) or in the rest of the district (RoD, blue)

Impact of geographical barriers to maternal care access

Temporal trends as a function of travel time to health facilities were relatively stable for all four indicators of maternal care access during the study period (Fig. 3). In the HSS catchment, women residing in fokontany within an hour distance had rates of per capita utilization roughly twice that of those who lived 1–2 h away and three times higher than those who lived more than 2 h away (Fig. 3 A). The only exception was ANC1, where these differences were smaller. Women living over two hours away had the Lowest utilization rates, at under 0.2 per capita-year for ANC4, deliveries and postnatal care, with similar trends in both the HSS intervention catchment and the RoD. We observed similar patterns in cohort data, where women residing within 1 h had substantially higher levels of health care access in the HSS catchment, consistently over 75% for ANC1 and ANC4, and over 50% for deliveries and postnatal care for both survey years (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with analyses of health system data, women living over 2 h from a PHC had levels of health care access under 25% for ANC4, deliveries and postnatal care, regardless of HSS support. However, for those from the RoD, access for women who lived 1–2 h from a PHC was relatively similar to those who lived over 2 h (Fig. 3 B).

Post-travel respiratory infections—prevention and infection control emphasize that vaccines are available to prevent or reduce severity of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, diphtheria, H. influenzae type b, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, pneumococcal disease, varicella, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Unless contraindicated, travelers should be up to date with COVID-19 and influenza vaccines and other routine immunizations, especially against S. pneumoniae, RSV, and measles. Preventing respiratory illness while traveling might not be possible, but travelers can follow common-sense measures, including adhering to current recommendations regarding advisability of travel and any indicated precautions (e.g., mask wearing, physical distancing); minimizing close contact with people who are coughing or sneezing; avoiding live animal markets; frequently washing hands, either with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing ≥60% alcohol when soap and water are not available; and, if the traveler has a preexisting eustachian tube dysfunction, using a vasoconstricting nasal spray immediately before air travel, which might decrease the likelihood of otitis or barotrauma.

a. Number of approaches: calculated by counting the number of times in which patients moved into the area in front of a door from a wide angle. For each door, the approach area is defined for this study by a semicircle with a radius 20 cm greater than half the width of the door. An approach is counted when patients enter the area with a trajectory that is within 75° of the normal of the door (Fig. 2), calculated autonomously between 2 adjacent x-y data points using three prior data points. Back-and-forth movement on the radius of a door does not trigger multiple approaches if it is within 2 seconds of the previous approach, where 2 seconds provided the smallest Euclidean distance within the minimum sampling rate of 1 Hz. Whether or not an initial approach was made was independent of the speed of entry into the area of approach.
i) Number of approaches (own room): calculated by counting the number of approaches to a room in which the approaching patient had occupied overnight.
ii) Number of approaches (others room): calculated by counting the number of approaches to rooms for which the approaching patient did not occupy overnight.
b. Number of entrances: the number of approaches that are followed by an entrance into a room; entrances are detected only when a patient moves from the hallway into a room for more than 2 seconds.
c. Entrance ratio: ratio calculated between number of approaches and entrances of patients to a specific door. A higher ratio value indicates that the door is approached often, but the room is not entered as frequently.
d. Own-room rate: the rate at which a patient enters their own room divided by the total number of entrances to any room (own + other). A higher percentage indicates that patients enter their own room more frequently than others’ rooms.
e. Dwell time: time in seconds that patients spend within the approach area. Time is only counted if the patient spends longer than 2 seconds per instance to avoid counting time passing by while walking in the hallway.

### Choice of reference measurements affects quantification of long diffusion time behaviour using stimulated echoes [^7a3d379d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

For models that rely on accurate estimation of ADC values (12,48), it becomes important to carefully consider the measurement regime, as not all regimes are equally affected. The exact sampling locations of the reference and diffusion‐weighted measurements along the decay curve determine the extent of the induced diffusion time dependence. In the low‐contrast regime, the effect is small: The linear extrapolation to the b = 0 ms/μm 2 intercept is reasonably accurate. Higher b 0 ‐values for the reference measurement at the longest diffusion time spread the sampled points for fixed‐ q 0 design over a larger range of the decay curve, and therefore result in a larger induced diffusion time dependence (Fig. 2).

Although these effects were demonstrated in postmortem tissue, the results presented here should apply to in vivo data. Postmortem tissue has been shown to exhibit similar diffusion time dependence to in vivo tissue (49). Our measurements had a slight residual variation in the b ‐value with Δ and gradient direction (b min = 3.39 ms·μm −2 at Δ = 70 ms quadratically increasing to b max = 3.45 ms·μm −2 at Δ = 400 ms along the slice‐select axis). Considering the relatively small size of the b ‐value variation in comparison to the b 0 ‐variation and the use of the same diffusion‐weighted data in both analyses, this does not invalidate our fixed‐ b 0 versus fixed‐ q 0 comparison and conclusions. Another remaining issue is the directional bias 27 caused by the particular direction of the diffusion weighting in the b 0 ‐image, with respect to all directions in the shell. One solution for this would be to acquire a reference image for each direction and diffusion time at the cost of significant increase in scan time.

### Specialist team retrieval of head injured patients: fact, fiction, or formula? [^cef15bf6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This feasibility study aimed to determine the maximum theoretical distance the Edinburgh Paediatric Retrieval Team (EPRT) could travel to retrieve head injured children without additional delay in reaching definitive care.

Design

A prospective audit was conducted over 2 years to determine the current practice for paediatric head injury transfers (stabilisation, referral, and transfer time) undertaken by primary hospital staff, and the performance (mobilisation and travel time) of the EPRT. A novel formula was devised and used to determine the theoretical maximum radius within which the EPRT could reach a referring hospital during their stabilisation of head injured patients.

Measurements and Results

During the study period, 27 head injured patients were transferred to our unit by road and the EPRT conducted 194 road retrievals. The median stabilisation time for the head injured patients was 3.6 h. Median time to refer these patients to neurosurgical services was 1 h after presenting to primary hospitals. Median mobilisation time for EPRT was 1 h. Using our novel formula, 67 miles was the theoretical maximum radius within which the EPRT could reach a referring hospital during their stabilisation of head injured patients.

Conclusions

Specialist team retrieval of paediatric head injury is a possibility, but not without significant organisational changes such as availability of second teams, early referral of patients and utilisation of the mobilisation time as a cancellation window. Our novel formula offers other teams a starting point to assess their own performance and to develop services.

TABLE 3 
Changes in T 1, T 2, and D reported in the literature due to fixation and washing in PBS.

Thus, for both fresh ex vivo and fixed tissue, the drop in diffusivity is typically on the order of approximately two to five at room temperature, which corresponds to increasing the b ‐value by a similar factor to match the attenuation expected from an in vivo dMRI protocol. For post‐mortem human samples, however, due to non‐negligible post‐mortem interval and an extended duration of immersion fixation needed to preserve cell and tissue components, the diffusivity is often on the order of 85% lower than in vivo,,also in agreement with animal studies with extended PMI.Consequently, going beyond DTI protocols, including DKI and other advanced dMRI methods is sometimes challenging on post‐mortem human tissue due to the prohibitively high b ‐values required. For DTI, an adjusted b ‐value to about 4000 s/mm 2 has been shown to result in similar signal attenuation as for an in vivo b = 1000 s/mm 2 scan, and provide the angular contrast needed to resolve crossing fibers for tractography.It should, however, be noted that the optimal b ‐value for post‐mortem acquisitions is a function of tissue fixation and scanning temperature and should be evaluated for each experiment individually.

Because of changes in diffusivity, it is important to consider spatial scales that are being probed. As diffusivity drops, diffusion distances proportional todrop as well—unless the diffusion time is prolonged accordingly—which results in different interactions between water molecules and the microscopic features they are able to probe. This may be beneficial when interested in probing geometry on small scales and also extends the limit of the narrow pulse approximation validity.This is additionally important in MR microscopy, where the resolutions start to approach the diffusion length scales,and a significant amount of water may diffuse out of the imaging voxels in the TE such that the spatial resolution is no longer “real.”

Below, we provide guidelines for common applications of ex vivo imaging: signal representations (DTI/DKI), tractography, and biophysical signals models.

### Drainage explains soil liquefaction beyond the earthquake near-field [^73ddd3be]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The time of liquefaction event termination, t e, used as the timescale factor in Fig. 2, is determined as the time at which the soil compaction slows down significantly (see Fig. 2 b), as an approximation of t e = t i + L / u front, where L is the distance to the surface from z front (t = t i). In most cases, t i is negligible in comparison to L / u front since the downward moving unloading front (Fig. 6 inset) is very fast.

The theoretical time of a liquefaction event in Fig. 4 b (semi-transparent symbols) was extrapolated to a 5-m deep soil layer, based on the relationship between the measured compaction front velocity in simulations and experiments, and the input seismic energy density. The synthetic high permeability data (κ = 10 −9 m 2) was calculated based on the power-law prediction derived from simulations (Fig. 3 d and section “Drained liquefaction beyond the near field in simulations and experiments”), by substituting the numerical characteristic permeability with the synthetic permeability. The actual time of liquefaction (opaque symbols in Fig. 4 b) was calculated as the minimum value between the theoretical time (t e) and earthquake duration of t E Q = 30 s. The sloping blue line is the best fit for the data points which satisfy t e < t E Q. The surface settlement in Fig. 4 c was calculated as the integral of the settlement velocity (Eq. (6)), between t = 0 and. The blue and red horizontal trend lines represent the mean value of data points associated with t e > t E Q. The gray sloping line represents the amount of settlement resulting from the synthetically adapted power-law prediction, as described above.

### Flocking at a distance in active granular matter [^c0716331]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The self-organized motion of vast numbers of creatures in a single direction is a spectacular example of emergent order. Here, we recreate this phenomenon using actuated nonliving components. We report here that millimetre-sized tapered rods, rendered motile by contact with an underlying vibrated surface and interacting through a medium of spherical beads, undergo a phase transition to a state of spontaneous alignment of velocities and orientations above a threshold bead area fraction. Guided by a detailed simulation model, we construct an analytical theory of this flocking transition, with two ingredients: a moving rod drags beads; neighbouring rods reorient in the resulting flow like a weathercock in the wind. Theory and experiment agree on the structure of our phase diagram in the plane of rod and bead concentrations and power-law spatial correlations near the phase boundary. Our discovery suggests possible new mechanisms for the collective transport of particulate or cellular matter.

### Three-dimensional wave breaking [^10c24ed3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

3D ‘global steepness’

We now introduce a measure akin to the global steepness that accounts for the effects of directional spreading. For directionally spread (3D) linear waves, the surface slope has two orthogonal components:andThe directions in which waves propagate affect how they contribute to the total surface slope. When calculating S in equation (4), which corresponds to the maximum possible 2D linear slope (M = 1 and θ = 0), the phase argument in equation (5) is ignored. A similar approach may be used to calculate a 3D equivalent of S :For broadbanded spectra, the slope maxima of each component are not necessarily colocated in space. As a result, the 3D global slope S 3D can be quite different from the maximum achievable slope for a linear focused wave group. Thus, we did not use S 3D in ‘Results’. To calculate the linear maximum achievable slope, we searched for the time and position at which the absolute slope was a maximum for a focused wave group based on each directional distribution. Extended Data Fig. 2 demonstrates how two focused wave groups with the same global steepness S can have different waveforms and local slopes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). The wave group in Extended Data Fig. 2a is unidirectional, whereas the wave group in Extended Data Fig. 2d is an axisymmetric standing wave.

Local steepness

Local measures of steepness, unlike the global steepness, implicitly capture the effects that nonlinear evolution and directionality may have on the waveform of steep waves. As a result, such measures may provide better descriptions of the free surface elevation at breaking onset for any given wave. The local steepness has various forms for which either a locally measured wave amplitude a or a height H (Extended Data Fig. 2) are non-dimensionalized using a chosen length scale, which is most commonly the wavelength λ (a k and k H /2, where k = 2π/ λ). The choice of length scale and the manner by which it is calculated (in space or time) have significant implications for the resulting measure of steepness. In highly spread conditions, even if highly resolved spatial measurements of surface elevation are available, the wavelength and other length scales become ill-defined. Even in 2D, where some of the aforementioned issues are resolved, the local steepness is not always a robust indicator of breaking onset. As a result, we have not used local steepness parameters herein.

### The backtracking survey propagation algorithm for solving random K-SAT problems [^7905ae97]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The SID algorithm then proceed by assigning variables (decimation step). According to SP equations, assigning a variable x i to its most probable value (that is, setting x i =1 if w i + > w i − and viceversa), the number of clusters gets multiplied by a factor, called bias

With the aim of decreasing the lesser the number of cluster and thus keeping the largest the number of solutions in each decimation step, SID assigns/decimate variables with the largest b i values. In order to keep the algorithm efficient, at each step of decimation a small fraction f of variables is assigned, such that in O (log N) steps of decimation a solution can be found.

After each step of decimation, the SP equations are solved again on the subproblem, which is obtained by removing satisfied clauses and by reducing clauses containing a false literal (unless a zero-length clause is generated, and in that case the algorithm returns a failure). The complexity and the biases are updated according to the new fixed point messages, and a new decimation step is performed.

The main idea of the SID algorithm is that fixing variables that are almost certain to their most probable value, one can reduce the size of the problem without reducing too much the number of solutions. The evolution of the complexity Σ during the SID algorithm can be very informative. Indeed it is found that, if Σ becomes too small or negative, the SID algorithm is likely to fail, either because the iterative method for solving the SP equations no longer converges to a fixed point or because a contradiction is generated by assigning variables. In these cases the SID algorithm returns a failure. On the contrary, if Σ always remains well positive, the SID algorithm reduces so much the problem, that eventually a trivial SP fixed point,, is reached. This is a strong hint that the remaining subproblem is easy and the SID algorithm tries to solve it by WalkSat.

A careful analysis of the SID algorithm for random 3-SAT problems of size N = O (10 5) shows that the algorithmic threshold achievable by SID is α a SID =4.2525 (ref.), which is close, but definitely smaller than the SAT-UNSAT threshold α s =4.2667.

The running time of the SID algorithm experimentally measured is O (N log(N)).

### Optimum b value for resolving crossing fibers: a study with standard clinical b value using 1.5-T MR [^4ab31233]. Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Our study population comprised 10 healthy volunteers (five men and five women; mean age, 26.3 years; age range, 22–32 years) without any history of neurologic injury or psychiatric disease. No subjects had abnormal neurologic signs or symptoms. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the MR examinations.

Imaging technique

All images were obtained using a 1.5-T whole body scanner (Gyroscan Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a six-channel phased-array head coil. Single-shot echo-planar imaging was used for diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) (repetition time, 5,000 ms; echo times (TEs), 55, 65, 72, and 78 ms) with a motion-probing gradient in 32 orientations and b values of 700, 1,400, 2,100, and 2,800 s/mm 2. The selected TEs were the shortest possible, depending on the selected b values. We only imaged the optic chiasm, superior cerebellar peduncle, and red nucleus to minimize the scan duration. The scan durations for each b value were kept constant (3 min), since the aim of the study was to find the optimum b value to be used within a clinically feasible time frame. These 3-min DTI protocols were repeated twice, and the data were averaged after image reconstruction in order to increase the SNR.

A parallel imaging technique was used to record 128 × 37 data points, which could be reconstructed into images equivalent to 76 × 76 resolution. A total of 12 slices with a thickness of 3.0 mm each were obtained without interslice gaps. The field of view was 230 × 230 mm; thus, the size of a voxel was 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm.

Image postprocessing

The diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were transferred to an offline workstation for registration, averaging, and analysis (Precision 530; Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA). PRIDE software (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) written in Interactive Data Language (RSI, Inc. Boulder, CO, USA) was used for image analysis. A total of 32 acquisitions using different diffusion-sensitizing gradients were performed, which were registered with respect to the b = 0 measurement using the method of Netsch et al. This was done to remove distortion and possible head motion over various slices and scans. Affine transformation was used for registration.

Red and cyan dotted lines depict linear fits to the MSD within the time intervals of 0–4.5 ps and 6–9 ps, respectively. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

For quantifying the proton’s diffusion rate, we have calculated the mean squared displacement (MSD) vs. time as depicted in Fig. 3 d. To improve the statistical accuracy, we employed here the multiple origin method, while results using a single origin are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. In this method, multiple trajectory segments are generated from a single trajectory by truncating progressively longer sections from its origin (the truncated segments are in multiples of Δ t, here Δ t = 250 fs). The new origins are superimposed and the segments averaged together.

We find that the MSD is not linear over the entire timescale. Rather, it changes slope at time t *. Therefore, we fit two linear equations, one around 3 ps and the other around 7 ps (dotted lines in Fig. 3 d). Division by 6 gives two three-dimensional diffusion coefficients, D s h o r t and D l o n g, as summarized in Table 1. In all cases D l o n g > D s h o r t and both are larger than, the proton diffusion coefficient in pure water.

The result for an excess proton in pure water (Supplementary Fig. 2) is given in the last row. It is close to the experimental value of 0.93 Å 2 /ps, supporting the use of DFTB3 for proton diffusion.

Respiratory infections in travelers—prevention and infection control emphasize that vaccines are available to prevent or reduce severity of multiple respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, diphtheria, H. influenzae type b (in young children), influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, pneumococcal disease, varicella, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and unless contraindicated, travelers should be up to date with COVID-19 and influenza vaccines and other routine immunizations, especially against S. pneumoniae, RSV, and measles. Preventing respiratory illness while traveling might not be possible, but travelers can follow common-sense measures, including adhering to current recommendations regarding advisability of travel and any indicated precautions (e.g., mask wearing, physical distancing); minimizing close contact with people who are coughing or sneezing; avoiding live animal markets; frequently washing hands, either with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing ≥60% alcohol when soap and water are not available; and, if the traveler has a preexisting eustachian tube dysfunction, using a vasoconstricting nasal spray immediately before air travel, which might decrease the likelihood of otitis or barotrauma. Healthcare workers should use recommended infection-control measures while managing any patient with a respiratory infection.

### Four-dimensional surface motions of the slumgullion landslide and quantification of hydrometeorological forcing [^57733232]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Spatial displacement patterns

The 98 scenes of Sentinel-1 SAR reveal displacement details over the more slowly deforming head and toe areas of the landslide (Fig. 1b, c). The fast-moving middle parts are not resolvable due to extreme InSAR phase gradients at the available Sentinel-1 orbital period, radar wavelength, and the amount of displacement over a short distance (see “Methods” for details). We refine the boundaries of a kinematic element in an area of ~0.35 km 2 below the crest of the prehistoric landslide (Fig. 1a), which accounts for ~1/3rd of the previously mapped mobile area,,. We further update the structural zones, : head zone (kinematic elements #1–3) exposed by extensional fractures, zone of stretching (#4–6) characterized by broad bands of tension cracks and normal faults, hopper and neck (#7–8) resembling a funnel, zone of marginal pull-apart basins (#9–10) accompanying widening of the slide, and toe (#11–12) overriding inactive surfaces. The current major source of debris supply appears to be on the upper flank of the head (blackish area in Fig. 1b, c with motion to east). Here, the sediments are transported along a curved track parallel to the margin between elements 1 and 2, at a large angle from the main stream of the slide.

### Confronting drowsy driving: the American Academy of Sleep Medicine perspective [^64f6c61e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Drowsy driving—individual risk factors, symptoms, and immediate actions are outlined as follows: The average adult needs 7 or more hours of sleep per night, and even sleeping for at least 7 hours per night may be insufficient if an undiagnosed sleep disorder impairs sleep quality; non-traditional work schedules (e.g., shift-work) can disrupt and shorten sleep time. Symptoms include frequent yawning or difficulty keeping eyes open, “nodding off” or trouble keeping the head up, inability to remember the last few miles, missing road signs or turns, difficulty maintaining speed, and drifting out of the lane. If drowsiness occurs while driving, you should pull off the road and rest until no longer sleepy; caffeinated beverages can temporarily increase alertness but are not a substitute for adequate sleep, and turning up the radio, opening the window, or turning up the air conditioner are not effective. Preventive measures include getting plenty of sleep before long drives and using a designated driver or alternate drivers rather than risk driving while drowsy when a long trip is planned and tiredness is anticipated.

### Surviving out of hospital cardiac arrest at home: a postcode lottery? [^81378e8f]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To find out if the response time, distance travelled to scene, and geographical location affect survival from out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

Retrospective cohort study over 10 years, 1 December 1991 to 1 August 2001. Outcome and demographic data were obtained for 1956 OHCAs occurring at home, in the Lothians region, from the Heartstart Scotland database. Survival rates to hospital admission and discharge were examined by postcode district.

Results

Certain postcode areas were served by quicker response times and shorter journeys. The survival to admission rate was greater in those areas where the median response time was <10 minutes (13.5% versus 8.1%, p<0.05). There was greater survival to discharge in these areas but not significantly so (4.1% versus 3.2%, p = 0.42). Survival to admission was more likely in areas where the median distance travelled was <four miles (13.3% versus 9.7%, p<0.05) but not survival to discharge (4.0% versus 3.7%, p = 0.72). A close correlation between distance travelled and response time was shown (Pearson = 0.93, p<0.01), likewise between distance travelled and survival to admission (Spearman = -0.87, p<0.01). Certain areas, particularly those at greater geographical distance from ambulance dispatch points, were found to be associated with significantly lower survival to admission rates.

Conclusions

Survival to admission from OHCA is strongly influenced by response time and distance travelled to the scene. The geographical location of an arrest can potentially influence survival to admission. Measures should be taken to strategically position ambulance dispatch points and to task the nearest geographically available vehicle to attend an OHCA.

### Neurogenomic and behavioral principles shape freezing dynamics and synergistic performance in drosophila melanogaster [^d5db0e64]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Here, the intercept β 0 was used as an index of response threshold, representing flies’ visual responsiveness toward motion cues of other conspecifics. To accurately estimate the logistic curve fitting to the visual response of each strain of flies, we pooled the data of all stimulating trials (6 individuals × 20 trials × 20 replicates = 2400 data points at maximum) and conducted above regression for each strain. In case for the dataset of GAL4/UAS strains, we randomly sampled 500 data points from all the dataset of a given strain to perform logistic regression and repeated it for 20 times to obtain the β 0 estimates for the population. Considering that the primary focus of this study is on the responsiveness to conspecifics, we further quantified this by introducing an additional metric: the mean cumulated motion cues each individual received on freezing exit (defined as moving speed > 4 mm/s). We then sought to identify genetic variants associated with this metric. The results similarly indicated genetic involvement of nervous system (Fig. S20 and Supplementary Data 8). Thus, given the high correlation between males and females, we decided to use the previously mentioned metric (β 0) as the main result.

Given the significant observation of male chasing behavior across several strains, we quantified both the duration of chasing and chaining behavior (involving three or more individuals in a chain) within the initial 5 min of experiment. Chasing is defined based on three criteria: (1) both individuals must be moving at a speed greater than 1 mm/s; (2) their orientations must be aligned within an angular difference of π/4; and (3) the distance between them must be less than 3 mm. Chaining behavior occurs when these chasing interactions form a sequence, such that individual A chases B, and B chases C, establishing a continuous chain of chases.

Spatial variation in antenatal care (ANC1) and deliveries in Ifanadiana District, 2016–2018. A Annualized per capita utilization out of expected pregnant women, estimated as the fokontany average from data of all health centers. B Percentage of pregnant women included in each of 80 clusters in cohort surveys (black circle) who accessed each maternal care service, with values interpolated using inverse distance weighted interpolation

Geographic trends in maternal care access were observed for all indicators, with slight differences between the HSS intervention catchment and RoD (Fig. 2). There was a consistent decline in utilization rates for women living at increasing travel time from health centers, but women in the HSS catchment who lived in close proximity to health centers had higher rates of maternal care access than those in the RoD. The decrease was particularly pronounced for ANC4, deliveries and postnatal care, were we observed an exponential decline as a function of travel time. Annual per capita utilization rates for women living over 2 h from a PHC was consistently under 0.25 for ANC4, deliveries and postnatal care in both catchment areas (Fig. 2 A). Maternal care access from cohort data revealed similar patterns, with a smaller decline for ANC1 than for the rest of maternal indicators (Fig. 2 B). The decline in women's access to PHC was particularly pronounced within the first 2 h of travel time from the facility. Beyond this point, ANC4 access remains stable at about 25% for women in the HSS catchment, while it continues to decrease for deliveries and postnatal care until access is close to zero for women living further than 3 h from a PHC (Fig. 2 B). For women in the RoD, lower access overall meant that geographic trends were less pronounced.

### Addressing the minimum fleet problem in on-demand urban mobility [^a2b962b8]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Information and communication technologies have opened the way to new solutions for urban mobility that provide better ways to match individuals with on-demand vehicles. However, a fundamental unsolved problem is how best to size and operate a fleet of vehicles, given a certain demand for personal mobility. Previous studies 1-5 either do not provide a scalable solution or require changes in human attitudes towards mobility. Here we provide a network-based solution to the following 'minimum fleet problem', given a collection of trips (specified by origin, destination and start time), of how to determine the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all the trips without incurring any delay to the passengers. By introducing the notion of a 'vehicle-sharing network', we present an optimal computationally efficient solution to the problem, as well as a nearly optimal solution amenable to real-time implementation. We test both solutions on a dataset of 150 million taxi trips taken in the city of New York over one year 6 . The real-time implementation of the method with near-optimal service levels allows a 30 per cent reduction in fleet size compared to current taxi operation. Although constraints on driver availability and the existence of abnormal trip demands may lead to a relatively larger optimal value for the fleet size than that predicted here, the fleet size remains robust for a wide range of variations in historical trip demand. These predicted reductions in fleet size follow directly from a reorganization of taxi dispatching that could be implemented with a simple urban app; they do not assume ride sharing 7-9 , nor require changes to regulations, business models, or human attitudes towards mobility to become effective. Our results could become even more relevant in the years ahead as fleets of networked, self-driving cars become commonplace 10-14 .

### Association between pulse wave velocity and frailty, disability, and mortality in community-dwelling older Adults [^f258db17]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Study variables

Pulse wave velocity

Arterial stiffness was evaluated by assessing central PWV with a SphygmoCor (Actor Medical), following the protocol proposed by Laurent et al.Briefly, PWV was measured after 5-minute rest in the supine position at 21 to 25 °C of room temperature. The measurements were recorded between 9:00and 12:00to minimize diurnal variation effects. Subject weight and height were also recorded.

PWV was automatically calculated as the distance travelled by the pulse wave from the carotid to the femoral artery (in meters) divided by the time interval (in seconds). With this purpose, the proximal distance between the carotid pulse and sternal manubrium is measured. The distal distance is estimated between the femoral pulse located in the inner third of the inguinal crease and the sternal manubrium (Central Illustration). The PWV was measured twice, and the average of both measurements was analyzed. Performance of at least 2 measurements was required for inclusion in the analysis. If the difference between the 2 measurements was higher than 0.5 m/s, a third measurement was taken. The median value of PWV was finally recorded.

Central Illustration 
Association Between PWV and Frailty, Disability, and Mortality in Community-Dwelling Adults Older Than 65 Years of Age

Arterial stiffness was evaluated by assessing central pulse wave velocity (PWV) and was strongly associated with age. Segmented regression was used to identify PWV cut-off points associated with adverse outcomes (frailty, disability, and mortality). Different PWV cut-off points were identified for each of the outcomes. In those subjects with a PWV values over the cut-off point, PWV independently predicted the outcome. Conversely, in those subjects with PWV less than the cut-off point, age was the main determinant of outcome. D = distance; T = time.

### Service user satisfaction with telemedicine in an occupational healthcare setting [^ddc39d21]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Telemedicine has existed pre-pandemic and has been used in some healthcare settings with high patient satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telemedicine to help minimize transmission while maintaining service provision.

Aims

To assess service user satisfaction with telephone assessment and to assess distance/time saved by telephone assessment as services users did not have to travel to their appointment.

Methods

Prospective review of service users attending one occupational health clinic over a 1-month period. Service users were asked two questions regarding method of travel, and satisfaction with telephone review. All data captured were anonymous, and distances and times for travel were calculated for driving using Google Maps.

Results

Seventy-three service users were recruited to the review. Ninety per cent were reviewed by telephone and 10% reviewed in person. Eighty-eight per cent of service users were satisfied with telephone review. Seventy-eight per cent of service users planned to drive to Dr Steevens' Hospital. In total, 4058.4 km (77 h 6 min) of commuting was saved with phone reviews, and 2753.2 km (54 h 16 min) driving was saved.

Conclusions

Service user satisfaction with telephone review was found to be high, and telephone review resulted in saving of both commuting time for the healthcare worker, reduced time away from the workplace, as well as having a positive environmental impact.
