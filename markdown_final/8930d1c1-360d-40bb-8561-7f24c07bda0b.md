## Question

what is temporal hemianopia or central scotoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what temporal hemianopia and central scotoma are, with definitions, anatomy, etiologies, distinguishing clinical features, diagnostic testing, imaging, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about where along the visual pathway each defect localizes. Then, I should verify the characteristic field patterns and structure–function correlations on OCT. Next, I will review common causes and the appropriate perimetry strategy. After that, I need to check which imaging is warranted and why. Finally, I will consider treatment pathways and common pitfalls in differentiation.

> Let me first confirm temporal hemianopia: classically this is a bitemporal hemianopia respecting the vertical midline, pointing to a lesion at the optic chiasm where crossing nasal retinal fibers are preferentially injured; I should double-check that the resulting loss is of the temporal visual fields in both eyes with preservation of nasal fields early on, and that OCT often shows nasal macular ganglion cell thinning corresponding to injured crossing fibers, which fits the chiasmal localization.

> I need to ensure I cite typical causes correctly: pituitary macroadenomas are the leading etiology and frequently produce bitemporal hemianopia; other suprasellar masses such as craniopharyngioma and planum sphenoidale meningioma can compress the chiasm as well; wait, let me verify that meningiomas may also cause vascular compression of the chiasm or its blood supply as an alternative mechanism to direct mass effect [^114BHqot] [^113AoB47] [^113FVR1L].

> Now, central scotoma: I should confirm this denotes a defect involving the point of fixation and central field, usually from macular disease or damage to the papillomacular bundle within the optic nerve; hold on, I should verify that LHON classically begins with a cecocentral scotoma that may enlarge and that dyschromatopsia parallels acuity loss, and that in demyelinating optic neuritis (especially MS) central scotoma is common, whereas NMOSD often shows non-central patterns more frequently than MS [^112kirUL].

> I will now examine key clinical differences: temporal hemianopia respects the vertical meridian with outer hemifield loss and often relatively preserved acuity early unless macular or prechiasmal fibers are compromised, while central scotoma centers on fixation, does not respect meridians, and typically reduces acuity and color vision; wait, I should verify pupillary findings — pupils may remain relatively intact in LHON despite central loss, which can mislead if I don't correlate fields with structure [^113KjzPG].

> Next, I should review OCT correlations to anchor localization: in chiasmal compression I expect nasal macular GCC thinning from loss of crossing fibers, whereas in central scotoma from papillomacular bundle injury I anticipate temporal RNFL thinning and central macular GCC loss; hold on, I should verify that the macular naso-temporal ratio (mNTR) helps distinguish chiasmal compression (nasal-predominant macular atrophy) from glaucoma (temporal-predominant macular atrophy), improving diagnostic specificity when overall macular GCIPL thickness is reduced in either disorder [^112rkcBm].

> Let me think about perimetry strategy: for suspected bitemporal hemianopia, 24–2 or 30–2 automated perimetry is appropriate and can show the classic vertical meridian–respecting defect, while for central scotoma I should ensure high-resolution central testing with a 10–2 strategy to avoid underestimating central loss; wait, I should not rely on SITA Fast alone to monitor change over time given higher variability than SITA Standard [^112oNqEG] [^11117H4R] [^112tub8W].

> I need to check imaging next: if temporal hemianopia is suspected, an MRI of the brain with targeted sellar and parasellar sequences with contrast is mandatory to evaluate for chiasmal compression; conversely, for central scotoma, imaging is indicated when optic neuropathy or compressive/inflammatory causes are suspected, whereas primary macular disease should be clarified with retinal imaging first; hold on, I should verify guideline language that proximity of a pituitary lesion to the chiasm dictates the need and timing of formal visual field testing and MRI follow-up [^1118hfof] [^113iwuqn] [^115HzVKw].

> But wait, what about treatment trajectories: for chiasmal compression from pituitary macroadenoma, transsphenoidal decompression or disease-specific medical therapy (e.g., dopamine agonists for prolactinomas) can produce rapid field improvement; I should double-check the caveat that post-therapy chiasmal herniation into an enlarged sella may paradoxically worsen fields, necessitating dose adjustment or surgical consideration despite biochemical control [^114BHqot] [^117Xt65u] [^1128mAtg].

> For central scotoma, therapy is etiology-specific: LHON lacks proven disease-modifying therapy but supportive and investigational approaches continue, demyelinating optic neuritis requires timely immunotherapy and disease-specific management, macular disease is managed per retinal protocols, and vision rehabilitation leveraging preferred retinal loci can improve function; hold on, I should verify that PRL assessment is now standard in low-vision rehabilitation for central scotomas [^113KjzPG] [^115PzguW].

> I should double-check common pitfalls: bilateral chorioretinopathies can mimic bitemporal hemianopia and even show binasal macular thinning, especially when perimetric defects cross the vertical midline; also, volunteers can simulate central scotomas and hemianopias on automated perimetry, so I need to correlate fields with OCT and imaging to avoid mislocalization [^111NtCs1] [^111sXSfo].

> Let me reconsider the core differentiators to avoid jumping to conclusions: temporal hemianopia implies chiasmal localization with vertical meridian–respecting temporal field loss and nasal macular GCC thinning, typically mandating urgent sellar MRI and neurosurgical or endocrine management; central scotoma signifies maculopapillary pathway disease with central acuity and color compromise, guided by retinal imaging, OCT, and tailored neuroimaging when optic neuropathy is suspected, and both patterns demand alignment of perimetry with OCT for accurate localization and timely care [^112kirUL] [^114BHqot] [^113KjzPG].

### Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Current perspectives [^113KjzPG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) usually presents as painless, subacute, central visual loss in one eye. Weeks to months later, the second eye becomes involved, with a median delay of 6–8 weeks. Within 1 year, 97% of those affected have involvement of the second eye, such that a patient presenting with a unilateral optic neuropathy for longer than 1 year is highly unlikely to suffer from LHON-related vision loss. Approximately 25% have bilateral simultaneous vision loss, but in some individuals, it may be that vision loss in the first eye is not noticed before the second eye becomes involved.

The majority of individuals progress to a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Due to preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle, the earliest visual field abnormality is a cecocentral scotoma, which can enlarge to become a larger central defect. Dyschromatopsia is common and usually parallels the degree of visual acuity loss. Pupillary light reflexes usually remain intact due to relative sparing of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This subset of RGCs is thought to be more resistant to metabolic insult from mitochondrial dysfunction when compared with all RGCs. In cases of asymmetric bilateral or monocular vision loss, however, a relative afferent pupillary defect can occur.

On fundus examination preceding or during the acute stage of vision loss, there can be characteristic findings, including optic disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectatic blood vessels, vascular tortuosity, and swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the optic disc.

### Visual acuity and its postoperative outcome after transsphenoidal adenoma resection [^114BHqot]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). High credibility.

In total, 110 out of 191 patients exhibited specific visual field defects, such as complete or incomplete bitemporal hemianopsia (57.6%). Perimetric findings of bitemporal hemianopsia were diagnosed in 52 patients, which accounts for 47.3% of all patients with visual field defects and 27.2% of all patients. Furthermore, 54 patients had specific visual field defects without bitemporal hemianopsia, comprising 49.1% of all patients with preoperative field defects and 28.3% of all patients.

Unspecific visual field defect changes were registered in 33 patients, representing 30% of all patients with visual field defects and 17.3% of all patients.

The mean preoperative visual acuity was 0.76 for both the right and left eyes. Visual acuity impairment was identified in 133 out of 191 patients (69.6%). All patients suffered from pituitary macroadenoma. Mean visual acuity was 0.64 for the right eye and 0.65 for the left eye. The median Knosp classification score was grade 3, while the median Hardy classification grade was 2. Preoperative visual acuity significantly depended on the Knosp classification (r = -0.192, p = 0.029) but not on the grading provided by Hardy et al. (p = 0.395).

Regarding the intraoperative parameters, 67% (128 out of 191) of the patients were operated microsurgically, and 33% (63 out of 191) underwent an endoscopic approach. In 27.2% of the cases, intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow was noticed (52 out of 191).

The mean surgery duration was 80 minutes, with a range of 24 to 320 minutes. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 50.8% (n = 97) of the patients, while partial resection (defined as more than 90% tumor resection) was attained in 64.2% (122 out of 191 patients).

### Visual fields and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in neuro-ophthalmology: Structure-function correlation [^112kirUL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Low credibility.

Visual field (VF) testing is an essential component of the neurological examination. The differential diagnosis of VF defects depends on relating this measure of afferent visual function to the structure of the visual pathway, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an invaluable tool for detailed structural evaluation of the optic nerve and retina. This review describes the ways in which interpretation of VF and OCT can be used together to increase the accuracy of the localization of lesions along the visual pathway.

Lesions of the anterior visual pathway, originating in ganglion cells or the nerve fiber layer of the retina or optic nerve, typically produce defects that respect the horizontal midline. This reflects the arcuate path of the ganglion cell axons as they travel to the optic nerve. OCT of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex (GCC) will typically demonstrate irreversible thinning in compressive and demyelinating lesions affecting the anterior visual pathway.

Chiasmal lesions produce highly localizable VF defects, such as junctional scotoma and bitemporal hemianopia, which correspond to the thinning of the nasal portion of the GCC. Lesions of the optic tract result in incongruous homonymous hemianopia on VF, with corresponding hemianopic thinning on GCC developing within months. Lesions affecting optic radiations usually produce more congruous homonymous VF defects and can also produce homonymous thinning on GCC; however, this takes much longer to develop as trans-synaptic degeneration at the lateral geniculate body must occur.

### Planum sphenoidale meningioma leading to visual disturbance [^113AoB47]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old male presented with complaints of dizziness, which worsened with fatigue and a sense his balance was 'off'. Initial physical examination was negative, and the laboratory testing was unremarkable. Within weeks, the patient developed bilateral visual field deficits. MRI revealed an extra-axial mass that extended into the pituitary fossa and caused compression of the pituitary gland. The pituitary stalk was displaced posteriorly, and the optic chiasm was compressed with displacement superiorly and posteriorly. The patient underwent a surgical resection. Diabetes insipidus developed postoperatively, requiring a vasopressin drip. He also developed hypopituitarism after the resection, with hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, and hypogonadism. The patient requires testosterone, levothyroxine, and hydrocortisone replacement, and has mild residual bitemporal hemianopsia.

### Optokinetic nystagmus in patients with central scotomas in age related macular degeneration [^116WcLJj]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Reports on the impact of a loss in the central field of vision on optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) are varied. A study was therefore undertaken to reassess the role of the central retina in the generation of OKN in a large group of patients with age-related macular degeneration.

- **Methods**: Four groups of 20 patients were examined: a control group without scotoma and three groups with absolute central scotomas measuring 1 degree–10 degrees, 11 degrees–20 degrees, and 21 degrees–30 degrees. OKN was elicited with black and white stripes moving nasally to temporally or temporally to nasally on a screen subtending 54 degrees x 41 degrees at four velocities (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees/s). OKN gain was measured using infrared oculography.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in OKN gain between the control group and those with scotomas of 1 degree–10 degrees and 11 degrees–20 degrees. A significant difference in OKN gain was found between the group with scotomas of 21 degrees–30 degrees and all other groups at stimulus velocities of 30, 45, and 60 degrees/s (p < 0.05). OKN gain significantly diminished with increasing stimulus velocity (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in OKN gain between stimuli moving temporally to nasally and nasally to temporally.

- **Conclusion**: Abnormalities of OKN gain were noted only in patients with large scotomas. An intact macula is therefore not necessary for the generation of OKN.

### The ability of healthy volunteers to simulate a neurologic field defect on automated perimetry [^111sXSfo]. Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if volunteers could simulate and reproduce three types of neurologic field defects: hemianopia, quadrantanopia, and central scotoma.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study.

- **Participants**: Thirty healthy volunteers new to perimetry, including automated perimetry.

- **Methods**: After informed consent, volunteers were randomized to one of the three visual field defects listed: hemianopia, quadrantanopia, or central scotoma. All visual field testing was performed on the right eye using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) SITA Fast 24–2 protocol. Each volunteer received standard new patient instructions and was shown a diagram of the defect to be simulated. Two sets of visual fields were performed on the right eye with 10 minutes between tests. Three experts used the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study reading center criteria to determine if the simulation was successful.

- **Main outcome measures**: Proportion of volunteers able to simulate the assigned visual field.

Results indicated that all 10 volunteers (100%) successfully simulated a hemianopia on the first and second fields. All 10 volunteers (100%) simulated a quadrantanopia on the first field, and 9 (90%) did so on the second field. Eight volunteers (80%) successfully simulated a central scotoma in the first field, and all 10 (100%) did so on the second field. Reliability criteria were excellent. Forty-seven fields (78%) had zero fixation losses, 48 fields (80%) had zero false-positive results, and 44 fields (73%) had zero false-negative results.

In conclusion, it is easy to simulate reproducible and reliable neurologic field defects on automated perimetry using these methods.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^112tub8W]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Visual fields, particularly when correlated with other symptoms, provide valuable information regarding the location of brain lesions. Goldmann perimetry is useful in detecting neurologic visual field loss. Unfortunately, the equipment is not widely available, and testing requires a more skilled technician compared with automated perimetry. Humphrey automated perimetry is widely used for assessing visual field defects. The Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Fast is less sensitive than the SITA Standard method. SITA Fast testing can give reliable screening results, but because of the larger test-retest variability, it may not be a good choice to monitor visual field loss over time. Additionally, quantitative comparison of different strategies should be avoided, as the mean deviation is higher with SITA Fast compared with SITA Standard.

Frequency doubling technology (FDT) perimetry can detect glaucomatous visual field damage earlier than standard perimetry by isolating specific types of ganglion cells. While these technologies are good at identifying patients with glaucoma, they have been shown to be inconsistent in finding neurologic visual field defects. Compared with Goldmann perimetry, the FDT C20 threshold protocol was found to detect hemianopic field loss less than half of the time. With the use of a smaller stimulus size, the second-generation Matrix FDT has better correlation with standard perimetry when measuring neurologic disorders. However, the Matrix may still be less sensitive than standard automated perimetry in detecting homonymous hemianopia.

### Scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in visual field test coexisting with optic disc temporal atrophy in cerebral arteriovenous malformation [^114dge6w]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

A 22-year-old man suffering from visual disturbance, starting 5 years ago and gradually decreasing over time, presented to our ophthalmology department. Although his previous ophthalmic examination data were not available, he had no family history of any systemic or ophthalmologic disorders. At presentation, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye.

Dilated fundoscopic examination revealed bilateral optic disc temporal pallor (Figure 1). Visual evoked potentials (VEP) revealed delayed P100 latencies, particularly observed in the smaller patterns in both eyes (Figure 2). The pupillary light reflex was normal in both eyes. Automated visual field testing (Humphrey Instruments Inc, San Leandro, CA, USA) demonstrated scattered depressions with temporal preponderance, resembling incomplete bitemporal hemianopsia (Figure 3). The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) map, analyzed with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), confirmed the presence of optic disc temporal atrophy (Figure 4).

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), which was located adjacent to the inferomedial portion of the posterior limb of the right internal capsule at the level of the lateral ventricle (Figures 5 and 6). Chiasmal compression or atrophy was not observed. The AVM was draining into the choroidal veins at the level of the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) - revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: Diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^114MfjWJ]. Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Visual field testing is also recommended, as it can provide supportive differential diagnostic information, help assess attack severity, and may be important for monitoring the efficacy and extent of treatment-driven or spontaneous attack resolution in patients with acute NMOSD-ON. Perimetric studies have demonstrated non-central scotomas — such as altitudinal, quadrant, three-quadrant, hemianopsia, and bitemporal hemianopsia — in around 25% of patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD-ON, whereas MS patients typically exhibit central scotoma. Altitudinal hemianopia is the most common type of non-central scotoma in NMOSD and is rare in MOG-EM/MOGAD, but may also occur in double-seronegative ON. Complete visual field loss during acute attacks is more frequent in NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD than in MS.

### Defective angles of localized retinal nerve fiber layer reflect the severity of visual field defect- a cross-sectional analysis [^11117H4R]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

In regard to angle α, we did not find a significant correlation with the presence of central scotoma. Recall that angle α is the angular width between the reference line and the proximity of the RNFL defect. Hence, it follows that the smaller the angle α, the closer the RNFL defect is relative to central vision and may cause central visual defects.

We proposed four possible explanations for the lack of correlation. Firstly, some studies suggest that RNFL thickness loss is significantly correlated with more circumferential visual field loss but is not correlated with central visual field loss. Secondly, early glaucomatous optic nerve damage precedes visual loss most of the time. Thirdly, the presence of central scotoma was identified based on 30–2 visual fields using the criteria we proposed, instead of using 10–2 visual fields, which we lack. This deficit in accurately defining central scotoma may have caused the lack of correlation. Fourthly, from a physiological standpoint, the central RNFL lesion is closer to the origin of retinal vessels and may receive more nutritional support and stronger cellular reinforcements, thus developing more visual field compensation compared to the peripheral RNFL.

Altogether, we believe that there may be a correlation between angle α and the presence of central scotoma. However, the timing of ocular examination and the definition of central scotoma may have concealed the underlying correlation in this study.

We further evaluated whether our method is comparable to that of the OCT in reflecting the severity of visual field defect through Spe…

### Photophobia in a blind patient: An alternate visual pathway. Case report [^113FcqQz]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Photophobia is a common neurological and ophthalmological symptom associated with numerous neurosurgical conditions, particularly compressive lesions. Although the exact signaling pathways and neurophysiological features of the disorder are not well understood, data from multiple studies highlight the significance of the trigeminal system and the pretectal nuclei in its pathophysiology. In this report, the authors discuss a rare case of a blind patient who exhibited photophobia without evidence of light perception. They also review the literature and early experimental data to understand the potential neuronal pathways and structures involved in photophobia.

### Clinical reasoning: An 80-year-old woman with a homonymous hemianopsia [^112SvXkd]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

An 80-year-old woman who was experiencing visual symptoms for two years was found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia (HH). On further evaluation the following month, she was noted to have simultanagnosia and alexia. MRI of the brain did not reveal a structural etiology for the symptoms. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT was performed to aid in the diagnostic investigation. This case of posterior cortical atrophy highlights the differential diagnosis of an HH in the absence of a structural lesion on MRI and the role of FDG PET-CT imaging in such patients.

### Differentiating glaucoma from chiasmal compression using optical coherence tomography: The macular naso-temporal ratio [^112rkcBm]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Although the atrophy pattern seen in glaucoma does not respect the vertical meridian, it has been noted that the temporal hemi-macula is generally more severely affected. This was also identified in these data, with the macular naso-temporal ratios (mNTRs) being higher in eyes of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) compared with controls. The preferential temporal atrophy pattern associated with POAG is opposite to the nasal pattern seen in chiasmal compression, giving the mNTR excellent discriminative properties for distinguishing the two disorders.

Furthermore, these data showed that the overall macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thickness had a higher sensitivity for distinguishing healthy eyes from eyes affected by either chiasmal compression or POAG. However, the mNTR had a greater specificity for distinguishing between POAG and chiasmal compression as causes of optic nerve damage. Comprehensive analysis of overall mGCIPL thickness and mNTR may optimize the diagnostic value of structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) data in optic nerve injury. Reduced overall mGCIPL thickness is highly sensitive to identifying the presence of optic nerve damage, making it an advantageous screening tool. Direct retrograde degeneration causes appreciable mGCIPL atrophy within one month of onset, as has been described in optic neuritis.

There are other advantages when using retinal thickness metrics compared with perimetry when trying to identify chiasmal compression. OCT is quicker, more reproducible, and less affected by patient-related factors, as already discussed. Most importantly, mGCIPL atrophy may be more sensitive to picking up pituitary lesions compared with visual field assessments.

### Sudden bilateral vision loss due to third ventricular cavernous angioma with intratumoral hemorrhage - case report [^117J5yEv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Chiasmal syndrome is associated with lesions of the optic chiasm, manifesting as various impairments of the visual field such as central scotoma, bitemporal paracentral scotoma, junction scotoma, and bitemporal hemianopsia. Pituitary tumors are the most common cause, but it may also be caused by neurofibromatosis, angioma, and glioma, and associated with other inflammatory diseases such as hypophysitis, chiasmal neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.

We report a rare case of chiasmal syndrome with sudden bilateral vision loss due to third ventricular cavernous angioma, presenting with intratumoral hemorrhage.

### Objective perimetry using the multifocal visual evoked potential in central visual pathway lesions [^1111YLbH]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the ability of the multifocal pattern visual evoked potential (mVEP) to detect field loss in neurological lesions affecting the visual pathway from the chiasm to the cortex.

The method involved a retrospective review of mVEPs recorded in the clinic for cases involving central neurological lesions. Recordings were performed using the AccuMap V1.3 objective perimeter, utilizing an array of four bipolar occipital electrodes to provide four differently oriented channels for simultaneous recording. In total, 19 patients with hemianopias were identified: 10 with homonymous hemianopias and hemifield type loss, two with bitemporal hemianopias, and seven with homonymous hemianopias and quadrantanopic distribution. A comparison was made with subjective field results and CT/MRI findings to determine the relationship between the two methods of visual field mapping and any connection with the anatomical location of the lesion and the mVEP results.

Results indicated that in all hemianopic type cases (12), the defect was demonstrated on the mVEP and showed good correspondence in the location of the scotoma (nine homonymous and two bitemporal). The topographic distribution was similar but not identical to subjective testing. Of the seven quadrantanopic type hemianopias, four cases had corresponding mVEP losses in the same areas. In the three cases where the mVEP was normal, the type of quadrantanopia had features consistent with an extra-striate lesion being very congruous, complete, and respecting the horizontal meridian.

In conclusion, the mVEP can detect field loss from cortical lesions effectively.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in an HIV-infected patient on antiretroviral treatment: What is the risk factor [^11223Xs2]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

However, 4 days after admission, the patient reported bilateral visual impairment accompanied by a severe headache and subsequently suffered a tonic–clonic epileptic seizure. The ophthalmological examination revealed a bitemporal hemianopsia and visual agnosia, especially prosopagnosia, but no abnormal findings on a slit lamp examination. Blood pressure was 200/120 mm Hg during this episode.

A contrast-enhanced cerebral CT scan revealed bilateral cortical and subcortical hypodense lesions in the territories of the posterior circulation (Figure 1).

- **Figure 1**: The axial native CT scan of the brain 4 days after hospitalisation showed relatively symmetrical bi-occipital patchy hypodense areas in the territories of the posterior circulation, cortical and subcortical, predominantly right-sided.

T2-weighted (T2w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed patchy hyperintense signal alterations — asymmetric bilateral cortical and subcortical parieto-occipital — with associated diffusion restriction (Figures 2 and 3). Additionally, infratentorial large asymmetric patchy T2w and FLAIR hyperintensities were noted in both cerebellar hemispheres. The lesions showed neither contrast medium uptake nor blooming artefacts (e.g. haemorrhage or calcifications).

- **Figure 2**: In line with the CT scan, the MRI of the brain (axial FLAIR) revealed symmetrical T2w and FLAIR patchy hyperintense signal alterations, asymmetric bilateral cortical and subcortical parieto-occipital. FLAIR, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; T2w, T2-weighted.

### Perceptual relevance of abnormal visual field representations: Static visual field perimetry in human albinism [^115zUy9v]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

In human albinism, the plasticity of the visual system is challenged, as part of the temporal retina projects abnormally to the contralateral hemisphere.

- **Aim**: To investigate whether the sensitivity of the abnormally projecting temporal retina is preserved.

- **Methods**: Light spot detection sensitivities were assessed in the central 20 degrees of the visual field in 15 patients with albinism with electrophysiologically determined extents of the retinal projection abnormality and in 6 controls. The sensitivities were determined monocularly with static white-on-white perimetry using Octopus 101.

- **Results**: In patients with albinism, the sensitivity of the abnormally projecting part of the temporal retina was not selectively reduced. Apart from the vicinity of the papilla, there was no significant sensitivity difference between nasal and temporal retina in both patients with albinism and controls.

- **Conclusions**: While in the present study the papilla-induced scotoma was detected in those with albinism tested, there was no indication of a selective visual field defect induced by the projection abnormality. This contrasts with the selective visual field defects observed in some animal models of albinism, and indicates that, in humans, mechanisms of cortical self-organisation make the abnormal representation available for visual perception.

### Does the World Health Organization criterion adequately define glaucoma blindness [^111x8nBV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

From the total cohort of 3,883 patients from the DURING study, we included a random sample of 77 patients with 423 visual fields from one university hospital for the analyses.

- **Assessment and variability using the WHO criterion**: Using the WHO criterion, assessor A rated 14.4% of the visual fields as blind and assessor B 11.3%, with a kappa of 0.78. The visual fields' central island of vision and temporal crescent were mostly assessed as blind according to this criterion. The variability between the assessors was found in cases where visual fields depicted altitudinal defects, central islands of vision, and para-central scotomas.

- **Assessment and variability using a 5-point ordinal scale**: A higher percentage of blindness was found when the ordinal scale was used as an alternative for the WHO criterion; 21.7% and 19.6% of the visual fields were rated as blind according to assessors A and B, respectively, but with a lower kappa of 0.71. Central islands of vision and temporal crescents were mostly assessed as blind according to the ordinal scale as well. However, this scale showed more variability between the assessors, which was present in the categories arcuate scotoma, altitudinal defect, para-central scotoma, and hemianopia.

- **Interobserver variability in visual fields with the same score for the type of defect**: A closer look at the interobserver variability revealed that even when visual fields were given the same rating by the two assessors, the agreement on blindness with the criterion was not uniform, indicating significant variability.

### Chiasmal herniation following treatment of pituitary macroadenoma [^117Xt65u]. Pituitary (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with pituitary macroadenomas typically present with bitemporal hemianopsia, a partial blindness where vision is missing in the outer half of the visual field (VF), as a result of an elevated and compressed optic chiasm. Based on the type of tumor, decompression by resection or size reduction by pharmacological treatment results in immediate and significant improvement of VF in the vast majority of patients. However, in some patients, delayed deterioration of the VF and visual acuity (VA) is observed following initial post-treatment improvement. In the clinical work-up of this deterioration, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is performed to exclude new chiasmal compression caused by a recurring tumor or growth of a remnant. Strikingly, several of these patients showed a radiological herniation, i.e. a (new) downward displacement of the optic chiasm into a secondary enlarged sella, raising the question of whether this is one of the reasons for the deterioration of VF.

The most accepted hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanism of the secondary downward displacement of the optic chiasm and its relation to deteriorating VF and VA is based on tethering of scar tissue, enlargement of the sella turcica, and a deficient sellar diaphragm, or a combination. This results in the downward displacement of the optic chiasm, stretching the optic nerves and causing deterioration of the VF.

A PubMed search resulted in a total of 23 studies, and most studies focus on the downward displacement of the optic chiasm and VF deterioration.

### Retinotopic organization of the visual cortex before and after decompression of the optic chiasm in a patient with pituitary macroadenoma [^114b8iHz]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Compression induced by a pituitary tumor on the optic chiasm can generate visual field deficits, yet it is unknown how this compression affects the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex. It is also not known how the effect of the tumor on the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex changes after decompression. The authors used functional MRI (fMRI) to map the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex in a 68-year-old right-handed woman before and 3 months after surgery for a pituitary macroadenoma.

The authors demonstrated that longitudinal changes in visual field perimetry, as assessed by the automated Humphrey visual field test, correlated with longitudinal changes in fMRI activation in a retinotopic manner. In other words, after decompression of the optic chiasm, fMRI charted the recruitment of the visual cortex in a way that matched gains in visual field perimetry. Based on this case, the authors propose that fMRI can chart neural plasticity of the visual cortex on an individual basis and that it can also serve as a complementary tool in decision making with respect to management of patients with chiasmal compression.

### Sub-acute blindness in a patient with a temporal lobe astrocytoma [^116FyUKQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report describes an unusual case of a middle-aged man who suffered sub-acute visual loss, rendering him blind over a period of four weeks. This was associated with the diagnosis of a right temporal lobe World Health Organization grade 4 astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme). Chronic papilloedema had been diagnosed at presentation and persisted after his debulking surgery, yet there was no radiological evidence of direct involvement, either by compression or infiltration, of the visual pathways. This case report outlines the sub-acute on chronic nature of his visual loss and suggests possible causes and preventative measures for visual loss in these patients.

### Paracentral and cecocentral scotomas after pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [^114BGYN8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

To describe novel paracentral and cecocentral visual scotomas after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair over a 5-year period, we conducted a retrospective case series. This review included all patients who reported visual scotomas after 23- or 25-gauge PPV (Constellation Vision System, Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) for RRD repair by a single surgeon (RNK) from January 2013 through December 2018. All patients underwent multimodal imaging, including fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, autofluorescence, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and standardized central Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing, to further characterize the visual scotomas.

Nine patients reported visual scotomas after PPV for RRD during the study period, resulting in an incidence rate of 6.4% (9 out of 140). The patients had an average age of 61 years, ranging from 53 to 71 years, and 3 out of 9 were female. The preceding RRD was macula-sparing in 6 out of 9 patients, and all cases involved the right eye. Seven out of 9 patients reported the central scotoma within the first week post-surgery. All 9 patients noted paracentral or cecocentral locations of scotomas, which involved the inferior temporal visual field. Multimodal imaging was significant only for corresponding focal superior nasal ganglion cell loss on spectral-domain OCT. Two out of 9 patients experienced symptomatic visual loss due to the scotoma's involvement at the center of fixation.

In conclusion, we report a novel central/paracentral visual field defect following PPV for RRD repair.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^115VrAgN]. Clinical ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Confrontation visual field testing is not sensitive at detecting visual field loss, but it may be the only method available. Kerr et al. evaluated 332 eyes prospectively to compare seven types of confrontation visual field tests. Finger counting was the least sensitive method, finding 0% of mild defects and 49% of severe defects. Overall, the most sensitive individual method of confrontation visual field testing is kinetic testing using a 5 mm red bead. This picks up 43% of mild defects and 89% of severe defects. The overall sensitivity using the kinetic red bead is 74%, but this improves to 78% when combined with static finger wiggle testing. Formal perimetry is necessary if there is a strong suspicion of visual field loss.

Unilateral damage to the retrochiasmal visual pathway results in bilateral vision loss affecting the contralateral visual field. The visual loss respects the vertical midline of the visual field. This should be differentiated from glaucomatous visual field loss, which does not respect the vertical midline but instead respects the horizontal midline. The most common location of lesions resulting in HH is the occipital lobe (45%), followed by damage to the optic radiations (32%). The remainder is caused by lesions of the optic tract (10%), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (1.3%), or a combination of several areas (11%).

A complete HH affects the entire hemifield of both eyes (Figure 1A). This can occur with a lesion anywhere posterior to the chiasm and cannot be further localized based on visual field appearance alone. An incomplete HH spares at least part of the hemifield.

### Training-induced cortical representation of a hemianopic hemifield [^11229RRF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with homonymous hemianopia often have some residual sensitivity for visual stimuli in their blind hemifield. Previous imaging studies suggest an important role for extrastriate cortical areas in such residual vision, but results of training to improve vision in patients with hemianopia are conflicting.

- **Objective**: To show that intensive training with flicker stimulation in the chronic stage of stroke can reorganize visual cortices of an adult patient.

- **Methods**: A 61-year-old patient with homonymous hemianopia was trained with flicker stimulation, starting 22 months after stroke. Changes in functioning during training were documented with magnetoencephalography, and the cortical organization after training was examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

- **Results**: Both imaging methods showed that, after training, visual information from both hemifields was processed mainly in the intact hemisphere. The fMRI mapping results showed the representations of both the blind and the normal hemifield in the same set of cortical areas in the intact hemisphere, more specifically in the visual motion-sensitive area V5, in a region around the superior temporal sulcus and in retinotopic visual areas V1 (primary visual cortex), V2, V3, and V3a.

- **Conclusions**: Intensive training of a blind hemifield can induce cortical reorganization in an adult patient, and this case shows an ipsilateral representation of the trained visual hemifield in several cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex.

### Inferior temporal sulcus as a site of corticotomy: Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of individual sulcus patterns [^115U4Pyr]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Transcortical approaches to the inferior horn often result in quadrant hemianopsia attributable to the injury to the optic radiation. The inferior temporal sulcus (ITS) has received little attention as an entrance point for the transsulcal approach. We used the method of detecting the ITS with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and investigated the sulcus pattern of ITS, its incidence rate, and the availability of the ITS to the corticotomy for selective amygdalohippocampectomy.

- **Methods**: The sulcus patterns of the ITS of 100 temporal lobes in 50 healthy individuals were classified according to the number of interruptions by gyral bridges, and the localization of the ITS was characterized in relation to the outer surface by means of the surface anatomy scan of MRI.

- **Results**: Most of the ITS was interrupted by one to three gyral bridges (0 bridges, 8%; one bridge, 27%; two bridges, 37%; three bridges, 20%; more than four bridges or no apparent ITS, 8%). When the ITS was present, it was located 15 mm above the orbitotragus line at a point 20 mm anterior to the tragus. The number of gyral bridges was significantly larger in the left temporal lobes than in the right temporal lobes, regardless of the sex of the subject.

- **Conclusion**: The ITS was clearly identified in 72% of the temporal lobes by the oblique sagittal view of MRI scans; thus, in such cases, the ITS was considered to be a candidate for an entrance point of a small temporal corticotomy. The preoperative observation of the ITS in relation to the orbitotragus line by means of MRI may improve the planning.

### Preferred retinal locus locations in age-related macular degeneration [^115PzguW]. Retina (2018). Low credibility.

An evaluation of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with age-related macular degeneration and a central scotoma is becoming a standard of care in the practice of low-vision rehabilitation. This is a retrospective study of PRL specifications and whether they have a correlation with the best-corrected visual acuities of patients with age-related macular degeneration.

- **Methods**: Seventy-two patients with macular degeneration (144 eyes) were included in the study. The PRLs were evaluated monocularly with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Each PRL's location, the fovea-PRL distance, the PRL edge of the lesion distance, and PRL stability were measured with the built-in caliper of the ophthalmoscope.

- **Results**: The most frequent location of a PRL was nasal (29.2%). The PRL was located in the left visual field of 34.0% of the patients. The best-corrected visual acuity values were positively correlated with the lesion's vertical and horizontal dimensions, as well as its surface area, the PRL-fovea distance, the PRL border of the lesion distance, and PRL stability.

- **Conclusion**: The clinical PRL evaluation methodology that we describe can be used to facilitate making decisions on how to provide best visual rehabilitation to patients with a central scotoma.

### Hyperglycemic hemianopia: A reversible complication of non-ketotic hyperglycemia [^1134TCJE]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Four patients each developed a reversible homonymous hemianopia caused by non-ketotic hyperglycemia. In two patients, the homonymous hemianopia was the first manifestation of diabetes mellitus type 2. All four patients had abnormal MRI scans; in the three patients who had late follow-up scans, the abnormalities resolved completely. In one patient, the progressive visual field defect and unusual MRI findings initially caused concern for a tumor.

### A minute demyelinating lesion causing acute positional vertigo [^113XNt1k]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Clinico-anatomical correlations in multiple sclerosis patients presenting with central positional vertigo are lacking. We report on a patient with acute onset positional vertigo mimicking benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, with a single enhancing lesion in the inner part of the superior cerebellar peduncle, disclosed only after thin slice MR imaging. This location appears to be a common cause of central positional vertigo and should be regarded as characteristic for demyelinating rather than vascular pathology. In cases presenting with positional nystagmus and vertigo without other cerebellar deficits, one should look explicitly for signal abnormalities in the inner part of the superior cerebellar peduncle. High spatial resolution MRI seems to be mandatory for lesion detection.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^116HbLMW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to congruity, the shape and location of an incomplete HH can help localize the causative factor. Damage to the LGN will often result in one or more sectors of visual field loss, since the dorsal portion of the LGN contains fibers from the macular region, the lateral portion represents the superior visual field, and the medial portion represents the inferior visual field. Temporal lobe lesions tend to involve the superior visual field quadrant, while parietal lesions are more likely to cause inferior visual field defects with sloping borders superiorly. Lesions isolated to the upper cuneus gyrus or the lower lingual gyrus result in an inferior or superior quadrantanopia, respectively (Figure 1D).

Macular representation, found at the posterior pole of the occipital lobe, is disproportionately large. It is estimated that 50%–60% of the visual cortex represents 10°–30° of central vision. Because of the large macular representation, as well as the dual blood supply to the posterior occipital lobe, sparing of the central 2°–10° of the visual field (Figure 1E) is commonly found with occipital lobe lesions. Macular sparing can also occur with lesions of the optic radiations or optic tracts. Even without macular sparing, an HH itself does not generally affect visual acuity. If visual acuity is reduced, an accompanying lesion involving the anterior visual pathway should be suspected.

### Homonymous hemianopias: Clinical-anatomic correlations in 904 cases [^111QRcRJ]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia (HH), the study reviews medical records of all patients with HH seen in their service between 1989 and 2004. Demographic characteristics, characteristics of visual field defects, causes of visual field defects, neuroradiologic definition of lesion location, and associated neurologic deficits were recorded.

A total of 904 HH were found in 852 patients. Of these, 340 HH (37.6%) were complete and 564 HH (62.4%) were incomplete. Homonymous quadrantanopia (264 HH, 29%) was the most common type of incomplete HH, followed by homonymous scotomatous defects (116 HH, 13.5%), partial HH (114 HH, 13%), and HH with macular sparing (66 HH, 7%). A total of 407 HH (45.0%) were isolated. Causes of HH included stroke (629 HH, 69.6%), trauma (123, 13.6%), tumor (102, 11.3%), brain surgery (22, 2.4%), demyelination (13, 1.4%), other rare causes (13, 1.4%), and unknown etiology (2, 0.2%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Every type of HH, except for unilateral loss of temporal crescent and homonymous sectoranopia, was found in all lesion locations along the retrochiasmal visual pathways.

Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors.

### Temporal sensitivity in a hemianopic visual field can be improved by long-term training using flicker stimulation [^112WZ8YU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Blindness of a visual half-field (hemianopia) is a common symptom after postchiasmatic cerebral lesions. Although hemianopia severely limits daily activities, clinical practice does not include training of visual functions in the blind hemifield. The objective of this study was to determine whether flicker sensitivity in the blind hemifield can be improved with intensive training and whether training with flicker stimulation can evoke changes in cortical responsiveness.

Two men with homonymous hemianopia participated in the experiments. They trained with flicker stimuli at 30 degrees or with flickering letters at 10 degrees eccentricity twice a week for a year, and continued training with more peripheral stimuli thereafter. Neuromagnetic responses were registered at 1–2-month intervals, and the Goldmann perimetry was recorded before, during, and after training.

Flicker sensitivity in the blind hemifield improved to the level of the intact hemifield within 30 degrees eccentricity in one participant and 20 degrees eccentricity in the other. Flickering letters were recognized equally at 10 degrees eccentricity in both the blind and intact hemifields. The improvement spread from the stimulated horizontal meridian to the whole hemianopic field within 30 degrees. Before training, neuromagnetic recordings showed no signal above the noise level in the hemianopic side. During training, evoked fields emerged in both participants. No changes were found in the Goldmann perimetry.

These results demonstrate that sensitivity to flicker could be fully restored in the stimulated field of study, showing promise for therapeutic applications.

### Optic chiasmal herniation — an under recognized complication of dopamine agonist therapy for macroprolactinoma [^1128mAtg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

The initial presentation of macroprolactinoma with visual field impairment, especially in males, is well recognized. Successful treatment with dopamine agonist therapy is characterized by a reduction in hyperprolactinemia and often rapid and progressive resolution of the visual impairment. A small proportion of patients may subsequently develop a secondary deterioration in both their visual fields and visual acuities despite normalization of prolactin levels and tumor shrinkage. When pituitary apoplexy can be excluded, this may result from traction on the optic chiasm, which is pulled down into the now partially empty sella.

We report a series of seven patients in whom chiasmal traction is believed to be the cause of their secondary deterioration in visual acuity occurring after dopamine agonist therapy for macroprolactinoma. The clinical history of two patients, both of whom had rapid resolution of field defects with bromocriptine therapy but subsequently developed a recurrence of their bitemporal hemianopia, is detailed. In both patients, MRI scanning showed not only tumor involution but also marked optic chiasm herniation into the pituitary fossa. Surgical treatment was considered too risky; however, on reduction of bromocriptine dosage, the field defect improved in both cases. There was a modest elevation of prolactin and a degree of tumor re-expansion. The latter is believed to have released tethering of the optic chiasm and/or its vascular supply, thus obviating the need for surgery.

Regular monitoring of visual fields in patients with macroprolactinoma receiving medical treatment is essential.

### ACR appropriateness criteria orbits vision and visual loss [^1118hfof]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Visual loss can be the result of an abnormality anywhere along the visual pathway, including the globe, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, thalamus, optic radiations, or primary visual cortex. An appropriate imaging analysis of visual loss is facilitated by a compartmental approach that establishes a differential diagnosis based on the suspected lesion location and specific clinical features. CT and MRI are the primary imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with visual loss and are often complementary in evaluation. Depending on the specific clinical scenario, one modality may be preferred over the other. Imaging coverage may require targeted evaluation of the orbits and/or assessment of the brain, based on the pattern of visual loss and differential diagnosis. Contrast is preferred when masses and inflammatory processes are differential considerations.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging approaches.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^116o4zZf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

In this study, analysis of both the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the ganglion cell complex (GCC) were included to demonstrate retrograde transneuronal degeneration in patients with homonymous hemianopsia caused by cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Prior to the algorithm for GCC measurement, the best way to indirectly measure the nerve fiber layer was to use the RNFL function on optical coherence tomography (OCT).

The RNFL is primarily reported divided into four quadrants: temporal, nasal, superior, and inferior. This distinction is less than ideal for evaluating post-chiasmatic visual field defects since the temporal quadrant contains retinal fibers from the temporal retina as well as the maculopapillary bundle nasal to the fovea. This allows for both the nasal and temporal visual fields to be represented in the same measurement and could be a confounder when attempting to analyze visual field defects that respect the midline.

To demonstrate retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration, a right occipital lesion would cause thinning of the nasal nerve fiber of the right eye and temporal nerve fiber of the left eye. This becomes further challenging as the peripapillary nerve fiber layer is not symmetric at baseline in normal subjects. In general, the inferior quadrant is thickest, followed by the superior, nasal, and temporal.

The fovea represents the physiologic division between crossed and uncrossed fibers to the visual cortex, and at baseline, it is symmetric between the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants. For these reasons, the GCC analysis is a more straightforward way to demonstrate thinning as it is projected to the visual cortex.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113iwuqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, more specifically with respect to watchful waiting, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining visual field testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on follow-up imaging. Avoid obtaining visual field testing in patients with incidentalomas situated not close to the chiasm, with no new symptoms, and who are being followed closely by MRI.

### Scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in visual field test coexisting with optic disc temporal atrophy in cerebral arteriovenous malformation [^116uCL2k]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral vascular abnormalities, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), are common incidental and asymptomatic findings on noninvasive imaging studies. AVMs are considered slow-growing congenital lesions that can cause a wide spectrum of visual field defects due to their involvement of the visual paths. Since each AVM has its own unique natural history, the association between the characteristics of an AVM and visual field defects remains unpredictable.

There is no evidence indicating a correlation between the size and localization of an AVM and the pattern of the visual field defect. However, closer localization to the posterior cerebral region can generally cause a more congruent visual field defect. In this article, we present a case with a nonchiasmatic cerebral AVM, which revealed optic disc temporal pallor associated with scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in a visual field test resembling bitemporal hemianopsia.

### Discordance between subjective perimetric visual fields and objective multifocal visual evoked potential-determined visual fields in patients with hemianopsia [^116LmGps]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

This study investigates the concordance between subjectively and objectively acquired visual fields in patients with subjectively determined hemianopsia. It is structured as a retrospective observational study.

Ten patients, including six men and four women aged 28 to 68 years, underwent examination. Subjectively determined visual fields were obtained using Goldmann or Humphrey perimeters for up to 25 degrees of eccentricity. Objective visual fields were recorded using the VERIS Scientific System (Electro-Diagnostic Imaging, San Francisco, California, USA) through multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEPs). The approach involved alternating 60 black-and-white segments of the checkerboard stimulus according to a binary m sequence, with first slices of the second-order kernels extracted and analyzed.

The results indicated that in five cases, visual field loci where the mfVEPs were within normal limits corresponded to scotomatous areas identified by conventional perimetry. In discordant cases, lesions, such as arteriovenous malformations, were located in the occipital lobe, with two cases experiencing complete subjective visual field recovery. In contrast, concordant cases, with lesions located outside the occipital lobe (e.g. pituitary adenoma), showed no improvement in visual fields. The temporal crescent syndrome was ruled out in patients with posterior lesions through CT or MRI findings.

In conclusion, patients with occipital lesions may show discordance between subjective and objective visual field results.

### MRI of optic tract lesions: Review and correlation with visual field defects [^115H3CfM]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Visual field defects are a conglomerate of patterns of visual impairment derived from diseases affecting the optic nerve as it extends from the globe to the visual cortex. They are complex signs requiring perimetry or visual confrontation for delineation and are associated with diverse aetiologies. This review considers the chiasmatic and post-chiasmatic causes of visual disturbances, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Newer MRI sequences, such as diffusion-tensor imaging, are considered. MRI images are correlated with perimetric findings to demonstrate lesion localization in the visual pathway. This may serve as a valuable reference tool for clinicians and radiologists in the early diagnostic process of differentiating causes of various visual field defects in daily practice.

### Highly accurate retinotopic maps of the physiological blind spot in human visual cortex [^111Qt3NK]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). High credibility.

The visual cortex in the occipital lobe contains precise topographic maps, with neighboring locations of the observer's visual field encoded by adjacent populations of neurons. Damage at various stages of the primary visual pathway results in localized vision loss, such as retinal damage in age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as stroke or brain trauma that can impact structures at later stages of the human visual hierarchy. These regions of localized loss of visual sensitivity, known as scotomas, are not entirely irreversible. There is evidence for plasticity by which the brain reorganizes mappings between inputs and neural responses in regions surrounding the area of acquired blindness — either through prolonged experience or active perceptual learning. Such plasticity may enable the visual system to compensate for some vision loss by making better use of intact neural circuitry.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows researchers to study neural processing and map reorganization around the scotomas of human participants in a non-invasive fashion. Advances in neuroimaging technology and data analysis methods have greatly improved the knowledge we can glean about neural functioning in the visual cortex. For over a decade, population receptive field (pRF) analysis has been an important method in the toolkit of visual neuroscientists. The pRF estimates the position, size, and shape of receptive fields of neurons.

### Pituitary hyperplasia causing complete bitemporal hemianopia with resolution following surgical decompression: case report [^112rFb3J]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

In this report, the authors demonstrated that idiopathic pituitary hyperplasia (PH) can cause complete bitemporal hemianopia and amenorrhea, even with mild anatomical compression of the optic chiasm and normal pituitary function. Furthermore, complete resolution of symptoms can be achieved with surgical decompression. PH can occur in the context of pregnancy or end-organ insufficiency, as well as with medications such as oral contraceptives and antipsychotics, or it can be idiopathic. It is often found incidentally, and surgical intervention is usually unnecessary since the disorder rarely progresses and can be managed by addressing the underlying etiology.

The authors present the case of a 24-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, who presented with bitemporal hemianopia and amenorrhea. Imaging revealed an enlarged pituitary gland that was contacting, but not compressing, the optic chiasm, while pituitary hormone tests were all within normal limits. The patient underwent surgical decompression of the sella turcica and exploration of the gland through an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Pathology results demonstrated PH. A postoperative visual field examination revealed complete resolution of the bitemporal hemianopia, and menstruation resumed 3 days later. The patient remains asymptomatic with no hormonal deficits.

### Visual field loss associated with vigabatrin: Pathological correlations [^115XVGqS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Pathological changes were reported in the anterior visual pathways of a 41-year-old man with complex partial seizures treated with vigabatrin, who developed bilateral visual field constriction. The patient exhibited peripheral retinal atrophy with loss of ganglion cells and loss of nerve fibers in the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts. No evidence of intramyelinic edema was seen. These findings suggest that the primary site of injury resides within the ganglion cells in the retina. The degree of atrophy observed indicates that the visual field loss is irreversible.

### Effects of visual pathway lesions on the visual aura of migraine [^116BqDAY]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

The aim was to determine if the visual aura of migraine is altered by diseases of the afferent visual pathways and if visual aura changes are associated with pre- or postgeniculate lesions. Functional neuroimaging during migraine demonstrates the primary visual/extrastriate cortex as an anatomical substrate of visual aura. Neuro-ophthalmological records, including kinetic and static perimetry of 25 patients with visual loss and typical aura with or without migraine headache, were reviewed.

Twenty-five patients (16 women, nine men) with a mean age of 59.8 years and typical aura experienced visual loss from either pregeniculate (72%) or postgeniculate lesions (28%). Eight patients (four with postgeniculate cerebrovascular accidents or arteriovenous malformations, two with lifelong optic neuropathy/retinopathy, one with childhood ocular trauma, and one with anisometropic amblyopia) reported an absence or alteration of visual aura. Postgeniculate lesions were significantly associated (P = 0.017) with changes in visual aura.

The association of postgeniculate lesions with altered auras indicates a postgeniculate effect on aura appearance, consistent with functional neuroimaging findings. Although statistically significant, this series' association of postgeniculate disease and aura changes is even more robust (P = 0.0002) when structural changes of ocular dominance columns are considered in three patients with optic neuropathy, retinopathy, and keratopathy of congenital or childhood origin.

### Predictors for visual dysfunction in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas - implications for neurosurgical management [^1168CssU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite ample experience with the surgical treatment of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, objective data defining the risk for visual compromise depending on the suprasellar extension in pituitary adenomas are sparse.

- **Design and patients**: We measured the suprasellar extension of 98 newly diagnosed suprasellar nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas on sagittal and coronal magnetic resonance images, using reference lines for the skull base level. In addition, the position of the optic chiasm in relation to the suprasellar adenoma was assessed. The findings were correlated with the degree of visual dysfunction and with the type of visual field defects (VFD).

- **Results**: Seventy percent of the patients suffered from VFD. The most frequent perimetric findings were bilateral (81.2%) or unilateral (10.1%) temporal hemifield defects. For the coronal view, a suprasellar extension of 12 mm was a practicable cut-off value for the emergence of visual disturbances (87.0% sensitivity, 72.4% specificity). For the sagittal view, 8-mm suprasellar extension was a suitable cut-off for the appearance of chiasma syndrome (87.0% sensitivity, 75.9% specificity). In five of seven cases without a chiasma syndrome, despite a suprasellar extension > 12 mm (coronal) and 8 mm (sagittal), the optic chiasm was found in an anterior position. No correlation was found between the position of the chiasm (i.e. anterior, superior, or posterior) and the type of VFD (P = 0.647). A highly significant correlation was found between the decline of visual acuity and the suprasellar adenoma extension (P < 0.0001).

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: A retrospective observational study [^112oNqEG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Apart from detailing temporal hemifield defects, the present study revealed that visual field defects extend into the nasal hemifield, which also demonstrates left-right asymmetry in many cases. Advanced bitemporal visual field defects in pituitary adenoma patients are likely to be followed by visual field loss in the nasal hemifield. This could be attributed to damaged uncrossed nerve fibers. Either the growing pituitary tumor may successively damage directly the uncrossed fibers, or it compresses the uncrossed fibers in the lateral part of the optic chiasm against the surrounding structures.

In addition to the left-right asymmetry, pituitary adenoma also causes upper-lower asymmetry. Although one earlier study demonstrated the trend toward greater total deviation of Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results in the superotemporal quadrant compared to the inferotemporal quadrant, the details of upper-lower asymmetry in patients with pituitary adenoma were poorly investigated in the literature. In the present study, by investigating the frequency of severe scotoma instead of total deviation, we were successfully able to demonstrate upper-lower asymmetry with upper-dominant deterioration in the temporal hemifield and lower-dominant deterioration in the nasal hemifield.

The pattern of asymmetry showing upper-dominant deterioration in the temporal hemifield and lower-dominant deterioration in the nasal hemifield may conform to Hedges' report, in which visual field damage in the inferonasal quadrant precedes damage in the superonasal quadrant.

### Arranon [^115RhHVH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Blurred vision was reported in 4% of adult patients as an adverse reaction. A single case of biopsy-confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was documented in the adult patient population.

- **Neurologic adverse reactions**: Nervous system adverse reactions were reported for 76% of adult patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials. The most common neurologic adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in adult patients, including all grades (NCI CTCAE), were shown in a table that is not present in this text. One patient experienced a fatal neurologic adverse reaction, which included cerebral hemorrhage, coma, and leukoencephalopathy.

Most nervous system adverse reactions in adult patients were evaluated as Grade 1 or 2. Additional Grade 3 adverse reactions in adult patients included aphasia, convulsion, hemiparesis, and loss of consciousness, each reported in one patient (1%). Grade 4 adverse reactions included cerebral hemorrhage, coma, intracranial hemorrhage, leukoencephalopathy, and metabolic encephalopathy, again each reported in one patient (1%).

Other neurologic adverse reactions reported as Grade 1, 2, or unknown in adult patients were abnormal coordination, burning sensation, disturbance in attention, dysarthria, hyporeflexia, neuropathic pain, nystagmus, peroneal nerve palsy, sciatica, sensory disturbance, sinus headache, and speech disorder, each reported in one patient (1%).

### Scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in visual field test coexisting with optic disc temporal atrophy in cerebral arteriovenous malformation [^111YjuzK]. Clinical ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Cerebral AVMs produce circulatory and functional disturbances. Regarding the pathophysiology of these effects, the hemodynamic results of cerebral AVMs are not clearly understood. To our knowledge, the anatomy of visual field defects generated by lesions located between the retina and primary visual cortex has been clearly identified. Bitemporal hemianopsia associated with optic disc nasal atrophy due to chronic papilledema was described more than 20 years ago in association with intracranial AVMs. On the contrary, a bitemporal hemianopsia-like visual field defect associated with bilateral optic disc temporal atrophy has not been reported so far in cerebral AVM.

- **Vascular steal syndrome**: Blood shunting resulting in partial ischemia may theoretically cause different types of visual field defects in AVMs. Decreased blood flow and local compression were demonstrated in cerebral regions next to AVMs. Partial infarction of nerve fiber bundles following vascular steal syndrome was described as a possible reason for unusual visual field defects. It may also be possible that the AVM caused some compression with or without vascular steal over the optic chiasm at an earlier date due to its close proximity to the chiasma, and may have regressed in size at presentation.

- **Anatomical variants**: Some anatomical variants of the optic nerve might be responsible for temporal pallor. In healthy eyes, peripapillary RNFL is thicker superiorly and inferiorly and thinner nasally and temporally. Split bundle patterns, appearing either superiorly (most frequently), inferiorly, or both, have been described as real anatomic features.

### Long-term follow-up of torpedo maculopathy: A case series and mini-review [^115SpaRx]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Case 2**:

- **Fundus photography**: A color fundus photograph demonstrates a horizontally oval, hyperpigmented, torpedo-shaped lesion containing a central pseudolacuna in the right eye. A small satellite lesion is noted adjacent to the temporal margin of the lesion. Serial photography documents apparent stability of the lesion over the 10-year observation period.

- **Fundus autofluorescence**: Typical features of torpedo maculopathy (TM), including hypoautofluorescence of the lesion interior and hyperautofluorescence of the lesion margins, are observed. The lesion is interrupted near the temporal margin by a tongue of tissue with a normal autofluorescence signal that splits the lesion into two parts. This corresponds to the observed satellite lesion at the temporal edge of the torpedo lesion. There is no apparent change in the signal pattern over the observation period.

- **Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy**: Images with the location of corresponding B-scan highlighted in the baseline and 10-year follow-up exam.

- **Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Each image represents a horizontal B-scan through approximately the same location in the middle of the torpedo lesion. Because the examinations were performed on different instruments at each time period, the scans are not of the identical fundus location. Nonetheless, they are as close to the same fundus location as possible. At the 10-year follow-up visit, some progression of the inner retinal degeneration is seen. A few small cystic spaces are seen under the inner limiting membrane at baseline, and they appear larger and more numerous at the 10-year visit.

### Motion area V5/MT+ response to global motion in the absence of V1 resembles early visual cortex [^111Tj8Gx]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Seven individuals were recruited with chronic unilateral damage to V1, causing homonymous visual field loss recorded by Humphrey perimetry. Ages ranged from 38 to 76 (see Fig. 1 for radiology and visual field schemata in all patients). Pathology was caused by posterior circulation stroke (n = 5) or benign tumor resection (n = 2), at least 6 months previously (range: 6–252 months post-lesion). Cases with additional non-correctable visual impairment or prior neurological disease were excluded from the study. Six age-matched participants (ages 25–68) were recruited as controls. All control participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological disease. Participants were recruited from ophthalmological or stroke services in three UK centers. All testing was carried out at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. Written informed consent was obtained, with ethical approval from the Oxford Research Ethics Committee: Ref B 08/H0605/156.

- **Figure 1**: Patient neuroimaging and visual field deficits. V5/MT+ masks are overlaid on example coronal or axial (left column) and sagittal (middle column) T1-weighted slices for all seven patients (P1–P7) (radiological convention). Ipsilesional V5/MT+ is shown in blue, contralesional in yellow. Coronal slices (right column) also demonstrate the intact lateral geniculate nucleus in green. The lateral geniculate nucleus was identifiable by manual inspection of the anatomical T1-weighted images, with a radiological brain atlas to aid identification. Visual field deficits are adapted from 30:2 thresholding measurements.

### Variable structure and function relationship of compressive optic neuropathy at the time of diagnosis [^114SU96v]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Compressive optic neuropathy (CON) is a heterogeneous disease that damages the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon of the optic nerve through mechanical compression. It typically results in slow, progressive, and painless structural and functional deterioration of the optic nerve. The etiologic compressive masses vary in terms of pathologic tissues, sizes, growth rates, biological behaviors, and systemic disturbances. Retinotopic rearrangement of axonal fibers at the site of compression can be region-specific along the pathway from intraocular, intraorbital, intracanalicular, to intracranial parts of the optic nerve, chiasm, and optic tract before synapse at the lateral geniculate body. Therefore, clinical presentations can vary in pattern, severity, rate of visual loss progression, disc morphology, and other associated neurological and systemic signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis.

The evaluation of both structure and function in optic neuropathies at the time of presentation provides vital information about the status of the disease and is extremely useful for monitoring clinical progression and/or recovery after treatment. While glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) is among the most extensively studied optic neuropathies, where structure and function mapping are well established, other nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies may have specific patterns of structural and functional damage and potentially different degrees of structure–function relationship. CON has been shown to possess distinct patterns.

### Nonuniform pressure generation in the optic chiasm may explain bitemporal hemianopsia [^115oJzJg]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to measure the pressure in the temporal and central aspects of the optic chiasm simultaneously during compression from an expanding simulated tumor beneath the optic chiasm.

- **Design**: Experimental study.

- **Methods**: Craniotomies were performed on five unfixed cadaveric specimens ranging in age from 49 to 89 years, and the optic chiasm was exposed. A pediatric gauge Foley catheter was inserted into the sellar region, and the temporal side of the chiasm (temporal aspect uncrossed fibers) was impaled with a 30-gauge needle connected to a pressure transducer. Similarly, the central portion of the chiasm (crossed fibers) was impaled with another 30-gauge needle connected to a pressure transducer on a separate channel. The Foley catheter was inflated for 30 seconds to 1 minute, and the pressure in each channel was continuously monitored. Multiple trials were conducted on each of the five specimens.

- **Main outcome measure**: Pressure change between the temporal and nasal aspects of the optic chiasm.

- **Results**: In all cases where intrachiasmal pressure could be measured, higher pressures were consistently generated in the central aspect of the chiasm than in the temporal aspect. For instance, in cadaver 1, the mean central pressure was 19.75 mmHg whereas the mean temporal pressure was 6 mmHg. In cadaver 5, the mean central pressure was 4 mmHg, whereas the mean temporal pressure was zero. Donors aged 70 and older exhibited abnormally thin and frail chiasms that were unable to support a sustained pressure increase during simulated tumor expansion.

- **Conclusions**: During deformation and pressure increase simulations…

### Visual field changes as an early indicator of glioblastoma multiforme progression: Two cases of functional vision changes before MRI detection [^1137wZig]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing is a functional study that enhances the sensitivity of detecting disease progression in tumors known to involve the optic pathway. Functional studies provide a clinical context for imaging findings, increasing the predictive value of a positive imaging finding. This fundamental concept is well known but often overlooked in the era of increasingly sophisticated imaging techniques.

Overreliance on imaging that contradicts clinical findings may lead to delayed treatment, inappropriate treatment, or unnecessary tests. While imaging has played and will continue to play a key role in the monitoring of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the development of accurate tools to assess clinical status should be similarly emphasized. HVF testing may prove useful for monitoring clinical signs of progression, as up to 50% of patients with lesions in the optic pathway show visual field defects.

The utility of HVF testing has already been recognized in the context of hydroxychloroquine toxicity screening, where roughly 10% of patients manifest visual field changes in a classic ring scotoma pattern before any evidence of photoreceptor damage is observed through optical coherence tomography macula and fundus exam. While HVF testing can be prone to error, well-documented, reliable studies that show a clear pattern of visual changes can alert clinicians to prompt workup.

### Low vision due to cerebral visual impairment: Differentiating between acquired and genetic causes [^112DEvsH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

We were able to establish a diagnosis in the majority of CVI in our study population, consisting of genetic disorders and acquired causes. After the exclusion of possible confounders, a 'purely' genetic and a 'purely' acquired subgroup remained. Between these two different etiologies, the ophthalmological examination revealed significant differences. Strabismus, visual field defects, and (partial) pale optic disc were significantly less common in the genetic group compared to the acquired group. This might be explained by the localization of the defect. In the acquired group, the most important cerebral damage was PVL and stroke, both mainly localized in the optic radiations. Damage to the optic radiations can cause visual field defects and retrograde optic disc pallor. In the genetic group, the optic radiations are probably less severely affected, and a more overall dysfunction of the brain and/or cortical anomalies might have resulted in the visual impairment. This theory is supported by the observation that normal optic discs are seen more often in individuals with cortical lesions compared to subcortical lesions. A comparable mechanism might result in the higher frequency of strabismus in the acquired group. To guide the alignment of the visual axes, the binocular connections in the striate cortex play an important role. When the input to the striate cortex is disturbed by prism-glasses, strabismus develops in primates. It can be expected that injury to the optic radiations by stroke or PVL, which also disrupts the input to the striate cortex, leads to strabismus.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^115HzVKw]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, particularly concerning ophthalmologic surveillance, the PS 2025 guidelines recommend considering visual field testing at 6–12 months for patients with macroadenomas that do not compress the optic chiasm. These patients are followed up with annual MRIs to detect potential early adenoma growth during the extended MRI interval.

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: A retrospective observational study [^114ukBQr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Different frequencies of severe scotoma were observed between the superior and inferior visual field quadrants in the temporal and nasal hemifields. Although upper-lower asymmetry was less prominent in the nasal hemifield, the upper-lower relationship in the nasal hemifield was the inverse of that in the temporal hemifield, with the frequency of severe scotoma being higher in the inferonasal quadrant compared to the superonasal quadrant (P = 0.00268, Mann–Whitney U-test, Figure 5 right).

The maximum diameter of the pituitary adenoma in the patients of the present study, as measured on the preoperative MRI, was 30.3 ± 8.8 mm (mean ± standard deviation; range, 12–50 mm). Representative Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results for asymmetric and symmetric visual field defects, coupled with the corresponding MRI images, are shown in Figure 6.

Preoperative MRI images of a 68-year-old man with pituitary adenoma exhibit a right-sided deviation in the coronal section through the optic chiasm ((A) T1 image; (B) constructive interference in steady-state image). Visual field defects in the preoperative greyscale display of Humphrey 30–2 results in the left eye are less severe compared with those of the right eye. Another set of preoperative MRI images of a 60-year-old man shows a symmetric pituitary adenoma located below the center of the optic chiasm ((D) T1 image; (E) T2 image). The Humphrey 30–2 results of the patient display symmetric visual field defects.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^115skJ49]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The potential causes of homonymous hemianopia (HH) are dependent on the age of the patient. The most common cause of HH in adults is stroke. Approximately 8%–10% of stroke patients have permanent HH, and 52%–70% of hemianopias are caused by stroke. As the population ages and stroke patients live longer, the incidence of stroke and resultant HH is likely to increase.

Other common causes of HH include traumatic brain injury (14% of HH cases) and tumors (11% of HH cases). Temporary HH with spontaneous recovery may occur due to migraine; occipital, parietal, or temporal lobe seizures; or transient ischemic attack. Nonketotic hyperglycemia can cause HH that resolves with normalization of the blood sugar.

For children aged ≤ 18 years, the most common causes of HH are tumors (27%–39%), brain injury (19%–34%), infarction (11%–23%), and cerebral hemorrhage (7%–11%).

### Primary visual cortical thickness in correlation with visual field defects in patients with pituitary macroadenomas: a structural 7-Tesla retinotopic analysis [^1169Yiqo]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

Vision loss remains a debilitating complication of pituitary adenomas. However, there is considerable variability in visual impairment before and after decompression surgery. Growing evidence suggests secondary damage to remote visual structures may contribute to vision loss in patients with chiasmatic compression. This study leverages ultrahigh field 7-T MRI to examine the retinotopic organization of the primary visual cortex (V1) and correlates visual defects with cortical thinning in V1 to characterize the consequences of pituitary adenomas on the posterior visual system.

- **Methods**:
		Eight patients (4 males and 4 females, mean age 44.3 years) with pituitary adenomas exhibiting chiasmatic compression and visual field defects, along with 8 matched healthy controls (4 males and 4 females, mean age 43.3 years), were scanned using 7-T MRI for this prospective study. Whole-brain cortical thickness was calculated using an automated algorithm. A previously published surface-based algorithm was applied to associate the eccentricity and polar angle with each position in V1. Cortical thickness was computed at each point in the retinotopic organization, and a cortical thickness ratio was generated against matched controls for each point in the visual fields. Patients with adenomas also underwent a neuroophthalmological examination, including 24–2 Humphrey automated visual field perimetry. Pattern deviation (PD) of each point in the visual field — i.e. the deviation in point detection compared with neurologically healthy controls — was correlated with cortical thickness.

### Visual field deficit caused by vascular compression from a suprasellar meningioma: Case report [^113FVR1L]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Suprasellar meningiomas typically cause bitemporal hemianopsia by direct compression of the chiasm, its blood supply, or both. We report another mechanism for visual loss in suprasellar meningiomas, whereby compression by the suprajacent vascular complex is the offending agent.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 78-year-old woman with a suprasellar meningioma was diagnosed incidentally. During the follow-up period, she developed an inferior homonymous wedge defect consistent with superior compression, without any detectable radiological progression. It was decided to resect her tumor.

- **Intervention**: The patient underwent a fronto-orbital approach for tumoral excision. Intraoperatively, a groove by the anterior cerebral artery complex was found along the superior surface of the chiasm. Postoperatively, the patient's visual deficit resolved.

- **Conclusion**: This case illustrates an unusual visual field deficit associated with a suprasellar meningioma. It also emphasizes the importance of frequent and careful visual field monitoring, which can precede radiological and symptomatic progression.

### Chorioretinopathy presenting as bitemporal hemianopia [^111NtCs1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Low credibility.

Bitemporal hemianopia is usually caused by chiasmal pathology. Rarely, chorioretinal lesions may develop symmetrically in both eyes and mimic chiasmopathy.

- **Methods**: This case series included three patients who presented to a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology centre with bitemporal hemianopic defects between 2021 and 2023 and were subsequently diagnosed with bilateral chorioretinopathy. All patients received comprehensive examinations from a fellowship-trained neuro-ophthalmologist and uveitis specialist to rule out other causes of visual dysfunction.

- **Results**: Three males aged 64, 62, and 72 years were included. All patients showed bitemporal hemianopic defects crossing the vertical midline on automated perimetry and binasal thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) revealed classical features of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) in two patients and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) in another. AZOOR diagnosis was preceded by neuroimaging in both cases, whereas the patient with CSCR had longstanding, electroretinography-confirmed lesions and did not require neuroimaging. Fundus appearance and visual field defects remained stable in all patients across 3–6 months of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Bilateral chorioretinopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bitemporal hemianopia in specific cases, including when visual field defects cross the vertical midline and when neuroimaging fails to reveal chiasmal pathology. FAF and macular OCT have high diagnostic value in such evaluations.
