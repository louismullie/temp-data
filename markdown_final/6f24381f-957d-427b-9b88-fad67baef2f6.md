## Question

rebound nystagmus cause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of rebound nystagmus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining rebound nystagmus and how to elicit it at the bedside. Then, I should verify the core neuroanatomy and pathophysiology, especially the neural integrator and cerebellar flocculus/paraflocculus. Next, I will categorize etiologies by mechanism and provide representative examples, while distinguishing physiological from pathological rebound. After that, I should review bedside diagnostic implications and how rebound nystagmus fits into central versus peripheral vestibular algorithms. Finally, I will synthesize a concise causal framework and note any controversies or exceptions that might modify interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and bedside maneuver. Rebound nystagmus is a transient jerk nystagmus that appears when the eyes return to primary position after sustained eccentric gaze, with slow phases in the direction of the prior eccentric position and corrective fast phases back toward center; it is typically elicited by having the patient maintain lateral gaze for about 60 seconds before returning to primary position, and it reflects impaired gaze-holding adaptation rather than a primary vestibular tone imbalance [^112AWHX3] [^116819uA].

> I need to check the core neuroanatomy next. The horizontal neural integrator for gaze-holding resides in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nuclei, with critical modulation by the cerebellar flocculus and paraflocculus. The vertical/torsional integrator is centered in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal with floccular involvement as well, so lesions or dysfunction in these circuits destabilize eccentric gaze and predispose to rebound phenomena when returning to primary position [^112UAEE3] [^112AWHX3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I verify the pathophysiology. Rebound nystagmus arises when the neural integrator fails to maintain tonic discharge for eccentric gaze, producing a centripetal drift that is normally countered by adaptive cerebellar mechanisms; with cerebellar impairment, those adaptive mechanisms overshoot or mis-calibrate, so when the eyes return to primary position there is a transient slow-phase drift in the direction of the prior eccentric gaze with corrective fast phases, essentially a maladapted attempt to reset the integrator's null position [^111XUL7j] [^112UAEE3].

> Let me consider the major etiologic categories. First, cerebellar disorders are the most consistently implicated, including degenerative ataxias such as SCA6 and SCA17, where rebound nystagmus coexists with gaze-evoked nystagmus and saccadic abnormalities; flocculus/paraflocculus dysfunction is a recurring theme in these presentations, aligning with the integrator hypothesis [^115prwY1] [^114JYq2r]. Second, structural cerebellar lesions including stroke, tumor, demyelination, and Chiari malformation can produce rebound nystagmus via direct injury to the vestibulocerebellum or its brainstem connections, often alongside other central ocular motor signs [^112AWHX3] [^111cus5k]. Third, toxic-metabolic and medication-related causes can destabilize integrator function, with notable examples including lithium toxicity, high-dose cytarabine cerebellar toxicity, and anticonvulsant effects, where withdrawal or correction of the offending agent may reverse the nystagmus [^117Gihp8] [^115T41u7] [^1142nzvU]. Fourth, genetic channelopathies and integrator-related genes such as FGF14 variants have been linked to early-onset nystagmus phenotypes that include rebound nystagmus, reinforcing a mechanistic tie to cerebellar ocular motor circuits [^115srYm5] [^116i3dg9]. Finally, I should confirm that a mild physiological rebound can be seen in healthy individuals at very eccentric gaze, which must be distinguished from pathological rebound by symmetry, duration, and associated signs [^114KgnZf] [^111paBSd].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought "purely peripheral vestibular lesions do not cause rebound nystagmus", but I should be cautious here. While rebound nystagmus is classically a central sign reflecting integrator or cerebellar dysfunction, rare peripheral mechanisms have been described, including ocular myotonia in myotonic dystrophy type 2 producing rebound-like eye movements without structural cerebellar or brainstem lesions, reminding me not to overgeneralize and to integrate the full clinical context before concluding localization [^116GBNKT].

> Next, I should review bedside diagnostic implications. The presence of rebound nystagmus, especially when elicited with sustained eccentric gaze and accompanied by gaze-evoked nystagmus, impaired VOR suppression, or saccadic dysmetria, strongly suggests cerebellar or floccular involvement and supports a central localization. In acute vestibular presentations, it should prompt consideration of cerebellar stroke or other central causes and can complement HINTS-based algorithms, though HINTS itself does not directly test rebound and should be interpreted alongside other central signs [^112AWHX3] [^111cus5k] [^115VRVAu].

> I will now examine how to distinguish physiological from pathological rebound. Physiological rebound, if present, tends to be low amplitude, symmetric, brief, and seen only at extreme eccentricities, whereas pathological rebound is more pronounced, asymmetric, sustained, and often coexists with other central ocular motor abnormalities such as impaired smooth pursuit, saccadic dysmetria, or failure of VOR suppression. Careful observation with and without fixation and attention to associated cerebellar signs help avoid overcalling normal variants [^111paBSd] [^112AWHX3].

> Let me synthesize the causal framework succinctly. Rebound nystagmus reflects a maladaptive neural integrator reset due to cerebellar dysfunction, most classically flocculus/paraflocculus impairment, leading to transient gaze-holding instability when returning from eccentric to primary position; causes span degenerative cerebellar disease, structural cerebellar or brainstem lesions, toxic-metabolic and medication effects, and genetic disorders affecting integrator stability, with a narrow physiological counterpart in healthy subjects at extreme gaze [^112AWHX3] [^116819uA] [^114KgnZf].

> But wait, what if the patient has episodic ataxia or a paroxysmal syndrome; could that still fit. Yes, episodic ataxia type 2 and other channelopathies can produce cerebellar ocular motor dysfunction including rebound nystagmus between attacks, consistent with intermittent integrator instability, so a history of episodic symptoms does not exclude this mechanism and may actually support it when combined with other cerebellar eye movement abnormalities on examination [^111RMJR6].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. Rebound nystagmus is a central ocular motor sign caused by impaired cerebellar modulation of the neural integrator, producing a transient, direction-reversed nystagmus upon return to primary gaze after sustained eccentric fixation; it is most commonly due to cerebellar degeneration, structural cerebellar or brainstem lesions, toxic-metabolic insults, or genetic integrator-channelopathies, and its presence should steer the clinician toward central vestibular or cerebellar pathology rather than a primary peripheral vestibular disorder, while remembering rare exceptions and the need to correlate with the full neuro-otologic exam [^112AWHX3] [^116819uA] [^116GBNKT].

Rebound nystagmus is caused by **cerebellar dysfunction** [^111yxwJt], particularly involving the flocculus and paraflocculus [^112AWHX3], which are critical for gaze-holding and neural integration [^112UAEE3]. It reflects a **failure of the neural integrator** to maintain eccentric gaze [^112UAEE3], leading to a drift back toward primary position and corrective saccades when the eyes return to center after sustained eccentric gaze [^112AWHX3]. Common causes include cerebellar degeneration (e.g. SCA6, SCA17) [^115prwY1] [^114JYq2r], demyelination, stroke, tumors, and toxic or metabolic insults [^notfound]; it is a central sign and not seen in isolated peripheral vestibular disorders [^111cus5k].

---

## Neuroanatomical basis

The **neural integrator** — comprising the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, medial vestibular nuclei, and cerebellar flocculus/paraflocculus — maintains eccentric gaze by converting velocity signals to position commands [^112UAEE3]. The **flocculus and paraflocculus** provide critical inhibitory feedback to stabilize the integrator; damage here impairs gaze-holding and causes rebound nystagmus [^112AWHX3].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanism

- **Gaze-holding failure**: Lesions of the flocculus/paraflocculus or their projections destabilize the integrator, causing drift back toward primary position during eccentric gaze [^112AWHX3].

- **Rebound phenomenon**: When returning to primary position, the maladapted integrator overshoots, producing slow phases toward the prior eccentric gaze with corrective fast phases, creating rebound nystagmus [^111XUL7j].

- **Central origin**: Rebound nystagmus is a hallmark of central vestibular or cerebellar disease, not peripheral vestibular disorders [^111cus5k] [^112AWHX3].

## Clinical conditions associated with rebound nystagmus

| **Category** | **Clinical conditions** |
|-|-|
| Degenerative cerebellar disorders | - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA6, SCA17) [^115prwY1] [^114JYq2r] <br/> - Multiple system atrophy <br/> - Chronic cerebellar degeneration [^112UAEE3] |
| Demyelinating diseases | - Multiple sclerosis [^notfound] <br/> - Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [^notfound] |
| Cerebrovascular accidents | - Cerebellar infarction <br/> - Hemorrhage <br/> - Brainstem stroke [^111cus5k] |
| Tumors | - Cerebellar or brainstem tumors (e.g. medulloblastoma, astrocytoma) [^notfound] |
| Toxic and metabolic causes | - Alcohol intoxication <br/> - Anticonvulsant toxicity (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine) <br/> - Lithium toxicity [^notfound] <br/> - Thiamine deficiency (Wernicke encephalopathy) [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic implications

- **Central localization**: Rebound nystagmus strongly suggests cerebellar or brainstem involvement and helps distinguish central from peripheral causes of dizziness or ataxia [^111cus5k].

- **Bedside test**: Have the patient maintain eccentric gaze for ≥ 60 seconds, then return to primary position; rebound nystagmus appears transiently upon return [^112AWHX3].

- **Associated signs**: Often coexists with gaze-evoked nystagmus, saccadic dysmetria, and impaired VOR suppression, reinforcing cerebellar localization [^112AWHX3].

---

## Summary

Rebound nystagmus arises from **cerebellar dysfunction** — especially involving the flocculus and paraflocculus — that destabilizes the neural integrator and impairs gaze-holding [^112AWHX3]. It is a central sign with localizing value, commonly seen in cerebellar degeneration, demyelination, stroke, tumors, and toxic-metabolic insults, and is not a feature of isolated peripheral vestibular disease [^111cus5k].

### Retinal nerve fiber layer thickening in ARSACS carriers [^111yVqd1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Two Caucasian Belgian families were diagnosed with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). The ophthalmological findings in both ARSACS disease and carriers are described.

Methods

In addition to a complete ophthalmological assessment, in both patients and carriers, spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography scans of the peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer were performed.

Results

Molecular analysis revealed a missense mutation which has not been reported before. Besides patients with ARSACS, who also presented additional ophthalmological abnormalities i.e. eye movement problems, ARSACS carriers demonstrated thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer.

Conclusion

The most conspicuous ophthalmological feature of ARSACS is an increased thickness of the peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer. Retinal striation and thickening of the nerve fiber layer on spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography appeared also in carriers of the ARSACS-gene. Other ophthalmological features encountered, were gaze-evoked nystagmus and rebound nystagmus.

### Nystagmus in infancy: causes, characteristics and main tools for diagnosis [^112c7qmb]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nystagmus is a rhythmic and involuntary movement of either one or both eyes, involving two phases leading the eyes to move away from and then return to the target. It might occur in the horizontal, vertical or torsional plane and can be further classified into a jerk or pendular waveforms. The pathophysiology behind the appearance of nystagmus, especially in infants, has still many unanswered questions, with several possible hypotheses published in the literature.

The prevalence of nystagmus in children ranges from 14 per 10,000 to 6.1 per 10,000 live births with an increased prevalence of children born prematurely.

Nystagmus in children can be roughly divided into two main groups: "Infantile nystagmus syndrome" (INS) when the nystagmus appears for the first time before age 6 months, and "Acquired nystagmus" in which appearance of nystagmus occurs later in life. Idiopathic nystagmus is a term used when all known causes for nystagmus have been ruled out.

The most common forms of INS are nystagmus associated with albinism or retinal diseases and idiopathic nystagmus. In nystagmus associated with other eye diseases, vision is not only affected by the excessive motion of the image on the retina, but also by a defective visual system. Based on the fact that in many cases the retina itself may, at least in-part, cause reduced visual acuity, a research group in Leicester have used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to explore the relationship between retinal morphology and vision, and develop the Leicester OCT grading system, that helps to provide a prognostic indicator for vision.

Several genes have been identified to cause nystagmus. Recently, the FRMD7 gene was pinpointed as a primary contributor to hereditary nystagmus. The main aetiologies for acquired nystagmus are related to neurological pathology.

Central positional vertigo and nystagmus

Positional vertigo and positional nystagmus (paroxysmal, persistent or both) can be the presenting feature of some focal lesions and diffuse diseases affecting the cerebellum or the brainstem. Downbeating nystagmus on straight head-hanging, upbeating nystagmus on returning to the upright position from supine and apogeotropic nystagmus during the supine head-roll test all occur in central paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The direction of central paroxysmal positional nystagmus aligns with the vector sum of the rotational axes of the semicircular canals that were being inhibited in each position: for example, a straight head-hanging position would inhibit both anterior canals, and so the nystagmus is directly upbeat with no latency to onset and a rapid crescendo phase which decreases exponentially. Time constants for the nystagmus, 3–8 s, correspond to those of the vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The possibility of a central positional vertigo/nystagmus is particularly important to consider in a patient presenting without any other neurological symptoms or signs, just with atypical BPV. Could the cause of the positional vertigo be just migraine or perhaps something more sinister such as a structural lesion? Unfortunately, not even a high-quality, contrast-enhanced MRI with thin, overlapping slices is totally reassuring, as the problem might be an MRI negative, antibody mediated, autoimmune process.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^112F4Ro4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Positional Nystagmus

This occurs when a change in head or body position elicits the eye movement, typically observed in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In BPPV, otoliths displaced into the semicircular canals, especially the posterior canal, result in abnormal endolymph flow when the head is moved into specific positions, producing transient torsional and vertical nystagmus. This form is highly position-dependent and usually brief, fatigable, and follows a latency period after the provocative maneuver. The Dix–Hallpike maneuver is a cornerstone for diagnosing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), particularly of the posterior semicircular canal. During this test, the patient is rapidly transitioned from sitting to a supine position with the head turned to one side and extended. A positive result is indicated by a brief latency followed by torsional upbeat nystagmus lasting less than 30 seconds, which fatigues with repetition — hallmarks of canalithiasis.

Pressure-Induced Nystagmus

This type of nystagmus is seen in conditions where abnormal communication exists between intracranial, middle ear, or inner ear structures. For instance, patients with perilymph fistulas or semicircular canal dehiscence (SCD) may exhibit nystagmus triggered by barometric pressure changes, Valsalva maneuvers, or straining. This type typically presents with direction-fixed horizontal or vertical-torsional nystagmus, reflecting inappropriate activation of vestibular end organs.

Sound-Induced Nystagmus

This nystagmus also known as the Tullio phenomenon, is another variant most often seen in superior semicircular canal dehiscence. In this condition, high-amplitude sounds stimulate the dehiscent canal, activating the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and resulting in nystagmus that is direction-specific based on the involved canal. This nystagmus is usually vertical or torsional and may be accompanied by vertigo, oscillopsia, or autophony.

Vibration-Induced Nystagmus

This is most commonly observed in unilateral vestibular loss. When a vibratory stimulus is applied to the mastoid or sternocleidomastoid, it activates the intact side's vestibular system asymmetrically, resulting in nystagmus toward the healthy ear. It is used diagnostically to reveal covert vestibular hypofunction in clinical settings.

### Characteristics and possible mechanisms of direction-reversing nystagmus during positional testing in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^1132EsPR]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

The clinical significance of reversal nystagmus in patients with BPPV may be to help clinicians identify the affected side, because reversal nystagmus occurs on the affected side. In this study, we found that compared with BPPV patients without reversal nystagmus, patients with reversal nystagmus required more than one CRP treatment. This result is somewhat similar to a previous study conducted by Jeong et al. Although statistical significance was not achieved (p = 0.059), a higher proportion of BPPV patients without reversal nystagmus recovered after only one CRP compared with those with reversal nystagmus (82% [14 of 17] versus 57% [26 of 46]). We assumed that the vigorous first-phase nystagmus can be induced by the accumulation of large numbers of otolith particles within the semicircular canals, and some otolith particles may not be repositioned after a CRP, so repeated CRP is required. A previous study conducted by Choi et al. revealed no significant difference in the treatment response between BPPV patients with and without reversal nystagmus after receiving same treatment. We speculate that the reason for these contradictory results is the difference in the patient population included. The majority of the patients included in our study visited the hospital for the first time, whereas in the study of Choi et al. data of patients were obtained from tertiary referral centers.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^115eBqMC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nystagmus is a disorder characterised by uncontrolled, repetitive to-and-fro movements of the eyes in a rhythmic pattern that may be physiological or pathological. It can occur as an isolated disorder but is most commonly part of an underlying ophthalmic or systemic disorder and is the most obvious or first presenting feature. It is common and affects both paediatric and adult age groups. The movements can be horizontal, vertical, torsional, or a combination of both. It usually starts as a slow movement of the eye away from the target, followed by a second movement to re-fixate back onto the target. If the second movement is fast, it is called jerk nystagmus, whereas a slow second movement is characterised by pendular nystagmus. However, with that said, the classification and waveforms of nystagmus remain highly intricate, and are based on aetiology, electronystagmography, and pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying nystagmus remain unclear, and several hypotheses and models have been proposed to explain its pathogenesis. As nystagmus remains a multifaceted condition, the clinical and laboratory assessments of nystagmus in patients with neurological disorders can provide crucial information for differential diagnosis. This can provide insight into various systemic disorders and aid in their diagnosis. Moreover, these involuntary eye movements can negatively affect visual function and quality of life, making nystagmus an important complex ocular condition. Visual acuity may be limited, and patients may experience vertigo, oscillopsia, or adjusted head posture. This makes it imperative to understand the various types, underlying mechanisms, causes, assessment, and treatment of nystagmus. A diagnosis should be established using clinical assessment and confirmed by various investigations, including electrophysiological tests, optical coherence tomography, neuroimaging, and genetic workup. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the underlying treatment is tailored to the diagnosis and aims to alleviate the visual symptoms and address the underlying aetiology. This review provides a comprehensive and structured description of the epidemiology, classification, clinical features, diagnostic workup, treatment, and recent advances in nystagmus. Moreover, this review uniquely integrates a comprehensive neuroanatomical and pathophysiological correlation for each subtype of nystagmus, offering readers a clearer clinical framework for differentiating among complex presentations. Unlike previous reviews, we have clubbed traditional classifications with newer diagnostic paradigms, incorporating nystagmoid movements, waveform analysis, and triggered nystagmus variants — areas which were either underrepresented or not structurally detailed in earlier works. Additionally, we have included updated neuro-ophthalmic diagnostic algorithms, realigned classifications by modern etiological groups (eg, vestibular, cerebellar, paraneoplastic), and introduced emerging diagnostic tools such as eye-tracking-based waveform analysis and AI-assisted vestibular testing, which reflect recent clinical advances. Importantly, we have also included a dedicated section outlining recent advances in treatment modalities and the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and monitoring of nystagmus, which further strengthens the clinical relevance of this work.

### Impaired fixation suppression of horizontal vestibular nystagmus during smooth pursuit: pathophysiology and clinical implications [^111YxGQo]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Visual suppression of horizontal SN during vertical pursuit was less effective than during static visual fixation, implying that separate neural networks mediated visual fixation and pursuit. When horizontal pursuit appears relatively impaired, the degree may depend on how much an underlying horizontal SN is released during tracking. At the bedside, testing vertical pursuit may be a simple way to bring out or enhance a spontaneous horizontal vestibular nystagmus.

### Less talked variants of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^117AuVfi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic criteria were established for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common vestibular disorder worldwide, by the Barany Society in 2015. This marked an important milestone in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV. However, there still remain uncertainties and ambiguities regarding the clinical features and pathophysiology of BPPV, and its clinical variants. In this manuscript, we will discuss 1) the emerging and controversial syndromes of BPPV (i.e., canalolithiasis of the anterior canal, cupulolthiasis of the posterior canal, and lithiasis of multiple canals) with updates, 2) atypical nystagmus according to the canal involved (e.g., nystagmus induced by head position changes in the pitch plane in horizontal canal BPPV, and positional downbeat nystagmus in posterior canal BPPV), 3) persistent geotropic positional nystagmus. Consideration of these uncommon types and manifestations of BPPV would broaden our understanding of BPPV pathomechanisms and allow differentiation from central vertigo and nystagmus.

### Central positional nystagmus: an update [^115gwDhU]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinically, central positional nystagmus (CPN) is often suspected when atypical forms of its peripheral counterpart, i.e., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), are observed, namely a linear horizontal nystagmus as in horizontal canal BPPV or a downwardly and torsionally beating nystagmus as in anterior canal BPPV. Pathophysiologically, CPN is caused by cerebellar and/or brainstem dysfunction. Recent work has provided further insights into the different clinical phenotypes and the underlying pathomechanisms. We performed a PubMed review focused on the findings on CPN using the key words "Central Positional Nystagmus", "Central Positional Vertigo", "Positional Nystagmus" OR "Positioning Nystagmus" OR "Positional Vertigo" OR "Positioning Vertigo" AND "Central" from January 2015 to August 2021. CPN may account for up to 12% of patients with positional nystagmus. Clinical data on CPN are mostly based on case reports or small retrospective case series. CPN is frequently associated with cerebellar and/or brainstem structural lesions, namely stroke, tumours or demyelination, or diffuse involvement of these structures due to degenerative or autoimmune/paraneoplastic diseases; it is also found in patients with vestibular migraine. CPN can be paroxysmal or persistent. The direction of the nystagmus is often downward in head-hanging or apogeotropic in lateral supine positions; combinations of both forms also occur. Clinically it is important to note that CPN is often associated with other central, often cerebellar ocular motor or other neurological signs; typically, it is not improved by the therapeutic liberatory manoeuvres for BPPV. These additional features are also important for the diagnosis, in particular if no structural lesions are found. Pathophysiologically, CPN is believed to reflect an abnormal integration of semicircular canal-related signals by the cerebellar nodulus, uvula and/or tonsil, ultimately providing an erroneous estimation of the head tilt and/or eye position coordinates. The natural course of CPN remains, so far, largely unknown. Symptomatic treatment of CPN consists of pharmacotherapy, e.g., with 4-aminopyridine, and causative treatment of the underlying disease if known. CPN is an important differential diagnosis to BPPV and a clinically relevant entity with heterogenous clinical presentations and various pathomechanisms and etiologies. In particular, studies on the natural course and treatment of CPN are needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^116LZjXi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Posterior versus anterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — nystagmus features and cautions include that the nystagmus typically fatigues when the maneuver is repeated, but repeating the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to demonstrate fatigability is not recommended and the panel did not include nystagmus fatigability as a diagnostic criterion. Anterior canal BPPV is uncommon, accounting for 1% to 3% of cases; a downbeating vertical component in addition to the torsional nystagmus toward the dependent ear could imply anterior canal rather than posterior canal BPPV, but this diagnosis should be considered with caution because downbeating positional nystagmus related to brainstem or cerebellar lesion can produce a similar pattern and should be ruled out.

### Paroxysmal alternating nystagmus [^1151XdQm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal reversal of spontaneous nystagmus has rarely been described. Herein, we report recurrent bouts of vertigo and oscillopsia in association with reversed spontaneous nystagmus in a patient with prior surgical resection of the cerebellar vermis due to medulloblastoma and subsequent labyrinthine damage. The symptoms almost completely resolved with carbamazepine. The episodes may be ascribed to paroxysmal reversal of the vestibular asymmetry due to intermittent decompensation by the deficient cerebellum.

### Impaired fixation suppression of horizontal vestibular nystagmus during smooth pursuit: pathophysiology and clinical implications [^1166BTP6]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The main finding of this study is that most of our patients showed better suppression of the nystagmus when fixating a stationary target than when following a pursuit stimulus. In other words, pursuit brought out the spontaneous vestibular nystagmus. This effect was most easily seen during vertical pursuit since, being orthogonal to the horizontal component of the SN, it was not contaminated by superimposed pursuit movements in the same or opposite direction as the slow phase of the SN. Quantitatively, the effect was also seen for horizontal nystagmus during horizontal pursuit, even with an inferred correction that assumed superposition of intact pursuit movements and the SN. A comparable effect of a superimposed bias by the underlying nystagmus was also seen in head impulse tests of healthy subjects during induction of a superimposed post‐rotatory nystagmus These findings are discussed first by considering the circuits within the brain that mediate pursuit of objects moving within the environment versus those that mediate fixation suppression of unwanted drift of the eyes such as from a pathological vestibular nystagmus, and secondly, how this information might be used at the bedside to reveal the presence of an underlying SN without having to put the patient in the dark to eliminate fixation.

The neural circuitry underlying pursuit of a moving target versus maintaining fixation on a stationary target

Vision is best when motion of images on the fovea is minimized. Motion of images on the fovea can be from many sources including perturbations of the head during fixation of stationary objects in the environment, movement of a target of interest in the environment, and inherent drifts of the eyes from neural "noise" in the gaze‐holding networks within the brain and the ocular muscles themselves. Whilst the goal of the brain is the same for each of these "threats" to vision — to detect motion of images on the fovea and to suppress it — the circuits that accomplish these tasks are widely distributed with considerable overlap

One often expressed view is that fixation is a special case of pursuit of a target moving at a low speed, with the extreme case being tracking a target that is "moving" at zero velocity. In support of this idea is that patients with neurological disease who have deficits in pursuit usually have comparable deficits in suppression of an unwanted spontaneous vestibular nystagmus. This is typically the case in patients with chronic lesions in the cerebellum and the flocculus in particular, for example Zee et al. but also in normal subjects when challenged with high‐velocity pursuit targets with the head still, or tracking a target moving with the head at comparable high speeds that exceed normal capabilities

### Downbeat nystagmus… [^117Gihp8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Downbeat nystagmus developed in a 67-year-old hypomagnesemic woman while she was receiving lithium carbonate for depression. This nystagmus abated each time lithium carbonate therapy was withdrawn, and no alternative causes of nystagmus were demonstrated. However, this nystagmus occurred despite serum lithium carbonate levels in the nontoxic range. Total-body magnesium deficiency may have enhanced the toxic effect of lithium carbonate on cerebellomedullary connections. Coppeto JR, Monteiro MLR, Lessell S, Bear L, Martinez-Maldonado M.

### Eye movement abnormalities in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) [^114JYq2r]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is associated with an expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the gene encoding the TATA-binding protein. In this quantitative characterization of eye movements in SCA17 mutation carriers, we investigated whether eye movement abnormalities originate from multiple lesion sites as suggested by their phenotypic heterogeneity.

Methods

Eye movements (saccades, smooth pursuit) of 15 SCA17 mutation carriers (mean age 36.9 years, range 20 to 54 years; mean disease duration 7.3 years, range 0 to 20 years; 2 clinically unaffected, 13 affected) were compared with 15 age-matched control subjects using the video-based two-dimensional EYELINK II system.

Results

Smooth pursuit initiation (step-ramp paradigm) and maintenance were strongly impaired, i.e., pursuit latency was increased and acceleration decreased, whereas latency and position error of the first catch-up saccade were normal. Visually guided saccades were hypometric but had normal velocities. Gaze-evoked nystagmus was found in one-third of the mutation carriers, including downbeat and rebound nystagmus. There was a pathologic increase in error rates of antisaccades (52%) and memory-guided saccades (42%). Oculomotor disorders were not correlated with repeat length. Smooth pursuit impairment and saccadic disorders increased with disease duration.

Conclusions

Several oculomotor deficits of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) mutation carriers are compatible with cerebellar degeneration. This is consistent with histopathologic and imaging (morphometric) data. In contrast, increased error rates in antisaccades and memory-guided saccades point to a deficient frontal inhibition of reflexive movements, which is probably best explained by cortical dysfunction and may be related to other phenotypic SCA17 signs, e.g., dementia and parkinsonism.

Positional nystagmus without positional vertigo

BPV can be overdiagnosed if its unique attribute, canal-plane nystagmus, is not sought. With removal of visual fixation, an asymptomatic low-amplitude positional nystagmus is common in healthy subjects: about 55% have upbeating nystagmus in the Dix–Hallpike position, with slow-phase velocity up to 5°/s. Unilateral horizontal positional nystagmus is also common (23% geotropic, 32% apogeotropic), although bilateral, direction-changing apogeotropic or geotropic nystagmus is rare (less than 5%).

Videonystagmography high-frequency headshake subtest in children — Purpose is used to assess asymmetrical vestibular system firing, with the population identified as children aged over 10 months. In normal subjects, no nystagmus should be observed in response to horizontal headshake; if there is asymmetric vestibular function, an initial burst of nystagmus, typically horizontal and beating toward the intact ear, decays over approximately 30 seconds; for central involvement, nystagmus can occur with a latent onset and/or may be persistent beyond 30 seconds, and vertical nystagmus after horizontal headshake can suggest central pathology. The method specifies the patient is seated with vision denied and head tilted 20° downward, the head is moved horizontally at about 2 Hz with displacement of approximately 30° horizontally for 15–20 seconds, and after stopping the headshake the eyes are observed for up to 60 seconds. Normative data are none specific to children, and most laboratories consider three consecutive beats of nystagmus pathological.

Figure 2 — nystagmus patterns in acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) depict gaze direction, amplitude, and central versus peripheral cues; green indicates a peripheral pattern, orange an ambiguous pattern, and red central, with open circles indicating no nystagmus in that gaze direction. The degree of nystagmus is defined as follows: first degree is only present when the patient is looking in the direction of the fast phase; second degree is present both in primary gaze and when looking in the direction of the fast phase; third degree is present in primary gaze and also when looking both to the right and left. In AVS, nystagmus that is torsional or vertical downbeat indicates a central cause, and the absence of nystagmus or direction‑fixed nystagmus does not, by itself, exclude stroke.

### Surgical interventions for infantile nystagmus syndrome [^115KM3AK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a type of eye movement disorder that can negatively impact vision. Currently, INS cannot be cured, but its effects can potentially be treated pharmacologically, optically, or surgically. This review focuses on the surgical interventions for INS. Despite the range of surgical interventions available, and currently applied in practice for the management of INS, there is no clear consensus, and no accepted clinical guidelines regarding the relative efficacy and safety of the various treatment options. A better understanding of these surgical options, along with their associated side effects, will assist clinicians in evidence-based decision-making in relation to the management of INS.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 3 July 2020, with no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of surgical options for treating INS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our prespecified outcome measures were the change from baseline in: binocular best-corrected distance visual acuity; head posture; amplitude, frequency, intensity, and foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform; visual recognition times; quality of life and self-reported outcome measures; incidence of adverse effects with a probable causal link to treatment; and permanent adverse effects after surgery. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data from eligible RCTs, and judged the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We reached consensus on any disagreements by discussion. We summarised the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We only identified one eligible RCT (N = 10 participants), undertaken in India. This trial randomised participants to receive either a large retro-equatorial recession of the horizontal rectus muscle of 9 mm on the medial rectus and 12 mm on the lateral rectus, or a simple tenotomy and resuturing of the four horizontal rectus muscles. We did not identify any RCTs comparing a surgical intervention for INS relative to no treatment. In the single eligible RCT, both eyes of each participant received the same intervention. The participants' age and gender were not reported, nor was information on whether participants were idiopathic or had sensory disorders. The study only included participants with null in primary position and did not explicitly exclude those with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus. The study did not report funding source(s) or author declaration of interests. The evaluation period was six months. We judged this study at low risk for sequence generation and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias. The risk of bias was unclear for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. There is very uncertain evidence about the effect of the interventions on visual acuity and change in amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the nystagmus waveform. We were unable to calculate relative effects due to lack of data. None of the participants in either intervention group reported adverse effects at six-month follow-up (very low-certainty evidence). There was no quantitative data reported for quality of life, although the study reported an improvement in quality of life after surgery in both intervention groups (very low-certainty evidence). Change in head posture, foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform, visual recognition times, and permanent adverse effects after surgery were not reported in the included study. We judged the certainty of the evidence, for both the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, to be very low. Due to a lack of comprehensive reporting of adverse events, there was also very low-certainty of the safety profile of the evaluated surgical interventions in this population. As such, we are very uncertain about the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions for the surgical management of INS.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review identified minimal high-quality evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS. The limited availability of evidence must be considered by clinicians when treating INS, particularly given these procedures are irreversible and often performed on children. More high-quality RCTs are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of surgical interventions for INS. This will assist clinicians, people with INS, and their parents or caregivers to make evidence-based treatment decisions.

### Pulse-synchronous torsional nystagmus [^116ZZxGn]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purely torsional spontaneous nystagmus almost always has a central vestibular cause. We describe a man with spontaneous pulse-synchronous torsional nystagmus in which the clockwise component corresponded to his pulse upswing, in keeping with a peripheral vestibular cause; following imaging we diagnosed left-sided superior canal dehiscence syndrome. Identifying pulse synchronicity of spontaneous nystagmus may help to distinguish central from peripheral vestibular torsional nystagmus, and is readily confirmed at the bedside using Frenzel's glasses and a pulse oximeter.

### Optokinetic nystagmus: six practical uses [^1163Ggbe]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is a reflexive eye movement in response to movement of the viewer's visual environment that consists of a slow phase eye movement in the direction of the stimulus followed by a quick phase in the opposite direction. When tested at the bedside, the slow phases represent smooth pursuit, while the quick phases represent saccades. Normally, OKN is conjugate and symmetric (horizontally and vertically). Abnormalities in the optokinetic response can provide diagnostic and localising value. We describe six clinical scenarios where OKN testing is most useful for the practising neurologist.

Predominantly Horizontal Central Vestibular Nystagmus

Direction-Fixed Horizontal Central Vestibular Nystagmus

This is predominantly horizontal. It remains direction-fixed in the primary gaze position, which means that it beats either towards the normal or the pathological side in a fixed direction. While direction-fixed nystagmus is more typical of peripheral lesions, certain brainstem pathologies, particularly involving vestibular nuclei or their commissural connections, may produce a direction-fixed horizontal nystagmus. Central lesions may cause tonic imbalance in vestibular output, mimicking peripheral vestibular tone asymmetry. However, the lack of suppression with fixation, absence of vertigo, and associated neurological signs help differentiate it from its peripheral counterpart. Though direction-fixed, if central, it may not follow Alexander's law and is not inhibited by visual fixation. Often requires MRI to rule out brainstem infarcts or demyelinating lesions.

Latent Nystagmus

Conjugate horizontal jerk nystagmus that manifests only on monocular occlusion. Arises due to disruption of binocular visual input control over the brainstem nuclei, especially involving the accessory optic system and vestibular integrators. In patients with congenital strabismus or infantile esotropia, latent nystagmus is a manifestation of impaired fusion. It is absent when both eyes are open, but when one eye is occluded, the uncovered eye exhibits a conjugate horizontal jerk nystagmus with fast phase toward the uncovered eye. Latent nystagmus is a hallmark of fusional disruption and is part of the "nystagmus compensation syndrome". It may coexist with congenital motor nystagmus and improves with binocular fixation.

Periodic Alternating Nystagmus (PAN)

Horizontal, conjugate, jerk nystagmus that periodically alternates direction in the fast phase. PAN commonly occurs in association with Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis, cerebellar ataxia, and stroke. Originates in the nodulus and uvula of the cerebellum, regions that regulate the velocity storage mechanism of the vestibular system. PAN is characterized by cyclic reversal of nystagmus direction, typically every 90–120 seconds. The mechanism involves dysfunctional velocity storage integration, possibly due to lesions in the vestibulo-cerebellum or brainstem. Associated with Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis, cerebellar degeneration, or brainstem stroke. Nystagmus may respond to baclofen, a GABA agonist that resets the velocity storage cycle. PAN is purely horizontal, and changes direction periodically, unlike most other nystagmus types.

Spontaneous nystagmus — diagnostic accuracy for central causes is limited: across six studies (621 patients), sensitivity for a central cause was 52.3% (95% CI 29.8%–74.0%) and specificity was 42.0% (95% CI 15.5%–74.1%), and because nearly all patients with vestibular neuritis have spontaneous nystagmus and about half of patients with cerebellar stroke do, the mere presence of spontaneous nystagmus is not helpful in distinguishing central from peripheral causes.

Family 2

The NYS4 pedigree now consists of 17 affected individuals with eye movement anomalies (Fig. 1B). These include nystagmus (gaze-evoked, upbeat and rebound), poor or absent smooth pursuit, and hyperactive vestibulo-ocular reflex. II.16 and III.29 also manifested ataxia, while II.6, II.8, and III.35 had balance problems. II.10 and III.34 reported dizzy spells and mild coordination problems, respectively, without nystagmus. Strabismus and seizures were variably present. Clinical features are summarised in Table 1.

WGS of III.63 and III.64 did not detect pathogenic SNVs in known nystagmus or ataxia genes. However, a 161 kb heterozygous deletion within the NYS4 interval was identified in both individuals (chr13:102,250,764–102,412,039, hg19), encompassing 2 exons of FGF14 and 4–5 exons of ITGBL1 (depending on isoform) (Fig. 2A, B). This CNV was also absent from ClinVar (August 2022) and DECIPHER (April 15th, 2022 release). Segregation analysis by PCR showed the deletion was present in 12/12 affected and 0/9 unaffected individuals (Table 1). The deletion was classified as pathogenic according to the ACMG guidelines.

STANDING algorithm for patients with dizziness, vertigo, or instability — structure, validation, and performance: The algorithm directs clinicians to examine for nystagmus and proceed via sequential steps "1: Is nystagmus present? 2: Nystagmus characteristics? 3: If HIT is indicated, what is the result? 4: Patient can stand/walk independently?", with action nodes including "Perform Head Impulse test", "Supine head roll test for hc-BPPV", and "Dix-Hallpike test for pc-BPPV", and terminal labels "Central cause of symptoms" and "Peripheral cause of symptoms". The protocol "has been internally and externally validated" and "is a focused physical examination aimed at differentiating central from peripheral causes of dizziness (and specifically making the diagnosis of pc- and hc-BPPV) in four steps", with step descriptions specifying nystagmus presence/characteristics, head impulse testing for spontaneous direction-fixed nystagmus, and final assessment of gait unsteadiness. Reported performance shows that the "sensitivity for identifying a central cause of the dizziness (mostly strokes) ranged from 93.4% to 100% and the specificities from 71.8% to 94.3%", it "does not include the test of skew (part of HINTS) or test of hearing (part of HINTS plus)", and "The average time needed for emergency physicians to perform the STANDING protocol is less than 3 min".

### Patient information: nystagmus… [^113Vkdbj]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

There are 2 major categories of nystagmus related to when the disease occurs. Congenital nystagmus is present shortly after birth. Acquired nystagmus begins after 6 months of life. Congenital motor nystagmus is the most common type of congenital nystagmus. This usually occurs by itself, is not associated with any other congenital abnormalities, and does not go away but can lessen with time. Other causes of congenital nystagmus include developmental abnormalities in the eye structures, such as the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve, or abnormalities in the visual pathways in the brain. Acquired nystagmus has several medical and neurologic causes, including certain medications, stroke, brain injuries or tumors, and diseases of the vestibular system. When vestibular organs are not functioning normally, the body has a difficult time balancing and may induce nystagmus.

A clinician can evaluate for the different causes by taking a thorough history, by physical examination, and sometimes with blood tests and imaging. Symptoms of Nystagmus In congenital nystagmus, families typically notice involuntary eye movements in an infant. Congenital nystagmus affects visual development in children and can result in limited visual acuity. However, children typically do not experience vertigo or oscillopsia. Patients may also tilt or turn their head to see better or try to slow down the eye movements. In patients who develop nystagmus later in life, it can cause vertigo or oscillopsia. Treatment of Nystagmus Treatment of nystagmus depends on the underlying cause. For many types of congenital nystagmus, it is important to have a specialist evaluate the nystagmus, look for other causes of the nystagmus, and help maximize the patient's visual development. Glasses or contacts are helpful for some patients.

Strabismus surgery, an operation involving the muscles that control eye movements, is an option that may improve head position and lessen but not eliminate the nystagmus. For patients with acquired nystagmus, medications can be used in some situations. In patients with nystagmus caused by medications, the nystagmus usually goes away after discontinuation of the medication. Treatment of the underlying medical or neurologic problem can also help resolve nystagmus in some patients.

Mechanisms for development of nystagmus

The underlying mechanism of infantile nystagmus is not fully understood, although theories abound that attempt to explain its development. Most implicated defects are found in fixation, saccades, the optokinetic reflex, the neural integrator, or the pursuit eye movement systems. No single theory has as yet been able to explain the development of the condition in all its complexity in an oculomotor movement system that largely has intact saccades, pursuits, and vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) movements outside the nystagmus. Three systems play a role in maintaining a stable image on the retina: fixation, the VOR, and gaze control. During the first few weeks of life, fixation is poor as the fovea is maturing, and orientation to targets is largely mediated by subcortical pathways through the superior colliculus. This rapidly changes as top-down pathways from the cerebral cortex establish greater control of eye movements at approximately 2–3 months of age. Larger waveform saccadic oscillations and intrusions have been reported to precede the onset of the infantile nystagmus waveform.

The vestibulo-ocular system holds the eyes stable during head movement. The VOR is one of the earliest developing of the image stabilization control systems. In patients with INS, the VOR system appears to function normally with a superimposed nystagmus. Invoking the VOR, head movement, or head shaking does not suppress movement or improve visual acuity in nystagmus.

The gaze control system holds the eyes stable when they are in an eccentric position and is coordinated by the neural integrator. The neural integrator is proposed to convert the velocity of the head's movement generated by the VOR to a neural signal that is to be sent to the eye muscles for target tracking. In gaze-evoked nystagmus, it is presumed that the neural integrator becomes "leaky" allowing the eyes to drift away from the object of regard with a correcting saccade back to the target. During early infant development, it is likely that the neural integrator is "calibrating" itself. Inappropriate input or feedback during this calibration period could lead to a lifelong error signal. A number of theories of the development of nystagmus have postulated that errors in the inputs, outputs, or feedback loops within the neural integrator are at fault in the development of infantile nystagmus.–

Clinical examination of saccades

First, it is necessary to observe spontaneous saccades, for instance, when taking patient history and when triggered by visual or auditory stimuli. The patient is then asked to glance back and forth between two horizontal and two vertical targets (Fig. 4). The velocity, accuracy and the conjugacy of the saccades should be noted: (a) normal individuals can immediately reach the target with a single fast movement or one small corrective saccade; (b) slowing of saccades in all directions — often accompanied by hypometric saccades — occurs, for example, in neurodegenerative disorders or with intoxication (and with medication, particularly anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines); (c) isolated slowing of horizontal saccades is observed in pontine brainstem lesions due to a dysfunction of the ipsilateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF); this can be caused by ischemia, bleeding, pontine gliomas but also in Gaucher disease type 3, the later stages of NP-C and PSP; (d) isolated slowing of vertical saccades indicates a midbrain lesion in which the rostral interstitial medial longitudinal fascicle (riMLF) is involved, as in ischemic or neurodegenerative diseases, especially progressive supranuclear palsy or inherited disorders such as NP-C (in the latter, typically first downward and then downward and upward because there is a double innervation for upward saccades from the riMLF — a bilateral lesion of the INC impairs the range of all types of vertical eye movements and is accompanied by a vertical GEN, and a lesion of the posterior commissure (PC) also impairs all types of vertical eye movements and is associated with a convergence-retraction nystagmus (see)); (e) hypermetric saccades, which can be identified by a corrective saccade back to the object, indicate lesions of the cerebellum (especially the vermis) or the cerebellar pathways. Patients with Wallenberg's syndrome make hypermetric saccades toward the side of the lesion and hypometric saccades toward the opposite side due to a dysfunction of the inferior cerebellar peduncle (conversely, defects of the superior cerebellar peduncle lead to contralateral hypermetric saccades); (f) a slowing of the adducting saccade ipsilateral to a lesion of the MLF is pathognomonic for INO; (g) delayed initiation of saccades is most often due to supratentorial cortical dysfunction affecting the frontal or parietal eye field (e.g. Balint's syndrome) and is called ocular motor apraxia. Nowadays, the velocity of saccades can be quantified in clinical routine by video-oculography (Fig. 5), which also allows the detection of mild to moderate slowing of saccades that could be the first clinical sign of PSP, NP-C or Gaucher disease type 3.

### Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus [^114Ua5ex]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The head impulse test: examination of the horizontal vestibulo–ocular reflex (VOR)

The most common bedside test of the examination of the VOR is the head impulse test, which examines the VOR at a high frequency. To test the horizontal VOR the examiner holds the patient's head between both hands, asks him to fixate a target in front of his eyes, and very rapidly turns the patient's head horizontally approximately 20–30° to the right and then to the left. This is the most important bedside test for VOR function. In a healthy subject this rotation of the head causes rapid, compensatory eye movements in the opposite direction with the same angular velocity as the head movements, so that the eye position in space remains the same. In this way the target also remains stable on the retina. For instance, in unilateral right-sided labyrinthine failure the eyes move during head rotations with the head to the right, and the patient has to perform a so-called re-fixation saccade to the left to fixate the target again. This is the clinical sign of a deficit of the VOR (in the high frequency range) to the right. If the findings of the bedside test are unclear, the use of a video-based head-impulse test is indicated; this allows the gain of the VOR to be quantified.

### Novel phenotype with prominent cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction in spastic paraplegia type 39 [^115HP2rU]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

S1 (Subject 1), the index subject, was a 29-year-old male presenting with benign peripheral paroxysmal vertigo. Routine neurologic examination revealed marked gait disturbance for which the patient had never sought medical advice. He reported normal milestones during childhood and worked as a skilled specialist in manufacturing.

On examination he had grossly spastic gait with normal Romberg test and brisk muscle stretch reflexes with sustained ankle clonus. However, Babinski's sign was negative. His muscles were neither weak nor atrophic. Oculomotor testing revealed massive saccadic pursuit movements. There was coarse nystagmus evoked by upward and horizontal gaze. On downward gaze, however, the direction of the nystagmus was upward (to his forehead) (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Video). There was no nystagmus in primary position. Rebound nystagmus could easily be elicited. HIT (head impulse test) according to Halmagyi showed normal vestibular ocular reflexes (VOR), but the suppression of the VOR by fixation was markedly impaired, indicating cerebellar dysfunction. Optokinetic nystagmus was reduced. Despite these prominent findings the patient had no subjective visual complaints. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. In particular there was no sensory, autonomic or cognitive dysfunction, no disorder of speech and fine finger movements, and no ataxia of gait or the upper limbs.

In S2 (subject 2), his 35-year-old sister, an office employee with good cognitive abilities, a marked gait disturbance had been present from early childhood with a very slowly progressive course. In terms of quality, her neurological findings were identical to subject S1; however, somewhat more pronounced. At the age of around 18 years, she developed secondary amenorrhea. Videonystagmography (VNG), done in S1 and S2, revealed a grossly reduced ability of fixation to suppress the VOR (Fig. 2). The father, S5 (subject 5), of S1 and S2 had no complaints. On examination he had sustained ankle clonus without Babinski's sign. Gait and balance were normal and there was no oculomotor disturbance.

The same was true for the mother, S4 (subject 4), in whom unsustained ankle clonus was present.

Saccadic Intrusions And Oscillations

They involuntary conjugate saccades that disrupt fixation as compared to the slow drift in true nystagmus. Saccadic intrusions can be idiopathic or secondary to neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and metabolic or toxic aetiologies.

Square-Wave Jerks

They are horizontal conjugate saccades (typically < 2°) that interrupt the fixation. It consists of an initial saccade that moves the fovea away from the intended position of fixation, followed by a second saccade in the opposite direction that refoveates the fixation position. Associated with dysfunction of superior colliculus, brainstem omnipause neurons, or cerebellar fastigial nucleus.: Inappropriate release of saccadic commands leads to small horizontal saccades away from and back to fixation. Common in elderly and patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or progressive supranuclear palsy. Easily mistaken for nystagmus but lacks rhythmicity and slow-phase drift.

Macro-Saccadic Oscillations

Oscillations that straddle around a fixation point due to saccadic hypermetria. Typically, due to lesions in the cerebellar fastigial nucleus or cerebellar outflow pathways. Saccadic hypermetria results in overshooting saccades oscillating around a fixation point. Often seen in cerebellar disease, they retain intersaccadic intervals and mimic ocular tremors; however, they are nonrhythmic and not triggered by gaze.

Saccadic Pulses

These consist of a brief saccade away from the fixation position followed by an immediate recorrecting saccade, and can be differentiated from square-wave jerks by the intersaccadic interval seen in the latter. Linked to dysfunction of the neural integrator system, especially the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nucleus. Consist of small saccades that fail to hold eccentric gaze, immediately corrected by a return saccade without a pause. This results from instability in gaze-holding circuitry. They differ from square-wave jerks by their lack of intersaccadic interval and are often subtle. May occur in cerebellar degeneration and brainstem disorders affecting gaze stability.

Positional vertigo without positional nystagmus

If the story sounds like BPV, but there is neither positional vertigo, nor positional nystagmus with a correctly done Dix-Hallpike test, it is best to see the patient again rather than order tests. While an unequivocal diagnosis of BPV requires paroxysmal positional nystagmus, some patients who keep having positional vertigo but have no nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike test can do just as well as those who do have nystagmus after a repositioning manoeuvre. Others only have vertigo after coming up from the Dix-Hallpike test but do have retropulsion and measurable oscillation of the trunk at the same time, possibly due to otoconia on the utricular side of the PSC. These patients can be treated effectively with repeated sit-ups from the Dix-Hallpike position, aimed at liberating otoconia from the short arm of the PSC.

### Rethinking positional nystagmus: beyond BPPV [^112HUM5v]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Positional nystagmus is a frequently encountered yet often underappreciated clinical sign that provides critical insights into vestibular and central nervous system function. For the general neurologist, recognising and correctly interpreting positional nystagmus can significantly impact diagnostic accuracy and guide appropriate management of common and complex dizziness presentations. The current diagnostic framework for positional nystagmus disproportionately favours BPPV, underestimates central positional nystagmus (CPN), and over-relies on imaging. We argue for a paradigm shift that acknowledges clinical complexity, defines objective diagnostic thresholds, and strengthens neurological training.

Gaze holding

Underlying neuroanatomy

Gaze holding is controlled by a group of neural structures which differ for vertical/torsional and horizontal meridians. These distinct groups of structures are collectively termed the horizontal and vertical 'neural integrators'. The horizontal neural integrator includes the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (Pons), vestibular nuclei (Pons and Medulla) and vestibulo-cerebellum (Cerebellum). The vertical/torsional neural integrator is the Interstitial Nucleus of Cajal (Midbrain) although an intact flocculus (Cerebellum) is also necessary. Both neural integrators have multiple neural connections and their primary role is to coordinate tonic discharge to the extra-ocular muscles in order to maintain eccentric gaze.

Clinical assessment of gaze holding

Observe the eyes in primary gaze and in vertical and horizontal eccentric gaze either by turning the patient's head, or by presenting a large stimulus in eccentric view. Abnormalities of gaze holding are usually characterised by nystagmus, due to a slow drift towards primary position and a corrective saccade into the attempted position of eccentric gaze (GEN). Examination of nystagmus is detailed below.

Interpreting some common clinical findings while examining gaze holding

Typical signs of damage to the neural integrator, whether vertical, torsional or horizontal, include GEN (due to loss of eccentric gaze holding) and rebound nystagmus (nystagmus beats seen in the opposite direction to the eccentric gaze when the eye is returned to primary position). Abnormalities of VOR suppression (most commonly seen as failure of dampening post-rotational vestibular nystagmus following the spinning baby test) and OKR are also commonly seen together and reflect underlying cerebellar pathology.
GEN can also be seen with the use of anti-convulsants, sedatives and other drug intoxications.
GEN in all directions implies a cerebellar lesion, particularly the flocculus and has many causes.
Isolated horizontal GEN is often caused by an isolated pontine lesion. This is because vestibulo-cerebellar disorders tend to yield additional oculomotor signs.
Purely vertical GEN is due to a lesion of the vertical/torsional neural integrator which is the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (midbrain).
The presence of rebound nystagmus may indicate chronic, rather than acute cerebellar disease.

### The Chiari I malformation and the neurotologist [^1151XRdy]. Otology & Neurotology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The first objective of this paper is to report the clinical symptoms of 77 patients and the results of their neurologic, vestibular, and audiological evaluations done with magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed Chiari I malformations. The second objective is to report how the results of a vestibular evaluation can help neurosurgeons decide on the need for surgical treatment.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review of 77 patients seen between 1988 and 2000.

Setting

Tertiary care center.

Patients

The clinical data of patients under diagnoses of Chiari I malformation, which was filed in the vestibular laboratory computer, was analyzed.

Intervention

The cases included in this study were derived from a population of patients who were evaluated for dizziness, hearing loss, and tinnitus in the Torok Vestibular Laboratory.

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of central vestibular findings in the patients with Chiari I malformation.

Results

In this group of 77 patients, 10 had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and 22 had unilateral sensorineural hearing loss of varying severities. Horizontal spontaneous nystagmus was noted in 27 patients, vertical upbeat nystagmus in 3, and downbeat nystagmus in 4 others. Saccadic dysmetria was noted in 4 patients, optokinetic nystagmus was impaired in 3, and smooth-pursuit impairment was noted in 12 of the group. Positional nystagmus was noted in 9 patients. The Torok monothermal caloric test showed normal responses in 19 patients, hyperactive responses in 43, decruitment in 45, and rebound caloric nystagmus in 20. Surgical decompression of the Chiari I malformation was completed in 33 patients.

Conclusion

From this study it is clear that the results of the basic vestibular function-test battery reflect the functional deficit in the vestibulocerebellum that is presumed by its ectopic position. These tests results have given our neurosurgeons a stronger foundation on which to base surgical decisions for this disease.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^113Ad59q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The main goal of treatment is to alleviate the visual symptoms by reducing the speed of the nystagmus slow phase. In addition to this, the other aim is to negate the visual consequences of the nystagmus. In addition to visual disturbances, psychological, social, and cosmetic concerns are other reasons why patients with nystagmus seek treatment. Various medical, surgical, and optical options are available for treatment. Generally, those that abolish abnormal ocular oscillations while preserving physiological eye movements (saccades, vergence, and vestibulo-ocular reflex) are preferred. The cause of nystagmus, presence of visual complaints, and the type of nystagmus play a major role in determining the treatment modality.

Medical Treatment

Medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for the acquired forms of nystagmus. However, long-term therapy is limited by drug-related side effects. Several trials have been conducted to determine the optimal treatment approach for specific types of nystagmus. Table 1 summarizes drug treatments for different forms of nystagmus.

Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus (GEN)

It is characterized by involuntary eye movements when looking in specific directions. During the clinical assessment, patients' eye movements are evaluated by instructing them to fixate on stationary and moving targets and assessing smooth pursuits and saccades. It is typically observed when the gaze shifts towards the direction of nystagmus. This suggests an underlying neurological or vestibular disorder. Differential diagnosis should consider neurological, vestibular, or drug-related causes. Depending on the clinical context, further investigations such as neuroimaging or vestibular testing may be necessary. The GEN assessment is a diagnostic tool that reveals specific anatomical issues. (a) GEN indicates cerebellar disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, or medication-induced effects in all directions (b) Purely horizontal GEN indicates brainstem lesions that affect horizontal gaze-holding. (c) Purely vertical GEN points to midbrain lesions that affect vertical gaze. (d) Dissociated horizontal GEN with adduction deficit indicates internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to a medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF) defect. (e) GEN with rebound nystagmus is suggestive of cerebellar or flocculus/paraflocculus pathway impairment.

Vestibular Nystagmus

Assessment of vestibular nystagmus involves clinical history to identify symptoms and triggers, observation of eye movements for direction and intensity, positional testing such as the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre, evaluation of spontaneous nystagmus, gaze testing in different positions, caloric testing for vestibular function, and video-oculography to precisely record and distinguish between central and peripheral nystagmus patterns. Table 5 highlights the differences between peripheral and central vestibular nystagmus. Various studies have suggested that spontaneous nystagmus with an upward component can manifest as both central and peripheral vestibular disorders. Nevertheless, exclusively upward nystagmus is considered to be a distinctive marker of central vestibular dysfunction. Table 6 summarizes the assessment of acquired nystagmus during childhood. Table 7 show the Neurological Associations of Nystagmoid Movements.

Investigations

The first and foremost step is clinical assessment to establish a diagnosis, followed by paraclinical testing to confirm the diagnosis. The investigations available to aid in diagnosis include electrophysiology, neuroimaging, OCT, and genetic workup.

### Rethinking positional nystagmus: beyond BPPV [^111WtvwK]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic challenges in practice

Accurate interpretation of positional nystagmus requires knowledge of neuroanatomical correlates, nystagmus vector analysis, and vestibular physiology — skills often underrepresented in standard neurology or medical training. As a result, clinicians with limited exposure to vestibular disorders may struggle to identify the positional nystagmus characteristics of central pathology and also other central ocular motor signs.

Unlike BPPV, the nystagmus seen in CPN typically lacks latency and persists for longer while the head is maintained in the triggering position. These features are easily misinterpreted as cupulolithiasis variants of BPPV. Directional characteristics can also be diagnostically informative; for example, if the nystagmus direction is inconsistent with the stimulated canal, a central origin should be considered. Moreover, direction-changing nystagmus (a change in the direction of the nystagmus even when the head is still in the same position) cannot occur with BPPV where the direction of the nystagmus is driven by the gravity-dependent cupula displacement. Still, controversy remains, and no single set of features has achieved consensus as a reliable CPN diagnostic signature.

Clinical features associated with CPN that point to a central cause include positional vomiting and a lack of response to repositioning manoeuvres. However, the absence of standardised thresholds for defining "treatment failure" in BPPV complicates matters. Is one unsuccessful repositioning manoeuvre enough to question a BPPV diagnosis, or should multiple trials be attempted? These ambiguities hinder diagnostic clarity, particularly when clinical documentation is incomplete or fragmented across care settings. There is no consensus on this currently, but we believe this is an important area that future research should address.

### Questioning the role of rebound firing in the cerebellum [^1174QhAD]. Nature Neuroscience (2008). Medium credibility.

A key component of recent theories on cerebellar function is rebound firing in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Despite the robustness of this phenomenon in vitro, in vivo studies have provided little evidence for its prevalence. We found that intact mouse or rat DCN neurons rarely showed rebound firing under physiological conditions in vitro or in vivo. These observations necessitate a critical re-evaluation of recent cerebellar models.

Common nystagmus patterns useful for diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients describe that peripheral vestibular positional patterns include transient (lasts < 30 s) upbeat–torsional nystagmus triggered by the Dix–Hallpike test and transient (lasts < 90 s) horizontal nystagmus triggered by the supine roll test and beating toward the lowermost ear ("geotropic"), with the note that in hc-BPPV the nystagmus is seen no matter which side the head is turned; peripheral vestibular persistent patterns feature horizontal spontaneous nystagmus on primary gaze that is unidirectional ("direction-fixed"), commonly attributed to vestibular neuritis (but can be seen in stroke); central vestibular positional patterns include persistent positional downbeating vertical nystagmus associated with CPPV (but can be seen in BPPV variants); and central vestibular persistent patterns include positional horizontal nystagmus beating away from the lowermost ear ("apogeotropic") that does not dampen over time, often due to apogeotropic hc-BPPV (but is also seen in CPPV), as well as dominantly vertical or purely torsional spontaneous nystagmus and gaze-evoked direction-changing horizontal nystagmus, which are linked to stroke, Wernicke syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and medication side effects or acute intoxication.

### Nystagmus [^116RZNZc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The clinical and laboratory assessment of nystagmus in patients with neurologic disorders can provide crucial elements for a state-of-the-art differential diagnosis. An increasing number of publications in the fields of neuro-otology and neuro-ophthalmology have nystagmus in the center of interest, which makes frequent updates on the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of these contributions indispensable. This review covers important clinical studies and studies in basic research relevant for the neurologist published from January 2016 to August 2017.

Recent Findings

Current themes include vestibular nystagmus, positional nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus and after-nystagmus, vibration-induced nystagmus, head-shaking nystagmus, postrotatory nystagmus, caloric nystagmus, nystagmus in cerebellar disorders, differential diagnosis of nystagmus and treatment approaches (whereas infantile nystagmus syndrome is not addressed in this review). These studies address mechanisms/pathomechanisms, differential diagnoses and treatment of different forms of nystagmus.

Summary

In clinical practice, a structured description of nystagmus including its three-dimensional beating direction, trigger factors and duration is of major importance. The differential diagnosis of downbeat nystagmus is broad and includes acute intoxications, neurodegenerative disorders and cerebrovascular causes amongst others. In patients with positional nystagmus, the distinction between frequent benign peripheral and rare but dangerous central causes is imperative.

### Diagnostic value of nystagmus: spontaneous and induced ocular oscillations [^117G7mwG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Research over the past 20 years has provided a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of most forms of nystagmus and other ocular oscillations. To the clinician, these advances translate into greater accuracy of nystagmus as a diagnostic sign. However, to capitalise on these advances, it is important to systematically examine eye movements and interpret the findings with reference to pathophysiology. In this review we describe a scheme for examining the patient with nystagmus and interpreting common ocular oscillations; some examples are provided as video clips.

Magnetic Vestibular Stimulation–Induced Nystagmus

Nystagmus that occurs while a patient is undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending on the strength and direction of the field. Involves the vestibular end organs, particularly the horizontal canals, responding to magnetic field-induced forces on endolymph or otoliths. High-strength MRI fields can induce ionic currents or pressure gradients in the labyrinth due to the Lorentz force, resulting in tonic stimulation of the horizontal canal and subsequent nystagmus. This may produce horizontal nystagmus in the scanner, which resolves after exiting the field. It is more prominent in supine positions and can be misinterpreted if not recognized.

Recent studies have advanced our understanding of physiological nystagmus, particularly in the context of gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) and its characteristics in healthy individuals. Ritter et al investigated the occurrence of physiological GEN in healthy subjects during prolonged horizontal eccentric gaze at angles between 30° and 45°. The findings revealed that physiological GEN was elicited in all participants, with prevalence increasing at greater eccentricities: 71% at 30° and 100% at 40–45° The study also noted that eye drift velocities decreased during sustained eccentric gaze, indicating an increase in gaze stability over time. Additionally, physiological rebound nystagmus (RN) was observed in 21% of subjects after eccentric gaze at 30°, with higher prevalence at greater eccentricities. These findings provide quantitative benchmarks for eye drift velocities and the prevalence of physiological nystagmus in healthy individuals. Ozawa et al explored the stochastic properties of physiological GEN, also referred to as end-point nystagmus (EPN). The study suggested that healthy individuals commonly exhibit physiological GEN at wide horizontal gaze angles, ranging from −40° to 40°. This research highlights the variability and commonality of physiological GEN in the general population.

Pathological Nystagmus

Abnormal nystagmus due to damage to vestibular-oculocephalic or cortical areas affecting oculomotor function.

Spontaneous Nystagmus

This subtype of nystagmus refers to involuntary rhythmic eye movements with alternating fast and slow components while the eyes are in the primary position without any provoking stimuli (Figure 3).

Methods

Ethics approval and patients' consent

The study procedures have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Munich. All procedures were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients gave their written informed consent.

Participants and clinical assessment

Eighteen patients with primary OT (mean age 70.5 ± 5.9 years, 10 females) with typical symptoms and high-frequency tremor as well as 18 age-matched healthy controls (mean age 71.2 ± 6.3 years, 10 females) participated in the study. The patient cohort was derived from a previous study from our medical center focusing on the course of disease and postural imbalance assessed by posturographic measurements. The average disease duration of OT was 14.0 ± 7.0 years. Detailed patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. All patients underwent a standardized neurological, neuro-ophthalmological, and neuro-otological examination. In addition to the neurological evaluation, this included assessment of eyesight and eye movements (smooth pursuit, spontaneous, gaze-evoked and head-shaking nystagmus, impaired visual fixation, among others), a head impulse test and examination of the subjective visual vertical (SVV). A cerebellar ocular motor disorder was defined by the presence of one of the following findings: gaze-evoked nystagmus (left, right, both horizontally) or downbeat nystagmus, rebound nystagmus, impaired visual fixation suppression of the VOR. Pallesthesia was assessed using a C64/128 Hz tuning fork. Reduced vibration sense was defined as pallesthesia ≤ 4/8. Romberg's test was considered positive, when patients showed signs of imbalance with considerable staggering after eye closure or if they were unable to perform the task. All patients completed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC, ranging from 0 to 100%, > 80 high level of physical function; 50–80 moderate level of physical function; < 50 low level of physical function) and the Falls Efficacy Scale — International (FES-I, total score range from 16, i.e. no concern about falling, to 64, i.e. severe concern about falling) and were screened for fall events within the last 6 months.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^116gjUdX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Neurologic disorders mimicking benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can be suggested by specific nystagmus patterns and lack of response to typical care. Nystagmus findings that more strongly suggest a neurologic cause include downbeating nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, direction-changing nystagmus occurring without changes in head position, and baseline nystagmus manifesting without provocative maneuvers. Failure to respond to conservative management such as CRP or vestibular rehabilitation (VR) should raise concern that the underlying diagnosis may not be BPPV. Central paroxysmal positional vertigo from structural lesions can closely mimic BPPV, and among patients with known multiple sclerosis, BPPV was found to be a more common cause of acute dizziness than a multiple sclerosis flare.

Conclusions and future perspectives

Considerable progress has been made over recent decades in describing the clinical characteristics of different forms of nystagmus, as well as their pathophysiology and etiology. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying many forms of nystagmus are not well understood and, consequently, targeted treatments have not yet been developed. Indeed, most proposed treatments for nystagmus are yet to be validated in prospective, masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Due to the rarity of many forms of nystagmus, multicenter trials are required to evaluate an adequate number of patients. Several drugs could be potentially effective (listed in alphabetical order): acetazolamide, aminopyridines, anticholinergics (benztropine, scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl), baclofen, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, canabinoids, carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, memantine, phenytoin, selective potassium channel blockers, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, topiramate, triptans, and valproic acid. Knowledge of the possible effects of these agents — most of which act specifically on certain receptors or ion channels — will also further improve our insights into the pathophysiology of the underlying disorders and how to treat them.

### Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus [^113DbHLZ]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many patients present with symptoms of blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, 'bouncing images' (oscillopsia) or double vision. Other patients complain of dizziness, vertigo, postural imbalance, tendency to fall or recurrent falls, gait disturbances or ataxia. These symptoms may indicate a dysfunction of the ocular motor system. Unfortunately, they are often overlooked simply because patients are not adequately clinically examined, although an impairment of eye movements is important for the differential diagnosis and, in particular, to ascertain whether the brainstem or the cerebellum is affected. Further, the examination of eye movements is of clinical relevance for several disciplines, especially neurology, ophthalmology, pediatrics and neuropediatrics, internal medicine and otorhinolaryngology. In patients with an acute onset of the above-mentioned symptoms, the most important differential diagnosis is ischemia, bleeding or inflammation of the brainstem; they may also occur in Wernicke encephalopathy. If the symptoms are chronic or chronically progressive, possible causes can include metabolic, neurodegenerative, inherited or inflammatory disorders (multiple sclerosis or encephalitis) or tumors.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^1175dgoz]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vertigo and dizziness arise from many multisensory and sensorimotor syndromes of various etiologies and pathogeneses, which are best elucidated using an interdisciplinary approach. After headache, vertigo is one of the most frequent presenting symptoms to physicians in many disciplines, with a life-time prevalence of almost 30%. Here, we first review current pharmacological treatments for common peripheral and central vestibular disorders (for description of other therapies, see reviews). Second, we focus on those ocular oscillations that impair vision and may give rise to illusory motion of the visual environment (oscillopsia). In particular, the pathophysiology, topographic diagnosis, and current pharmacological treatment of downbeat nystagmus (DBN), upbeat nystagmus (UBN), acquired pendular nystagmus (APN), and saccadic oscillations that impair vision (for description of other therapies, see reviews) are discussed.

If functional complaints or impairments are evident, the clinician should proceed with a basic eye/vision exam which should include visual acuity (distant and near), monocular confrontational fields, pupils (size/equality/response), eye movements, an external exam (direct illumination of anterior segment), and nystagmus (primary position and gaze evoked), and the clinician should also perform a slit lamp exam, if available. Medications should be evaluated; drugs that may be associated with vision symptoms include antihistamines, anticholinergics, digitalis derivatives, antimalarial drugs, corticosteroids, erectile dysfunction drugs, phenothiazines, chlorpromazine, indomethacin, and others, and other co-occurring symptoms (e.g., migraines, sleep disturbances, chronic pain, mood disorders, PTSD) may be contributing factors or the source of the vision dysfunction.

### Nystagmus and central vestibular disorders [^117E2X2z]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will cover the recent advances in clinical and laboratory features, pathophysiology, and treatment of central vestibular disorders.

Recent Findings

Several features and mechanisms of central nystagmus have been identified over the years. Application of head impulse tests and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials has expanded our understanding of altered processing of canal-driven and otolith-driven vestibular signals in lesions involving the central vestibular structures. Integrated approach based on the symptoms and neurotologic signs enhances the diagnostic accuracy of acute vascular vertigo. Identification of isolated central vestibular syndromes has improved the diagnosis of central vertigo and our understanding of anatomic and functional organization of the central vestibular structures.

Summary

With the developments of clinical and laboratory neurotology, the spectrum of central vestibular disorders has expanded markedly over the years.

### Modeling the effect of gravity on periodic alternating nystagmus [^1139mduH]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) is a rare oscillatory ocular motor disorder. The effects of gravity on the dynamic behavior of PAN can be studied by monitoring the nystagmus while changing head orientation. Previous studies of patients with PAN reached different conclusions about the effect of changing the orientation of the head relative to gravity on the ongoing PAN, either no effect or a damping of the nystagmus within several minutes. What neuronal circuits could account for the difference in the effects of gravity among PAN patients? We modeled how the brain resolves the tilt-translation ambiguity in normal individuals and added an unstable, oscillatory vestibular system generating PAN. PAN was suppressed in our patient in ear-down positions, in a similar pattern to that of a previously reported patient. This effect was simulated by reducing the gain of the projection of the "rotation feedback" loop to the velocity-storage integrator to approximately 5% of its normal value. With normal "rotation feedback" PAN is expected to dissipate quickly as soon as the head is rotated away from upright position. Moreover, by disconnecting the rotation feedback completely (gain = zero) the model simulated PAN that was reported to be unaffected by gravity. Thus, understanding the effect of this single parameter, the gain of the rotation feedback, can explain the observed variability among our own and previous studies.

### An unusual phenomenon of spontaneously reversing nystagmus in peripheral vertigo – A case report and literature review [^115LWZVc]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Direction-changing nystagmus on positional testing is classically ascribed to a central pathology. We herein report a case of a patient with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) who demonstrated the unusual phenomenon of spontaneously reversing nystagmus, and discuss the theorised mechanisms with a novel illustration. In left lateral position, our patient's Videonystagmography (VNG) demonstrated an initially fast-phase geotropic nystagmus (leftward-beating, SPV 29°/s) which then paused for 8 s, then spontaneously reversed direction into a slow-phase ageotropic nystagmus (rightward-beating, SPV 7°/s). The rest of the neurootological examination and audiometry were normal. An MRI Brain scan also revealed no intracranial pathology. In subsequent reviews the vertigo resolved after repositioning manoeuvres for Left Horizontal Canal BPPV. With review of existing literature, this case may have exhibited coexistent left canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis, resulting in simultaneous ampullopetal then ampullofugal forces in a single head position. Other posited theories include that of Endolymphatic Reflux and short-term central adaptation of the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex. This case highlights a diagnostic challenge the otolaryngologists and neurologists may face with an atypical spontaneously reversing nystagmus in BPPV. However it remains a priority to rule out central pathologies first, and calls for specialists to take care in diagnosing horizontal canal BPPV by observing for a period of latency and spontaneous reversal of nystagmus first, so as to perform the appropriate repositioning manoeuvres.

### Head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examination for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome [^115VRVAu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dizziness is a common reason for people to seek medical care. Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a specific type of dizziness, which can include severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, nystagmus, or unsteadiness. Acute vestibular syndrome can be due to peripheral or central causes. It is important to determine the cause, as the intervention and outcomes differ if it is from a peripheral or central cause. Clinicians can assess for the cause using risk factors, patient history, examination findings, or advanced imaging, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) examination is a three-part examination performed by clinicians to determine if AVS is due to a peripheral or central cause. This includes assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning a person's head (head impulse), assessing the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and assessing whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of auditory function.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trials registers to September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included all retrospective and prospective diagnostic test accuracy studies that evaluated the HINTS or HINTS Plus test used in a primary care clinic, an urgent care clinic, the emergency department, or during inpatient hospitalization against a final diagnosis of a central etiology of AVS, as defined by the reference standard of advanced imaging or final diagnosis by a neurologist.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently determined eligibility of each study according to eligibility criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence. Disagreements were adjudicated by consensus or a third review author if needed. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central etiology for AVS, conducted clinically (clinician visual assessment) or with video assistance (e.g. video recording with goggles); we independently assessed the clinical and video-assisted examinations. Subgroup analyses were performed by provider type (e.g. physicians, non-physicians), time from symptom onset to presentation (e.g. less than 24 hours, longer than 24 hours), reference standard (e.g. advanced imaging, discharge diagnosis), underlying etiology (e.g. ischemic stroke, alternative etiologies [hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial mass]), study setting (e.g. outpatient [outpatient clinic, urgent care clinic, emergency department], inpatient), physician level of training (e.g. resident, fellow/attending), physician specialty (e.g. otolaryngology, emergency medicine, neurology, and neurologic subspecialist [e.g. neuro-ophthalmology, neuro-otology]), and individual diagnostic accuracy of each component of the examination (e.g. head impulse, direction-changing nystagmus, test of skew). We created 2 x 2 tables of the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and used these data to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants (981 women and 1043 men) with a mean age of 60 years. Twelve studies assessed the HINTS examination; five assessed the HINTS Plus examination. Thirteen studies were performed in the emergency department; half were performed by neurologists. The clinical HINTS examination (12 studies, 1890 participants) was 94.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.0% to 98.2%) sensitive, and 86.9% (95% CI 75.3% to 93.6%) specific (low-certainty evidence). The video-assisted HINTS examination (3 studies, 199 participants) was 85.0% to 100% sensitive (low-certainty evidence), and 38.9% to 100% specific (very low-certainty evidence). The clinical HINTS Plus examination (5 studies, 451 participants) was 95.3% (95% CI 78.4% to 99.1%) sensitive, and 72.9% (95% CI 44.4% to 90.1%) specific (low-certainty evidence). The video-assisted HINTS Plus examination (2 studies, 163 participants) was 85.0% to 93.8% sensitive, and 28.6% to 38.9% specific (moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses were limited, as most studies were conducted in the emergency department, by physicians, and with MRI as a reference standard. Time from symptom onset to presentation varied across studies. Three studies were at high risk of bias and three studies were at unclear risk of bias for participant selection. Three studies were at unclear risk of bias for the index test. Four studies were at unclear risk of bias for the reference standard. Two studies were at unclear risk of bias for flow and timing. One study had unclear applicability concerns for participant selection. Two studies had high applicability concerns for the index test and two studies had unclear applicability concerns for the index test. No studies had applicability concerns for the reference standard.

Authors' Conclusions

The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations had good sensitivity and reasonable specificity for diagnosing a central cause for AVS in the emergency department when performed by trained clinicians. Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. There were limited data for the role of video-assistance or specific subgroups. Future research should include more high-quality studies of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examination; assessment of inter-rater reliability across users; accuracy across different providers, specialties, and experience; and direct comparison with no HINTS or MRI to assess the effect on clinical care.

### Neuro-otology-some recent clinical advances [^114dbj6v]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Benign positional vertigo (BPV)

BPV is the commonest cause of recurrent vertigo. The vertigo attacks are brief, usually lasting seconds, rarely minutes, triggered by bending down, looking up or rolling over in bed. The elderly might present with falls getting out of bed. BPV is caused by otoconia dislodged from an otolith macula, moving within a semicircular canal duct ("canalithiasis") or becoming attached to its cupula ("cupulolithiasis"). As the head changes position with respect to gravity, movement of these ectopic otoconia, within the canal duct or on the cupula, under the influence of gravity, activates or inhibits canal afferents, producing vertigo and nystagmus with an axis that is orthogonal to the affected canal plane.

### Acquired pendular nystagmus [^116nGY4f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Acquired pendular nystagmus is comprised of quasi-sinusoidal oscillations of the eyes significantly affecting gaze holding and clarity of vision. The most common causes of acquired pendular nystagmus include demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and the syndrome of ocular palatal tremor. However, several other deficits, such as pharmacological intoxication, metabolic and genetic disorders, and granulomatous disorders can lead to syndromes mimicking acquired pendular nystagmus. Study of the kinematic features of acquired pendular nystagmus has suggested a putative pathophysiology of an otherwise mysterious neurological disorder. Here we review clinical features of neurological deficits that co-occur with acquired pendular nystagmus. Subsequent discussion of the pathophysiology of individual forms of pendular nystagmus speculates on mechanisms of the underlying disease while providing insights into pharmacotherapy of nystagmus.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^114EjWFi]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Periodic alternating nystagmus

Periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) is a spontaneous horizontal jerk nystagmus that changes direction every 90–120 s. Affected patients complain of oscillopsia and often turn their head in the direction of the quick phases in order to bring their eyes to a position in the orbit where the slow-phase velocity is minimized, thereby reducing oscillopsia. The diagnosis is often missed if the patient is not observed for long enough to detect the reversal of the nystagmus. PAN is most often caused by cerebellar dysfunction, in particular by lesions of the more lateral portions of the cerebellar nodulus or uvula. These lesions alter the velocity-storage mechanism in the brainstem, as has been shown in animal studies, and the oscillations are, therefore, thought to arise from disinhibition of the optokinetic–vestibular system. The treatment of choice for PAN is the GABAergic drug baclofen (5–10 mg tid), which completely abolishes the nystagmus in most patients. Memantine may be added, if necessary. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials of treatment for PAN, to date.

### Damping of monocular pendular nystagmus with vibration in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^111FkYDo]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Acquired pendular nystagmus (PN) occurs commonly in multiple sclerosis (MS) and results in a highly disabling oscillopsia that impairs vision. It usually consists of pseudo-sinusoidal oscillations at a single frequency (3–5 Hz) that often briefly stop for a few hundred milliseconds after saccades and blinks. The oscillations are thought to arise from instability in the gaze-holding networks ("neural integrator") in the brainstem and cerebellum.(1,2) Here we describe a patient with monocular PN in whom vibration on the skull from a handheld muscle massager strikingly diminished or stopped her nystagmus.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^114nFMj9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Assessment and Diagnostic Workflow

Efforts to classify nystagmus may fall short in clinical practice as one condition can result in various types of nystagmus. Comprehensive and targeted evaluation is essential for accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause. The single best and most important step in diagnosis is the clinical examination

A patient with nystagmus must first be examined in the primary gaze, followed by the observation of eye movements in cardinal gazes. The following characteristics should be assessed:
Binocularity: can be monocular or binocular
Conjugacy: Can be conjugate (both eyes rotate simultaneously in the same direction by the same amount) or disconjugate (they do not rotate in the same direction). Disconjugate may be further dissociated if the velocity or amplitude of the movements is different in the two eyes, or disjunctive if the two eyes simultaneously rotate in different directions.
Direction of movement: horizontal, vertical, torsional or mixed.
Velocity: Quantitative measurement of the slow-phase movement in degrees per second.
Waveform: oscillatory appearance of nystagmus on an oculographic trace. Jerky (constant, decreasing, or increasing velocity waveform) or pendular (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, elliptical, circular, convergent, divergent, or seesaw).
Frequency: Measuring beats per second or Hz (hertz)
Amplitude: Magnitude in degrees of each beat, that is, the amount of excursion of the globe with each phase.
Intensity: Qualitative measurement of the product of amplitude and frequency
Temporal profile: Continuous, intermittent or changing
Presence of null point: The direction of gaze or distance of fixation at which nystagmus is minimal or nil
Age at presentation: congenital or infantile if present from birth until six months or acquired if it develops after six months or later.
Gaze positions: Contributes to nystagmus, including trajectory
Vergence: may have convergence – divergence component.
Effect of provocative manoeuvres: changes in position, sound, Valsalva, headshaking, vibration, and hyperventilation.

The following approaches are used to categorise nystagmus into various types and streamline the diagnostic process based on clinical findings and patient history:

Neurologic Causes (Neurologic Group):

Assess the patient's birth and family history as well as their growth and development. If no relevant family history or signs of neurological issues were present, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the initial test.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Rebound nystagmus – A cerebellar sign? [^114SfqzB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The role of cerebellar disease in the production of nystagmus continues to be controversial. The cerebellum receives projections from visual and ocular muscle receptor afferents, and cerebellar efferent fibers project to vestibular and oculomotor nuclei and to the pontine reticular formation. These connections provide ample basis for disturbances of oculomotor control in cerebellar disease. 1, 2 Some authors are reluctant to attribute spontaneous nystagmus to disturbances of the cerebellum itself. The probability of concurrent dysfunction of the brainstem produced either by pressure or by direct brainstem involvement has been emphasized. 3, 4 The observations of Gordon Holmes5 provide pertinent oculomotor guidelines. After acute cerebellar hemispheric injuries, Holmes described paralysis of ipsilateral gaze followed by gaze-paretic nystagmus on gaze toward the side of injury. The slow phase was directed to a "rest point" located 10° to 30° from midline on the unaffected side.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Bruns' nystagmus revisited: a sign of stroke in patients with the acute vestibular syndrome [^111XUL7j]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Another mechanism for a Bruns' nystagmus would be a position bias, for example, in the gaze‐holding integrators themselves, either in the brainstem or the cerebellum. A position bias could also arise from the adaptive networks that create rebound nystagmus. Rebound nystagmus appears in straight‐ahead gaze following a sustained attempt at holding eccentric gaze, and leads to a new null in the direction of prior eccentric gaze. Finally, when fixation is allowed, the ability to suppress SN by fixation could influence the null position since SN of higher speed can be more difficult to suppress than that of lower speed. In sum there are many ways that imbalances in cerebellar or brainstem circuits can lead to Bruns' nystagmus, and perhaps this is one reason it is often difficult to localize lesions solely based on the side of the null. To clarify these ideas we simulated several examples of how different biases combined with GEN might lead to a Bruns' pattern of nystagmus (Figures S2 and S3).

Localizing lesions in patients with Bruns' nystagmus

From the view of localization of lesions, based on experimental work, we would expect a null point shifted towards the affected side when there are lesions close to the vestibular nuclei, inducing a vestibular tone imbalance but also impairing gaze‐holding, producing a GEN. To complicate matters, however, an isolated lesion of nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH), which is adjacent to the vestibular nuclei, may produce a SN beating towards the side of the lesion, and a GEN with a null away from the side of the lesion.

With pure cerebellar lesions, as indicated above, the null point can shift either way depending on the location of the lesion, usually contralesional if the lesion is in the cerebellar hemisphere and ipsilesional, if the lesion is in the posterior vermis. Whether or not the deep nuclei are involved, may also influence the shift of the null.

### Management of nystagmus in children: a review of the literature and current practice in UK specialist services [^113SX2zX]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Nystagmus is an eye movement disorder characterised by abnormal, involuntary rhythmic oscillations of one or both eyes, initiated by a slow phase. It is not uncommon in the UK and regularly seen in paediatric ophthalmology and adult general/strabismus clinics. In some cases, it occurs in isolation, and in others, it occurs as part of a multisystem disorder, severe visual impairment or neurological disorder. Similarly, in some cases, visual acuity can be normal and in others can be severely degraded. Furthermore, the impact on vision goes well beyond static acuity alone, is rarely measured and may vary on a minute-to-minute, day-to-day or month-to-month basis. For these reasons, management of children with nystagmus in the UK is varied, and patients report hugely different experiences and investigations. In this review, we hope to shine a light on the current management of children with nystagmus across five specialist centres in the UK in order to present, for the first time, a consensus on investigation and clinical management.

### American academy of audiology clinical consensus statement: assessment of vestibular function in the pediatric population [^1135psws]. Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (2025). High credibility.

Identification of nystagmus in children — definition and recognition states that nystagmus is involuntary rhythmic eye movement with fast and slow phases, that its direction is named for the direction of the fast phase, that horizontal (left- or right-beating) and vertical (up- or down-beating) nystagmus can be easily recognized while torsional nystagmus may be difficult to observe without goggles, and that abnormal eye movements are common in young children and may include ocular oscillation, opsoclonus, and flutter which are not vestibular in origin.

### Infantile nystagmus without overt eye abnormality: early features and neuro-ophthalmological diagnosis [^112Usbjg]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nystagmus was defined by the child neurologist Jean Aicardì in his seminal book of paediatric neurology as 'an involuntary, rhythmical, conjugate oscillatory movement of the eyes, due to dysfunction of the complex mechanisms that maintain ocular fixation'. The fixation reflex that maintains the visual target centred in the fovea requires fronto‐nigral‐collicular circuits and depends upon the motion detection (magnocellular) portion of the visual system. Early in life these anatomo‐functional systems are in their crucial developmental period; as these are driven by sensory input, they are consequently vulnerable to prechiasmal visual disorders.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of infantile nystagmus include sensory defects (disorders of the eye and anterior visual pathways causing visual deficit), a variety of neurological syndromes disrupting oculomotor circuits and congenital idiopathic nystagmus, nowadays preferentially called idiopathic infantile nystagmus (IIN), when no underlying eye or neurological disorders can be detected. Because of the multifaceted pathophysiology of nystagmus, the clinical evaluation should include a close collaboration between the child neurologist, the ophthalmologist, and other related professionals using an interdisciplinary approach.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^114UESQ5]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

APN in multiple sclerosis (MS)

In MS, the frequency of APN typically ranges from 3–5 Hz and the oscillations are regular. Large saccades may transiently stop or "reset" the timing (phase) of the oscillations. Patients with MS who present with APN often have brainstem lesions involving the paramedian tracts, which relay an efference copy signal of eye position to the cerebellar flocculus and, thereby, contribute to gaze-holding. Although vision is often impaired in patients with MS who have APN, impaired visual feedback does not appear to be the cause; it is more likely that APN arises due to instability of the neural integrator, which normally ensures steady gaze-holding.

Several agents have been evaluated in clinical trials of treatment for APN in MS. Anticholinergic drugs, such as trihexyphenidyl, have not proven effective and retrobulbar injection of botulinum toxin, evaluated in several small series of patients, caused side effects such as diplopia that were more troublesome to the patient than the nystagmus itself. Memantine, a noncompetitive N -methyl — aspartate receptor antagonist, was first reported as effective treatment for APN in MS in 1997. Gabapentin, which blocks the alpha-2-delta subunit of calcium channels, was also shown to be effective for this form of nystagmus. These and subsequent double-masked studies have shown that both memantine and gabapentin often suppress APN in MS patients, whereas baclofen does not. Either memantine (10 mg qid) or gabapentin (300 mg qid) may be effective in MS patients with APN (Fig. 4). The mechanism by which memantine and gabapentin suppress APN in MS remains uncertain, but current hypotheses include effects on the neural integrator, including the cell groups of the paramedian tracts, cerebellar flocculus, and medial vestibular and prepositus hypoglossi nuclei.

### Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus [^112AWHX3]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Examination for a gaze-holding deficit: GEN

The distinction between GEN (Fig. 3) and so-called end-point nystagmus is a widespread clinical problem. Many healthy subjects have physiological end-point nystagmus during maximal eccentric gaze. End-point nystagmus is pathological if it lasts for longer than 20 s (sustained end-point nystagmus), is notably asymmetrical, and/or is accompanied by other ocular motor disturbances.

GEN often allows a topographic anatomical diagnosis: (a) GEN in all directions occurs in cerebellar disorders, particularly impaired function of the flocculus/paraflocculus, and above all in neurodegenerative diseases, but can also be caused by drugs such as anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines or alcohol; (b) purely horizontal GEN can indicate a structural lesion in the area of the brainstem [nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, vestibular nuclei, and cerebellum (flocculus/paraflocculus)] — the neural integrator for horizontal gaze-holding function; (c) purely vertical GEN is observed in midbrain lesions involving the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) — the neural integrator for vertical gaze-holding function; (d) dissociated horizontal GEN (greater in the abducting than the adducting eye) in combination with an adduction deficit is the sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to a defect of the medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF), ipsilateral to the adduction deficit; (e) DBN usually increases when looking down, and especially to the side, most likely due to an additional gaze-holding deficit, so that the nystagmus beats diagonally downward in the sideward gaze (the cause of DBN is generally bilaterally impaired function of the flocculus/paraflocculus; (f) patients with GEN also often show a rebound nystagmus. To examine for so-called rebound nystagmus, the patient should gaze for at least 60 s to one side and then return the eyes to the primary position. This can cause a transient nystagmus to appear with slow phases in the direction of the previous eye position. Rebound nystagmus generally indicates damage to the flocculus/paraflocculus or cerebellar pathways.

### Fosphenytoin induced transient pendular nystagmus [^1142nzvU]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Pendular nystagmus was seen after intravenous infusion of fosphenytoin for the treatment of breakthrough seizure. The oscillations were conjugate, quasi-sinusoidal, and regular. The nystagmus was resolved within 12h. Phenytoin is known to cause conduction slowing. Such delays in the feedback between the cerebellum and the oculomotor neural integrator may cause instability of the integrator. An improvement in the conduction delay following post-ictal recovery may resolve the pendular nystagmus.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^111Ws1yc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bedside Examination (Primary Screening Tools)

Alexander's Law

Assessed during spontaneous nystagmus. It helps differentiate peripheral from central vestibular lesions by observing that the nystagmus intensity increases when gazing in the direction of the fast phase and decreases when looking in the opposite direction. This is a simple, non-invasive clinical tool best used in bedside evaluation.

Head Impulse Test (HIT)

Evaluates vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) integrity. A catch-up saccade after rapid passive head rotation indicates peripheral vestibular hypofunction. It is one of the cornerstones of the HINTS protocol in acute vestibular syndrome and highly useful at the bedside.

Fixation Suppression Testing

Observation of whether spontaneous nystagmus reduces with visual fixation. Peripheral nystagmus is typically suppressed by fixation, whereas central nystagmus persists. This can be evaluated using Frenzel goggles or infrared video goggles if available.

Observation of Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus

Easily performed at bedside by asking the patient to hold eccentric gaze. Central nystagmus (gaze-evoked) typically lacks a crescendo-decrescendo pattern and may reverse direction with gaze.

Alternate Cover Test

To check for latent nystagmus in cases of suspected congenital origin.

### Eye movement disorders and neurological symptoms in late-onset inborn errors of metabolism [^1143ayNt]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Energy Metabolism Disorders

Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; either maternally inherited or de novo) or nuclear DNA (Mendelian inherited). Tissues with high energy needs are commonly affected, including brain, heart, and skeletal muscles. There is a wide range of clinical phenotypes, and onset varies widely. Neurological involvement causes movement disorders, psychomotor retardation or regression, epilepsy, muscle weakness, and migraine. 108 Adult onset of mitochondrial disease is especially frequent in disorders caused by multiple deletions in mtDNA, probably attributed to accumulation of mtDNA defects. 108 Ocular involvement is frequent, and both central and peripheral causes of eye movements can be present. A well‐known form of ocular motor dysfunction in mitochondrial disease is PEO, characterized by progressive bilateral ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles. PEO often occurs in association with other symptoms. 109 When it is the sole feature, it is called chronic PEO. PEO is seen in Kearn‐Sayre's syndrome, Pearson's syndrome, and multiple disorders attributed to mitochondrial deletions or point mutations. 110 In mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy, PEO is characterized by slow and hypometric saccades, particularly for saccades larger than 10 degrees, and abducting saccades are slower than adducting saccades. 111 Central eye movement disorders are observed in patients with Leigh's syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy). Patients with early‐onset disease show disorders similar to those attributed to thiamine deficieny, including gaze‐evoked nystagmus, impaired vestibular responses, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and upbeat nystagmus switching to downbeat nystagmus during convergence. 9, 112 A combination of PEO with central eye movement disorders has been described in POLG‐related disorders. The phenotype of POLG‐related disorders is variable; it ranges from severe and often lethal childhood forms to later‐onset forms with a continuum of overlapping phenotypes, including ophthalmoplegia. 113 In addition to ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, gaze‐evoked nystagmus, rebound nystagmus, abnormalties of saccades (dysmetria and slowing), and impaired pursuit have been observed. 114 Treatment of mitochondrial diseases is still limited and includes vitamins and cofactors. 21

### Paraneoplastic seesaw nystagmus and opsoclonus provides evidence for hyperexcitable reciprocally innervating mesencephalic network [^112TC7GB]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Seesaw nystagmus is characterized by the rhythmic combination of vertical and torsional dysconjugate oscillations where one eye moves up and inward while the other moves down and outward. Common association of seesaw nystagmus with accessory optic track lesions lead to traditional hypothesis that it is due to the mismatch in the vision and vestibular systems. Here we propose a novel mechanism for seesaw nystagmus. We hypothesize that reverberations due to abnormal increases in the excitability of the reciprocally innervating circuit of excitatory burst neuron in the midbrain interstitial nucleus of Cajal causes the seesaw nystagmus. Analogous oscillations of the brainstem burst generators may be responsible for generation of saccadic oscillations or opsoclonus. The key difference is that the interstitial nucleus of Cajal lacks inhibitory burst neurons, hence the lack of post-inhibitory rebound, and relatively lower frequency of the oscillatory cycles causing pendular seesaw nystagmus. In contrast the brainstem burst generator, with reciprocally innervating excitatory and inhibitory burst neurons, and further inhibitory influence of the omnipause neurons results in the post-inhibitory rebound at the burst neurons, hence high oscillation frequency. This novel concept is supported by a unique observation in a patient with antineuronal nuclear autoantibody type 2 due to breast cancer who had combined seesaw nystagmus and superimposed saccadic oscillations. The patient neither had cerebellar deficits typically thought to cause paraneoplastic opsoclonus nor visual deficits that are known cause of seesaw nystagmus. We propose that hyperexcitability of the burst neurons in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal due to paraneoplastic antibody caused pendular seesaw nystagmus. On the other hand, increased excitability of brainstem burst generators and reduced efficacy of the omnipause neurons caused saccadic oscillations.

### A novel pathogenic CACNA1A variant causing episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) spectrum phenotype in four family members and a novel combined therapy [^111RMJR6]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

A 47-year-old white Caucasian female presented to our tertiary outpatient center with recurrent attacks of postural imbalance (no vertigo sensu stricto, no nausea or vomiting) with the feeling of falling forward, and an associated holocephalic headache that began around the age of 15 years. The attacks occurred daily, most often in stressful situations and usually lasted for several hours. No other triggers were evident. By the time the patient presented to us, she felt permanently dizzy and posturally unstable in between the attacks, rendering her dependent on regular help in her daily routine. There was no catamnestic report of seizures or syncopes.

Her clinical and neuro-ophthalmological examination revealed a cerebellar ocular motor dysfunction with bilateral horizontal gaze-evoked and rebound-nystagmus, saccadic pursuit in all directions, hypermetric horizontal and vertical saccades, reduced optokinetic nystagmus in all directions, and an most probably centrally impaired horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex bilaterally (video head-impulse test: gain of 0.44 on the right and 0.35 on the left). Bithermal caloric testing showed a central preponderance of left-beating nystagmus without spontaneous nystagmus (warm right – 3.8°/s, warm left + 22.9°/s, cold right 6.4°/s, cold left – 2.0°/s). Finger-to-finger following showed slightly hypermetric movements. Romberg's test revealed an imbalance in tandem stance. Quantitative gait analysis with the GAITRite system objectified a dynamic instability due to incipient impaired cerebellar postural adjustment. Cranial MRI showed several small supratentorial white matter lesions, but no distinct vermian atrophy as is sometimes reported in EA 2.

### Nystagmus and oscillopsia [^117E5bnx]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The ocular motor system consists of several subsystems, including the vestibular ocular nystagmus saccade system, the pursuit system, the fixation and gaze-holding system and the vergence system. All these subsystems aid the stabilization of the images on the retina during eye and head movements and any kind of disturbance of one of the systems can cause instability of the eyes (e.g. nystagmus) or an inadequate eye movement causing a mismatch between head and eye movement (e.g. bilateral vestibular failure). In both situations, the subjects experience a movement of the world (oscillopsia) which is quite disturbing. New insights into the patho-physiology of some of the ocular motor disorders have helped to establish new treatment options, in particular in downbeat nystagmus, upbeat nystagmus, periodic alternating nystagmus, acquired pendular nystagmus and paroxysmal vestibular episodes/attacks. The discussed patho-physiology of these disorders and the current literature on treatment options are discussed and practical treatment recommendations are given in the paper.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^113ekN2C]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

A mechanism intrinsic to the membranes of saccadic burst generators might explain the high frequency and familial dependence of saccadic oscillations. According to this hypothesis, the saccadic oscillations represent unmasking of the inherent instability in the saccadic burst neuron circuit due to an imbalance between burst neuron excitability and external inhibition. It was proposed that increased excitability of the burst neurons or reduced external inhibition would result in increased amplitude of the post-inhibitory rebound (PIR) — a rebound increase in neuronal membrane discharge after sustained membrane hyperpolarization. In a neuromimetic model of the burst neurons, increased maximal conductance through pacemaker ion channels, including hyperpolarization-activated, inward-mixed, cation currents (Ih), and low threshold calcium currents (IT), determined the neural excitability and the amplitude of the PIR. Subsequently, it was hypothesized that increases in neural excitability and/or in PIR due to pathologically increased Ih and/or IT reduce the effects of external inhibition, so that saccadic oscillations can emerge.

The membrane mechanism of saccadic oscillations is supported by a number of case reports on rare etiologies of saccadic oscillations or reports of successful treatment of saccadic oscillations with ion channels blockers. For example, carbamazepine, a calcium channel blocker, may ameliorate saccadic oscillations. Saccadic oscillations in patients abusing cocaine or with strychnine poisoning could be explained by reduction in norepinephrine reuptake, causing increases in norepinephrine-induced Ih conductance. Saccadic oscillations in hyperammonemic, uremic, and hyperosmolar states could be due to alterations in pH, which in turn regulates the maximal Ih conductance. Organophosphate-induced opsoclonus is possibly the result of cholinergic excess causing increased activation of the fastigial nucleus, a component of a feedback loop of the brainstem saccade generator, causing hyperexcitability of the saccadic burst generators. Inherent hyperexcitability in migraineurs might explain saccadic oscillations in these patients.

### The pharmacological treatment of acquired nystagmus [^115Lro1s]. Practical Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

We review the latest literature on the neuropharmacological treatments for acquired nystagmus. Nystagmus may have a significant impact on health, yet there is little scientific evidence on which to make firm recommendations for treatment. Acquired pendular nystagmus may respond to gabapentin or memantine; downbeat and upbeat nystagmus to aminopyridines; and periodic alternating nystagmus to baclofen. To improve treatment we need multi-centre, randomised controlled trials using standardised techniques in reporting objective outcomes, with good follow-up duration and careful reporting of side effects.

### Novel phenotype with prominent cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction in spastic paraplegia type 39 [^117GKakW]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among the more than 80 different genetic causes of HSP, SPG39, which is caused by alterations in the gene PNPLA6, is likely to be one of the rarest forms. While PNPLA6 has been implicated in a variety of disorders, among which the leading manifestations are often extra-neural, spastic paraplegia as the leading or even sole manifestation has been described in only three case reports. PNPLA6 causes different neurodegenerative motor diseases with a wide spectrum of symptoms. Rainier et al. postulated that complex HSP, i.e. clinical features in addition to spasticity, such as distal muscle wasting, is the most common phenotype of PNPLA6 mutations. However, Synofzik et al. showed that besides complex HSP which is "the peak of the iceberg", PNPLA6 can cause a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with four main clinical features: ataxia, chorioretinal dystrophy, spasticity and hypogonadism. So far, cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction has not been associated with PNPLA6 mutations.

The family reported here has a novel clinical phenotype with novel compound heterozygous variants in PNPLA6. Apart from lower limb spasticity with spastic gait, the most salient feature was marked oculomotor dysfunction comprising saccadic pursuit movements, rebound nystagmus and impaired suppression of the VOR by fixation.

The most prominent finding was a peculiar gaze evoked nystagmus. While the fast phase of the nystagmus was beating into the direction of horizontal and upward gaze, this was reverted on downward gaze. Here, the direction of the fast phase of the nystagmus was upwards (to the forehead). While these findings may be classified as cerebellar dysfunction, other cerebellar features, such as gait ataxia, ataxia of upper limbs or dysarthric speech were conspicuously absent. As the sole non-neurologic feature, patient S1 and S2 had low concentrations of blood gonadotropic hormones, indicating mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Taken together, the organ systems affected to the extent of becoming clinically apparent were the cortical motor neurons, cerebellar neurons or connections and, to a much lesser extent, the reproductive endocrine system. Hufnagel et al. found individual tissues to express different levels of NTE activity. Thus, in our patients, NTE activity was likely most prominently reduced in cortical motor and cerebellar neurons.

As mentioned before, Hotson and Baloh identified horizontal nystagmus with fast phase direction change as a specific central sign. This finding, coupled with a normal h-HIT, is compelling enough to repeat imaging when a clinical diagnosis of stroke is conflicted by an initially, false negative MRI study. Peripheral lesions do not cause this nystagmus pattern. To explain the gaze induced direction change, vi impairment of gaze-holding pathways (neural integrator) in the cerebellum, the brainstem or their connecting fibres in the cerebellar peduncles must be compromised. Clinicians may rely with confidence on horizontal, direction changing nystagmus as a central localisation sign.

Rebound horizontal nystagmus vii was not common in the ischaemic lesions series summarised in table 1, it may be seen with cerebellar or extra-axial brainstem lesions and is always a central sign. Clinicians should also be aware of the fact that demyelination, infectious and nutritional/toxic aetiologies may be responsible for a central AVS. Imaging, clinical examination and laboratory testing will identify most of these possibilities. Head shaking for a few seconds usually increases the amplitude of the primary nystagmus; however, variations such as posthead shaking horizontal nystagmus direction change or its conversion to vertical nystagmus (perverted nystagmus) are central signs. This nystagmus elicitation technique was the only central localisation in one patient from a previous AVS, AICA stroke series. Positional testing (Dix Hallpike or lateral head roll in the supine position) does not change the h-primary gaze nystagmus direction. Furthermore, any direction change will also point to central localisation. Finally, primary gaze vertical or purely torsional nystagmus point to central localisationand was relatively uncommon in most AVS series summarised in table 1.

### Characteristics and possible mechanisms of direction-reversing nystagmus during positional testing in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^117G74QB]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

The central adaptation mechanism of VOR may be mediated through a velocity storage mechanism to produce second-phase nystagmus in patients with BPPV reversal nystagmus. In this study, most patients with reversal nystagmus had intense first-phase nystagmus with short duration (< 60 s) and less intense second-phase nystagmus with long duration (> 60 s). The Tc values of the first-phase nystagmus were 5.70 ± 1.79 and 4.66 ± 1.53 seconds, respectively, in HC-BPPV and PC-BPPV patients with reversal nystagmus, whereas the mean Tc values of the second-phase nystagmus were 27.7 and 24.06 seconds, respectively, in these patients. From the aforementioned results, we can find that the Tc of the second-phase nystagmus in this study is significantly longer than that of the second phase. Previous studies have shown that the Tc of the semicircular canal is estimated to be 4 to 7 seconds. There is a central brainstem mechanism, known as the velocity storage mechanism, which can prolong the process of rapid canal-cupula adaptation, causing the signals driving VOR to outlast the peripheral signal generated by head rotation alone. The velocity storage mechanism can prolong the Tc of VOR to 15 to 20 seconds. The Tc of the second-phase nystagmus in BPPV patients with reversal nystagmus found in the present study is similar to the aforementioned previous studies. The prolongation of the cupula time constant caused by the velocity storage mechanism may be mediated by the central vestibular feedback pathway, which is also known as the central adaptation mechanism. This central adaptation mechanism may play a pivotal role in the production of direction-reversing nystagmus. In addition, the short-term central adaptation of the VOR is also thought to underlie the second phase of biphasic headshaking nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus, or rebound caloric nystagmus, and the generation of the second-phase nystagmus both due to the development of central adaptation caused by the intense nystagmus produced during the first phase.

Spontaneous Peripheral Vestibular Nystagmus

Spontaneous jerk nystagmus due to an imbalance in vestibular tone between the labyrinths or vestibular nerves, which usually follows a horizontal-torsional pattern. Arises from the peripheral vestibular apparatus, particularly the labyrinth (semicircular canals, utricle) or vestibular nerve. Input is transmitted to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, which then project via the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to ocular motor nuclei (III, IV, VI). Damage to one labyrinth (eg, vestibular neuritis) causes tonic imbalance between the left and right vestibular inputs. The intact side exerts a stronger influence, interpreted by the brain as continuous head movement. This activates the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), producing a slow phase toward the lesioned side and a fast phase (corrective saccade) toward the intact side — resulting in jerk nystagmus.

Features

Direction-fixed (usually horizontal-torsional)
Follows Alexander's Law: increases in amplitude when gazing in direction of fast phase
Inhibited by fixation (best seen in darkness or with Frenzel goggles)
Often accompanied by vertigo, nausea, imbalance
Fast phase is away from the lesion

Spontaneous Central Vestibular Nystagmus

Central forms of vestibular nystagmus arise from the dysfunction of the interconnections between the central vestibular structures and neural integrators. It can be horizontal or vertical. Originates in the brainstem or cerebellum, especially in areas like the vestibular nuclei, nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, flocculus, nodulus, and medullary reticular formation. Central vestibular nystagmus occurs due to lesions that impair the neural integrators for gaze-holding or disrupt the central vestibulo-ocular pathways. These include: brainstem strokes or demyelination, cerebellar infarcts or degeneration, tumors or neurodegenerative diseases. The direction be horizontal, vertical, or purely torsional. Direction-changing with gaze (unlike peripheral). Not suppressed by fixation. May not follow Alexander's Law. Often associated with other neurological signs (eg, diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria) Fast phase may be toward or away from lesion, depending on location.

Results

Family 1

An 8-year-old boy (II.3, Fig. 1A) was referred to the eye clinic with apparently isolated nystagmus since age 4 years. History and clinical examination revealed that he had mild developmental delay and had started walking after age 2 years. His visual acuity was within normal range (logMAR < 0.18 either eye). He had vertical upbeat nystagmus in primary position, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus in side gazes and horizontal rebound nystagmus. Eye movement recordings showed that horizontal and upward smooth pursuits were absent, but downward smooth pursuits were present with reduced gain. His electroretinogram (ERG), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. Subsequent neurological examination identified bilateral intention tremor, mild dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, and difficulties with heel-to-toe walking. He also had behavioural issues, including mood disorder and aggressiveness (Table 1, Supplemental Material).

Physiological Nystagmus

Physiologic End-Point Nystagmus

Nystagmus in the absence of any pathology due to normal variation in gaze-holding ability. Arises from the normal functioning of the neural integrator (gaze-holding mechanism), primarily involving the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nucleus (for horizontal gaze) and interstitial nucleus of Cajal (for vertical gaze). In healthy individuals, when the eyes are held at extreme eccentric gaze (usually beyond 30°), the integrator system cannot sustain tonic activity indefinitely, causing a drift back toward midline followed by corrective saccades. This results in a low-amplitude, horizontal jerk nystagmus with the fast phase directed toward the gaze. This is a benign phenomenon and differs from gaze-evoked nystagmus due to cerebellar or brainstem pathology by being symmetrical, non-progressive, and usually non-sustained.

Per-Rotational Nystagmus

Horizontal jerk nystagmus due to sustained head rotations with fast phases ipsilateral to the rotation. Mediated by the horizontal semicircular canals, vestibular nerve, vestibular nuclei, and the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) projecting to ocular motor nuclei. During sustained head rotation, endolymph flow in the semicircular canals causes deflection of the cupula, stimulating the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). This triggers slow eye movement opposite to head movement, followed by fast saccades in the direction of rotation to reset gaze. This nystagmus is horizontal, jerk, with fast phase in the direction of rotation. It is transient and stops when the head motion ceases.

Post-Rotational Nystagmus

Horizontal nystagmus occurs when the body is rotated and after the rotation is stopped, with a contralateral fast phase and subjective rocking boat sensation. Same central pathways as per-rotational, involving vestibular labyrinth → vestibular nuclei → ocular motor nuclei via MLF. After rotation stops, the endolymph continues to move briefly due to inertia, producing the illusion of continued rotation. This causes eye movements with a fast phase opposite the direction of the prior spin. Often associated with vertigo and a subjective sense of motion (rocking or spinning). It is a testable component of vestibular function and adapts quickly.
