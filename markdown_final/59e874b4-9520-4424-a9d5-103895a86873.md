## Question

How should diabetes be managed in women of reproductive age?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage diabetes in women of reproductive age. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principles and the continuum from preconception through postpartum. Then, I should verify universal preconception counseling and pregnancy intention screening. Next, I will review medication safety and what to stop before or during pregnancy. After that, I need to clarify insulin initiation, glycemic targets, and monitoring strategies alongside lifestyle therapy. Then, I should address contraception until readiness for pregnancy. Next, I must screen for and manage diabetes complications preconception. I will then outline pregnancy management, surveillance, and delivery timing. Finally, I will define postpartum glucose testing, lactation considerations, and transition back to interpregnancy care with a multidisciplinary plan.

> Let me first confirm the core philosophy and continuum of care. Person-centered, shared decision-making anchored in preconception planning, pregnancy management, and postpartum transition is repeatedly emphasized, and I need to ensure I keep that continuity front and center because postpartum care doubles as preconception care for the next pregnancy, especially given the high rate of unplanned pregnancies in this population [^116aRA4z] [^111iBQeU] [^114GAfNq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; modern challenges like obesity are eroding prior gains, so lifestyle and weight management must be interwoven across the continuum, not treated as an afterthought [^116dnmkT].

> Next, I should review pregnancy intention screening and universal preconception counseling. The joint Endocrine Society/ESE 2025 guideline advises asking about pregnancy intentions at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit, with three linked actions: brief PCC counseling, contraception evaluation, and referral for PCC to achieve therapy goals; the ADA echoes embedding family planning into routine diabetes care, so I need to highlight this as a default workflow rather than an optional step [^115v3xHK] [^114XbfEw] [^113Ho7rR] [^111kiKz6]. I should double-check screening for undiagnosed diabetes in those planning pregnancy or of childbearing potential, since detecting hyperglycemia preconception reduces malformation risk [^111a8VY4] [^111vAcL2] [^1142vmc8].

> Let me consider glycemic optimization before conception. I need to ensure the target is stated clearly: HbA1c less than 6.5% if achievable without significant hypoglycemia, because lowering A1c into this range decreases congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia, and preterm birth; if this goal is not safely attainable, individualized targets still aim for as close to normal as feasible preconception [^111Mi6LJ] [^114tsWWj]. Wait, I should verify that this is framed within shared decision-making and appropriate education, which the ADA underscores as part of PCC [^117DFW68].

> I will now examine medication safety and what to stop or switch. Noninsulin glucose-lowering agents are not recommended during pregnancy due to placental transfer and limited long-term safety; I should confirm that insulin is preferred and that metformin and glyburide are not first-line for GDM, while also noting that if metformin was used for PCOS/ovulation induction, ADA recommends discontinuation by the end of the first trimester; more generally, use metformin in pregnancy only if benefits outweigh risks and when insulin is not feasible, aligning with obstetric guidance [^114mxSaU] [^11772GFs] [^114wyRZE] [^116PM5dB]. I need to ensure teratogenic and pregnancy-contraindicated agents are addressed: avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs unless reliable contraception is used, and avoid statins in those not using reliable contraception [^1128SztH] [^114dZwUC]. Hold on, I should verify less common agents: pioglitazone has limited human data and should generally be avoided unless a compelling risk–benefit exists, and crucially, all this should happen before organogenesis because by pregnancy recognition, fetal organ development is largely complete [^114mxSaU] [^116PGjVc].

> Now, let me clarify preferred glucose-lowering therapy and escalation during pregnancy. Insulin is the preferred treatment for hyperglycemia in pregnancy, including GDM, with lifestyle therapy initiated first in GDM and insulin added promptly if targets are not met, typically within about a week of diet and exercise optimization; I need to stress that delaying insulin increases fetal exposure to hyperglycemia [^115ZLxth] [^116akqEs] [^113f2pj4] [^1114MJ7K] [^1164eh85]. Initially, I was going to say glyburide should never be used in pregnancy; wait, let me verify and be precise — ADA advises against metformin or glyburide as first-line due to placental transfer and potential insufficiency, but the Endocrine Society allows glyburide as a backup in selected GDM cases diagnosed after 25 weeks with fasting plasma glucose 110 mg/dL or lower when insulin is declined or not feasible, so I should preserve that narrow exception while clearly stating ADA's preference for insulin [^114mxSaU] [^1177Wu7S].

> I need to ensure glucose monitoring guidance is practical and technology-enabled. Continuous glucose monitoring or structured self-monitoring of blood glucose are appropriate during pregnancy, and I should confirm that either can be used depending on availability, patient preference, and clinical scenario, while reinforcing frequent review and rapid titration of insulin based on data [^114eo5Bt] [^11463pSi]. Hold on, I should verify this integrates with education and nutrition support to interpret and act on glucose patterns in a timely fashion [^116AhBEH].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and nutritional measures from preconception through postpartum. High-dose folic acid at 5 mg daily starting 3 months before stopping contraception or attempting conception reduces neural tube defects in diabetes, and I need to ensure prenatal vitamin folate is incorporated for general support; individualized medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian and daily moderate exercise of at least 30 minutes are foundational, while addressing obesity and mandatory smoking cessation to mitigate the erosion in outcomes we are seeing [^116owkaq] [^114tsWWj] [^116AhBEH] [^113f2pj4] [^116dnmkT] [^116PGjVc].

> I should confirm contraception planning while optimizing for pregnancy. Discuss and implement a contraceptive plan for all patients of childbearing potential until glycemic targets, safe medication regimens, and comorbidities are optimized; long-acting reversible contraception is highly effective and reversible, combined hormonal contraception is acceptable in diabetes, and progestin-only pills may raise later T2DM risk in those with prior GDM, so use with caution in that subgroup; equally important, avoid pressure, uphold autonomy, and align choices with patient preferences and agency [^11218C24] [^111kiKz6] [^116dn4Qf] [^116TKvVF] [^114sQVnU] [^115UkVMD] [^115GE4qb]. Wait, I need to check for drug–contraception interactions and counsel accordingly, as ADA notes certain glucose-lowering drugs can affect contraception efficacy; contraception can be discontinued when HbA1c is below 6.5%, medications are pregnancy-safe, and comorbidities are optimized, as part of a shared plan [^111NJALE] [^111kiKz6].

> Next, I should review preconception screening for complications and comorbidities. I need to ensure retinal status is documented before pregnancy, then in the first trimester, each trimester, and about one year postpartum, given progression risk; likewise, assess nephropathy, screen for and manage thyroid disease in T1D, and evaluate cardiovascular disease where indicated; finally, aim for blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg preconception using pregnancy-compatible drugs [^11587eKn] [^116iUsz7] [^112cg7AX] [^113Vu4vH] [^116u9T7s]. Hold on, I should verify ACEi/ARB transition plans are made early because they must be stopped before conception due to teratogenicity [^1128SztH].

> I will now examine pregnancy management logistics. Multidisciplinary care with endocrinology, maternal–fetal medicine, a registered dietitian nutritionist, and diabetes education enhances safety and coordinated titration; GDM screening with a 75-gram OGTT at 24–28 weeks using IADPSG criteria remains standard, with earlier testing if high risk; and fetal surveillance should be earlier or more frequent when obesity, suboptimal glycemia, LGA, prior stillbirth, hypertension, or SGA are present; integrating telehealth with in-person visits can improve outcomes in GDM [^116AhBEH] [^114xcikp] [^1121d3bg] [^116yKotR] [^112et7th] [^115GohbT]. Wait a minute, I should also consider cost and implementation — pregnancy intention screening and PCC are likely cost-effective, supporting investment in these workflows [^1164VdDC].

> Delivery timing needs careful balance, so let me reconsider the thresholds. The SOGC recommends offering induction between 38 and 40 weeks based on glycemic control and comorbidities, and ES/ESE advises that risks may outweigh benefits beyond 38 weeks even with ideal control, so I should individualize timing using glycemia, fetal growth, amniotic fluid, and complication history rather than defaulting to expectant management [^116Fpaxy] [^1132LSW6]. Hold on, I should verify that plans include intrapartum insulin protocols and neonatal hypoglycemia prevention, aligned with the team's protocols, though those specifics extend beyond the current reference set [^116AhBEH].

> Postpartum metabolic assessment is the next checkpoint. I should confirm immediate fasting glucose or fasting SMBG within 24–72 hours after delivery to detect persistent hyperglycemia, then arrange a 75-gram OGTT at 4–12 weeks postpartum using nonpregnancy criteria; if normal, repeat screening periodically and before future pregnancies to prevent missed progression to diabetes [^112oL849] [^112Hvpit] [^117K7UvP] [^114h65Ho]. But wait, what if the patient had overt diabetes antepartum? Medication de-escalation and continuation decisions should be individualized immediately postpartum given rapid insulin requirement changes and lactation plans [^111c9FJn].

> I need to check lactation support and medication compatibility. ADA and ES recommend encouraging breastfeeding for all patients with diabetes and especially after GDM to reduce later T2DM risk; metformin or glyburide can be continued during breastfeeding if necessary, though insulin is commonly used, and vigilance for maternal hypoglycemia is essential as insulin needs fall sharply after placental delivery and then drift upward over weeks; CGM and hybrid closed-loop systems may help mitigate both hypo- and hyperglycemia during this dynamic period [^113SHFqY] [^111VYLYm] [^113dEqck] [^114pxF3j] [^114YdnZB]. I should double-check that lactation counseling includes glucose targets, nighttime snack strategies, and safe correction dosing to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia [^114YdnZB].

> Finally, I should ensure the transition back to interpregnancy care is explicit. Postpartum diabetes care is itself preconception care; arrange multidisciplinary follow-up for glycemia, complication surveillance, contraception, and lifestyle optimization, recognizing disparities in lactation support and the risk of lapses in diabetes care that can raise future congenital malformation and miscarriage risks in unplanned pregnancies [^111iBQeU] [^114YdnZB]. Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making continues in the interpregnancy interval with refreshed pregnancy intention screening and updated targets as health status evolves [^115v3xHK] [^114GAfNq].

Effective diabetes management in women of childbearing age focuses on **preconception glycemic optimization** and **individualized contraception** to prevent unplanned pregnancies and reduce the risk of congenital anomalies [^111Mi6LJ] [^111kiKz6]. Insulin is the **preferred therapy during pregnancy**; metformin may be continued if already in use, but other oral agents should be avoided [^116PM5dB] [^114mxSaU]. Postpartum, **screen for diabetes at 4–12 weeks** with a 75-g OGTT, encourage breastfeeding, and provide ongoing contraception and lifestyle support to prevent type 2 diabetes [^112Hvpit] [^111VYLYm].

---

## Preconception care and counseling

Preconception care is **essential** for women with diabetes because it significantly reduces the risk of congenital anomalies, miscarriage, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Key components include:

- **Glycemic control**: Achieve HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) before conception to minimize congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia, and preterm birth [^111Mi6LJ].

- **Medication review**: Discontinue teratogenic medications (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, statins) and switch to pregnancy-safe alternatives [^112cg7AX].

- **Folic acid supplementation**: Initiate 5 mg/day at least three months before conception to reduce neural tube defects [^116owkaq].

- **Screening for complications**: Evaluate and manage diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, hypertension, and thyroid dysfunction before pregnancy [^11587eKn] [^112cg7AX].

- **Contraception**: Provide effective contraception until optimal glycemic control is achieved [^111kiKz6].

---

## Glycemic targets during pregnancy

Maintaining strict glycemic control during pregnancy is **critical** to reduce the risk of maternal and fetal complications. Recommended targets include:

| **Glycemic parameter** | **Recommended target** |
|-|-|
| HbA1c | < 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) if safely achievable |
| Fasting glucose | 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L) |
| 1-hour postprandial | < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour postprandial | < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) |

---

## Pharmacological management

Insulin is the **preferred pharmacological treatment during pregnancy** because of its safety and efficacy. Metformin may be continued if already in use, but other oral agents (e.g. glyburide) are not recommended as first-line therapy due to placental transfer and insufficient glycemic control [^114mxSaU].

---

## Monitoring and screening

Regular monitoring and screening are **essential** for detecting and managing complications:

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: Frequent SMBG or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended to maintain glycemic targets [^114eo5Bt].

- **Retinopathy screening**: Dilated eye examinations before pregnancy, during the first trimester, and each trimester thereafter [^11587eKn].

- **Nephropathy screening**: Regular assessment of renal function and proteinuria.

- **Thyroid function**: Screen for thyroid dysfunction, particularly in women with type 1 diabetes.

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are **fundamental** to diabetes management, and individualized medical nutrition therapy should emphasize balanced carbohydrate intake and weight management. Regular, moderate physical activity (≥ 30 minutes daily) improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [^113f2pj4]. Weight management focuses on achieving and maintaining a healthy BMI before conception and during pregnancy.

---

## Postpartum care

Postpartum care is **critical** to prevent recurrent gestational diabetes and progression to type 2 diabetes:

- **Glucose screening**: Perform a 75-g OGTT at 4–12 weeks postpartum to detect persistent diabetes or prediabetes [^112Hvpit].

- **Breastfeeding**: Encourage breastfeeding to reduce maternal risk of type 2 diabetes and provide neonatal benefits [^111VYLYm].

- **Contraception**: Discuss and implement effective contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancies [^11218C24].

- **Lifestyle support**: Provide ongoing support for weight management, nutrition, and physical activity.

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **multidisciplinary approach** involving endocrinologists, obstetricians, dietitians, diabetes educators, and primary care providers is essential for optimal outcomes [^116AhBEH].

---

Effective **diabetes management** in women of childbearing age requires comprehensive preconception care, strict glycemic control, appropriate pharmacological management, regular monitoring, lifestyle interventions, and coordinated multidisciplinary care.

### Optimizing diabetes-in-pregnancy outcomes requires a care continuum [^116dnmkT]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to assess the strengths, limitations, opportunities, and threats presented by diabetes-in-pregnancy. We review the improvements in maternal and fetal mortality since the advent of insulin therapy, evaluate health challenges, and identify opportunities for preventing increased mortality due to diabetes-in-pregnancy.

Prior to 1922, women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) of childbearing age were discouraged from becoming pregnant, as the maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality rates were extremely high. Starvation-level dietary restriction was the only "treatment", with limited success in managing the disease. The discovery of insulin, coupled with careful clinical management, presented the possibility of successful pregnancies for women with T1DM. Over the course of the next half-century, maternal survival increased from 54% to 97%.

However, the gains made in reducing adverse outcomes of diabetes in pregnancy are eroding due to modern challenges. The global obesity epidemic has led to an increase in type 2 and gestational diabetes mellitus (DM). T1DM also is on the rise. Together, the rise in the prevalence of pregestational diabetes has increased the risks for adverse outcomes.

We review the ongoing challenges as well as opportunities for research to improve outcomes. We suggest that overweight, obesity, and diabetes management must be coupled with preconception counseling and education. This should include, in addition to Ob/Gyns, input from primary care, nutrition, weight management, and other experts to ensure that those at risk of pregnancy complications do not face preventable adverse outcomes.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^115v3xHK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 1

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate [2 | ⊕OOO].

- **Technical remarks**: There are no data supporting a specific timing or frequency of screening. A critical component of preconception care (PCC) is the optimization of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations. The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) suggests that for screening for pregnancy intent to be effective, three actions are required: provision of basic counseling about the benefits of PCC, evaluation of contraception needs and/or family planning referral, and referral for PCC to achieve goals of therapy. This recommendation applies to individuals with all types of preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM), including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

- **Summary of evidence**: The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence, and Evidence to Decision (EtD) tables can be found online.

- **Benefits and harms**: The systematic review did not identify any randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of a screening question about pregnancy intention in individuals with diabetes on the following outcomes: contraception prescription, referral for PCC, unplanned pregnancy, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit, and congenital malformations.

The GDP found indirect evidence for the effectiveness of these measures.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111AhzqV]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly regarding pregnant patients and preconception care, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining preconception screening for diabetes. This aims to provide preconception care that identifies and treats hyperglycemia and prevents congenital malformations in patients with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus.

---

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111a8VY4]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the 2025 ADA guidelines recommend screening for undiagnosed diabetes in individuals with risk factors who are planning pregnancy. It is also advised to consider testing all individuals of childbearing potential for undiagnosed prediabetes or diabetes.

---

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^11772GFs]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning the management of gestational diabetes in pregnant patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend against using metformin and glyburide, either individually or in combination, as first-line agents. This is because both medications cross the placenta to the fetus and may be insufficient for achieving glycemic goals. Other oral and non-insulin injectable glucose-lowering medications are also not recommended due to the lack of long-term safety data.

---

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112Hvpit]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, and more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (postpartum care), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend screening patients with gestational diabetes mellitus for prediabetes or diabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum. This screening should use the 75-g OGTT and clinically appropriate nonpregnancy diagnostic criteria.

---

### Actos [^113XYy4t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**: Limited data with Actos in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

- **Animal reproduction studies**: No adverse developmental effects were observed when pioglitazone was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures up to 5- and 35-times the 45 mg clinical dose, respectively, based on body surface area [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with an HbA1c > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.

- **Data**: Pioglitazone administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at a dose of 20 mg/kg (~5-times the 45 mg clinical dose).

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1178efqL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, important new research has emerged in the field of diabetes and pregnancy. This guideline has been developed to address and distill this burgeoning literature with the goal of assisting healthcare providers in managing their pregnant patients living with overt or gestational diabetes using contemporary, evidence-based strategies.

In this guideline, all references to diabetes specifically and exclusively refer to diabetes mellitus. Unless stated otherwise, the terms diabetes, overt diabetes, and pregestational diabetes refer to either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

We use the traditional term gestational diabetes to describe what has customarily been defined as "any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first definition during pregnancy", while acknowledging that the more contemporary term hyperglycemia in pregnancy has strong merit as a more appropriate term. We have retained the longstanding term "gestational diabetes" due to its widespread familiarity and traditional usage.

Select thyroid recommendations in this Diabetes and Pregnancy Guideline are included as they relate specifically to thyroid disease in pregnant women with diabetes. See the 2012 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on pregnancy and thyroid disease for a detailed discussion on this topic.

This guideline advocates for the use of best practices based on an analysis of the contemporary (and older) medical literature. It is, however, recognized that cost considerations and other practical realities may not necessarily allow for implementation.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116PM5dB]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. The ACOG guidelines suggest metformin as a second-line choice for patients declining insulin or unable to safely administer it. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend discontinuing metformin when used to treat PCOS and induce ovulation by the end of the first trimester. The drug metformin PO (also known as Riomet) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111kiKz6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, and more specifically with respect to general counseling, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend discussing family planning and prescribing effective contraception. Consideration of long-acting, reversible contraception should be given, and these methods should be used until a patient's treatment plan and HbA1c are optimized for pregnancy.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116TKvVF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: Combined oral contraceptive use by women with type 1 diabetes does not affect their glycemic control or increase their risk of end-organ injury. Combined oral contraceptive use by women with a history of gestational diabetes does not increase the risk of later developing type 2 diabetes. Use of a contraceptive patch or vaginal ring exerts a similar metabolic effect to that of oral contraceptives. Compared with women without diabetes, women with diabetes using an intrauterine device (either copper or levonorgestrel-releasing) are not at increased risk of untoward effects. Progestin-only oral contraceptives do not affect blood glucose values or blood pressure in women with type 1 diabetes; however, there is some limited evidence that these medications increase the risk for later developing type 2 diabetes in women who have had gestational diabetes.

- **Screening for postpartum thyroiditis**: We suggest women with type 1 diabetes be screened for postpartum thyroiditis with a TSH test at 3 and 6 months postpartum.

- **Evidence**: Postpartum thyroiditis is common in women who have type 1 diabetes.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114xcikp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Testing for gestational diabetes should be conducted between 24 to 28 weeks gestation. We recommend that pregnant women not previously identified with overt diabetes or gestational diabetes through earlier testing, as per recommendation 2.1 or at some other point before 24 weeks gestation, be tested for gestational diabetes. This is done by having a 2-hour, 75-g OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) performed at 24 to 28 weeks gestation. Gestational diabetes should be diagnosed using the IADPSG criteria based on the majority opinion of this committee.

The 75-g OGTT should be conducted after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours but not more than 14 hours. The patient should not have reduced their usual carbohydrate intake in the several days leading up to the test. During the test, the patient should remain seated and refrain from smoking. One or more abnormal values establish the diagnosis, except in the case of overt diabetes. For overt diabetes, a secondary test — either a fasting plasma glucose, untimed random plasma glucose, HbA1c, or another OGTT — must be performed on a different day, without symptoms of hyperglycemia, to confirm the diagnosis.

For pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically concerning the management of nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend providing reproductive counseling to patients of childbearing age. This is due to the potential teratogenic effects of ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is advised to avoid using these drugs in patients who are not using reliable contraception.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1121d3bg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

We recommend testing pregnant women, not previously identified with overt diabetes or gestational diabetes, for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. This should be done by performing a 2-hour, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Gestational diabetes should be diagnosed using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria.

The 75-g OGTT is conducted after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours (but not more than 14 hours) without reducing usual carbohydrate intake in the days prior. During the test, the patient should be seated and refrain from smoking. The diagnosis is confirmed if one or more abnormal values are observed. However, for overt diabetes, confirmation requires a second test (fasting plasma glucose, untimed random plasma glucose, HbA1C, or another OGTT) without hyperglycemia symptoms to be abnormal on another day.

- **Management of elevated blood glucose**: We recommend that women with gestational diabetes aim to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115VDEaY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Our objective was to formulate a clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnant women with diabetes. The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

- **Consensus process**: One group meeting, several conference calls, and numerous e-mail communications enabled consensus for all recommendations except one, with a majority decision being employed for this single exception.

Using an evidence-based approach, this Diabetes and Pregnancy Clinical Practice Guideline addresses important clinical issues in the contemporary management of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes preconceptionally, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum setting, as well as in the diagnosis and management of women with gestational diabetes during and after pregnancy.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^113Ho7rR]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In this guideline, the Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology provide recommendations on managing diabetes in individuals who may become pregnant.

- **Recommendation 1**: In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent should also be addressed at urgent care or emergency room visits when clinically appropriate.

	**Technical remarks**: There are no data supporting a specific timing or frequency of screening. A critical component of preconception care (PCC) is optimization of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations. To be effective, screening for pregnancy intent requires three actions:
	- Provision of basic counseling about the benefits of PCC
	- Evaluation of contraception needs and/or family planning referral
	- Referral for PCC to achieve goals of therapy.
	- This recommendation applies to individuals with all types of preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM), including type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Recommendation 2**: In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest the use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired.

This guideline outlines the importance of structured screening and the provision of contraception as preventative measures for managing diabetes in reproductive-aged individuals.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: Diabetes in adolescence [^115oCmPN]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Low credibility.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes in adolescents and young women with diabetes:

Suboptimal glycemic control around conception increases the risks of congenital malformations, spontaneous abortion, and fetal death. A planned pregnancy in a person with diabetes who has optimal glycemic control and good health carries only slightly higher risks than those in the general population, but not as elevated as previously reported in those with suboptimal glycemic control. However, most pregnancies in young women with diabetes are unplanned and associated with suboptimal glycemic control. A fifth of live-born infants of unplanned pregnancies in adolescents with Type 2 diabetes had major congenital malformations, despite recommendations for early counseling on contraception and pre-pregnancy counseling. Recent studies show worse outcomes in pregnancies in adolescents with diabetes and higher healthcare utilization during pregnancy, including a higher risk of preeclampsia and larger babies than adult women with pregestational diabetes. However, a nationwide Welsh study showed similar outcomes for pregnancies in both teenage and older mothers with T1D, although hospital admissions during the first year of life were five times more common in the babies of younger mothers.

Access to expert pregnancy management should include pre-pregnancy care to plan a healthy pregnancy; joint management by an obstetrician and physician with expertise in diabetes and pregnancy; and delivery in a hospital with expert maternal, fetal, perinatal, and neonatal care.

### Exclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials of type 2 diabetes medications: A review of protocol-based barriers to enrollment [^1146hkdE]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Women of childbearing potential are often excluded from participating in clinical trials due to concerns about adverse fetal effects of treatment. This study aims to determine the prevalence of fertility-related exclusion criteria in clinical trials of type 2 diabetes medications and whether these criteria are commensurate with drug risk.

- **Research design and methods**: ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for trials of type 2 diabetes medications that were phase 2 or 3, based in the US, and enrolled participants aged 18–40. Six hundred eighty-eight trials met the criteria. Information collected about each trial included enrollment, trial length, exclusion and inclusion criteria, trial sponsor, and pregnancy category of the drug(s) administered.

- **Results**: Most studies (59%) included one or more fertility-related exclusion criteria, most often excluding pregnancy (55%) and breast-feeding (44%). Trials of medications with increased fetal risk were not more restrictive: trials of category C drugs (evidence of fetal risks in animals) were less likely to exclude pregnancy compared with trials of category B drugs (no known human or animal fetal risks) (45.6% vs. 69.8%, odds ratio [OR] 0.37 [95% CI 0.20, 0.65], P = 0.0005) or to require contraceptive use (29.9% vs. 57.1%, OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.18, 0.56], P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: In clinical trials of type 2 diabetes medications, exclusion criteria affecting women of childbearing potential are often disproportionate to risk to the participant and fetus. These criteria have the potential to impede young women from participating in clinical research.

### Experiences of women with type 2 diabetes during the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods: A systematic review of qualitative studies [^116WA88n]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

For women living with type 2 diabetes, there exists a tension between the advice received from healthcare professionals regarding family planning — such as using contraception to avoid or delay pregnancy until their diabetes is optimized — and pursuing their desired reproductive goals. Some women reported prioritizing their wish to have a baby over managing their diabetes, indicating that their reproductive desires often took precedence over the potential health risks associated with pregnancy and type 2 diabetes. This prioritization frequently conflicted with the medical guidance they received, reflecting a complex interplay between personal reproductive goals and the clinical management of their diabetes.

Women often lacked knowledge about the relationship between type 2 diabetes and pregnancy, leading to difficulty understanding the importance of the advice given. These perspectives and priorities influenced some women's decisions regarding contraception and diabetes medication, while also intensifying anxiety related to fertility.

### Management of pregnant and postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease using multi-disciplinary team models of care: A systematic review [^1163GCqA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

More women with an increased risk of poor pregnancy outcome due to pre-existing medical conditions are becoming pregnant. Although clinical care provided through multi-disciplinary team (MDT) working is recommended, little is known about the structure or working practices of different MDT models, their impact on maternal and infant outcomes, or healthcare resources. The objectives of this review were to consider relevant international evidence to determine the most appropriate MDT models of care to manage complex medical conditions during and after pregnancy, with a specific focus on pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease in high-income country settings.

- **Methods**: Quantitative and qualitative evidence of MDT models of care for the management of pregnant/postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes and cardiac disease was considered. A search of the literature published between January 2002 and January 2014 was undertaken. Methodological quality was assessed using checklists developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Given limited primary and secondary research evidence, guidelines and opinion papers were included. Two independent reviewers conducted critical appraisal of included papers.

- **Results**: Nineteen papers were included from the UK, Canada, USA, the Netherlands, and Singapore. No studies were found which had compared MDT models for pregnant/postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease. Two small retrospective studies reported better outcomes for women with cardiac disease if an MDT approach was used, although evidence to support this was limited.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to postpartum care (general principles), the ES/ESE 2025 guidelines recommend considering postpartum endocrine care, including diabetes management, for patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus, including those with pregnancy loss or termination, in addition to usual obstetric care:

- **Prioritize immediate postpartum care**: For patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus to manage glycemic levels, support healing, promote lactation, and facilitate the transition to interpregnancy and long-term diabetes management, in addition to routine obstetric care.

- **Deliver postpartum diabetes care**: Through a multidisciplinary team that includes physicians specializing in diabetes and/or endocrinology, as well as nurses, dietitians, and certified diabetes care and education specialists; ensure this team supports ongoing, long-term established follow-up.

- **Recognize postpartum care as preconception care**: Approximately half of all deliveries occur among patients who already have at least one child, highlighting the opportunity for postpartum care to contribute meaningfully to preconception care.

### Preconception counselling resource for women with diabetes [^114m4FCq]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Women with diabetes need to plan for pregnancy if they are to reduce their risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. While care providers have focused on setting up specialist pre-pregnancy planning clinics to help women prepare for pregnancy, the majority of women do not attend, entering pregnancy unprepared. A major barrier to accessing this care, and a consequence of poor preconception counselling, is a lack of knowledge as to the need to plan and the reasons why. This project addressed an urgent need to raise awareness of the importance of planning for pregnancy among women with diabetes and among the healthcare professionals (HCPs) caring for them. Focus groups with the target groups informed the development of a preconception counselling resource for women with diabetes. Originally produced as a DVD with Diabetes UK funding, this resource has been embedded in routine care in Northern Ireland (NI) since 2010. A subsequent service evaluation of pregnancy planning indicators undertaken across all five antenatal-metabolic clinics in NI indicated that women who viewed the resource were better prepared for pregnancy. In order to increase the positive impact of the resource and to ensure longer-term sustainability, the DVD was converted to a website, http://www.womenwithdiabetes.net, with funding from the Public Health Agency NI. The evaluation also highlighted that women with type 2 diabetes were a hard-to-reach group. As these women are often cared for outside of specialist clinics, it is pertinent that all HCPs caring for women with diabetes are aware of the importance of preconception counselling.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114Gc51H]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Remarks**: The definition of gestational diabetes ("any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first definition during pregnancy") includes pregnant patients who have a marked degree of hyperglycemia consistent with previously undiagnosed overt diabetes. To exclude women with overt diabetes from the definition of gestational diabetes, most of our committee supports redefining gestational diabetes as outlined in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome study. According to this study, gestational diabetes is "the condition associated with degrees of maternal hyperglycemia less severe than those found in overt diabetes but associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes".

Based on the preceding evidence (Evidence 2.2.) and its analysis, the committee reached a majority opinion recommending screening using the protocol and threshold values as established by the consensus panel of the IADPSG. Readers are referred to the IADPSG recommendations on the diagnosis and classification of hyperglycemia in pregnancy for further reading on this subject.

Our recommendation, although in agreement with the recommendations of the IADPSG and American Diabetes Association, differs materially from the recommendation of other organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institutes of Health. It is acknowledged that this is an arguable and controversial recommendation; indeed, our committee failed to establish unanimity on advocating for this recommendation.

### Ethical dimensions of counseling about the clinical management of gestational diabetes [^1113YG1z]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes is associated with both short- and long-term adverse outcomes for the mother and the child. Glycemic control to improve perinatal outcomes is consistent with the best available evidence and should be recommended. The evidence for interventions to improve long-term outcomes is less robust. Therefore, patients need to be informed of the data, have the limitations explained, and be supported in decision-making. Theoretical risks do not need to be revealed to patients. Enthusiasm for interventions not supported by evidence should not be promoted. This article provides an ethical framework for counseling patients about the management of gestational diabetes.

This review presents an up-to-date summary on the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) among women of reproductive age, focusing on the time periods of preconception, gestation, and postpartum.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A systematic search and review of the literature for randomized controlled trials and other studies evaluating management of T1DM before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and postpartum was performed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Preconception planning should begin early in the reproductive years for young women with T1DM. Preconception and during pregnancy, it is recommended to achieve near-normal glucose values to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including fetal demise, congenital anomaly, pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, neonatal respiratory distress, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

- **Conclusion**: Women with T1DM can have healthy, safe pregnancies with preconception planning, optimal glycemic control, and multidisciplinary care.

### Prepregnancy care: A shared responsibility [^115Dxm9P]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The effective management of pregnancies complicated by diabetes is a shared responsibility — an equal partnership between healthcare professionals and a responsible woman. Over the last 30 years, major advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and care of diabetes have led to the hope that pregnancy outcomes for women with diabetes would be similar to the outcomes for women without diabetes, as stated in the goal of the Saint Vincent's Declaration in 1989. Unfortunately, this has not been realized, with the risk of congenital malformations, stillbirths, and neonatal death remaining as high as 3–10 times that of the background population.

For over a decade, major evidence-based guidelines have called for counseling women of child-bearing age with diabetes about the need for family planning and excellent control prior to conception. Preconception care provides the opportunity for the woman and her health caregivers to evaluate nutritional needs, the presence and extent of any micro-/macrovascular complications, and to adjust medications or diabetes management plans before pregnancy occurs.

Ideally, every woman with known diabetes would not only have prepregnancy counseling but also receive effective prepregnancy care. This has been an elusive goal, as underlined by Murphy et al. in this issue of Diabetes Care. These investigators developed a remarkable "marketing" plan, which included a website, lively and encouraging pamphlets mailed directly to potential patients, as well as local and community educational activities.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: A position statement of the American Diabetes Association [^114tsWWj]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

- **Specific settings and populations**: Pregnancy

Preconception counseling and care

To minimize risks associated with pregnancy and type 1 diabetes, preconception counseling and care are critical. Preconception care with tight glycemic control improves outcomes, including lower cesarean rates, decreased perinatal mortality, and decreased congenital malformations. Although there is some evidence that childbearing may be reduced, fertility should generally be assumed to be normal. All young women with type 1 diabetes should receive preconception counseling covering diabetes and general topics, such as the use of prenatal vitamins, discontinuation of potentially teratogenic medications, and the importance of glycemic control to reduce the risk of congenital malformations.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^114YdnZB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Rates of breastfeeding are significantly lower in women with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) for various reasons, including a higher rate of postpartum complications, fear of hypoglycemia, and lapses in postpartum diabetes care, which result in variability in maternal glycemia and decreased lactation support. Additionally, lapses in care that result in hyperglycemia and decreased uptake of contraception and pregnancy planning could increase the risk of congenital malformations and miscarriage in future pregnancies.

Management of maternal glycemia postpartum is challenging due to dramatic changes in insulin requirements during this period, which increases the risk of both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Insulin demand decreases dramatically with the delivery of the placenta, followed by a gradual increase in insulin resistance in the weeks after delivery. Hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal, is recognized as a significant problem for lactating women, prompting some to choose not to breastfeed.

Advances in diabetes technology may help reduce both hyper- and hypoglycemia. Diabetes care increasingly relies on advanced technology, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and hybrid closed-loop (HCL) pumps, in addition to a rapidly evolving array of oral and injectable pharmaceuticals. This complexity underscores the importance of expert diabetes care in the postpartum period.

In postpartum individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), the question arises: Should comprehensive diabetes management in addition to usual obstetric care be recommended over usual obstetric care alone?

The acceptability of the proposed intervention to key stakeholders was assessed as potentially variable. A systematic review addressing contraception in the general population across different scenarios concluded that contraceptive values and preferences are dynamic throughout a woman's lifespan and that these values and preferences are key elements women consider, alongside perceived benefits and side effects.

- **Factors influencing contraceptive use**: Potential factors include religious beliefs, opinions of significant others and family members, and desired family size. In an integrative review of 19 qualitative studies, women favored methods with natural preservation of menstruation and used negative language concerning daily hormonal and LARC methods. Regarding IUDs, there were issues regarding autonomy and power due to the need for a healthcare provider's involvement for insertion and removal. Power dynamics with partners also influenced contraception use and method. Similarly, women perceived an unequal power relationship with their healthcare providers, feeling that clinicians often tried to persuade them to choose a preferred method.

The study concluded that women's desire for contraceptive control and agency may be more important than the perceived effectiveness described by healthcare providers. Among adolescents and young women, privacy, autonomy, and safety of the contraceptive method were identified as the key issues in a systematic review of 9,693 subjects from the general population.

The implementation of the intervention was judged as likely feasible.

Starting at puberty, preconception counseling should be incorporated into routine diabetes clinic visits for all adolescents and women of childbearing potential, and appropriate birth control techniques should be discussed with women who do not desire pregnancy (C). As most pregnancies are unplanned, consider the potential risks and benefits of medications that are contraindicated in pregnancy in all adolescents and women of childbearing potential; counsel women using such medications accordingly (E).

Such medications should be evaluated prior to conception, as drugs commonly used to treat diabetes and its complications may be contraindicated or not recommended in pregnancy, including statins, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and most noninsulin therapies (B). Prenatal vitamins with folate should be started with preconception planning to reduce the risk for birth defects (B). All pregnant women with type 1 diabetes should be screened for thyroid disease early in pregnancy (B).

Women contemplating pregnancy should be evaluated and, if indicated, treated for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (B). A1C levels should be as close to normal as possible (< 7%) before conception is attempted (B). Nutritional intake should be optimized and included in preconception planning according to general pregnancy guidelines (E).

### Preconception counselling resource for women with diabetes [^111zzx2h]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Women with diabetes need to plan for pregnancy if they are to reduce their risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. While care providers have focused on setting up specialist pre-pregnancy planning clinics to help women prepare for pregnancy, the majority of women do not attend these clinics, entering pregnancy unprepared. Furthermore, women with type 2 diabetes remain a hard-to-reach group, suggesting a significant problem within primary care concerning preconception counselling. There is an urgent need to raise awareness of the importance of pregnancy planning among women and the healthcare professionals caring for them. Although this project is based in Northern Ireland, it addresses a global problem for women with diabetes.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116PGjVc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Preconception care of women with diabetes**: Preconception counseling is strongly recommended for all women with diabetes who are considering pregnancy. Women who receive this counseling tend to have better preconception glycemic control, resulting in more favorable pregnancy outcomes, including lower rates of congenital anomalies and spontaneous abortions. It is important to note that by the time a woman becomes aware of her pregnancy, much of fetal organogenesis has typically already occurred.

- **Remarks**: Optimally, preconception counseling should be provided by a multidisciplinary team, including a diabetes specialist, diabetes educator, dietitian, obstetrician, and other healthcare providers as needed. With the patient's consent, the inclusion of the woman's partner can enhance the supportive and mentoring therapeutic relationship. The counseling should cover several key topics:
	1. The necessity for planning the pregnancy, ensuring it occurs only when the woman has achieved adequate glycemic control, appropriate management of comorbidities (such as hypertension and retinopathy), discontinued unsafe medications, and has been taking folate supplements.
	2. The importance of smoking cessation.
	3. The significant time and effort required for self-management and engagement with the healthcare team, both before conception and during pregnancy.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, specifically concerning indications for screening, the SOGC 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for diabetes between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. This should be done using a standardized 2-hour 75-g OGTT with fasting plasma glucose, 1-hour plasma glucose, and 2-hour plasma glucose.

### Prepregnancy care: A shared responsibility [^115T2cHh]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising worldwide in women of childbearing age, and their care is generally in the hands of primary-care physicians. Thus, fewer women with type 2 diabetes relative to type 1 diabetes are seen in multidisciplinary prepregnancy clinics. Although most guidelines, including the International Diabetes Federation's Global Diabetes in Pregnancy Guideline, recommend insulin as optimal therapy ideally initiated prior to pregnancy, the reality is that this is often not done. A recent review of maternal and fetal outcomes in type 1 and type 2 diabetic women suggests that, although women with type 2 diabetes generally have had the disease for a shorter period of time, can achieve better glucose control in pregnancy, and have lower rates of diabetes complications, they have equally poor outcomes. Yet women with type 2 diabetes who access prepregnancy care can safely achieve normal glycemia in pregnancy with much less effort, as discussed in a recent review.

Interestingly, it was the outcomes of the women with type 2 diabetes in the study of Murphy et al. that experienced statistically significant improvements that helped to reduce overall adverse outcomes. For women with type 2 diabetes, the congenital malformation rate fell from 12.3% to 4.4%, perinatal mortality fell from 6.2% to 0.9%, and any serious adverse outcome fell from 16.4% to 5.3%. In all these subcategories, there was very little change for women with type 1 diabetes. The importance of the reported study is that it shows that access to prepregnancy counseling and care can significantly improve outcomes for women with type 2 diabetes.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, particularly concerning delivery considerations, the ES/ESE 2025 guidelines recommend offering early delivery for patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus based on risk assessment rather than expectant management. Consider using criteria such as the history of diabetes-related complications, measures of glycemia, ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, and the presence of other comorbidities associated with adverse perinatal outcomes to inform the ideal delivery timing. Recognize that risks may outweigh any benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation, even among patients with ideal glycemic management.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^1164VdDC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) express concerns about the effect of high glucose on the health of their infant. Although studies regarding the value placed on prioritized outcomes were not found, the guidelines development panel (GDP) judged that reducing congenital malformations would be of very high importance for most individuals.

The resources needed depend on how screening is implemented and could be substantial. Medical record modifications and staff/clinician time are required. Preconception care (PCC) increases the use of services, including diabetes education, nutrition counseling, contraception, and medical care.

Although no study directly evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pregnancy intention screening, cost-effectiveness data derived from estimates of PCC were found. The GDP judged that the indirect evidence for the cost-effectiveness of PCC favors screening those with diabetes for pregnancy intention. A US study estimated that the cost of PCC (20 preconception visits) was $3676 (1992 USD). However, the reduction in costs for maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and long-term costs related to congenital malformations resulted in cost savings of $1.86 for every dollar spent. An Irish study in 2016 demonstrated that attendees of a PCC clinic had an adjusted difference in complication costs of €2578 lower than usual antenatal care.

A systematic review of six economic evaluation studies of PCC, which included 1800 individuals with diabetes among other clinical contexts, found that PCC was likely to be cost-effective.

The specific circumstances regarding diabetes mellitus type 2, especially concerning pregnant patients, require careful attention. The ADA 2025 guidelines recommend using a person-centered, shared decision-making approach to preconception planning for all patients with diabetes and of childbearing potential. This involves addressing:

- **Attainment of glycemic goals**: Ensure glycemic targets are achieved before conception.
- **Time frame for discontinuing non-insulin glucose-lowering medications**: Plan for safe discontinuation as part of pregnancy preparation.
- **Optimal glycemic management in preparation for pregnancy**: Implement strategies for effective glycemic control prior to and during pregnancy.

Postpartum care recommendations for women with gestational diabetes involve several key components:

- **Measurement recommendations**: We recommend that postpartum care should include the measurement of fasting plasma glucose or fasting self-monitored blood glucose for 24 to 72 hours after delivery to rule out ongoing hyperglycemia.

- **Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: We recommend that a 2-hour, 75-g OGTT should be undertaken 6 to 12 weeks after delivery to rule out prediabetes or diabetes. If results are normal, this or other diagnostic tests for diabetes should be repeated periodically, as well as before future pregnancies.

- **Child's medical record**: We suggest that the child's birth weight and whether or not the child was born to a mother with gestational diabetes become part of the child's permanent medical record.

- **Lifestyle counseling**: We recommend that all women who have had gestational diabetes receive counseling on lifestyle measures to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, emphasize the importance of planning future pregnancies, and stress the need for regular diabetes screening, especially before any future pregnancies.

- **Medication management**: We suggest blood glucose-lowering medication should be discontinued immediately after delivery unless overt diabetes is suspected, in which case the decision to continue such medication should be made on a case-by-case basis.

These recommendations aim to ensure optimal postpartum health for women who experienced gestational diabetes and to mitigate future health risks for both the mother and child.

### Recommendations for preconception care [^115zzX5U]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Every woman of reproductive age who is capable of becoming pregnant is a candidate for preconception care, regardless of whether she is planning to conceive. Preconception care is aimed at identifying and modifying biomedical, behavioral, and social risks through preventive and management interventions. Key components include risk assessment, health promotion, and medical and psychosocial interventions. Patients should formulate a reproductive life plan that outlines personal goals about becoming pregnant based on the patient's values and resources. Preconception care can be provided in the primary care setting and through activities linked to schools, workplaces, and the community.

The justification for a screening question about the possibilities of pregnancy is based on the significant benefits for preconception care (PCC), which are used as a surrogate, and lack of considerable harm.

- **Adolescents with Type 1 diabetes**: Two subgroups need additional consideration: adolescent girls or young individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Serious adverse pregnancy outcomes can be especially high among adolescents and young women. The early and unpredictable timing of sexual debut, the high percentage of individuals who have at least one episode of unprotected sex, the higher occurrence of major malformations (20.5%), and the high prevalence of serious adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes support early intervention to reduce risks. As is true for all individuals, contraceptive counseling for adolescents should be devoid of coercion, involve shared decision-making, and respect individual autonomy. Access to contraception for adolescents should be available prior to sexual debut.

- **Women with Type 2 diabetes**: Women with T2DM may have lower awareness of pregnancy risks related to diabetes and reduced PCC attendance than those with T1DM, as well as an increased risk for certain adverse outcomes.

- **Research considerations**: Direct evidence from pragmatic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is needed to evaluate the benefit of the intervention of a screening question in individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant. Implementation studies are also needed. Suggested studies include evaluating how a screening question about pregnancy intention changes rates of:

1. Contraception prescription or referral to a family planning clinic
2. Referral for PCC
3. Unplanned pregnancies

Such studies could profoundly impact care practices and outcomes in this population.

### Preconception counselling resource for women with diabetes [^1156hFBC]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Women with diabetes need to plan for pregnancy to reduce their risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. While care providers have focused on setting up specialist pre-pregnancy planning clinics to help women prepare for pregnancy, the majority of women do not attend these clinics and enter pregnancy unprepared. A major barrier to accessing this care, as well as a consequence of poor preconception counselling, is a lack of knowledge regarding the need to plan and the reasons why.

This project addressed an urgent need to raise awareness of the importance of planning for pregnancy among women with diabetes and among the healthcare professionals (HCPs) caring for them. Focus groups with the target groups informed the development of a preconception counselling resource for women with diabetes. Originally produced as a DVD with funding from Diabetes UK, this resource has been embedded in routine care in Northern Ireland (NI) since 2010.

A subsequent service evaluation of pregnancy planning indicators carried out across all five antenatal-metabolic clinics in NI indicated that women who viewed the resource were better prepared for pregnancy. To increase the positive impact of the resource and ensure longer-term sustainability, the DVD was converted to a website, with funding from the Public Health Agency NI. The evaluation also highlighted that women with type 2 diabetes were a hard-to-reach group. As these women are often cared for outside of specialist clinics, it is pertinent that all HCPs caring for women with diabetes are aware of the importance of preconception counselling. Funding also supported the development of additional resources.
