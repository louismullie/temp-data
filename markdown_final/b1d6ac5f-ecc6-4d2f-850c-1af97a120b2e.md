## Question

What are the implications of trimetazidine on myocardial metabolism beyond stable angina?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the implications of trimetazidine on myocardial metabolism beyond stable angina. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core metabolic mechanism and why it could matter outside classic angina. Then, I should review the evidence in heart failure, distinguishing ischemic from non-ischemic etiologies. Next, I will examine data in diabetic cardiomyopathy, followed by peri-PCI and reperfusion settings. After that, I will consider specific cardiomyopathies like HCM, appraise pleiotropic effects, and finally position trimetazidine within guideline and safety frameworks to derive practical implications and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation before inferring broader clinical roles. Trimetazidine is a metabolic modulator that competitively inhibits 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, shifting substrate use from fatty acid β-oxidation to glucose oxidation, thereby improving ATP generation per oxygen molecule, tightening glycolysis–oxidation coupling, limiting acidosis, and attenuating ionic overload during ischemia–reperfusion; importantly, it has minimal hemodynamic effects, which makes any observed benefits more likely to be metabolic rather than preload/afterload mediated [^111KZQ39] [^116A9Tq4] [^117GW29f].

> Now, I should review the heart failure evidence, but I need to separate signal from bias. Meta-analytic data across 16 RCTs suggest improvements in LVEF by roughly 6–7%, reductions in NYHA class, better exercise time, remodeling indices, and fewer cardiac hospitalizations, albeit without a clear mortality effect, which aligns with a mechanism that improves energetics rather than altering arrhythmic substrates or infarct biology directly [^115qDryU]. Hold on, let me verify consistency with individual trials: an open-label randomized study showed improved EF and NYHA class with long-term add-on therapy, and a crossover MRS study demonstrated a 33% increase in the myocardial PCr/ATP ratio, supporting an energetic mechanism of action that plausibly underpins functional gains [^113fUTg5] [^117MSFk7].

> But wait, I should double-check non-ischemic etiologies where substrate mismatch may be less dominant. In stable nonischemic HF, a 6-month randomized double-blind study did not show a significant EF change, though 6-minute walk distance improved, suggesting symptomatic or peripheral/metabolic benefits even when central contractile function is unchanged; conversely, in ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, longer-term add-on therapy improved EF, functional status, and appeared to blunt CRP rise, hinting that ischemic substrate and low-grade inflammation may modulate responsiveness to metabolic manipulation [^117LTB6L] [^114Snp5k].

> Next, I should examine diabetes, where reliance on fatty acid oxidation is accentuated. In diabetic ischemic cardiomyopathy, randomized crossover data show increased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (M value), improved EF, lower fasting glucose, and reduced endothelin-1 with trimetazidine; another randomized study in diabetic cardiomyopathy reported improved EF, smaller LV dimensions, and better diastolic function, consistent with correction of substrate mismatch and possible endothelial effects; taken together, diabetes appears to be a setting where trimetazidine's mechanism aligns tightly with pathophysiology and may yield both cardiac and metabolic benefits [^114mEzzB] [^114eEZvx].

> I will now examine ischemia–reperfusion and the PCI setting, but I should be cautious not to overinterpret biomarkers. An acute loading strategy before PCI reduced post-procedural troponin Ic levels at serial time points and reduced overall troponin release; the study text concludes trimetazidine significantly reduces PCI-induced myocardial infarction, yet, wait, let me verify: the frequency of cTnI elevation did not differ significantly, so inferring fewer MIs from biomarker area under the curve is likely overstated, and I should correct that conclusion to "attenuates biomarker release without proven reduction in periprocedural MI rates" in that trial [^112NSgwh]. Post-PCI, persistent angina is common, and the large, event-driven ATPCI program was designed to test long-term symptom and event benefits of add-on trimetazidine after successful PCI, underscoring the biologic rationale of addressing residual ischemia and metabolic stress; however, I need to acknowledge that definitive outcome benefits were not established in the provided summary and remain uncertain here based on the cited material [^117Vw82V] [^116cVgum].

> Let me consider specific cardiomyopathies where energy inefficiency is central. In nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a randomized double-blind trial evaluated whether trimetazidine could improve exercise capacity; mechanistically, improving oxygen efficiency without negative inotropy could be attractive in HCM, but hold on, I should not jump to conclusions about efficacy because the summarized citation emphasizes evaluation rather than definitive benefit, and evidence appears mixed, so any use would remain investigational and carefully individualized [^113MgtrY].

> Next, I should review pleiotropic effects beyond substrate shift, while ensuring they are not overgeneralized. Trimetazidine has been associated with anti-inflammatory signals in ischemic DCM cohorts, reduced oxidative stress biomarkers and preserved function in experimental post-resuscitation models, lower endothelin-1 in diabetic ischemic cardiomyopathy, and even reductions in resting energy expenditure in systolic HF, all consistent with a broader cardio-metabolic benefit profile; additionally, emerging meta-analytic data suggest possible protection against contrast-induced AKI in high-risk coronary procedures, although prior syntheses were limited and heterogeneous, so I should qualify this as promising but not definitive [^114Snp5k] [^116A9Tq4] [^114mEzzB] [^115NkzEb] [^112fibSg].

> Hold on, I should verify where trimetazidine sits in contemporary guidance and any safety caveats. Most guidance places trimetazidine as a second- or third-line antianginal add-on for persistent symptoms after beta-blockers and/or CCBs, with 2024 ESC chronic coronary syndrome guidance noting it can be considered as add-on and in selected cases as part of initial therapy; concurrently, EMA-linked advisories highlight parkinsonian and restless legs–type adverse effects, prompting restrictions and the need for neurological monitoring and discontinuation if such symptoms emerge [^113iVktZ] [^114Jckmt] [^111KZQ39].

> I should now synthesize practical implications beyond stable angina, making sure I close the loop on earlier steps. First, in heart failure — particularly ischemic phenotypes — trimetazidine may improve myocardial energetics and functional measures, reduce hospitalizations, and favorably influence remodeling surrogates, consistent with disease-modifying potential centered on energy efficiency rather than mortality effects, with responsiveness attenuated in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy where substrate mismatch is less dominant [^115qDryU] [^113fUTg5] [^117MSFk7] [^117LTB6L]. Second, in diabetes-associated cardiac disease, the therapy appears to correct the pathologic FA-overreliance, improving both insulin sensitivity and LV function, suggesting a disease-specific metabolic intervention beyond symptom palliation [^114mEzzB] [^114eEZvx]. Third, in peri-PCI and reperfusion contexts, trimetazidine can attenuate biomarker release and may mitigate reperfusion injury biology, although I should emphasize that hard endpoint reduction was not demonstrated in the cited PCI biomarker study and long-term outcomes after PCI remained to be proven within the large ATPCI framework summarized here [^112NSgwh] [^117Vw82V] [^116cVgum]. Fourth, across multimorbidity with inflammatory and oxidative stress components, pleiotropic actions may add incremental benefit, but I need to ensure we do not overextend claims where trials are small, heterogeneous, or preclinical [^114Snp5k] [^116A9Tq4] [^112fibSg].

> Finally, let me reconsider risk–benefit and implementation, because patient selection is crucial. Given its hemodynamic neutrality, trimetazidine is useful when hypotension or bradycardia limit hemodynamic agents, and in phenotypes with clear metabolic mismatch such as ischemic HF and diabetic cardiomyopathy; yet, I should double-check for neurological adverse effects at baseline and during follow-up, use it primarily as guideline-concordant add-on for persistent symptoms, and communicate that while functional and biomarker improvements are likely, survival benefits are unproven in chronic coronary disease, keeping shared decision-making focused on symptom relief and quality of life [^113iVktZ] [^113ZdeaB] [^114Jckmt] [^115qDryU].

Trimetazidine **shifts myocardial metabolism from fatty acid to glucose oxidation** [^111KZQ39], thereby improving ATP efficiency [^117MSFk7] and reducing ischemic injury. Beyond stable angina, it **improves LV function and symptoms in ischemic heart failure** [^115qDryU] and **reduces PCI-related myocardial injury** [^112NSgwh]. It also **enhances insulin sensitivity and lowers fasting glucose** in diabetic cardiomyopathy [^114mEzzB]. However, it does not improve outcomes in nonischemic heart failure [^117LTB6L] or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and is not recommended for these conditions. Trimetazidine is generally well tolerated, but neurologic adverse effects (e.g. parkinsonism) can occur; avoid use in patients with movement disorders [^111KZQ39].

---

## Mechanism of action

Trimetazidine partially inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, **shifting substrate use toward glucose oxidation**, a more oxygen-efficient process that preserves high-energy phosphates during ischemia [^111KZQ39]. This metabolic shift reduces intracellular acidosis and ionic overload, thereby improving myocardial efficiency and function [^116A9Tq4].

---

## Clinical implications beyond stable angina

### Heart failure

In heart failure, patients with **ischemic etiology** benefit from trimetazidine, with improved LV function, reduced remodeling, and better symptoms and exercise capacity [^113fUTg5]. Meta-analyses also demonstrate increased LVEF, reduced LV volumes, and fewer cardiac hospitalizations [^115qDryU]. In contrast, in **nonischemic heart failure**, evidence is limited and inconsistent, with no significant benefit on LVEF or clinical outcomes [^117LTB6L].

---

### Myocardial infarction and ischemia-reperfusion injury

For myocardial infarction and ischemia-reperfusion injury, **PCI-related injury** is reduced when trimetazidine is given pre-procedurally, evidenced by lower post-PCI troponin release, indicating less myocardial injury [^112NSgwh]. Additionally, in **ischemia-reperfusion**, animal data [^116k1TPz] show reduced oxidative stress and inflammation with improved post-ischemic function [^114dDgF8].

---

### Diabetic cardiomyopathy

In diabetic cardiomyopathy, trimetazidine **enhances insulin sensitivity**, lowers fasting glucose [^114mEzzB], and improves LV function [^114eEZvx].

---

### Post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction

In post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction, **myocardial function and survival improve** post-resuscitation in animal models [^116k1TPz], likely via reduced oxidative stress and inflammation [^114dDgF8].

---

## Limitations and safety considerations

Neurologic adverse effects such as **parkinsonian symptoms** and **restless legs** have been reported; avoid use in patients with **movement disorders** [^111KZQ39]. The 2024 ESC **guidelines** state that trimetazidine is an add-on therapy for angina refractory to β-blockers/CCBs, not for primary heart failure or nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

---

## Summary of clinical implications

| **Clinical condition** | **Evidence of benefit** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Ischemic heart failure | Strong | Improved LVEF, reduced remodeling, improved symptoms |
| Nonischemic heart failure | Limited | No significant benefit |
| PCI-related myocardial injury | Moderate | Reduced troponin release |
| Diabetic cardiomyopathy | Moderate | Improved insulin sensitivity, reduced fasting glucose |
| Post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction | Experimental | Improved myocardial function, survival (animal models) |

Trimetazidine's **metabolic shift improves myocardial efficiency and function** [^117MSFk7], with benefits in ischemic heart failure [^115qDryU], PCI-related injury, and diabetic cardiomyopathy, but with limited effect in nonischemic heart failure [^117LTB6L] or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is generally well tolerated; however, neurologic adverse effects warrant caution in susceptible patients [^111KZQ39].

### Effects of trimetazidine in nonischemic heart failure: a randomized study [^117LTB6L]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with changes in myocardial metabolism that lead to impairment of contractile function. Trimetazidine (TMZ) modulates cardiac energetic efficiency and improves outcomes in ischemic heart disease. We evaluated the effects of TMZ on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac metabolism, exercise capacity, O2 uptake, and quality of life in patients with nonischemic HF.

Sixty patients with stable nonischemic HF under optimal medical therapy were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomized to TMZ (35 mg orally twice a day) or placebo for 6 months. LVEF, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), maximum O2 uptake in cardiopulmonary exercise test, different markers of metabolism, oxidative stress, endothelial function, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after TMZ treatment. Left ventricular peak glucose uptake was evaluated using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET). Etiology was idiopathic in 85% and hypertensive in 15%. Both groups were similar in age, functional class, LVEF, and levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline. After 6 months of TMZ treatment, no significant changes were observed in LVEF (31 ± 10% vs 34 ± 8%; p = 0.8), 6MWT (443 ± 25 m vs 506 ± 79 m; p = 0.03), maximum O2 uptake (19.1 ± 5.0 mL kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ vs 23.0 ± 7.2 mL kg⁻¹ min⁻¹; p = 0.11), functional class (percentages of patients in functional classes I/II/III/IV 10/37/53/0 vs 7/40/50/3; p = 0.14), or quality of life.

### Effect of trimetazidine dihydrochloride therapy on exercise capacity in patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A randomized clinical trial [^113MgtrY]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes limiting symptoms in patients, partly mediated through inefficient myocardial energy use. There is conflicting evidence regarding the therapy using inhibitors of myocardial fatty acid metabolism in patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The objective was to determine the effect of oral therapy with trimetazidine, a direct inhibitor of fatty acid β-oxidation, on exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial at The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom, was conducted between May 31, 2012, and September 8, 2014. The trial included 51 drug-refractory symptomatic (New York Heart Association class ≥ 2) patients aged 24 to 74 years with a maximum left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 50 mm Hg or lower and a peak oxygen consumption during exercise of 80% or less predicted value for age and sex. Statistical analysis was performed from March 1, 2016, through July 4, 2018.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive trimetazidine, 20 mg, three times daily (n = 27) or placebo (n = 24) for three months.

The primary endpoint was peak oxygen consumption during upright bicycle ergometry. Secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk distance, quality of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire), frequency of ventricular ectopic beats, diastolic function, serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, and troponin T.

### Short- and long-term beneficial effects of trimetazidine in patients with diabetes and ischemic cardiomyopathy [^114mEzzB]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Trimetazidine (TMZ) has been shown to partially inhibit free fatty acid oxidation by shifting substrate utilization from fatty acid to glucose. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of TMZ in patients with diabetes and ischemic cardiomyopathy.

- **Methods**: Sixteen patients with diabetes and ischemic hypokinetic cardiomyopathy (all males) on conventional therapy were randomized to receive either a placebo or TMZ (20 mg 3 times per day). Each arm lasted 15 days, followed by two additional 6-month periods, according to a double-blind, crossover design. At the end of each period, all patients underwent exercise testing, 2-dimensional echocardiography, and hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp. Among other measurements, New York Heart Association class, ejection fraction, exercise time, fasting blood glucose, end-clamp M value (an index of total body glucose disposal), and endothelin-1 levels were evaluated.

- **Results**: In both the short and long term (completed by 13 patients), compared to placebo, treatment with TMZ resulted in increased ejection fraction (47 ± 7 vs. 41 ± 9 and 45 ± 8 vs. 36 ± 8%, P < 0.001 for both) and M value (4.0 ± 1.8 vs. 3.3 ± 1.6, P = 0.003, and 3.5 ± 1.5 vs. 2.7 ± 1.6 mg/kg body weight/min, P < 0.01). Fasting blood glucose (121 ± 30 vs. 136 ± 40, P = 0.02 and 125 ± 36 vs. 140 ± 43, P = 0.19) and endothelin-1 (8.8 ± 3.8 vs. 10.9 ± 3.8, P < 0.001 and 6.2 ± 2.4 vs. 9.2 ± 4.3 pg/mL, P = 0.03) decreased. In the short term, 10 patients demonstrated a decrease of 1 class on the NYHA scale during treatment with TMZ (P = 0.019 vs. placebo).

### Taking diabetes to heart — deregulation of myocardial lipid metabolism in diabetic cardiomyopathy [^111KZQ39]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent used for antianginal therapy throughout Europe and Asia. By acting as a competitive inhibitor of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, the terminal enzyme of β-oxidation, trimetazidine shifts the energy substrate preference from FA oxidation to glucose oxidation. The improved coupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation limits the intracellular acidosis attributed to glucose metabolism and also minimizes sodium and potassium overload during ischemia and reperfusion. This allows trimetazidine to increase cardiac efficiency during ischemic episodes by sparing ATP hydrolysis from being used to correct myocardial ionic homeostasis.

The effects of trimetazidine in experimental studies make this drug an attractive treatment for angina in diabetic patients. This hypothesis was confirmed by the TRIMPOL-1 trial, in which the addition of trimetazidine to the treatment regimen improved exercise capacity and duration and reduced anginal attacks in diabetic patients with chronic stable angina, without influencing heart rate or blood pressure. Subsequent studies have also shown trimetazidine to improve heart function and overall insulin sensitivity in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. However, reports of side effects, such as parkinsonian symptoms and restless leg syndrome, have recently prompted the European Medicines Agency to restrict the use of trimetazidine-containing medicine in the treatment of patients with angina to second-line, add-on therapy and to discontinue its use in patients who develop these symptoms.

### Protective effect of an acute oral loading dose of trimetazidine on myocardial injury following percutaneous coronary intervention [^112NSgwh]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effect of pre-procedural acute oral administration of trimetazidine (TMZ) on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-induced myocardial injury, a single-centre, prospective, randomised evaluation study was conducted. The setting included patients with stable angina pectoris and single-vessel disease undergoing PCI. A total of 582 patients were prospectively randomised, with those undergoing more than one inflation during PCI excluded. This resulted in 266 patients randomly assigned to two groups.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive an acute loading dose of 60 mg of TMZ prior to intervention. The main outcome measured was the frequency and increase in the level of cardiac troponin Ic (cTnI) after successful PCI. cTnI levels were measured before and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after PCI.

Results showed that 136 patients were assigned to the TMZ group and 130 to the control group. Although no statistically significant difference was observed in the frequency of cTnI increase between the two groups, post-procedural cTnI levels were significantly reduced in the TMZ group at all time points: 6 hours (mean (SD) 4.2 (0.8) vs. 1.7 (0.2), p < 0.001), 12 hours (5.5 (1.5) vs. 2.3 (0.4), p < 0.001), 18 hours (9 (2.3) vs. 3 (0.5), p < 0.001), and 24 hours (3.2 (1.2) vs. 1 (0.5), p < 0.001). Moreover, the total amount of cTnI released after PCI, as assessed by the area under the curve of serial measurement, was significantly reduced in the TMZ group (p < 0.05).

In conclusion, pre-procedural acute oral TMZ administration significantly reduces PCI-induced myocardial infarction.

### Additional use of trimetazidine in patients with chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis [^115qDryU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). High credibility.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of additional trimetazidine (TMZ) treatment on patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Conflicting results currently exist on the clinical use of TMZ in CHF patients.

PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews databases were searched through November 2010 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing TMZ treatment in CHF patients. Data concerning the study design, patient characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. Risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated using fixed or random effects models.

Sixteen RCTs involving 884 CHF patients were included. Hospitalization for cardiac causes (RR: 0.43, p = 0.03), but not all-cause mortality (RR: 0.47, p = 0.27), was reduced by TMZ treatment. Moreover, TMZ therapy was associated not only with the increase of left ventricular ejection fraction (WMD: 6.46%, p < 0.0001) and total exercise time (WMD: 63.75 seconds, p < 0.0001), but also with the decrease of New York Heart Association functional class (WMD: -0.57, p = 0.0003), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (WMD: -6.67 mm, p < 0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (WMD: -6.05 mm, p < 0.0001), and B-type natriuretic peptide (WMD: -203.40 pg/ml, p = 0.0002).

The additional use of TMZ in CHF patients may decrease hospitalization for cardiac causes, improve clinical symptoms and cardiac function, and simultaneously ameliorate left ventricular remodeling.

### Efficacy and safety of trimetazidine after percutaneous coronary intervention (ATPCI): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117Vw82V]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Angina might persist or reoccur despite successful revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and antianginal therapy. Additionally, PCI in stable patients has not been shown to improve survival compared with optimal medical therapy. Trimetazidine is an antianginal agent that improves energy metabolism of the ischaemic myocardium and might improve outcomes and symptoms of patients who recently had a PCI. In this study, we aimed to assess the long-term potential benefits and safety of trimetazidine added to standard evidence-based medical treatment in patients who had a recent successful PCI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial of trimetazidine added to standard background therapy in patients who had undergone successful PCI at 365 centres in 27 countries across Europe, South America, Asia, and North Africa. Eligible patients were aged 21–85 years and had either elective PCI for stable angina or urgent PCI for unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction less than 30 days before randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned by an interactive web response system to oral trimetazidine 35 mg modified-release twice daily or matching placebo. Participants, study investigators, and all study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiac death; hospital admission for a cardiac event; recurrence or persistence of angina requiring an addition, switch, or increase of the dose of at least one antianginal drug; or recurrence.

### Norvasc [^1177aNHD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Coronary artery disease (CAD)**: Norvasc is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Norvasc may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents.

- **Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal's or variant angina)**: Norvasc is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents.

- **Angiographically documented CAD**: In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%, Norvasc is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.

### Effect of partial inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by trimetazidine on whole body energy metabolism in patients with chronic heart failure [^115NkzEb]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Trimetazidine may have beneficial effects on left ventricular (LV) function in patients with systolic heart failure. The authors assessed whether the long-term addition of trimetazidine to conventional treatment could improve resting whole body energy metabolism alongside LV function in patients with chronic systolic heart failure.

- **Design**: Single-blind randomized study conducted at a university hospital.

- **Patients**: 44 patients with systolic heart failure receiving full medical treatment participated in the study.

- **Interventions**: Indirect calorimetry and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed at baseline and after 3 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Whole body resting energy expenditure (REE), percentage of predicted REE, LV ejection fraction (EF), NYHA class, and quality of life were measured.

Results indicated that trimetazidine increased EF compared with conventional therapy alone (from 35 ± 8% to 42 ± 11% vs. from 35 ± 7% to 36 ± 6%; p = 0.02, analysis of variance for repeated measures). NYHA class and quality of life also improved compared with conventional therapy (p < 0.0001). REE decreased in the trimetazidine group (from 1677 ± 264 to 1580 ± 263 kcal/day) as well as the percentage of predicted REE (from 114 ± 10% to 108 ± 9% based on the Harris-Benedict equation), but not in the control group (REE from 1679 ± 304 to 1690 ± 337 kcal/day and percentage of predicted REE from 113 ± 12% to 115 ± 14%). The variations between groups were statistically significant (p = 0.03 and 0.023, respectively).

In conclusion, for patients with systolic heart failure, improvement in functional class and LV function induced by mid-term trimetazidine therapy is paralleled by a reduction in whole body resting energy expenditure.

### Expert consensus document: A 'diamond' approach to personalized treatment of angina [^113iVktZ]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In clinical guidelines, drugs for symptomatic angina are classified as being first choice (β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, short-acting nitrates) or second choice (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine), with the recommendation to reserve second-choice medications for patients who have contraindications to first-choice agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. No direct comparisons between first-choice and second-choice treatments have demonstrated the superiority of one group of drugs over the other. Meta-analyses show that all antianginal drugs have similar efficacy in reducing symptoms but provide no evidence for improvement in survival. The newer, second-choice drugs have more evidence-based clinical data that are more contemporary than what is available for traditional first-choice drugs. Considering some drugs, but not others, to be first choice is, therefore, difficult.

Moreover, double or triple therapy is often needed to control angina. Patients with angina can have several comorbidities, and symptoms can result from various underlying pathophysiologies. Some agents, in addition to having antianginal effects, have properties that could be useful depending on the comorbidities present and the mechanisms of angina, but the guidelines do not provide recommendations on the optimal combinations of drugs. In this consensus statement, we propose an individualized approach to angina treatment, which takes into consideration the patient, their comorbidities, and the underlying mechanism of disease.

### Trimetazidine alleviates postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and improves 96-hour survival in a ventricular fibrillation rat model [^116k1TPz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Myocardial dysfunction is a critical cause of post-cardiac arrest hemodynamic instability and circulatory failure, potentially leading to early mortality after resuscitation. Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent known for its protective effects in myocardial ischemia. However, its protective role against postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction remains uncertain.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 8 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were randomized into four groups immediately after resuscitation (n = 15/group): (1) normothermia control (NTC); (2) targeted temperature management; (3) trimetazidine-normothermia; and (4) trimetazidine-targeted temperature management. Trimetazidine (TMZ) was administered in a single dose of 10 mg/kg in the respective groups. Body temperature was maintained at 34.0°C for 2 hours and then rewarmed to 37.5°C in the targeted temperature management groups.

Postresuscitation hemodynamics, 96-hour survival, and pathological analysis were assessed. Heart tissues and blood samples from additional rats (n = 6/group), following the same experimental procedure, were collected to measure myocardial injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress-related biomarkers using ELISA-based quantification assays. Compared with the normothermia control, tumor necrosis factor-α and cardiac troponin-I were significantly reduced, while the left ventricular ejection fraction and 96-hour survival rates were significantly improved in the three experimental groups. Furthermore, inflammation and oxidative stress levels were assessed, showing a positive impact from the interventions.

### Isosorbide dinitrate [^112ZXwNo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Isosorbide dinitrate tablets are indicated for the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The onset of action of immediate-release oral isosorbide dinitrate is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.

### Relation of the number of cardiovascular conditions and short-term symptom improvement after percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina pectoris [^112xEdm1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

With the aging of the population, cardiovascular conditions (CC) are increasingly common in individuals undergoing PCI for stable angina pectoris (AP). It is unknown if the overall burden of CCs is associated with diminished symptom improvement after PCI for stable AP. We prospectively administered validated surveys assessing AP, dyspnea, and depression to patients undergoing PCI for stable AP at our institution from 2016 to 2018. The association of CC burden and symptoms at 30 days post-PCI was assessed via linear mixed effects models. Included individuals (N = 121; mean age 68 ± 10 years; response rate = 42%) were similar to non-included individuals.

At baseline, greater CC burden was associated with worse dyspnea, depression, and physical limitations due to AP, but not AP frequency or quality of life. PCI was associated with small improvements in AP and dyspnea (p ≤ 0.001 for both), but not depression (p = 0.15). After multivariable adjustment, including for baseline symptoms, CC burden was associated with a greater improvement in AP physical limitations (p = 0.01) and depression (p = 0.002), albeit small, but not in other symptom domains (all p ≥ 0.05).

In patients undergoing PCI for stable AP, increasing CC burden was associated with worse dyspnea, depression, and AP physical limitations at baseline. An increasing number of CCs was associated with greater improvements, though small, in AP physical limitations and depression. In conclusion, the overall number of cardiovascular conditions should not be used to exclude patients from PCI for stable AP on the basis of an expectation of less symptom improvement.

### Trimetazidine added to combined hemodynamic antianginal therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized crossover trial [^111NSdVh]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

In nondiabetic patients with stable angina, combined treatment with hemodynamic agents and trimetazidine is well-tolerated and effective in controlling ischemia. This study aims to evaluate the anti-ischemic and metabolic effects of trimetazidine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, not eligible for revascularization, who remained symptomatic despite the use of at least two antianginal agents.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial was used. Ten patients were randomized to receive trimetazidine (20 mg, three times a day) or placebo for 6-week periods. At baseline and at the end of each 6-week intervention period, clinical and biochemical evaluations, exercise testing, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, and Holter monitoring were performed.

- **Results**: During trimetazidine therapy, patients had significant improvement on angina functional class (P < .05), with a decrease in the number of weekly angina episodes (1.5 ± 0.8 vs. 0.4 ± 0.7, P < .01), and in sublingual nitrate doses (1.4 ± 0.7 mg vs. 0.1 ± 0.3 mg, P < .001). Time to 1-mm ST-segment depression during exercise test was increased after trimetazidine use (229 ± 126 seconds at baseline, 276 ± 101 seconds after placebo, and 348 ± 145 seconds after trimetazidine, P < .001). No differences were observed between treatment periods on mean 24-hour blood pressure, heart rate, and rate-pressure product evaluated concomitantly with ambulatory blood pressure and Holter monitoring. Glycemic and lipid profiles were similar after trimetazidine and placebo use.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with type 2 diabetes, trimetazidine added to combined hemodynamic antianginal therapy showed improvements in angina symptoms and exercise tolerance without adversely affecting glycemic or lipid profiles.

### Suboptimal pharmacotherapeutic management of chronic stable angina in the primary care setting [^115RLoVm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the adequacy of symptomatic treatment for chronic stable angina among primary care patients who receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a cross-sectional analysis was conducted involving 7,038 veterans with self-reported coronary heart disease. These patients completed the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and had made a primary care visit to one of seven VA general internal medicine clinics between May 1997 and January 2000. The main outcome measures included the anginal frequency scale of the questionnaire and receipt of prescriptions for antianginal medication in three classes: beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and long-acting nitrates.

Seventy percent of the patients experienced angina or took sublingual nitroglycerin preparations two or fewer times per week. Of the 30% of patients with more frequent symptoms, 22% were receiving no antianginal medications, and 33% were receiving only one class of antianginal medication. Among patients with frequent angina who were prescribed medications, 18% were taking no medications at the recommended therapeutic dose, and 50% were receiving only one class of antianginal medication at the recommended therapeutic dose.

A substantial proportion of patients with frequent episodes of chronic stable angina appeared to be receiving an inadequate antianginal regimen in terms of the number of agents and dosages. While numerous studies have described inadequate treatment of asymptomatic conditions and risk factors, our results suggest similar deficiencies in addressing a serious and imminent condition.

### Trimetazidine alleviates postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and improves 96-hour survival in a ventricular fibrillation rat model [^111kgXxu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Trimetazidine is a piperazine-derived metabolic agent that could maintain cellular homeostasis, thereby increasing cell tolerance to ischemia. It has a direct effect on myocardial ischemia and does not induce hemodynamic changes. Animal experiments have shown that trimetazidine can improve myocardial performance in vivo regional ischemia-reperfusion, heart failure, and myocardial infarction animal models. Clinical trials have demonstrated that trimetazidine can reduce attack frequency in patients with stable angina, improve left and right ventricular functions in patients with heart failure, and reduce the incidence of ST-segment exacerbation in patients with myocardial infarction. However, whether trimetazidine protects against postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction has not been investigated.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether trimetazidine can improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and 96-hour survival in a ventricular fibrillation (VF) rat model. Additionally, the study explored the role of trimetazidine in antioxidant and anti-inflammation processes and the influence of hypothermia on trimetazidine's cardioprotective effect.

### Acute effects of heparin administration on the ischemic threshold of patients with coronary artery disease: Evaluation of the protective role of the metabolic modulator trimetazidine [^114zv4z4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to assess the effects of heparin and the potential protective effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) on exercise performance, plasma nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and free fatty acid (FFA) release in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Heparin has been shown to reduce the ischemic threshold in patients with CAD. Trimetazidine may affect myocardial substrate utilization by shifting energy production from FFA to glucose oxidation.

In four consecutive days, nine patients with CAD each received one of the following four regimens:

- **Regimen 1**: One tablet of placebo the evening before and at 8 AM and 4 PM on the day of the study, 10 mL of saline in a bolus 10 minutes before exercise, followed by an infusion of the same preparation.
- **Regimen 2**: Placebo at the same times as in the first regimen, 5,000 IU of heparin 10 minutes before exercise, followed by 1,000 IU/h.
- **Regimen 3**: 20 mg TMZ at the same times as in the first regimen, 5,000 IU of heparin 10 minutes before exercise, followed by 1,000 IU/h.
- **Regimen 4**: TMZ at the same times as in the first regimen, 10 mL of saline 10 minutes before exercise, followed by an infusion of the same preparation.

During placebo (test 2), heparin reduced the time to 1-mm ST-segment depression and prolonged the recovery time compared with the results of test 1. When heparin was administered after TMZ (test 3), the time to 1-mm ST-segment depression and the recovery time were similar to those recorded during saline (test 1). Finally, compared with all study phases, TMZ during saline (test 4) prolonged the time to 1 mm.

### Trimetazidine for stable angina [^117RCf1T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with stable angina not controlled by monotherapy with nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers are often treated with combinations of these drugs. There may be adverse effects from, or contraindications to, the use of combinations. In low-risk groups, medical treatment appears to be as good an option as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in terms of averting myocardial infarction, death, or subsequent revascularization. Revascularization procedures are too costly or inaccessible for many patients in developing countries; therefore, effective and safe medical treatment is needed. Trimetazidine is a less well-known anti-anginal drug that controls myocardial ischaemia through intracellular metabolic changes. Trimetazidine has been reported in some studies to be better tolerated than combined anti-anginal therapy; however, it is not considered in published guidelines.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of trimetazidine in patients with stable angina.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and SCISEARCH, without language restriction, from inception to October 2003. Experts in the field were contacted to locate unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised studies comparing trimetazidine with placebo, or another anti-angina drug in adults with stable angina.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-three studies (1,378 patients) met the criteria.

### Angina and future cardiovascular events in stable patients with coronary artery disease: Insights from the reduction of atherothrombosis for continued health (REACH) registry [^111je381]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of stable angina has historically been linked to the classic chronic condition caused by epicardial coronary stenosis. Nevertheless, stable angina includes other less common presentations such as microvascular angina, vasospastic angina, and angina caused by ischemic cardiomyopathy. In each of these conditions, myocardial ischemia is present, albeit with different burdens and mechanisms. The association between angina, ischemia, and cardiovascular outcomes is complex and is probably not consistent across all patients.

In the BARI 2D trial, among patients with diabetes mellitus, myocardial ischemia, rather than anginal symptoms, appeared to be prognostic for future cardiovascular events. These results are consistent with our findings in diabetic patients, in whom angina by itself was not predictive of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Interestingly, in the CLARIFY registry, patients with only ischemia (without angina) had an adjusted risk for cardiovascular outcomes comparable to patients without both ischemia and angina. In contrast, patients with both angina and ischemia had the worst outcomes. Interestingly, more than half of the cardiovascular deaths and myocardial infarction events in the CLARIFY study occurred in patients without detectable ischemia or angina at baseline.

In our study, ischemia status during follow-up was not available and could not be accounted for. Nevertheless, angina, regardless of ischemia status, was independently associated with more cardiovascular hospitalizations and coronary revascularization procedures. Of interest, the association between angina and cardiovascular events was evident, even without available ischemia status.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116t1aCZ]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A total of 813 patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with PETN 80 mg b.i.d. or placebo at Visit 0 (408 to PETN, 404 to placebo, and 1 was randomized in error and was excluded from further procedures; see Table 1). Although 740 patients (91%) completed the trial, 72 patients (9%) terminated the trial early due to adverse events (13), investigator decision (5), withdrawal of consent (29), protocol violation (11), sponsor request (1), or other reasons (death: 2; serious adverse events: 4; randomized but not treated: 5; lost to follow-up: 2).

The ITT population comprised 655 patients (328 on PETN, see Table 2) after exclusion of patients with one or more of the following: no ETT at 6 and 12 weeks, n = 39; failure to recognize exclusion criteria like stability criterion, n = 45; maximum TED time longer than allowed for inclusion in the study, n = 42; or ECG criteria (e.g. left bundle branch block), n = 46. All patients had documented CAD. In the ITT population, 32.3% of the patients in the PETN group and 36.7% in the placebo group had a previous myocardial infarction; respectively, 25% and 23.2% had undergone a revascularization procedure (percutaneous or surgical).

- **Contraindications and Treatment Groups**: Other patients had contraindications to revascularization, a revascularization was anatomically or technically impossible, refused intervention, or were on a waiting list. Therapy with beta-blockers or ivabradine was used by 87.8% of the ITT population (see Figure 2) without differences between groups regarding age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, or the prevalence of smoking.

### Combination treatment in stable effort angina using trimetazidine and metoprolol: Results of a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study (TRIMPOL II). TRIMetazidine in POLand [^1143u9Y4]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the anti-ischaemic efficacy and tolerability of the metabolic agent trimetazidine in combination with metoprolol in patients with stable effort angina.

This was a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. A total of 426 male and female patients with stable, effort-induced angina and documented coronary artery disease received either a placebo or trimetazidine 20 mg three times daily, in addition to metoprolol 50 mg twice daily. Treadmill exercise tests were performed at weeks -1, 0, 4, and 12.

After 12 weeks, there were significantly greater improvements in the metoprolol plus trimetazidine group than in the metoprolol plus placebo group in several measures: time to 1 mm ST segment depression, total workload, time to onset of angina, maximum ST segment depression, mean weekly number of angina attacks, mean weekly nitrate consumption, and grade of anginal pain. There was no evidence of any development of tolerance to trimetazidine, and its tolerability was excellent.

Therapy with trimetazidine plus metoprolol produced significant improvements in exercise stress tests and the symptoms of angina relative to metoprolol alone. With its metabolic effect, devoid of any haemodynamic action, trimetazidine is useful for combination therapy in patients with stable angina insufficiently controlled by monotherapy with a beta-blocker.

### Long term cardioprotective action of trimetazidine and potential effect on the inflammatory process in patients with ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy [^114Snp5k]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of trimetazidine in patients with dilated ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Researchers studied the effects of trimetazidine on left ventricular function, its tolerability profile, and potential anti-inflammatory effects.

- **Design**: Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive trimetazidine (20 mg thrice daily) in addition to their conventional treatment or to continue their usual drug treatment for 18 months. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months with a clinical examination, echocardiography, and biochemical analysis (C reactive protein).

- **Results**: Trimetazidine added to the usual treatment significantly improved the patients' functional status (assessed by New York Heart Association functional class). The functional improvement of trimetazidine-treated patients was associated with a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (30 (6)%, 32 (8)%, 38 (7)%, and 37 (6)% vs. 31 (8)%, 30 (7)%, 28 (6)%, and 26 (9)%) in control patients at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively, and with a significant effect on ventricular remodelling. C reactive protein plasma concentrations remained stable throughout the study in patients receiving trimetazidine (2.5 (1.0), 2.7 (2.0), 2.7 (3.0), and 3.0 (2.0) mg/l at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively) but increased significantly in the control group (2.4 (1.0), 3.4 (1.2), 6.0 (4.0), and 7.0 (5.0) mg/l, respectively). No significant adverse event or changes in clinical or biochemical parameters were detected.

Conclusion: The treatment with trimetazidine demonstrated significant long-term cardioprotective benefits, improving functional status and stability of C reactive protein levels in patients with ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Comparison of trimetazidine plus sildenafil to chronic nitrates in the control of myocardial ischemia during sexual activity in patients with coronary artery disease [^111TcrSm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

A large proportion of patients with erectile dysfunction also have coronary artery disease (CAD). In these patients, nitrate therapy is contraindicated with the use of sildenafil. To assess whether the metabolic anti-ischemic agent, trimetazidine, is effective in controlling episodes of myocardial ischemia during sexual activity in patients with CAD who use long-term nitrate therapy, we studied 38 men (mean age, 57 ± 6 years) with confirmed CAD.

Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring at baseline, after one week of oral nitrate therapy (20 mg, three times a day), and after one week of trimetazidine (20 mg, three times a day). They were instructed to engage in at least one session of sexual intercourse during each monitoring session. Sildenafil (100 mg) was taken one hour before sexual intercourse at baseline and during therapy with trimetazidine and sildenafil, while a placebo (blinded) was administered during nitrate therapy.

A decrease in total ischemic burden was observed with nitrates and trimetazidine compared with baseline (-3 ± 1.2 episodes/patient/24 hours vs -5 ± 1.3 episodes/patient/24 hours and -6 ± 5 min/patient/24 hours vs -8 ± 3 min/patient/24 hours, p < 0.01 for nitrates and trimetazidine vs baseline). Trimetazidine plus sildenafil was more effective in controlling episodes of myocardial ischemia during sexual activity than nitrates alone (-45 ± 11% vs -18 ± 7%, p < 0.04).

In conclusion, in patients with CAD, combination therapy with sildenafil and trimetazidine is more effective than nitrate therapy alone.

### The impact of guideline compliant medical therapy on clinical outcome in patients with stable angina: findings from the Euro Heart Survey of stable angina [^111Hbypb]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology published guidelines for the management of stable angina in 1997 to promote an evidence-based approach to the condition. This study examines the impact of guideline-compliant medical treatment on clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina.

- **Methods and results**: The Euro Heart Survey of Stable Angina is a multicenter prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2003. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stable angina by a cardiologist were enrolled, and follow-up was conducted at 1 year. The primary outcome of interest was death or myocardial infarction (MI). The increasing intensity of guideline-compliant medical therapy was quantified by a simple treatment score based on the use of guideline-advocated therapies: antiplatelets, statins, and beta-blockers. A total of 3,779 patients were included in the initial survey. Increasing intensity of guideline-compliant therapy at initial assessment was associated with a reduction in death and MI during follow-up in patients with angina and confirmed coronary disease (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49–0.95 per unit increase in treatment score). All cardiovascular events were also significantly reduced in this subgroup (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69–0.97). The benefits of guideline-compliant therapy were only observed in patients with objective evidence of coronary disease.

Guideline-compliant medical therapy improves clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina and objective evidence of coronary disease.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114WG567]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

All the data were collected using an electronic case report form and analyzed by an independent statistician based on a predefined statistical analysis plan. The analysis of efficacy was performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with regard to primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. All patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement were included in the ITT population. Non-completers were included in the ITT population using the last-observation-carried-forward approach. In addition, all analyses were performed on the per-protocol population as secondary efficacy analyses. Safety data were presented for the safety population, which includes all patients who received at least one dose of study medication.

The primary efficacy endpoint, 'change in TED after 12 weeks', and the secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), including country, treatment, use of anti-anginal background therapy as fixed class effects, and baseline TED (ETT before randomization) as a covariate.

Subgroup analyses were carried out on the ITT population, restricted to the change in TED, TAP, and TST from randomization to week 12. Subgroup analyses included country and anti-anginal background therapy, gender, age (65 years), TED at baseline (divided into quartiles), co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking habits. Additionally, protocol version was considered, with version 1 allowing inclusion of patients with a baseline TED ≤ 9 min only.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112mVjHu]. European Heart Journal (2014). High credibility.

The trial endpoints used in the trial are in accordance with the EMA guideline CPMP/EWP/234/95. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in TED (in seconds) after 12 weeks of treatment with PETN 80 mg b.i.d. compared with placebo b.i.d., assessed in the trough between the morning and mid-day dose (i.e. at 5 hours after intake of morning dose of trial medication). Secondary efficacy endpoints included changes in TED (seconds) after 6 weeks of treatment as well as the following (at 6 and 12 weeks): TAP, TLA, TST, exercise capacity (METs), angina attack frequency (according to patient diary), concomitant use of short-acting nitrates (according to patient diary), health-related quality of life scores using the Seattle Standard Questionnaire and the EQ-5D; the patient's perceived exertion level was recorded using the Borg scale.

### International observational analysis of evolution and outcomes of chronic stable angina: The multinational CLARIFY study [^1145BBRj]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Angina pectoris is a common manifestation of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and negatively affects quality of life. Lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, and coronary revascularization can improve symptoms. However, in most randomized trials exploring antianginal strategies or drugs in stable CAD, the burden of angina improved over time in the control group. Although this improvement could be a result of the optimization of medical treatments and cardiovascular risk factors during the trial, it could also reflect the natural history of the condition.

Angina pectoris is also associated with poor outcomes. However, antianginal treatments have not been proven to improve outcomes in chronic stable angina. Even β-blockers, largely used on the basis of a mortality reduction after myocardial infarction, have not been associated with improved outcomes in stable angina. Likewise, invasive management with a view to coronary revascularization does not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina or myocardial ischemia, although it improves symptoms.

In the era of effective antianginal treatments, evidence-based secondary prevention therapy, and widespread use of coronary revascularization, we sought to describe the prevalence and time course of angina in patients with stable CAD as well as the effect of changes in anginal status on outcomes.

### Efficacy of ranolazine in patients with chronic angina observations from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes) 36 trial [^111sk4pX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). High credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ranolazine in a larger and more diverse group of patients with angina than previously studied. Ranolazine is an antianginal shown to reduce angina and improve exercise performance in selected patients with early-positive exercise testing and those with frequent angina.

- **Methods**: We investigated the antianginal effects of ranolazine in the subgroup of patients with prior chronic angina (n = 3,565, 54%) enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes) 36 trial of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Follow-up was a median of 350 days.

- **Results**: Patients with prior angina received evidence-based therapy (95% aspirin, 78% statins, 89% beta-blockers, average 2.9 antianginal agents). The primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, re-ischemia) was less frequent with ranolazine (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.97; p = 0.017), due entirely to a significant reduction in re-ischemia (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.91; p = 0.002). Ranolazine also reduced worsening angina (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.00; p = 0.048) and intensification of antianginal therapy (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.92; p = 0.005). Exercise duration at 8 months was greater with ranolazine (514 s vs. 482 s, p = 0.002). Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction did not differ between treatment groups (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.16; p = 0.71).

### Metabolic manipulation in ischaemic heart disease, a novel approach to treatment [^117GW29f]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Antianginal drugs that exert their anti-ischaemic effects primarily by altering myocardial metabolism have recently attracted attention. They have the potential to relieve symptoms in patients with refractory angina who are already on "optimal" medical therapy and have disease that is not amenable to revascularization, making these drugs an attractive addition to therapy, particularly for the elderly population. In some cases, they may even be used as first-line treatment. These drugs increase glucose metabolism at the expense of free-fatty-acid metabolism, enhancing oxygen efficiency during myocardial ischaemia. Whilst they have been demonstrated to reduce ischaemia in several clinical trials, their use remains limited.

This review aims to draw attention to these "metabolic" antianginal drugs while surveying the evidence supporting their use and mode of action. Four metabolic antianginal drugs are reviewed: perhexiline, trimetazidine, ranolazine, and etomoxir. We also discuss the metabolic actions of glucose-insulin-potassium and beta-blockers and describe myocardial metabolism during normal and ischaemic conditions. The potential of these metabolic agents may extend beyond the treatment of ischaemia secondary to coronary artery disease. They offer significant promise for the treatment of symptoms occurring due to inoperable aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic heart failure.

### Nitrostat [^111iPgBx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used, as excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitrostat tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed.

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin; therefore, this drug should be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who are already hypotensive for any reason. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

Nitrate therapy may aggravate angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, are blunted.

In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to high doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. During temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have been reported, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence.

Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens incorporating a 10- to 12-hour nitrate-free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval.

### Pharmacological and emerging therapies in the treatment of chronic angina [^11713b2i]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic angina is a common manifestation of ischaemic heart disease. Medical treatments are the mainstay approach to reduce the occurrence of angina and improve patients' quality of life. This series paper focuses on commonly used standard treatments (e.g. nitrates, β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers), emerging anti-angina treatments (which are not available in all parts of the world), and experimental treatments. Although many emerging treatments are available, evidence is scarce about their ability to reduce angina and ischaemia.

### Effects of metabolic modulation by trimetazidine on left ventricular function and phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio in patients with heart failure [^117MSFk7]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The addition of trimetazidine to standard treatment has been shown to improve left ventricular (LV) function in patients with heart failure. The aim of this study was to non-invasively assess, by means of in vivo 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS), the effects of trimetazidine on the LV cardiac phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratio in patients with heart failure.

- **Methods and results**: Twelve heart failure patients were randomized in a double-blind, cross-over study to receive either placebo or trimetazidine (20 mg t.i.d.) for two periods of 90 days. At the end of each period, all patients underwent exercise testing, 2D echocardiography, and MRS. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ejection fraction (EF), maximal rate-pressure product, and metabolic equivalent system (METS) were evaluated. Relative concentrations of PCr and ATP were determined by cardiac 31P-MRS. On trimetazidine, the NYHA class decreased from 3.04 ± 0.26 to 2.45 ± 0.52 (P = 0.005), whereas EF (34 ± 10% to 39 ± 10%, P = 0.03) and METS (from 7.44 ± 1.84 to 8.78 ± 2.72, P = 0.03) increased. The mean cardiac PCr/ATP ratio was 1.35 ± 0.33 with placebo, but increased by 33% to 1.80 ± 0.50 (P = 0.03) with trimetazidine.

Trimetazidine improves functional class and LV function in patients with heart failure. These effects are associated with the observed trimetazidine-induced increase in the PCr/ATP ratio, indicating preservation of the myocardial high-energy phosphate levels.

### Trimetazidine alleviates postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and improves 96-hour survival in a ventricular fibrillation rat model [^116A9Tq4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The mechanism by which trimetazidine exerts its cardioprotective effect has been explored in numerous animal and clinical studies. The beneficial effect of trimetazidine is attributed to the regulation of cardiac energy metabolism. As a competitive fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, trimetazidine inhibits the enzymes of fatty acid β‐oxidation and stimulates total glucose utilization, including both glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Because the utilization of glucose oxidation is more efficient than fatty acid oxidation, the preserved myocardial high‐energy phosphate levels result in the improvement of left ventricular function. In this study, myocardial injury markers were significantly reduced and postresuscitation LVEF was significantly improved in the trimetazidine-treated animals. This was consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of trimetazidine on cardioprotection. Additionally, trimetazidine may protect against myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting oxidative damage and decreasing myocardial fibrosis. The finding that biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were markedly reduced after administration of trimetazidine was also in accordance with previous studies. The enhanced generation of ROS instigates a wide array of pathways that lead to ischemia reperfusion injury, including the regulation of inflammatory reactions. Trimetazidine reduces the generation of ROS by maintaining energy production with less oxygen consumption. However, the antioxidant mechanisms responsible for cardioprotection have not been fully elucidated.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117LYanu]. European Heart Journal (2014). High credibility.

For the analysis of the effects of PETN in patients with refractory angina despite background anti-anginal therapy, subjects reporting at least two angina pectoris attacks and taking two doses of short-acting nitrates per week and with a baseline total exercise duration (TED) ≤ 9 min were selected. A total of 120 patients, 55 on PETN and 65 on placebo, met these criteria. The demographic characteristics in this subpopulation were similar to those of the ITT population and not different between groups.

In this group of patients with distinct and clinically relevant symptoms of angina pectoris, the change in TED at 6 and 12 weeks was markedly larger in the PETN group than in the control group (P = 0.05 and P = 0.017). Similarly, changes in MET, TAP, TLA, and TST at 12 weeks in this group of symptomatic patients were markedly larger in the PETN group (P = 0.03, P = 0.05, P = 0.003, respectively).

Finally, the frequency of angina pectoris attacks decreased after both PETN and placebo (a decrease in the angina stability scale was observed in 24.5% of those randomized to PETN and in 12.7% of those randomized to placebo; change in the angina frequency scale — PETN: 21.4%; placebo: 15.7%). The use of short-acting nitrates decreased in both groups (PETN: −1.7 doses/week, median −2; placebo: −2.5 doses/week, median −2).

### Trimetazidine improves left ventricular function in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease: a double-blind placebo-controlled study [^114eEZvx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy have impaired myocardial glucose handling and distal distribution of coronary atherosclerosis. Trimetazidine, an anti-ischemic metabolic agent, improves myocardial glucose utilization through the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effect of trimetazidine on left ventricular function in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two patients (24 males and 8 females, mean (SE) age = 67 ± 6 years) with type 2 diabetes and ischemic cardiomyopathy were randomized to receive either trimetazidine (20 mg, t.d.s.) or placebo (t.d.s.) for six months in a randomized parallel study. Patients underwent an echocardiogram at baseline and after six months.

- **Results**: Demographic data were comparable between the two groups. After six months, baseline left ventricular end-diastolic diameters increased from 62.4 ± 1.7 to 63 ± 2.1 mm in the placebo group, while they decreased from 63.2 ± 2.1 to 58 ± 1.6 mm (p < 0.01 compared to baseline) in the trimetazidine group. Compared to baseline, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 5.4 ± 0.5% (p < 0.05) in the trimetazidine group while remaining unchanged in the placebo group at -2.4 ± 1.1% (NS, p < 0.01 between groups). A significant improvement in the wall motion score index and in the E/A wave ratio was detected in patients treated with trimetazidine, but not in those receiving a placebo.

- **Conclusion**: In diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease, trimetazidine added to standard medical therapy has a beneficial effect on left ventricular function.

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^11189iZx]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

- **Impaired coronary vasodilator capacity (reduced CFR)**: Bairey Merz et al. performed a randomized controlled trial of ranolazine in the WISE population. Notably, there was no net benefit effect on the INOCA population as a whole; however, in patients with reduced CFR (< 2.5), there was a suggestion of improved myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi) after established treatment. Lanza and Crea highlight that subjects with reduced CFR might preferentially be treated with drugs that reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, such as beta-blockers (BB), for example, nebivolol 1.25–10 mg daily. There is accumulating evidence that long-acting nitrates are ineffective or even detrimental in MVA. Lack of efficacy may relate to poor tolerability, steal syndromes through regions of adequately perfused myocardium, and/or related to the reduced responsiveness of nitrates within the coronary microcirculation. Furthermore, chronic therapy with nitrate may induce endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, predominantly via endothelin-dependent pathways.

- **Increased microvascular constriction**: (structurally increased microvascular resistance or functional propensity to microvascular spasm): Subjects with increased microvascular vasoconstriction may be treated with vasodilator therapies acting on the microcirculation. These include calcium channel blockers (CCB) — for example, amlodipine 2.5–10 mg daily — or nicorandil (e.g. 5–30 mg two times a day). Hyper-reactivity to constrictor stimuli resulting in propensity to microvascular spasm may be provoked by endothelial dysfunction.

### The value of routine non-invasive tests to predict clinical outcome in stable angina [^117Ga1s5]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic stable angina is a common condition; however, considerable differences exist in the likelihood of acute coronary events, such as CHD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and unstable angina, between individual patients. Effective risk prediction is necessary for optimum management. The aim of this study was to identify clinical features and non-invasive test parameters associated with high risk of these coronary events in stable angina and compose a clinically useful model to predict adverse outcomes in this population.

- **Methods**: Six hundred and eighty-two patients with stable angina and a positive exercise test (1mm ST depression) from the Total Ischaemic Burden European Trial (TIBET) study were studied. Resting ECG, exercise tolerance testing, and echocardiography were performed at baseline, off anti-anginal therapy. The patients were then randomized to treatment with atenolol, nifedipine, or a combination of both. Clinical follow-up continued for an average of 2 years (range 1–3 years).

- **Results and conclusions**: Prior MI or prior CABG were the clinical parameters associated with adverse outcomes in patients with stable angina and a positive exercise test. On the ECG, left ventricular hypertrophy was predictive, and on echocardiogram, increased left ventricular dimensions were predictive of adverse events. When combined with time to ischaemia on exercise testing in a simple clinically applicable table, these factors could be used to predict the 2-year probability of events for an individual patient.

### Trimetazidine as an adjunct to standard hydration reduces the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous cardiac intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112fibSg]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Trimetazidine (TMZ) is a cellular anti-ischemic agent that inhibits the production of oxygen-free radicals, reduces apoptosis, prevents mitochondrial swelling, enhances mitochondrial activity, and prevents cell lysis, thereby protecting cell functions. TMZ also improves the concentration of intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is essential for removing oxygen free radicals. Moreover, TMZ can reduce intracellular H+, Ca2+, and Na+ overload, while simultaneously increasing the utilization rate of lactic acid, decreasing cell ketogenesis, and improving lipid metabolism. TMZ reduces oxidative stress and cytolysis and improves renal function in renal ischemia or reperfusion injury.

The effectiveness of TMZ as a preventive agent against CI-AKI has been a subject of debate due to contradictory findings and limited evidence. A meta-analysis conducted by Sharp et al. on pharmacological interventions for CI-AKI prevention in high-risk adult patients undergoing coronary angiography revealed a decrease in the incidence of CI-AKI. However, it only included two studies with respect to TMZ. Additionally, Nadkarni et al. performed a meta-analysis to assess the role of TMZ in reducing the risk of CI-AKI in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite the observed decrease in the incidence of CI-AKI, only three studies were included.

Furthermore, a study conducted by Savaj et al. including 100 CKD patients with mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50.6 ± 7, receiving TMZ, 35 mg twice daily from 4 hours before to 2 hours after CAG showed a decrease in the incidence.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112V1i5Y]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In the trial by Tardif et al, patients were randomized to receive ivabradine or placebo in combination with atenolol 50 mg o.d. It needs to be emphasized that differences between designs and populations complicate any direct comparison between different trials. At 16 weeks, TED increased by 24.3 ± 65.3 s in the ivabradine group compared with 7.7 ± 63.8 s in the placebo group. Remarkably, in the present study, the difference in the increase in TED observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline exercise capacity < 9 min and anginal symptoms was as large as 32 s at 6 weeks, reaching 48 s in favor of PETN at 12 weeks.

Similarly, combination therapy with the metabolic agent ranolazine administered on top of atenolol (50 mg/day), amlodipine (5 mg/day), or diltiazem (180 mg/day) in patients with severe angina pectoris resulted in an improvement in TED. However, the changes in time to ST-segment depression were not significant. In contrast, therapy with different calcium-channel antagonists did not show benefit on TED when administered as an add-on to beta-blockers.

- **Limitations**: There are several limitations that need to be acknowledged. The study was designed as an international multicenter trial, and the specific settings in which organic nitrates are used might not be the same among countries. For instance, access to percutaneous revascularization varies significantly among countries due to differences in the availability of facilities and reimbursement policies. This is one of the possible explanations.

### Traditional Chinese herbal products for stable angina [^111GXPxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Stable angina pectoris is a common condition worldwide. Traditional Chinese herbal products (TCHP) are developed for treating stable angina pectoris in China.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of TCHP in patients with stable angina.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (1995 to June 2008), EMBASE (1995 to June 2008), the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1995 to June 2008), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP) (1994 to June 2008), and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1995 to June 2008). We handsearched the relevant Chinese journals and contacted researchers in the field and authors of studies evaluated in this review for more information. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing TCHP with placebo, various other TCHP preparations, or with other regimes commonly used currently in the treatment of stable angina.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Quality of studies was assessed independently by two authors. Data were extracted by one author and checked by the other.

- **Main results**: Three studies, each with a number of participants ranging from 60 to 80, and a total of 216 participants, were included in this review. The interventions used in the included studies were different from one another. One study compared TCHP with nitrates and was of good methodological quality, whereas the remaining two trials compared one preparation with another preparation.

### Hydralazine [^113A6hzF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The myocardial stimulation produced by hydralazine can cause anginal attacks and ECG changes indicative of myocardial ischemia. The drug has been implicated in the production of myocardial infarction. Therefore, it must be used with caution in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

The "hyperdynamic" circulation caused by hydralazine may accentuate specific cardiovascular inadequacies. For example, hydralazine may increase pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral valvular disease. The drug may reduce the pressor responses to epinephrine. Postural hypotension may result from hydralazine but is less common than with ganglionic blocking agents. It should be used with caution in patients with cerebral vascular accidents.

In hypertensive patients with normal kidneys treated with hydralazine, there is evidence of increased renal blood flow and maintenance of the glomerular filtration rate. In some instances where control values were below normal, improved renal function has been noted after administration of hydralazine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, hydralazine should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal damage.

Peripheral neuritis, evidenced by paresthesia, numbness, and tingling, has been observed. Published evidence suggests an antipyridoxine effect, indicating that pyridoxine should be added to the regimen if symptoms develop.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be informed of possible side effects and advised to take the medication regularly and continuously as directed.

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood counts and anti

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of trimetazidine in patients with angina pectoris having been treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (ATPCI study): Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics [^116cVgum]. American Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

About 30% of angina patients have persisting symptoms despite successful revascularization and antianginal therapy. Moreover, in stable patients, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve survival compared with medical therapy alone. Trimetazidine, an antianginal agent devoid of hemodynamic effect, may help reduce symptoms and improve outcomes after PCI. The ATPCI study investigates the efficacy and safety of adding trimetazidine to the standard-of-care in angina patients who had a recent PCI.

- **Methods**: ATPCI is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, event-driven study in patients with coronary artery disease who have undergone PCI due to stable angina (elective PCI) or unstable angina/NSTEMI (urgent PCI). After PCI, patients were randomized to receive trimetazidine (35 mg bid) or placebo on top of standard-of-care, including event prevention drugs and antianginal treatment. Patients will be followed for 2 to 4 years. The primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of cardiac death, hospitalization for a cardiac event, and recurrence or persistence of angina. Safety events related to trimetazidine use will be monitored.

- **Results**: Recruitment lasted from September 2014 to June 2016. A total of 6,007 patients were enrolled (58% after elective PCI and 42% after urgent PCI). The mean age was 61 years; 77% were males. The median durations of coronary artery disease were 1 month and 5 months for urgent and elective PCI, respectively. Almost all patients received drugs for event prevention and antianginal therapy at baseline.

European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

- **Figure 4**: In the subgroup of patients with refractory angina pectoris, the change in TAP at 12 weeks was markedly larger in the pentaerithrityl tetranitrate group than in the control group. The changes in TST tended to be larger in the pentaerithrityl tetranitrate group, showing ANCOVA means with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Figure 5**: In the subgroup of patients with distinct and clinically relevant symptoms of angina pectoris, the changes in TLA and MET at 6 and 12 weeks were markedly larger in the pentaerithrityl tetranitrate group compared to the control group, as demonstrated by ANCOVA means with 95% confidence intervals.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^111Davs2]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for heart failure, the ESC 2021 guidelines specifically recommend considering the initiation of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and death. This is particularly advised for self-identified black patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% or with an LVEF < 45% combined with a dilated left ventricle in NYHA class III-IV. This recommendation applies even when patients are already under treatment with an ACE inhibitor (or ARNi), a β-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^113ZdeaB]. Heart (2020). High credibility.

Although NICE guidelines suggest using either beta-blockers (BB) or calcium channel blockers (CCB) as first-line therapy, we support BB initially because they are generally better tolerated. Long-term evidence of efficacy between BB and CCB is limited, and there are no proven safety concerns favoring one over the other. Dihydropyridine calcium may be added to BB if blood pressure permits. NICE CG126 states third-line options can either be added or substituted if BB/CCB is not tolerated.

These third-line medications include nitrates (e.g. isosorbide mononitrate 30–120 mg controlled release), ivabradine (e.g. 2.5–7.5 mg twice a day), nicorandil (5–30 mg twice a day), or ranolazine (375–500 mg twice a day). These can be used in combination with BB and/or CCB depending on comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference, and drug costs. The RIVER-PCI study found that anti-ischaemic pharmacotherapy with ranolazine did not improve the prognosis of patients with incomplete revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention. This serves as a reminder that alleviation of ischemia may not improve 'hard' endpoints in patients with chronic coronary syndromes but helps us focus on improving their quality of life.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of complete angina relief in symptomatic patients in the ISCHEMIA trial [^1159XdDo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) frequently comes to clinical attention following the development of stable angina. Stable angina is a common condition affecting approximately 4% of adults over 20, which amounts to almost 11 million adults in the United States. The prevalence increases with age, affecting 10% of men aged between 60 and 79 and 10% of women over the age of 80. Medical management of CCD involves lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to reduce the risk of death and acute ischemic events, along with antianginal therapy for symptomatic relief.

Both the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) and ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trials demonstrated that in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, the addition of revascularization to optimal medical therapy (OMT) for CCD significantly improves anginal symptoms and quality of life compared with a conservative treatment approach with OMT alone. Nevertheless, angina persists in 20% to 40% of patients with CCD after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in 20% to 30% in the first postoperative year after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Angina after PCI is associated with long-term anxiety, depression, impaired physical function, and reduced quality of life.

Although data examining patient goals and expectations regarding the treatment of stable angina are scarce, a Swedish survey of patients with stable angina found that 42% desired treatment to provide complete angina relief.

### International observational analysis of evolution and outcomes of chronic stable angina: The multinational CLARIFY study [^112LuJiM]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

The presence of angina was recorded at baseline and yearly visits and was defined as chest pain during physical exertion or equivalent symptoms necessitating occasional or permanent use of antianginal drugs, in the judgment of the investigator. We aimed to describe the natural history of angina pectoris. Patients were categorized according to the presence of angina at baseline. Yearly changes in angina status are presented up to the first myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, given that these events can result in complications that may affect anginal status. Hence, patients were censored after the occurrence of myocardial infarction or revascularization. Conversely, data from patients experiencing unstable angina that did not lead to coronary revascularization or myocardial infarction were analyzed.

To assess the consequences of angina evolution on cardiovascular outcomes, patients were categorized into four groups according to the evolution of angina between baseline and one year: persistence, resolution, occurrence (if angina was absent at baseline and appeared at one year), or absence of angina (if angina was absent at baseline and one year).

In patients with regression of angina (if angina was present at year N and absent at year N+1), control of angina was ascribed to coronary revascularization if the latter had been performed during the previous year as an elective procedure or for unstable angina. If no coronary revascularization had been performed, control of angina was ascribed to medical therapy if antianginal treatments, including β-blockers, ivabradine, and calcium channel blockers, were administered.

### Evaluation of trimetazidine in angina pectoris by echocardiography and radionuclide angiography: A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^1176Dib2]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of the metabolic agent trimetazidine (TMZ) as monotherapy in the treatment of stable angina pectoris from echocardiography and radionuclide angiography data.

- **Hypothesis**: Treatment with TMZ proved to be as effective as other first-line antianginal agents for coronary patients, and it provided additional efficacy in combination with hemodynamic agents.

- **Methods**: A search of the literature published between 1965 and 2008 was performed on the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Only randomized, controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Patients had to be treated for at least two weeks with data on the following four parameters at baseline and at the end of the treatment period: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), and wall motion score index (WMSI). The quality of the trials was assessed by the Jadad score.

- **Results**: Eleven clinical studies meeting our criteria were analyzed. Results showed that TMZ significantly improved LVEF, with a mean increase of 6.88% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.50–8.25), and significantly reduced LVESV by 11.58 mL (95% CI: 5.79–17.37) and WMSI by 0.23 (95% CI: 0.07–0.38). Changes in LVEDV were variable. In both the long term and the short term, TMZ can improve LV function. The efficacy was unchanged in patients with diabetes mellitus.

- **Conclusions**: This meta-analysis confirmed the efficacy of TMZ monotherapy in improving LV function compared with placebo.

### A randomized clinical trial of trimetazidine, a partial free fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, in patients with heart failure [^113fUTg5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). High credibility.

This study sought to assess whether the long-term addition of trimetazidine to conventional treatment could improve functional class, exercise tolerance, and left ventricular function in patients with heart failure (HF).

Previous small studies have shown that trimetazidine may be beneficial in terms of left ventricular function preservation and control of symptoms in patients with post-ischemic HF.

Fifty-five patients with HF were randomly allocated in an open-label fashion to either conventional therapy plus trimetazidine (20 mg three times daily) (28 patients) or conventional therapy alone (27 patients). The mean follow-up was 13 ± 3 months. At study entry and at follow-up, all patients underwent exercise testing and two-dimensional echocardiography. Among other measurements, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and ejection fraction (EF) were evaluated.

In the trimetazidine group, NYHA functional class significantly improved compared with the conventional therapy group (p < 0.0001). Treatment with trimetazidine significantly decreased left ventricular end-systolic volume (from 98 ± 36 mL to 81 ± 27 ml, p = 0.04) and increased EF from 36 ± 7% to 43 ± 10% (p = 0.002). On the contrary, in the conventional therapy group, both left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased from 142 ± 43 mL to 156 ± 63 mL (p = 0.2) and from 86 ± 34 mL to 104 ± 52 mL (p = 0.1), respectively; accordingly, EF significantly decreased from 38 ± 7% to 34 ± 7% (p = 0.02).

In conclusion, long-term trimetazidine addition to conventional treatment shows significant benefits in improving NYHA functional class and EF in patients with HF, with notable reductions in left ventricular end-systolic volume, indicating its potential role in HF management.
