## Question

What is the best medication to be used for a fungal otitis externa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best medication for fungal otitis externa (otomycosis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing noninvasive otomycosis from invasive disease. Then, I should verify the universal need for aural toilet and canal access. Next, I will review first-line topical antifungal options and their comparative evidence. After that, I need to check tympanic membrane status to choose non-ototoxic agents when indicated. I will then consider special populations and when to add systemic therapy. Finally, I should outline duration, follow-up, and what to do if treatment fails, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and available trials.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and disease category, because management hinges on whether this is noninvasive otomycosis versus invasive or necrotizing disease. Noninvasive otomycosis typically presents with pruritus, thick otorrhea that may be white, gray, bluish-green, yellow, or black, and on otoscopy Candida often shows white debris with hyphae while Aspergillus niger can appear as a moist white plug dotted with black specks, whereas invasive disease presents with severe otalgia out of proportion to exam, granulation tissue, cranial neuropathies, or systemic toxicity and mandates urgent imaging and systemic therapy rather than topical-only care [^a458e21e] [^abbe2e9c].

> Wait, let me verify the foundational principle before choosing any medication: thorough mechanical debridement and cleansing of the external auditory canal is essential in all cases of otomycosis, as antifungal drops cannot penetrate fungal mats and debris without access. Guidelines emphasize cleansing followed by topical therapy, and this step is repeatedly linked to better outcomes and is non-negotiable in best practice [^ea197828] [^c46d1e72] [^aac032a5].

> Next, I should review first-line topical antifungal options and the strength of evidence. Topical azoles such as clotrimazole, miconazole, bifonazole, ciclopirox, and tolnaftate are appropriate choices, with clotrimazole 1% solution or cream commonly used and supported by guideline recommendations for noninvasive disease. However, I need to be cautious: the Cochrane review of topical azoles found no placebo-controlled trials and very low certainty evidence for differences between azoles, so while clinical experience supports azoles, head-to-head superiority is uncertain and selection often defaults to availability, tolerability, and cost [^ea197828] [^b1b439af] [^b1b439af].

> Hold on, I should verify tympanic membrane status before finalizing the agent, because a perforated tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tube changes the safety calculus. In patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane, I need to choose a non-ototoxic topical preparation; azoles are generally considered non-ototoxic and are preferred in this scenario, whereas acidic preparations and some antiseptics carry more risk and should be avoided if the membrane is not intact, aligning with AAO-HNS guidance and otic safety considerations [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0] [^b1b439af].

> I will now examine special populations and when to escalate beyond topical therapy. In immunocompromised patients, those with diabetes, or when there is concern for invasive or necrotizing disease, systemic antifungal therapy is indicated, typically with voriconazole for Aspergillus or fluconazole for Candida, often combined with surgical debridement and guided by imaging and culture results. Case series and guidelines support prolonged systemic therapy in fungal malignant otitis externa, with mean durations around 2 months in contemporary series and strong recommendations for systemic voriconazole in tissue-invasive Aspergillus ear disease [^ea197828] [^169165e9] [^31a17427].

> Let me think about duration and follow-up, and I should double-check that I am not overextending therapy. For uncomplicated noninvasive otomycosis, 7 to 14 days of topical therapy is typical, with reassessment at 48 to 72 hours to ensure clinical improvement; if there is no improvement, I need to reconsider adherence, delivery, the diagnosis, or the presence of contact dermatitis from drops, and if symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks, I should re-evaluate for resistant organisms, biofilm, or invasive disease and consider culture or imaging as indicated [^7cd32554] [^7013c02a] [^ea24514f].

> But wait, what if the patient has been on topical antibiotics and is not improving? I should confirm whether fungal superinfection is likely, because prolonged antibacterial drops can promote fungal overgrowth; in such cases, stopping antibacterial drops and switching to antifungal therapy, along with debridement, is appropriate, and this is explicitly cautioned in AOE guidelines and supported by clinical reviews of otomycosis [^a458e21e] [^1e9c0ecf].

> I should also review practical choices and safety nuances. Clotrimazole 1% solution or cream applied two to three times daily is a reasonable default in many settings, with miconazole or ciclopirox as alternatives; if irritation occurs, switching formulation or agent is sensible, and in patients with suspected Aspergillus, I need to remember that some isolates may be less responsive to clotrimazole, prompting consideration of alternative azoles or systemic therapy if disease is refractory or invasive, though this is based on limited comparative data and clinical judgment rather than high-certainty trials [^b1b439af] [^fb100fe7].

> Putting this together, my best medication recommendation for noninvasive fungal otitis externa is a topical azole antifungal such as clotrimazole 1% solution or cream, used after thorough aural toilet and continued for 7 to 14 days with reassessment at 48 to 72 hours, ensuring the tympanic membrane is intact or selecting a non-ototoxic azole if it is not. For invasive disease or high-risk hosts, add systemic antifungal therapy — voriconazole for Aspergillus or fluconazole for Candida — plus surgical debridement and imaging as indicated, recognizing that the evidence base for topical comparisons is limited and clinical response guides ongoing management [^ea197828] [^a458e21e] [^fb100fe7] [^169165e9].

---

The best medication for fungal otitis externa is a **topical azole antifungal** (clotrimazole 1% or miconazole 2%) applied after thorough aural toilet, with **clotrimazole 1% preferred** for its efficacy, safety, and availability [^ea197828] [^fb100fe7]. Use **non-ototoxic preparations** if the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0]. Reserve systemic antifungals (e.g. voriconazole) for invasive or refractory cases, especially in immunocompromised or diabetic patients [^ea197828] [^169165e9]. Treatment duration is typically 7–14 days, with reassessment at 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, confirm the diagnosis, reassess adherence, and consider alternative therapy or culture [^7013c02a] [^ea24514f].

---

## Topical antifungal medications

Topical antifungals are **first-line therapy** for fungal otitis externa because they achieve high local concentrations with minimal systemic absorption [^ea197828]. The most commonly used agents are azole antifungals, including clotrimazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole [^b1b439af].

| **Medication** | **Concentration** | **Formulation** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clotrimazole | 1% | Solution or cream | - Highly effective <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Preferred first-line agent [^ea197828] [^fb100fe7] |
| Miconazole | 2% | Solution or cream | - Effective alternative <br/> - Particularly useful for Candida species [^b1b439af] |
| Ketoconazole | 2% | Solution or cream | - Effective <br/> - Higher recurrence rate compared to clotrimazole [^6e5faa96] |

---

Clotrimazole 1% is the **preferred first-line agent** due to its broad antifungal activity, favorable safety profile, and widespread availability [^ea197828]. It is typically administered as 2–3 drops twice daily for 7–14 days.

---

## Adjunctive measures

Thorough **aural toilet (debridement)** is essential to remove fungal debris and improve medication penetration [^ea197828]. Acidifying agents such as acetic acid 2% may be used as adjuncts to restore the ear canal's natural acidic environment and inhibit fungal growth [^87acaa1b].

---

## Systemic antifungal therapy

Systemic antifungals are reserved for **severe, invasive, or refractory cases**, particularly in immunocompromised or diabetic patients [^ea197828]. Voriconazole is the **preferred agent** for invasive Aspergillus infections, while fluconazole is used for Candida species [^ea197828] [^b1b439af].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Topical antifungal therapy achieves high clinical cure rates (80–90%) in noninvasive fungal otitis externa [^notfound]. Recurrence is common, particularly in patients with chronic moisture exposure, immunocompromised states, or inadequate debridement [^6e5faa96].

---

## Safety considerations

Topical antifungals are generally safe, with minimal systemic absorption. Local irritation, burning, or pruritus may occur but are usually mild and self-limited. Non-ototoxic preparations should be used in patients with perforated tympanic membranes or tympanostomy tubes [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus recommend topical azole antifungals, particularly clotrimazole 1%, as **first-line therapy** for fungal otitis externa [^ea197828]. Systemic antifungals are reserved for severe or refractory cases, and adjunctive measures such as aural toilet and acidifying agents are emphasized [^ea197828].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Topical clotrimazole 1% solution or cream, 2–3 drops twice daily for 7–14 days [^ea197828].
- **Alternative therapy**: Miconazole 2% solution or cream if clotrimazole is unavailable or not tolerated [^b1b439af].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Thorough aural toilet and acidifying agents (e.g. acetic acid 2%) [^ea197828] [^87acaa1b].
- **Systemic therapy**: Reserved for severe, invasive, or refractory cases; voriconazole for Aspergillus, fluconazole for Candida [^ea197828] [^b1b439af].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess at 48–72 hours; if no improvement, confirm diagnosis, reassess adherence, and consider alternative therapy or culture [^7013c02a] [^ea24514f].

---

Topical azole antifungals, particularly clotrimazole 1%, are the **best medications** for fungal otitis externa, with systemic antifungals reserved for severe or refractory cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1e9c0ecf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^87acaa1b]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Otitis externa: review and clinical update [^9809f6b7]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

Aspergillus ear infections — treatment differs by disease type: noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa, also called otomycosis, is treated by thorough mechanical cleansing of the external auditory canal followed by topical antifungals or boric acid (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), whereas we recommend that clinicians treat IA of the ear with a prolonged course of systemic voriconazole, usually combined with surgery (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Tissue-invasive Aspergillus otitis should be treated with prolonged systemic voriconazole, often necessitating surgical debridement, and in the absence of evidence of tissue invasion, we do not recommend that colonization should be treated.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Malignant otitis externa [^bf1aeca0]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant otitis externa is an invasive, potentially life-threatening infection of the external ear and skull base that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. It affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those who have diabetes. The most common causative agent remains Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Definitive diagnosis is frequently elusive, requiring a high index of suspicion, various laboratory and imaging modalities, and histologic exclusion of malignancy. Long-term oral antipseudomonal agents have proven effective; however, pseudomonal antibiotic resistance patterns have emerged and therefore other bacterial and fungal causative agents must be considered. Adjunctive therapies, such as aggressive debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, are reserved for extensive or unresponsive cases.

### Fungal infections of the external auditory canal and emerging pathogens [^6720a899]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Fungal infections of the external auditory canal can range from common (otomycosis) to life threatening (necrotizing otitis externa). Proper identification of fungal pathogens is necessary to guide appropriate therapy, and a high index of suspicion for fungal causes of ear canal disease is critical. Fungal pathogens may be an especially important cause of ear canal disease in certain populations, including patients with diabetes, patients recently treated with antibiotics, and immunosuppressed patients. Opportunistic fungal infections of the ear canal are an emerging concern.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^a458e21e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Otomycosis (fungal otitis externa) — prevalence, features, and management: Otomycosis, or fungal infection of the external ear canal, is a relatively common diagnosis and accounts for about 10% of AOE cases, with predisposing factors including moisture, absence of cerumen, alkaline pH, prior topical antibiotic or steroid use, chronic otitis media, hearing aid use, and immunocompromised states. Symptoms include pruritus and thick otorrhea that may be black, gray, bluish green, yellow, or white; Candida otitis externa generally results in white debris sprouting hyphae and Aspergillus niger usually appears as a moist white plug dotted with black debris ("wet newspaper"). Fungal otitis externa should also be suspected if a patient fails to respond to initial topical therapy, management may include debridement plus topical antifungal therapy, rarely systemic antifungal therapy, or both, and topical antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in managing otomycosis because it is ineffective and may promote further fungal overgrowth.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^59d21c16]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa:

- **Definition**: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- **Pathophysiology**: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

### Otomycosis: diagnosis and treatment [^b1b439af]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Aspergillus and Candida spp are the most frequently isolated fungi in patients with otomycosis. The diagnosis of otitis externa relies on the patient's history, otoscopic examination under microscopic control, and imaging studies. Direct preparation of the specimens, particularly with optical brighteners, mycologic culture, and histologic examination, is very important and strongly recommended for the correct diagnosis. Patients with noninvasive fungal otitis externa should be treated with intense débridement and cleansing, and topical antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, bifonazole, ciclopiroxolamine, and tolnaftate, are potentially safe choices for the treatment of otomycosis, especially in patients with a perforated eardrum. The oral triazole drugs, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole are effective against Candida and Aspergillus, with good penetration of bone and the central nervous system. These drugs are essential in the treatment of patients with malignant fungal otitis externa complicated by mastoiditis and meningitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^0bb48747]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — classification of evidence-based statements explains that guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, to minimize harm, and to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, with an evidence-based approach requiring that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined; evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm, and the definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in Tables 3 and 4; guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion, and less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than for a "recommendation", with "Options" offering the most opportunity for practice variability; values applied by the panel sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy and aimed to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process.

### Malignant otitis externa: a novel stratification protocol for predicting treatment outcomes [^6cb02648]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

1) Stratify malignant otitis externa into severe and nonsevere disease categories. 2) Predict treatment courses and outcomes based on this stratification.

Setting

Tertiary center.

Patients

Retrospective review 2004 to 2014; 28 patients. Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis by senior authors, radiographic evidence of disease, admission for intravenous antibiotics/debridement, minimum 1 year of follow-up.

Interventions

Severe group stratification if two or more of the following: cranial nerve VII palsy, fungal positive culture, relapse, surgery performed, major radiographic findings. All other patients stratified to nonsevere group.

Main Outcome Measures

Cure, alive/refractory disease, death by disease, death by other cause. Secondary measures are antibiotic duration and number of disease-related admissions.

Results

Forty-three percent (12 of 28) and 57% (16 of 28) of patients stratified into the severe and nonsevere groups. The severe group had significantly more adverse disease-specific outcomes than the nonsevere group (7 of 12 versus 0 of 16; p = 0.002). Disease-specific mortality was 42% and 0% in the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. The severe group had longer antibiotic courses (12.8 versus 6.9 wk; p = 0.01) and more disease-related admissions/relapses (1.6 versus 1, p < 0.001). Only four of 12 severe group patients achieved cure. All but two nonsevere patients achieved cure, with those two dying of other causes.

Conclusion

A subgroup of malignant otitis externa may exist that is not as susceptible to parenteral antibiotics and local debridement. A combination of clinical and radiographic findings may be useful for stratifying patients into severe/nonsevere categories. Patients with severe disease may be more likely to die of their disease and have worse treatment courses such that additional surgical intervention may be indicated.

### The role of surgery in necrotizing otitis externa [^ed0cbe31]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2017). Low credibility.

This retrospective case review describes a subset of 5 patients with necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) with a refractory disease course who underwent surgery as part of their management plan between 2008 and 2013. Surgery promoted the cure of 4 of the 5 patients, and a fungal pathogen was recovered in 4 of 5 surgical samples. We conclude that surgery may be a necessary diagnostic and treatment adjunct in selective cases of NOE, especially in patients with a refractory disease course or with a suspected fungal etiology.

### Fungal malignant otitis externa: pitfalls, diagnosis, and treatment [^a9e21612]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Oral voriconazole is a viable alternative modality treatment to traditionally used intravenous vancomycin in the treatment of malignant otitis externa (MOE).

Background

The incidence of MOE is on the rise, more so in Saudi Arabia where diabetes mellitus is endemic. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common offending organism, we are observing an increasing number of fungal MOE, in particular, Aspergillus species. The clinical findings in these patients can be quite different from those of the classic gram-negative bacteria.

Methods

Chart review of patients with a diagnosis of MOE who underwent oral voriconazole treatment.

Results

Three cases of Aspergillus MOE are reported in detail, pointing the pitfalls in clinical findings, diagnosis, and management of this entity.

Conclusion

Oral voriconazole proved to be an excellent alternative modality treatment in this population of patients with MOE.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa executive summary [^d4b3e506]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

Acute otitis externa — antimicrobial treatment emphasizes topical therapy and discourages routine systemic antibiotics. Topical antimicrobials are beneficial for AOE, but oral antibiotics have limited utility, yet about 20% to 40% of patients with AOE receive oral antibiotics, with or without topical therapy, without clinical benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^029d902f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — recommendation strength categories and clinician implications are defined as follows: A strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present; a recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences; an option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role; and no recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms and clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making while remaining alert to new published evidence, with patient preference having a substantial influencing role.

### Fungal otitis externa as a cause of tympanic membrane perforation: a case series [^1be267ac]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a series of 11 patients — 8 men and 3 women, aged 18 to 70 years (mean: 46.0) — who had fungal otitis externa that had been complicated by a tympanic membrane perforation. These patients had been referred to us for evaluation of chronic, mostly treatment-refractory otitis externa, which had manifested as otorrhea, otalgia, and/or pruritus. Seven of the 11 patients had no history of ear problems prior to their current condition. Five patients had been referred to us by a primary care physician and 4 by an otolaryngologist; the other 2 patients were self-referred. All patients were treated with a thorough debridement of the ear and one of two antifungal medication regimens. Eight of the 11 patients experienced a complete resolution of signs and symptoms, including closure of the tympanic membrane perforation. The other 3 patients underwent either a tympanoplasty (n = 2) or a fat-graft myringotomy (n = 1) because the perforation did not close within a reasonable amount of time. This series demonstrates that the nonspecific signs and symptoms of fungal otitis externa can make diagnosis difficult for both primary care physicians and general otolaryngologists. This study also demonstrates that most cases of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to fungal otitis externa will resolve with cleaning of the ear and proper medical treatment. Therefore, most patients with this condition will not require surgery.

### Fungal necrotizing otitis externa: clinical and therapeutic features [^169165e9]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To describe the clinical and therapeutic features of fungal necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) as well as to identify the predictive factors of complications. Materials and Methods: This retrospective and monocentric study included 15 cases of fungal NOE treated in our ENT department between 2006 and 2024. Clinical, biological, microbiological, and imaging data were collected and evaluated. Results: We included 15 patients diagnosed with fungal NOE based on positive microbiological cultures. The mean age was 67.6 years. All patients had diabetes. Otalgia was the most common symptom. Complications were noted in 80% of the cases. Facial nerve palsy occurred in 5 cases (33.3%). Computed tomography imaging revealed extension to the temporomandibular joint (46.7%), middle ear involvement (60%), vascular thrombosis (26.6%), intracranial extension (13.3%), and soft tissue complications (33.3%). The identified fungi were Candida spp. (26.7%) and Aspergillus spp. (73.3%). All patients received antifungal treatment. The mean total duration (intravenous + oral) of antifungal treatment was 2 months. Clinical improvement was observed in all cases, without recurrence cases after a median follow-up of 6 months. Older age and delay before consultation were significantly associated with soft tissue extension. Immunodeficiency and delay before consultation were significantly correlated with vascular thrombosis. Conclusions: Fungal NOE is a rare but serious condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Early identification and appropriate antifungal treatment are crucial to prevent complications and achieve favorable outcomes.

### Topical azole treatments for otomycosis [^fb100fe7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the outer ear, which may be treated with topical antifungal medications. There are many types, with compounds belonging to the azole group ('azoles') being among the most widely used.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical azole treatments for otomycosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search date was 11 November 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with otomycosis comparing any topical azole antifungal with: placebo, no treatment, another type of topical azole or the same type of azole but applied in different forms. A minimum follow-up of two weeks was required.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) clinical resolution as measured by the proportion of participants with complete resolution at between two and four weeks after treatment (however defined by the authors of the studies) and 2) significant adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 3) mycological resolution and 4) other less serious adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included four studies with 559 participants from Spain, Mexico and India. Three studies included children and adults; one included only adults. The duration of symptoms was not always explicitly stated. Mycological resolution results were only reported in one study. The studies assessed two comparisons: one type of topical azole versus another and the same azole but administered in different forms (cream versus solution). A. Topical azoles versus placebo None of the studies assessed this comparison. B. Topical azoles versus no treatment None of the studies assessed this comparison. C. One type of topical azole versus another type of topical azole i) Clotrimazole versus other types of azoles (eberconazole, fluconazole, miconazole) Three studies examined clotrimazole versus other types of azoles. The evidence is very uncertain about the difference between clotrimazole and other types of azole in achieving complete clinical resolution at four weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07; 3 studies; 439 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The anticipated absolute effects are 668 per 1000 for clotrimazole versus 835 per 1000 for other azoles. One study planned a safety analysis and reported no significant adverse events in either group. The evidence is therefore very uncertain about any differences between clotrimazole and other types of azole (no events in either group; 1 study; 174 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Clotrimazole may result in little or no difference in mycological resolution at two weeks follow-up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06; 1 study; 174 participants; low-certainty evidence) or in other (less serious) adverse events at two weeks follow-up (36 per 1000, compared to 45 per 1000, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.41; 1 study; 174 participants; very low-certainty evidence). ii) Bifonazole cream versus bifonazole solution One study compared bifonazole 1% cream with solution. Bifonazole cream may have little or no effect on clinical resolution at two weeks follow-up when compared to solution, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.57; 1 study; 40 ears; very low-certainty evidence). Bifonazole cream may achieve less mycological resolution compared to solution at two weeks after the end of therapy, but the evidence for this is also very uncertain (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96; 1 study; 40 ears; very low-certainty evidence). Five out of 35 patients sustained severe itching and burning from the bifonazole solution but none with the bifonazole cream (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies that evaluated topical azoles compared to placebo or no treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of clotrimazole on clinical resolution of otomycosis, on significant adverse events or other (non-serious) adverse events when compared with other topical azoles (eberconazole, fluconazole, miconazole). There may be little or no difference between clotrimazole and other azoles in terms of mycological resolution. It may be difficult to generalise these results because the range of ethnic backgrounds of the participants in the studies is limited.

### An overview of acute otitis externa [^4dc197c2]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa, cellulitis of the external auditory canal, is most frequently due to bacteria. Patients may present with otalgia, aural fullness, hearing loss, and otorrhea. Its diagnosis is a clinical one. Treatment is focused on analgesia, treating the underlying infection and preventing recurrence.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^a65f1e62]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

Diabetes or immunocompromised state — special considerations in AOE: Patients with diabetes, an immunocompromised state, or both require special consideration because they are susceptible to otomycosis and necrotizing otitis externa, which may present similar to AOE but require different management, and they are more likely to require systemic antibiotics often in addition to topical therapy and should not have their ear canals irrigated to remove debris, since it may predispose to necrotizing otitis externa.

Acute otitis externa — microbiology in North America is predominantly bacterial, most commonly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with other organisms rarely accounting for cases. Nearly all (98%) AOE in North America is bacterial. The most common pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%-60% prevalence) and Staphylococcus aureus (10%-70% prevalence), often polymicrobial. Other pathogens are principally gram-negative organisms (other than P aeruginosa), any of which causes no more than 2% to 3% of cases in large clinical series. Fungal involvement is distinctly uncommon in North America but may be more frequent elsewhere.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^cb484376]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evaluation of nonresponse and contact sensitivity: Alternative causes of ear pain and otorrhea should be considered if treatment fails, with specialist referral uncommon (3%) when AOE is appropriately managed; culture of the ear canal can identify fungi, resistant bacteria, or unusual causes needing targeted therapy. Fungi may act as co-pathogens and overgrow after topical antibacterials. Allergic contact dermatitis from prolonged antimicrobial otic drops can cause refractory AOE, with sensitization developing over 10 to 14 days and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions leading to erythema, pruritus, canal edema, and persistent otorrhea. Neomycin-containing eardrops commonly cause contact sensitivity with a 13% to 30% prevalence on patch testing in chronic otitis externa, and certain preservatives/vehicles have at least a 1% incidence of contact sensitivity. Allergic contact sensitivity may also arise from silicone ear plugs or hearing aid molds containing silicone or methyl-methacrylate, and patch testing to an appropriate antigen panel is useful to identify contributing agents.

4, 25 as a means of monitoring response to treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can also be used to monitor therapeutic response. 25 The excellent antipseudomonal activity of the fluoroquinolones has generally made them the treatment of choice for necrotizing otitis externa, although a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic and aminoglycoside is also effective. 26 In severe cases, a prolonged course of parenteral antibiotics may be needed, but the excellent gastrointestinal absorption of the fluoroquinolones allows milder infections to be treated with a two-week course of oral therapy. Treatment should also include surgical debridement of any granulation or osteitic bone. 4, 7, 25 Thus, an otolaryngologist should usually be involved early in the course, especially if the patient does not respond quickly to appropriate treatment. Because the infection can persist asymptomatically, the patient should be reevaluated at the end of the course of treatment.

At this time any further cleansing can be performed as needed. If the infection is not resolving, over-the-counter clotrimazole 1 percent solution, which also has some antibacterial activity, can be used. In vitro studies show that topical solutions of thimerosal and M-cresyl acetate are more effective agents but are messier. 11 If the tympanic membrane is perforated, tolnaftate 1 percent solution should be used in order to prevent ototoxicity. 11 All of these topical agents are typically used at a dosage of three or four drops twice daily for seven days. Aspergillus infections may be resistant to clotrimazole and may require the use of oral itraconazole.
6. The most important treatment is identifying and removing the irritant or allergen. Topical steroids are beneficial, including a cream for the pinna when it is involved.

An acidifying agent, usually Burow's otic solution with 2 percent acetic acid, is often added to prevent secondary infections, reacidify the skin, dry weeping lesions and remove crusts. Three to five days of use, three or four times daily, is usually sufficient for topical therapy. Systemic steroids and antihistamines may be needed for severe allergic reactions.

### Systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa [^7556189b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of topical antimicrobials for acute otitis externa.

Study Design

Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials with parallel groups permitting one or more of the following comparisons: antimicrobial vs placebo, antiseptic vs antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic vs nonquinolone antibiotic, steroid-antimicrobial vs antimicrobial, or antimicrobial-steroid vs steroid.

Results

Twenty trials met inclusion criteria and 18 had data suitable for pooling. Topical antimicrobials increased absolute clinical cure rates over placebo by 46% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29% to 63%) and bacteriologic cure rates by 61% (95% CI, 46% to 76%). No significant differences were noted in clinical cure rates for other comparisons, except that steroid alone increased cure rates by 20% compared with steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI, 3% to 38%). Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared with nonquinolone antibiotics (95% CI, 1% to 16%), but had statistically equivalent rates of clinical cure and adverse events.

Conclusion

Topical antimicrobial is highly effective for acute otitis externa with clinical cure rates of 65% to 80% within 10 days of therapy. Minor differences were noted in comparative efficacy, but broad confidence limits containing small effect sizes make these of questionable clinical significance.

Significance

Summary estimates from the 13 meta-analyses can be used to facilitate evidence-based management recommendations and clinical practice guideline development.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^872afadc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Population

Included in the study were patients older than 6 months with AOE of less than 21 days' duration in at least 1 ear, who presented with otorrhea, moderate or severe otalgia, and edema with a Brighton grading of II or III. The Brighton grading system is an algorithm to grade the severity of otitis externa, in which grade II corresponds to the presence of debris in the ear canal and tympanic membrane often obscured by debris and grade III corresponds to a tympanic membrane obscured by edematous ear canal but without systemic illness.

Exclusion criteria included a previous episode of AOE within 4 weeks or more than 1 episode of AOE within 6 months prior to enrollment; existing tympanic membrane perforation; current diagnosis of diabetes, otitis media, or malignant otitis externa; suspected viral or fungal ear infection; unknown or suspected fluoroquinolone and/or corticosteroid hypersensitivity; use of topical or systemic antimicrobial, antifungal, or corticosteroid agents within 1 week preceding study entry; and concurrent use of anti-inflammatory agents.

Treatments

The investigational product was ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%. Comparator drugs were ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%. All treatments were sterile otic solutions supplied in blue translucent single-use vials (0.25 mL) with the same characteristics.

Patients were randomized via an interactive web response system to one of the following treatment groups: ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin, or fluocinolone, in a 2:2:1 ratio. A block randomization algorithm was used. To ensure homogeneous representation of age groups, patients were stratified by age at enrollment (< 18 or ≥ 18 years).

### Necrotizing otitis externa: a systematic review [^fdf7b3d4]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To carry out a systematic review of scientific evidence available about necrotizing otitis externa, emphasizing epidemiologic data, diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols, follow-up criteria, prognosis factors, and chronologic evolution.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for publications in English and French languages, between 1968 and October 1, 2011.

Study Selection

We included publications of all types including at least 6 cases. We excluded publications focused on cranial base osteomyelitis not originating from the external ear and publications limited to a specific population.

Data Extraction

We assessed publication quality according to international guidelines.

Data Synthesis

For each publication, data were entered in a spreadsheet software for analysis. We excluded individual data already published in other studies or reviews.

Conclusion

Our review revealed the absence of strong scientific evidence regarding diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols and follow-up criteria. This implies the use of highly empirical indexes of suspicion in clinical practice. Our review confirmed the existence of a typical but not exclusive population at risk (aged, male, and diabetic patient) and also revealed major issues: lack of primary prevention in population at risk, delays before referral and management, bacteriologic issues caused by antibiotic misuse (agent identification problems, rise of resistant strains), persistence of recurrent cases. A better diffusion of medical information should help improve the management of this severe disease.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^4d1f03d0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Although most cases of otitis or mastoiditis are bacterial, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis should be considered for patients with otitis or mastoiditis who have resided in or traveled to areas of risk for coccidioidomycosis, especially if the case does not respond to empiric antibacterial therapy. The diagnosis can be suggested by serologic testing, but confirmation requires culture of discharge from the ear or by biopsy of the mastoid for histopathology and fungal culture.

The optimal treatment for coccidioidomycosis involving the ear or mastoids is unknown. Most of the patients we reviewed underwent debridement, as is typically performed for fungal ear or mastoid disease. Antifungal drugs are a major component of management, although the optimal agent and duration remain unresolved. In this series, the duration of therapy ranged from 1 week (of amphotericin B) to indefinitely (suppressive azole therapy), and the optimal duration is unresolved. Repeated clinical, radiographic, and serologic evaluation with CF should be obtained before therapy is discontinued. Given the proximity and potential for invasion of the central nervous system, lifelong azole therapy should be weighed against toxicities associated with long-term use. Our patient series demonstrates the protean nature of coccidioidomycosis. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis for patients with otomastoiditis refractory to standard therapy and a history of exposure to areas of geographic risk.

### An emergency medicine-focused review of malignant otitis externa [^24ad4d05]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC). This disease is rare but has severe morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review provides an overview of malignant otitis externa for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

MOE is an invasive external ear infection that spreads to the temporal bone and can further progress to affect intracranial structures. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly the facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscess and meningitis. The most common causative agent of MOE is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but others include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungi. Major risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Red flags for MOE include severe otalgia (pain out of proportion to exam) or severe otorrhea, neurologic deficits (especially facial nerve involvement), previously diagnosed otitis externa not responsive to therapy, and patients with major risk factors for MOE. Examination may show purulent otorrhea or granulation tissue in the EAC, and culture of EAC drainage should be performed. Diagnosis is aided by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, which may demonstrate bony destruction of the temporal bone or skull base. When suspecting MOE, early consultation with an otolaryngologist is recommended and antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage are needed. Most patients with MOE will require admission to the hospital.

Conclusions

MOE is a rare, yet deadly diagnosis that must be suspected when patients with immunocompromise, diabetes, or advanced age present with severe otalgia. Rapid diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and improve outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3f3c4303]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2–4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare "home therapies" (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^41097bc4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — adverse events, adherence, cost, and dosing — has an overall low incidence of adverse events, with pruritus (about 5% to 7%) and site reaction (4% to 5%), and other events less than 2%, and two meta-analyses comparing a quinolone drop versus neomycin–polymyxin B–hydrocortisone found no significant difference in adverse events; however, about 30% to 60% of patients with chronic or eczematous external otitis develop a contact dermatitis, most often to aminoglycoside drops, and it would appear prudent to avoid using aminoglycoside drops in these populations. Adherence and patient satisfaction are highest when drops are easy to administer, and drops administered 4 times daily may be less acceptable; costs range from a few dollars for antiseptics or generic products to more than $100 for quinolones. Available data suggest that, at least with quinolone drops, a twice-daily dosing regimen is as effective as more frequent dosing with the quinolones, and more recent trials recommend 7 to 10 days of topical therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^8c7c6078]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, superior to ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone in treating acute otitis externa?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 493 patients, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was not superior to either agent alone for the primary outcome of therapeutic cure. A faster resolution of otalgia, superiority in sustained microbiological response, and superiority in the microbiological outcome were noted with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with fluocinolone or ciprofloxacin alone.

Meaning

Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone otic solution did not show statistical superiority compared with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for the primary end point, although the combination showed statistical superiority in many secondary efficacy end points and a good safety profile.

### Skull base fungal osteomyelitis: a case report and review of the literature [^a688ee02]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is an invasive infection refractory to therapy, closely linked with malignant otitis externa (MOE). It is characterized by a mild clinical presentation that can delay cross-sectional imaging considered as the key to revealing it. Skull base osteomyelitis typically affects elderly diabetics and immunocompromised patients (> 70 years). It most commonly has an otogenic origin due to an extension of MOE. The prognosis can be very poor without the administration of adequate and timely therapy at an early disease stage. Nowadays, Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains the most common pathogen associated with SBO. Fungi are a rare cause of MOE. This report documents a rare case of otogenic SBO caused by Candida parapsilosis in a diabetic patient, with persistent otologic symptoms as clinical onset and resistance to medical treatment. Fungal MOE has more subtle symptoms and is more aggressive than its bacterial counterpart. When MOE is resistant to antibacterial drugs, this should raise the suspicion of a fungal etiology of MOE. The current guidelines do not exhaustively describe the diagnosis, antifungal drugs of choice, and optimum duration of treatment. The description of these rare clinical cases should help with the multidisciplinary management of this disease in order to optimize the diagnosis and therapeutic protocol.

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^bb15ddd3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### Clinical utility of a polymerase chain reaction assay in culture-negative necrotizing otitis externa [^2d90a538]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study describes a subset of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) patients with a refractory disease and negative cultures. In these cases, we decided to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay from surgically obtained tissue under sterile conditions to improve pathogen detection sensitivity.

Study Design

Retrospective case review.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patients

Nineteen consecutive patients diagnosed with NOE between January 2008 and January 2014 inclusive. Three patients of this cohort presented a culture-negative disease.

Interventions

Diagnostic.

Main Outcome Measures

Positive detection of pathogens using a PCR assay in cases with a complicated course of NOE and clinical resolution of the disease after targeted therapy according to PCR results.

Results

Surgical samples were obtained under sterile conditions from three patients with negative cultures and a refractory disease course of NOE. PCR assays were performed using pan-bacteria and pan-fungi protocols. In all three samples, a positive result for a fungal pathogen was recorded and followed by successful empirical targeted therapy.

Conclusion

Patients who present with a refractory culture-negative NOE should be suspected as suffering from a fungal disease. The PCR assay may be an important laboratory adjunct in detecting pathogens responsible for NOE and can aid to promote therapy and disease resolution.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^8bde4d29]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evidence synthesis for topical therapy: The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of topical therapy, without systemic antibiotics, for initial management of uncomplicated AOE, and most topical preparations provide antimicrobial activity through (1) an antibiotic, which may be an aminoglycoside, polymyxin B, a quinolone, or a combination of these agents; (2) a steroid, such as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone; or (3) a low-pH antiseptic. Randomized trials used in the 3 AOE meta-analyses are summarized in Table 7, with 31 listed trials, of which 3 were included in all of the meta-analyses, 14 in 2, and 5 in only 1, and multiple analyses report no meaningful differences in clinical outcomes by class or combination, including that Rosenfeld and colleagues found no significant differences for antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic(s), or steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial alone.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^450857f2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical study, ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure. However, the findings suggest the benefits of combining the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide to better manage patients with AOE, with regard to both the bacterial infection and the typical disease signs and symptoms.

### Hyperbaric oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for malignant otitis externa [^25a74ae5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant, or necrotising, otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone. It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa.

Data Collection and Analysis

No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.

Main Results

Due to the lack of data we could present no results.

Authors' Conclusions

No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. We found no data to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities. Further research is required.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^38ce79e0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE", and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^27e2548e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3e4f098c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

### Otomycosis: clinical features and treatment implications [^6e5faa96]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the clinical presentation, predisposing factors, complications, and treatment outcomes of otomycosis.

Study Design and Setting

Retrospective review of 132 patients with a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis treated from 1998 to 2004 in an academic otology practice.

Results

Otalgia and otorrhea were the most common presenting complaints (48%). Prior otologic procedures increase the risk of developing otomycosis. Residual disease was observed in 13% and recurrence in 15% of the subjects. The presence of a mastoid cavity was associated with higher recurrent and residual disease rates. Topical ketoconazole, cresylate otic drops, and aluminum acetate otic drops were all relatively effective with > 80% resolution rate on initial application, although topical ketoconazole had a higher resolution rate and lower rate of disease recurrence.

Conclusions and Significance

Otomycosis can usually be diagnosed by clinical examination and often occurs in the setting of persistent otorrhea. Complications are not uncommon but usually resolve with application of appropriate topical antifungal agents. Eradication of disease is more difficult in the presence of a mastoid cavity.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — overuse and harms of oral antibiotics: Despite the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy of topical preparations, about 20% to 40% of subjects with AOE nonetheless receive oral antibiotics, often in addition to topical antimicrobials, and despite a strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics clinicians actually prescribed more systemic antibiotics postpublication (31% vs 22%). Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — drug delivery recommendation: The clinician should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; this recommendation is based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality "Grade C, observational studies and D, first principles", level of confidence "High", benefit "Improved adherence to therapy and drug delivery", and risks/costs "Pain and local trauma caused by inappropriate aural toilet or wick insertion; direct cost of wick (inexpensive)".

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

Other secondary end points included (1) sustained microbiological cure; (2) clinical cure at visit 3 and visit 4; (3) microbiological cure at visit 3 and visit 4; (4) therapeutic cure at visit 4; (5) changes in otorrhea, edema, and otalgia at visit 3 and visit 4; and (6) AEs throughout the study. Compliance was assessed by dividing the number of doses the patient took by the number of prescribed doses. Patients were considered compliant if their percentage compliance was between 80% and 120%. Safety was evaluated by recording AEs reported by the patient or the investigator and by the assessment of vital signs.

Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa — epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment: Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa is an aggressive infection that predominantly affects elderly, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients, and P aeruginosa is isolated from exudate in the ear canal in more than 90% of cases. A clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate plus an abnormal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan, with other imaging modalities including gallium scan, indium-labeled leukocyte scan, technetium bone scan, and single-photon emission tomograph. Treatment includes surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics adequate to cover pseudomonal and staphylococcal infection, including methicillin-resistant S aureus, and biopsy may be necessary to detect neoplasia if the diagnosis is uncertain or response to therapy is delayed.

### Is biofilm the cause of chronic otitis externa? [^cd9ea63d]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

This study was undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, we considered patients affected by chronic external otitis treated either by chemical ear peeling (CEP) or by antibiotic/steroid treatment to compare the clinical and microbiological outcomes. In the second phase, we compared the microscopic findings observed in the CEP samples of patients affected by chronic otitis externa's acute exacerbation or by acute otitis externa to demonstrate the role of biofilm in the pathogenesis of chronic otitis externa.

Study Design

Prospective, double-blind, controlled study.

Methods

In phase 1 we compared clinical and microbiological data collected from two groups of 25 patients with chronic otitis externa treated by CEP or by conventional antibiotic/steroid treatment. In phase 2 we compared the results of the optical and electron microscopic analysis of specimens obtained by performing CEP in two groups of patients (25 with chronic otitis externa exacerbation and 15 with acute otitis externa).

Results

In phase 1 the disease control rate yielded markedly better results when treated with CEP. In phase 2 biofilms were identified in 23 of the 25 patients with chronic otitis externa exacerbation (92%) and in only three acute external otitis cases (20%).

Conclusions

CEP is a simple and effective method for the treatment of chronic external otitis. The removal of the bacterial biofilm has a high correlation with a long-term clinical remission.

Clinical epidemiology

A literature search, restricted to publications in English, including publications up to 8 December 2017, was performed by using Medline/Pubmed. At that moment, published clinical reports of C. auris infections originated from Japan, South Korea, India, Kuwait, Oman, South Africa, Venezuela, Panama, Colombia, Pakistan, Israel, Spain, UK, Canada and the USA describing 109 patients with candidaemia, 19 patients with chronic otitis media or otitis externa and 28 patients with other infections (including candiduria/urinary tract infections (n = 16) and wound and soft tissue infections (n = 6)). Real-time data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that new cases are reported on an almost weekly basis with a total of 243 clinical cases of C. auris infection in the USA. Public Health England shows a more episodic pattern in reported clinical cases (56 in total) with high increases during outbreaks. No paediatric patients have been reported in the UK (Dr E M Johnson, Public Health England, personal communication).

Ten out of the 18 publications described infections in adult patients only. Two publications did include paediatric patients but no details were given separately for the patients < 18 years of ageor age was not mentioned. Twenty-three paediatric patients have been reported in five case series published, of which 20 neonates and children suffered from a blood stream infection (18% of the total population). Three other paediatric patients suffered from chronic otitis media with positive ear swabs for C. auris. Table 1 summarises the clinical characteristics of those infections. Paediatric patients have only been reported in Asia and South America. Underlying conditions and risk factors are comparable to those known to render paediatric patients at risk for developing candidaemia and invasive candidiasis. Of the 20 paediatric patients with candidaemia due to C. auris, 14 were neonates and/or born prematurely. Older infants and children developed C. auris candidaemia during intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, postsurgery or with an underlying haematological malignancy. Antifungal regimens prescribed varied hugely with half of the patients receiving combination antifungal therapy with two or three antifungals. Mortality was 30% in paediatric patients with C. auris blood stream infections and lower compared with adult patients with mortality rates ranging from 30% to 60%. In contrast, during the C. auris outbreak in a large UK hospital, no attributable deaths were observed due to C. auris infections.

Acute otitis externa — wick placement to promote topical drug delivery is described as follows: Clinicians may place a wick in the ear canal if there is edema preventing drop entry or if most of the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized; the wick should preferably be made of compressed cellulose, ribbon gauze can be used, and some experts recommend moistening a dry wick with an aqueous solution before the first application of otic medication. A wick should not be made of a simple cotton ball. Many treatment studies uniformly use a wick to improve drug delivery, but there are no trials of wick efficacy; a wick is unnecessary once the ear canal edema subsides, which may occur within 24 hours or a few days of topical therapy, and the wick may fall out spontaneously, be removed by the patient if comfortable, or be removed by the physician by the time edema resolves. For severe external auditory canal edema when adequate aural toilet or wick placement is not possible or practical, systemic antibiotics may be considered.

Subjects with Otitis Externa

In the phase III clinical trials performed in support of once-daily dosing, 799 subjects with otitis externa and intact tympanic membranes were treated with ofloxacin otic solution. The studies, which served as the basis for approval, were 020 (pediatric, adolescents and adults), 016 (adolescents and adults) and 017 (pediatric). The following treatment-related adverse events occurred in two or more of the subjects.

An unexpected increased incidence of application site reaction was seen in studies 016/017 and was similar for both ofloxacin and the active control drug (neomycin-polymyxin B sulfate-hydrocortisone). This finding is believed to be the result of specific questioning of the subjects regarding the incidence of application site reactions.

In once daily dosing studies, there were also single reports of nausea, seborrhea, transient loss of hearing, tinnitus, otitis externa, otitis media, tremor, hypertension and fungal infection.

In twice daily dosing studies, the following treatment-related adverse events were each reported in a single subject: dermatitis, eczema, erythematous rash, follicular rash, hypoaesthesia, tinnitus, dyspepsia, hot flushes, flushing and otorrhagia.

Subjects with Acute Otitis Media with Tympanostomy Tubes (AOM TT) and Subjects with Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) with Perforated Tympanic Membranes

In phase III clinical trials which formed the basis for approval, the following treatment-related adverse events occurred in 1% or more of the 656 subjects with non-intact tympanic membranes in AOM TT or CSOM treated twice-daily with ofloxacin otic solution:

Other treatment-related adverse reactions reported in subjects with non-intact tympanic membranes included: diarrhea (0.6%), nausea (0.3%), vomiting (0.3%), dry mouth (0.5%), headache (0.3%), vertigo (0.5%), otorrhagia (0.6%), tinnitus (0.3%), fever (0.3%). The following treatment-related adverse events were each reported in a single subject: application site reaction, otitis externa, urticaria, abdominal pain, dysaesthesia, hyperkinesia, halitosis, inflammation, pain, insomnia, coughing, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, and tachycardia.

Acute otitis externa — aural toilet and adherence to enhance topical delivery — the purpose is "to maximize the efficacy of topical therapy by ensuring that it penetrates the ear canal and reaches the site of infection", and clinicians are told it is important to inform patients how to administer ear drops and that they may need to have the canal cleaned if obstructed by debris; adherence is suboptimal because "Only 40% of patients who self‑medicate do so appropriately during the first 3 days", and adherence increases when someone other than the patient applies the drops; the ear canal should be cleared of inflammatory debris, obstructing cerumen, or any foreign object, and there are no randomized studies of the use of aural toilet in AOE; clinician‑performed aural toilet may use gentle lavage with body‑temperature water, saline solution, or hydrogen peroxide, with alternatives including suction or dry mop; there are no randomized trials addressing safety of aural lavage in diabetic or immunocompromised patients, lavage for cerumen impaction in elderly or diabetic patients has been implicated as a contributing factor in malignant otitis externa, and irrigation with tap water is a potential iatrogenic factor, so high‑risk patients or those with established malignant otitis externa may require atraumatic cleaning with aural suctioning under microscopic guidance; the statement includes "Benefits‑harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", notes the value judgment that cleaning was appropriate when necessary to improve penetration of the drops, and indicates "Policy level: Recommendation".
