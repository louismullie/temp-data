## Question

A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with sudden onset right arm weakness and expressive aphasia that resolved within 45 minutes. He has no residual neurological deficits on examination. Noninvasive carotid duplex ultrasound reveals a 75% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. He is at average surgical risk, and the anticipated perioperative stroke or mortality rate at your institution is 3%. The event occurred 5 days ago. He has no history of prior disabling stroke, and his functional status is independent. There is no evidence of chronic total occlusion on imaging.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate management regarding carotid revascularization for this patient? Justify your answer using the relevant criteria from the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate management regarding carotid revascularization for a 72-year-old man with a recent TIA and 75% left internal carotid artery stenosis, including whether to intervene, which modality to choose, and the timing of intervention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and symptom–stenosis correlation. Then, I should verify the severity threshold that triggers revascularization in symptomatic patients. Next, I will assess perioperative risk and operator/institutional outcomes. After that, I need to choose between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) based on age, anatomy, and comorbidity. Finally, I will determine the optimal timing and outline concurrent medical therapy and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and its classification. Sudden right arm weakness and expressive aphasia resolving within 45 minutes meets the definition of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the left anterior circulation, and the noninvasive duplex showing 75% left internal carotid artery stenosis establishes symptomatic carotid stenosis ipsilateral to the event, which is the key determinant of benefit from revascularization in guidelines [^69fba3b6].

> Wait, let me verify the severity threshold that mandates intervention. For symptomatic patients, major guidelines recommend revascularization when stenosis is 70–99% by noninvasive imaging, and also consider CEA for 50–69% stenosis depending on patient-specific factors and perioperative risk. Here, 75% clearly exceeds the 70% threshold, so revascularization is indicated if perioperative risk is acceptable [^69fba3b6] [^b9790eb5] [^2b589962].

> I need to check perioperative risk next. The case states the anticipated perioperative stroke or mortality rate at the institution is 3%, which is below the 6% threshold recommended by AHA/ASA for symptomatic patients and below the 3% threshold emphasized by SVS for asymptomatic patients, supporting that the institutional outcomes meet safety benchmarks for CEA in this context [^69fba3b6] [^121f9c4c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality. I initially thought CAS might be reasonable given contemporary stent technology, but I should confirm age-related guidance. Multiple high-credibility guidelines advise favoring CEA over CAS in patients aged 70 years and older because CEA carries a lower periprocedural stroke risk in this age group, so at 72 years, CEA is preferred if anatomy and comorbidity allow [^21a39d1b] [^97ebe9f5] [^f42c5f49].

> Next, I should review timing. The TIA occurred 5 days ago, so we are within the 2-week window when early revascularization confers the greatest absolute risk reduction. Guidelines recommend proceeding within 2 weeks when feasible, balancing early hazard against the high early recurrence risk after TIA, and contemporary series show low perioperative complications when CEA is performed within 1–2 weeks in stable patients [^cf00a0e4] [^4c886aec] [^abbb9223].

> I will now examine the choice of revascularization modality with patient-specific factors. There is no mention of hostile neck anatomy, prior ipsilateral CEA, or radiation-induced stenosis, and he is at average surgical risk, so standard-risk CEA is appropriate. CAS would be reserved for anatomically unfavorable necks, restenosis after CEA, or high surgical risk, none of which are present here [^69fba3b6] [^ed7532d3].

> But wait, what if I overstate urgency and ignore perioperative hazard? Observational data suggest that very early CEA within 48 hours may carry higher perioperative risk, so I should confirm that we are not pushing too fast. The balance of evidence supports intervening after 48 hours and within 14 days for optimal net benefit, which fits this patient's timeline and stability [^6c914ab7] [^c0f01d01].

> Next, I should review concurrent medical therapy because revascularization is only one pillar. Intensive medical management with high-intensity statin to LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL, antiplatelet therapy, and strict blood pressure control should be initiated or optimized now and continued perioperatively and long term, as this reduces recurrent stroke risk independent of revascularization [^32de3df6] [^c848451c] [^aa947c2f].

> Let me consider alternatives and ensure I am not missing a reason to defer. Medical therapy alone is inferior to CEA for symptomatic severe stenosis in randomized and pooled analyses, and the absolute risk reduction remains substantial at 5 years, so deferring revascularization would not be guideline-concordant here absent prohibitive surgical risk, which is not the case [^2b589962] [^69fba3b6].

> Final recommendation: Proceed with carotid endarterectomy as soon as feasible within the next 7–9 days to stay within the 2-week window, given symptomatic severe stenosis, acceptable institutional perioperative risk, age ≥ 70 years favoring CEA, and absence of contraindications. Continue intensive medical therapy and arrange perioperative surveillance per institutional protocol [^cf00a0e4] [^69fba3b6] [^21a39d1b].

---

The most appropriate management is **carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within 2 weeks** [^cf00a0e4] of the TIA, given symptomatic severe (70–99%) left internal carotid artery stenosis [^69fba3b6] and an estimated perioperative stroke/death rate of 3% at your institution, which meets the < 6% threshold [^b9790eb5]. CEA is preferred over carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients ≥ 70 years [^21a39d1b] because it lowers periprocedural stroke risk [^f42c5f49]. Immediate initiation of **intensive medical therapy** (high-dose statin, antiplatelet therapy, and strict blood pressure control) [^c848451c] is essential while arranging urgent surgical referral [^2972f3af]. If CEA is not feasible within 2 weeks, CAS is a reasonable alternative [^cab5d237] if the institutional periprocedural stroke/death rate is < 6% [^a497a14a].

---

## Indications for carotid revascularization

According to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) 2021 guidelines, **revascularization is indicated** for patients with recent TIA or non-disabling stroke and ipsilateral severe (70–99%) carotid stenosis, provided the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is < 6% [^b9790eb5]. The patient has symptomatic severe stenosis (75%) and an estimated perioperative risk of 3%, meeting this criterion [^69fba3b6].

---

## Choice of revascularization procedure

CEA is the **preferred revascularization method** for patients aged ≥ 70 years with symptomatic carotid stenosis, as it significantly reduces periprocedural stroke rates compared with CAS [^21a39d1b] [^f42c5f49]. The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend CEA over CAS in patients ≥ 70 years old who are eligible for revascularization [^21a39d1b].

---

## Timing of revascularization

Early intervention after TIA significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke [^4c886aec]. The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend performing CEA or CAS **within 2 weeks** of the index event to maximize stroke-free outcomes [^cf00a0e4]. Given that the patient's TIA occurred 5 days ago, urgent scheduling of CEA within the next 9 days is recommended.

---

## Medical management

Intensive medical therapy should be initiated immediately and continued perioperatively and long term, including:

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin or clopidogrel [^aa947c2f].
- **High-intensity statin therapy**: LDL-C goal < 70 mg/dL [^32de3df6].
- **Strict blood pressure control**: Target < 140/90 mmHg, or < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^notfound].

---

## Alternative management if CEA is not feasible

If CEA is contraindicated or not feasible within 2 weeks, CAS is a reasonable alternative [^cab5d237], provided the institutional periprocedural stroke/death rate is < 6% [^a497a14a]. CAS is particularly considered in patients with anatomical or medical factors that increase surgical risk, such as radiation-induced stenosis or restenosis after CEA [^ed7532d3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| CEA within 2 weeks | Reduces recurrent stroke risk in symptomatic severe carotid stenosis [^cf00a0e4] [^4c886aec] |
| CEA preferred over CAS | Lower periprocedural stroke risk in patients ≥ 70 years [^21a39d1b] [^f42c5f49] |
| Intensive medical therapy | Essential for secondary stroke prevention [^c848451c] [^32de3df6] |
| CAS if CEA not feasible | Alternative revascularization with periprocedural risk < 6% [^cab5d237] [^a497a14a] |

---

The most appropriate management is **CEA within 2 weeks** of the TIA, given symptomatic severe carotid stenosis and acceptable perioperative risk. Immediate intensive medical therapy should be initiated, and CAS considered only if CEA is not feasible.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^121f9c4c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease. A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. The committee recommends CEA as the first-line treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 70% to 99%. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. In patients with recent stable stroke (modified Rankin scale score, 0–2), carotid revascularization is considered appropriate for symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis and should be performed as soon as the patient is neurologically stable after 48 hours but definitely < 14 days after symptom onset. In the general population, screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease is not recommended. In selected asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of carotid stenosis, we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis as long as the patients would potentially be fit for and willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience.

### Perioperative neurological evaluation and management to lower the risk of acute stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac, nonneurological surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^81924c9c]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Extracranial carotid artery stenosis — revascularization and perioperative considerations are as follows: Current guidelines recommend that patients with high-grade extracranial carotid artery stenosis (> 70%) and ipsilateral symptoms within the past 6 months should be strongly considered for revascularization by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS), and symptomatic patients with moderate stenosis (50%–69%) should also be considered provided that the surgical risk is < 6%. Some consideration of CEA in asymptomatic patients with severe stenosis may be warranted because CAS is associated with a slightly higher risk of stroke and CEA with a slightly higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI). The US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine carotid screening in patients without symptoms. For asymptomatic patients with known high-grade carotid stenosis in the general population, American Heart Association guidelines recommend that they be considered for CEA if the risk of perioperative stroke, MI, and death is < 3% and may be considered for CAS if the stenosis is > 70% by ultrasonography or > 60% by catheter angiography. Elective surgical procedures may be postponed if carotid artery revascularization treatment is planned, although the optimal duration of delay is unknown and may be informed predominantly by timing of the most recent cerebrovascular event. For cardiac surgery, a randomized trial comparing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with synchronous CABG and CEA reported 30-day perioperative stroke and death rates of 18.5% versus 9.7% without a statistically significant difference (P = 0.12).

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^6bf674a0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Neurologically asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥ 60% — carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic lesions: Controlled randomized trials have compared CEA with best medical therapy and the results of ACAS and ACST favored CEA. ACAS demonstrated the superiority of CEA over antiplatelet therapy alone for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of ≥ 60%, and this trial recommended CEA for these patients (aged < 80 years) as long as the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. In updated ACST I results, the patients in the CEA arm (aged < 75 years) experienced significantly lower perioperative and 10-year stroke rates (13.3% vs 17.9%). The question of whether modern medical therapy (including statins) is equivalent or superior to CEA or CAS has not yet been addressed by well-designed, appropriately funded, prospective, multicenter, and randomized trials.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^79d047bd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Extracranial cerebrovascular disease — evidence and rationale for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in asymptomatic carotid stenosis are summarized as follows: randomized trials reported aggregate risk reduction, 53%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 22%-72%. ACAS thresholds included patients aged < 80 years and required that the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. CEA showed an advantage in limiting stroke and death at 5 years compared with maximal medical therapy (4.1% vs 10.0%; 95% CI, 4.0%-7.8%), and among patients aged < 75 years the 10-year stroke rates were 13.3% vs 17.9%. Systematic reviews and a population-based cohort analysis evaluated contemporary medical therapy, with 5-year stroke risk for 70% to 99% carotid stenosis at 14.6% (6 of 53) compared with 0% for 50% to < 70% stenosis (P < .0001), and for 80% to 99% stenosis ipsilateral stroke was 5 of 34 (18.3%) vs 1 of 173 (1%); P < .0001. Investigators concluded that the benefit of CEA might have been underestimated for patients with severe stenosis (> 70%), whereas the 5-year stroke risk was relatively low for those with < 70% stenosis receiving contemporary best medical therapy. Perioperative safety data from large National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, state, and Medicare datasets of 4000 to 35,000 patients demonstrated stroke and death rates as low as 2.2%, with a maximum of 6.9% (symptomatic patients only). For stenting alternatives, the role of TF-CAS or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is even less clear because no completed studies have compared these treatments against best medical therapy.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^69fba3b6]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Extracranial carotid stenosis — For patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), the guideline provides the following directives: In patients with a TIA or nondisabling ischemic stroke within the past 6 months and ipsilateral severe (70%–99%) carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended to reduce the risk of future stroke, provided that perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is estimated to be < 6%; in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis who are scheduled for carotid artery stenting (CAS) or CEA, procedures should be performed by operators with established periprocedural stroke and mortality rates of < 6% to reduce the risk of surgical adverse events; in patients with carotid artery stenosis and a TIA or stroke, intensive medical therapy with antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and treatment of hypertension, is recommended to reduce risk; in patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral moderate (50%–69%) carotid stenosis as documented by catheter-based imaging or noninvasive imaging, CEA is recommended to reduce the risk of future stroke, depending on patient-specific factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities, if the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is estimated to be < 6%; in patients > 70 years of age with stroke or TIA in whom carotid revascularization is being considered, it is reasonable to select CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate; and in patients in whom revascularization is planned within 1 week of the index stroke, it is reasonable to choose CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^3c8d3746]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — symptomatic moderate to severe carotid stenosis: In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Values statement: In recommending endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 50%) carotid stenosis, the committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing the outcome of stroke with the associated disability and morbidity and a relatively lower value on avoiding the downsides of endarterectomy (cost, perioperative complications such as death, and myocardial infarction). The guideline also notes that no data exist to support or refute the value of endarterectomy for the management of symptomatic patients with nonstenotic but severely ulcerated plaques, and that while there could be a subset of symptomatic patients with less than 50% stenosis that might benefit from CEA, current published data do not permit identification of such a cohort.

Extracranial carotid disease — therapy selection recommendations (items 7–8): Neurologically asymptomatic patients deemed "high risk" for CEA should be considered for primary medical management; CEA can be considered only with evidence that periprocedural morbidity or mortality is ≤ 3%, and CAS should not be performed except as part of an ongoing clinical trial (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). For asymptomatic patients with 70% to 99% diameter stenosis, there are insufficient data to recommend CAS as primary therapy; if CAS is undertaken by experienced interventionists, operators and institutions must meet established AHA standards and the combined stroke and death rate must be < 3% to ensure benefit (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B).

### Time to rethink management strategies in asymptomatic carotid artery disease [^8f1c0cd1]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Despite level I evidence, no worldwide consensus of opinion exists on how best to manage patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease. In this article, I present the evidence supporting intervention in these patients, highlighting a number of 'inconvenient truths' that challenge the current 'one size fits all' approach to treatment. I will demonstrate that, even if one could identify and treat every individual with a 60–99% asymptomatic stenosis, > 95% of all strokes will still occur. Evidence shows that 94% of all carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting procedures in asymptomatic patients in the US are ultimately unnecessary, costing health-care providers US$2 billion annually. Evidence also exists that the risk of stroke in patients treated medically is lower than when the asymptomatic trials were recruiting, challenging the appropriateness of basing contemporary guidelines upon historical data. A small cohort of 'high-risk for stroke' patients will undoubtedly benefit from intervention and our goal must be to identify and treat these individuals, rather than continuing with a policy of mass intervention that benefits very few patients in the long term.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^19c927d6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis — carotid endarterectomy recommendation: In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Evidence includes a systematic review/meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 5223 asymptomatic patients; stenosis thresholds were ≥ 50% in the Veteran Affairs Cooperative Study and ≥ 60% in ACAS and ACST. The incidence of 30-day perioperative stroke or death was 2.8%, and endarterectomy reduced risk versus medical therapy: relative risk 0.69 (0.57 to 0.83) for perioperative stroke, death or any subsequent stroke, and 0.71 (0.55 to 0.90) for perioperative stroke, death, or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, with no important inconsistency across trials (I2 = 0); for any stroke or death there was a nonsignificant trend favoring surgery (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). The committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing stroke disability and morbidity versus avoiding endarterectomy downsides, and in broader contexts clinicians should "consider these as suggestions (GRADE 2)".

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^fdd0da6a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy — evidence limitations and NASCET exclusions: Carotid endarterectomy for nonhemispheric symptoms, vertebrobasilar symptoms, acute stroke, or for stroke or TIA with internal carotid occlusion is not supported by high quality evidence but rather by very low quality evidence (case series and unsystematic observations), and in these settings surgeon's complication rate and patient's values and preferences play a major role in decision making. NASCET withheld endarterectomy from patients with life expectancy of less than 5 years and significant comorbid conditions and also excluded patients over the age of 79, those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy, and those without adequate angiographic visualization; accordingly, the net benefit in these populations is unclear, requiring judicious and selective application, and case by case decision-making with attention to patient values, surgeon experience, and surgical center outcomes.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to carotid artery revascularization, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider performing carotid endarterectomy over carotid artery stenting to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate in ≥ 70 years old patients with stroke or TIA eligible for revascularization.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^bcfbd6a7]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Extracranial carotid stenosis — timing and modality of revascularization after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or nondisabling stroke: For patients with TIA or nondisabling stroke in whom revascularization is indicated, it is reasonable to perform the procedure within 2 weeks of the index event (Class 2a, Level C‑LD). In symptomatic severe stenosis (> 70%) with anatomic or medical factors that increase surgical risk (including radiation‑induced stenosis or restenosis after carotid endarterectomy [CEA]), it is reasonable to choose carotid artery stenting (CAS) to reduce the periprocedural complication rate (Class 2a, Level C‑LD). In symptomatic patients at average or low endovascular risk, when internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is ≥ 70% by noninvasive imaging or > 60% by catheter‑based imaging and the anticipated periprocedural stroke or death rate is < 6%, CAS may be considered as an alternative to CEA for stroke prevention, particularly in those with significant cardiovascular comorbidities (Class 2b, Level A).

### Management of patients with concomitant coronary and carotid vascular disease [^d9ea20aa]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Stroke is a major complication of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Carotid stenosis is an important cause of stroke in certain CABG patients. Randomized trials have revealed that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is clearly indicated in non-CABG patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis. CEA is also indicated in patients with symptomatic moderate stenosis and asymptomatic severe stenosis if the predicted incidence of perioperative morbidity and mortality is low. Therapeutic options for patients with concomitant coronary and carotid disease include CABG alone, CABG plus CEA, and CABG plus carotid stenting. In this article we discuss each of these management techniques in detail, and make recommendations regarding the preferred approach in specific patient populations.

### A systematic review supporting the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines on the management of carotid artery disease [^7ad6247c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To support the development of guidelines on the management of carotid disease, a writing committee from the Society for Vascular Surgery has commissioned this systematic review.

Methods

We searched multiple data bases for studies addressing five questions: medical management vs carotid revascularization (CEA) in asymptomatic patients, CEA vs carotid artery stenting (CAS) in symptomatic low surgical risk patients, the optimal timing of revascularization after acute stroke, screening high-risk patients for carotid disease, and the optimal sequence of interventions in patients with combined coronary and carotid disease. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed when feasible.

Results

Medical management compared with carotid interventions in asymptomatic patients was associated with better early outcome during the first 30 days. However, CEA was associated with significantly lower long-term rate of stroke/death at 5 years. In symptomatic low-risk surgical patients, CEA was associated with a lower risk of stroke, but a significant increase in myocardial infarction compared with CAS during the first 30 days. When the long-term outcome of transfemoral CAS vs CEA in symptomatic patients were examined using preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient data from four randomized trials, the risk of death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% for CEA and 8.7% for CAS, which lends support that, over the long term, CEA has a superior outcome compared with transfemoral CAS. When managing acute stroke, the comparison of CEA during the first 48 hours to that between day 2 and day 14 did not reveal a statistically significant difference on outcomes during the first 30 days. Registry data show good results with CEA performed in the first week, but not within the first 48 hours. A single risk factor, aside from peripheral artery disease, was associated with low carotid screening yield. Multiple risk factors greatly increase the yield of screening. Evidence on the timing of interventions in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease was sparse and imprecise. Patients without carotid symptoms, who had the carotid intervention first, compared with a combined carotid intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, had better outcomes.

Conclusions

This updated evidence summary supports the Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for commonly raised clinical scenarios. CEA was superior to medical therapy in the long-term prevention of stroke/death over medical therapy. CEA was also superior to transfemoral CAS in minimizing long-term stroke/death for symptomatic low risk surgical patients. CEA should optimally be performed between 2 and 14 days from the onset of acute stroke. Having multiple risk factors increases the value of carotid screening.

Extracranial carotid disease — therapy selection recommendations (items 1–3): For neurologically symptomatic patients with stenosis < 50% or asymptomatic patients with stenosis < 60% diameter reduction, optimal medical therapy is indicated and there are no data to support CAS or CEA in this group (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). In most patients with carotid stenosis who are candidates for intervention, CEA is preferred to CAS for reduction of all-cause stroke and periprocedural death (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B), though data from CREST suggest patients aged < 70 years may be better treated by CAS but need further confirmation. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with ≥ 60% diameter stenosis should be considered for CEA to reduce long-term stroke risk, provided a 3- to 5-year life expectancy and periprocedural stroke/death rates ≤ 3% (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^0d898ec9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Carotid stenosis with planned coronary artery bypass — perioperative strategies and outcomes include the following: stroke/death rates for combined CEA/CABG compared to staged CEA were 5.6% vs 17%, and the stroke rate with "unprotected" CABG was 7.4% versus 2.8% with combined CEA/CABG. In a randomized trial of 185 patients with unilateral severe (> 80%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis, "protected" CABG (15 CEA first, 79 combined CEA and CABG) had no strokes compared with 7 strokes (3 early, 4 later) in "unprotected" CABG with delayed CEA within 3 months (91 patients). When coronary intervention can be performed percutaneously, this should precede carotid intervention; if a sequential strategy is planned, CABG may need to be deferred for 2 to 4 weeks because of the need for dual-antiplatelet therapy after carotid artery stenting (CAS). A meta-analysis reported a stroke/death rate of 9.1% with CAS and CABG that was not significantly different than results with CEA and CABG, and one must conclude that data are insufficient to support a clear recommendation for treating patients with unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis who need CABG.

### A 70-year-old man with a transient ischemic attack: review of internal carotid artery stenosis [^45864504]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Mr V, a man with severe coronary, aortic, and peripheral artery disease, had an episode of brain ischemia caused by severe preocclusive carotid artery disease in the neck. The major treatment options for his symptomatic carotid artery disease are optimizing medical treatment, carotid endarterectomy, and carotid artery stenting. Selection of treatment must take into consideration his severe symptomatic coronary artery disease as well as Mr V's concerns about surgery. Carotid endarterectomy presents a risk of myocardial infarction unless his coronary disease is treated effectively before surgery. Carotid stenting is problematic because the severity of the preocclusive arterial narrowing makes passing a protective device beyond the stenosis difficult without first performing potentially hazardous angioplasty. Optimizing medical treatment may be the best option for his severe systemic atherosclerosis. Treatment decisions in complex patients like Mr V require weighing the particular risks and benefits of available options, and the patient's own wishes and fears. These decisions, in this and other complex patients, often cannot be directly informed by results from randomized trials.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^2b589962]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2017.

Objectives

To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal to October 2019. We also reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and abstract books from research proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carotid artery surgery plus best medical treatment with best medical treatment alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We assessed the results and the quality of the evidence of the primary and secondary outcomes by the GRADE method, which classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measuring carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. Using the primary electronic data files, we pooled and analysed individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient-years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials, and redefining outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. Surgery increased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with less than 30% stenosis (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.56; 2 studies, 1746 participants; high-quality evidence). Surgery decreased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies, 1429 participants; high-quality evidence), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; 3 studies, 1549 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.67; 3 studies, 1095 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, surgery decreased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with near-occlusions (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 2 studies, 271 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke for people with significant stenosis. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence) and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis (moderate-quality evidence).

### Urgent carotid artery revascularization fraught with higher rates of neurovascular events in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^3bbe8193]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis requires timely intervention to reduce risk of recurrent stroke. However, the optimal timing of revascularization remains debated. This study evaluates outcomes in patients undergoing urgent (< 48 hr), early (3–14 days), or delayed (> 14 days) carotid artery revascularization.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 186 interventions in symptomatic patients categorized by timing of intervention defined as urgent (< 48 hr from symptom onset, n = 47), early (3–14 days, n = 90), and delayed (> 14 days, n = 49). Baseline characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes were analyzed. Outcome measures included perioperative stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, and mortality at 30 days and on follow-up.

Results

The cohort's mean age was 71.3 ± 9.6 years, with no difference among groups, and with a balanced sex distribution (P = 0.75). Comorbidities included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, which were similar across groups (P > 0.05). National Institutes of Health stroke scale on admission was significantly different between groups (urgent: 4.7 ± 4.6; early: 8.2 ± 8.1; delayed: 4.0 ± 5.2; P = 0.01). The level of disability measured through the modified Rankin scale at discharge demonstrated no significant difference between groups (urgent: 0.9 ± 1.3; early: 1.1 ± 1.3; delayed: 0.5 ± 1.0; P = 0.09). At 30 days, ipsilateral strokes/TIA occurred in 3 (6.4%) patients in the urgent group, and none in either the early group or delayed group (P = 0.02). Thirty-day mortality was observed in 2 (4.3%) patients in the urgent group and 1 (1.1%) in the early group (P = 0.23). The 30-day composite of stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, or death was significantly higher in the urgent group (urgent: 8.5%, early: 1.1%, delayed: 0.0%; P = 0.02). At a mean follow-up of 14.6 ± 16.9 months, ipsilateral stroke rates were similar across groups (urgent: 4.3%, early: 5.6%, delayed: 4.1%; P = 1.00). All-cause mortality at follow-up occurred in 21.3% of urgent, 10.0% of early, and 10.2% of delayed patients (P = 0.17). Restenosis and reintervention rates at follow-up were significantly higher in the urgent (10.6%) and delayed (14.3%) groups than the early group (2.2%; P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Urgent carotid revascularization is associated with higher perioperative stroke/TIA rate than early and delayed interventions. Mid-term outcomes were comparable across groups. Restenosis and reintervention rates were higher in the urgent and delayed groups than the early intervention group.

### Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9d7707bc]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — three randomized clinical trials (n = 5226) of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (stenosis ≥ 50%) versus medical therapy over 2 to 9 years found that, compared with medical therapy alone, 2.0% fewer patients treated with CEA had perioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke combined over 30 d and 3.5% fewer had perioperative stroke or death and any subsequent stroke combined; however, none of the trials focused on exclusively asymptomatic populations identified by primary care screening, between 20% and 32% of trial patients reported a history of contralateral artery transient ischemic attack, stroke, or CEA at baseline, requirements for asymptomatic status differed across trials (eg, no ipsilateral events for the past 6 months vs the past 45 days), medical therapy varied and operators were highly selected, and because of these limitations the USPSTF concluded that the magnitude of any benefit would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population than among patients in the trials.

### Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^69b0c38e]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Carotid artery stenosis is atherosclerotic disease that affects extracranial carotid arteries. Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis refers to stenosis in persons without a history of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other neurologic symptoms referable to the carotid arteries. The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is low in the general population but increases with age.

Objective

To determine if its 2014 recommendation should be reaffirmed, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence review. The reaffirmation update focused on the targeted key questions on the potential benefits and harms of screening and interventions, including revascularization procedures designed to improve carotid artery blood flow, in persons with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Population

This recommendation statement applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms referable to the carotid arteries.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and therefore concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. (D recommendation).

### CIRSE standards of practice on carotid artery stenting [^a4a99001]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Around 10–15% of all episodes of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) may be attributed to atherosclerotic carotid artery disease, whilst the majority of carotid revascularisation interventions (75%) are done on asymptomatic patients for primary prevention of an ischaemic stroke event.

In 1994, carotid artery stenting was presented as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of individuals who had been assessed to be candidates for carotid revascularisation.

The carotid bifurcation is the most prevalent site for atherosclerotic carotid stenosis to develop, occasionally affecting the distal common and/or the proximal internal carotid arteries.

Indications for CAS and its general applicability have considerably expanded as a result of rapid technological developments in both the stents themselves and distal protective devices.

Indications, Contraindications, and Patient Selection

Carotid artery stenosis is considered symptomatic when correlated with findings like focal neurologic symptoms produced by ipsilateral transient ischaemic attacks, amaurosis fugax, or an ischaemic stroke in the carotid artery territory during the preceding six months. According to the NASCET criteria (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial), a high-grade stenosis is characterised as a ≥ 70% stenosis (equivalent to a ≥ 85% stenosis according to ECST criteria – European Carotid Surgery Trial).

Indications

Symptomatic patients:
With high-grade stenoses: Critical tandem lesion; Radiation-induced; After carotid endarterectomy (restenosis); Due to dissection; As a result of fibromuscular dysplasia; Related to Takayasu arteritis.
Presenting with pseudoaneurysms.
That have opted for CAS as their preferred treatment over CEA.
With signs of global hypoperfusion, according to a specialised stroke neurologist.
With presence of carotid web (although evidence is currently limited and supported primarily by limited case series).

Asymptomatic patients:
Of a younger age with a progressive asymptomatic lesion (> 70% stenosis) with or without evidence of cerebral infarction on brain computed tomography (CT) scans.
With bilateral 79–90% asymptomatic carotid stenosis (with a combined percentage of 160%).
With unilateral 70–90% stenosis with contralateral occlusion.
Who will undergo coronary artery bypass graft and have a previous history of stroke/TIA.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1f7efd08]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Indications for carotid bifurcation imaging — epidemiology and rationale are summarized as follows: stroke is the third leading cause of death, behind coronary artery disease and cancer, and is the leading cause of disability in the United States and Western Europe. Approximately 80% of strokes are ischemic and 20% are hemorrhagic. Significant carotid stenosis (> 50%) is seen in 12% to 20% of all anterior circulation ischemic strokes. Unfortunately, only 15% of stroke victims have a warning transient ischemic attack (TIA) before stroke. The purpose of carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect "stroke-prone" carotid bifurcation plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from therapy designed to reduce stroke risk. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) clearly demonstrated the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in reducing stroke in patients with symptoms of carotid territory cerebral ischemia and carotid bifurcation stenosis that reduced luminal diameter by > 50%.

### Carotid stenting: flow reversal technique: 2-dimensional operative video [^8e062398]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Management options for carotid stenosis include medical management, carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting with distal filter protection, or stenting with either flow arrest or flow reversal techniques.1 Flow reversal with transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) technique represents a hybrid approach with surgical access to the common carotid for endovascular placement of a stent in the internal carotid artery. This direct access to the carotid artery avoids navigating the challenging anatomy of the aortic arch with endovascular devices.2 Compared to transfemoral stenting, TCAR possesses lower risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke, and compared to carotid endarterectomy, there is less risk of cranial neuropathy.3,4 We present the case of an 87-yr-old man with recurrent severe stenosis (85%) of the right internal carotid artery. The patient had a remote history of bilateral endarterectomies for asymptomatic stenosis and was found with recurrence and progression of right internal carotid artery stenosis. Options were discussed and decision was made to proceed with TCAR after he consented for the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well with satisfactory revascularization. Exam remained unremarkable prior to discharge on postoperative day 1 and during follow-up at 1 mo. Patient consented to the publication of their image.

Carotid screening recommendations — Screening for asymptomatic clinically significant carotid bifurcation stenosis should be considered in patients with multiple risk factors who are fit and willing for intervention, and the presence of a carotid bruit increases the likelihood of significant stenosis (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B); groups include patients with clinically significant peripheral vascular disease regardless of age and patients aged ≥ 65 years with CAD, smoking, or hypercholesterolemia. Carotid screening may be considered in patients before CABG, most likely to be fruitful if aged > 65 years with left main disease or a history of peripheral vascular disease, with the aim to identify patients at high risk for perioperative stroke (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B). Carotid screening is not recommended for patients with AAA who do not fit the above categories (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B) and is not recommended for asymptomatic patients after prior head and neck radiotherapy (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B).

The premises of such testing are that the potential benefit of endarterectomy or stenting exceeds the potential harm in patients with asymptomatic stenosis and that discovery of asymptomatic stenosis may trigger beneficial changes in lifestyle or medical management that otherwise would not have occurred. However, given low contemporary rates of stroke in medically managed patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, invasive carotid procedures cannot be justified in this population. Moreover, among patients at increased cardiovascular risk, there is no evidence that carotid imaging motivates behavioral change or improves risk stratification beyond consideration of conventional risk factors. In this focused review, we address topics that should help health care professionals advise patients who inquire about carotid screening and patients in whom asymptomatic carotid stenosis has already been identified. We conclude that there is currently no role for carotid imaging in patients without a history of carotid-territory stroke or transient ischemic attack.

### No benefit from carotid intervention in fatal stroke prevention for > 80-year-old patients [^4907a968]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive management of patients ≥ 80 years of age with carotid stenosis may be questionable. The higher likelihood of stroke needs to be balanced with the increased perioperative risk and the reduced life expectancy of this ageing population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of carotid stenosis revascularisation in octogenarians.

Methods

All patients ≥ 80 years of age who received carotid revascularisation in 2001–2010 were reviewed for perioperative and 5-year outcomes. The experience was comprehensive of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) performed during the training frame when age was not a contraindication for this procedure. Mortality rates were compared to those of octogenarians of the same geographical territory according to all-cause and stroke-related mortality national statistics datasets.

Results

A total of 348 procedures performed in ≥ 80-year-old patients (272 males) were reviewed: 162 (46.6%) were by CAS and 169 (48.6%) were for symptomatic disease. Perioperative stroke/death rate was 5.5% and was non-significantly higher for symptomatic disease (7.1% vs. 3.9% asymptomatic; p = 0.24), after CAS (6.2% vs. 4.8% CEA; p = 0.64) and in females (6.6% vs. 5.1% males; p = 0.57). At median follow-up of 36.18 months, 95 deaths and 21 new ischaemic strokes (12 fatal) occurred with 5-year Kaplan-Meier freedom from stroke of 84.8% (78.7%, symptomatic vs. 90.3% asymptomatic; p = 0.003). According to national datasets, in 80-85-year-old resident population 5-year mortality was 29.9% (23.4% females, 40.6% males) and ischaemic stroke-related mortality was 14.9% (16.8% females, 13.0% males). Corresponding figures from treated population showed a 5-year mortality of 49.4%, higher in males (39.5% females, 52.5% males) and ischaemic stroke-related mortality of 20.2%, higher in females (40.0% females, 15.6% males). Comparing data from the study population with residents' figures, ischaemic stroke-related mortality hazard was significantly higher in the study females: odds ratio (OR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–9.17; p = 0.029 (for males: OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.89–1.10; p = 0.99).

Conclusions

Despite perioperative stroke/death risks being lower compared with CAS, the benefit of surgical carotid revascularisation in old patients remains controversial due to limited life expectancy and high fatality of stroke in this ageing population. Invasive treatment of carotid stenosis may not be warranted in most patients ≥ 80 years of age with carotid stenosis, especially when female and asymptomatic.

Extracranial carotid disease — asymptomatic stenosis outcomes and trials: In CREST asymptomatic patients, the primary composite end point including any periprocedural stroke, death, myocardial infarction (MI), or postprocedural ipsilateral stroke was 3.5% for carotid artery stenting (CAS) and 3.6% for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) (P = 0.96). Real-world data reported higher major complications with CAS versus CEA in asymptomatic patients, with a 30-day combined death, stroke, or MI rate of 4.6% in 1450 CAS patients versus 1.9% in 1368 CEA patients. Further randomized studies comparing CEA, CAS, and best medical therapy in asymptomatic patients (ACT I and ACST-2) are underway, and results are not expected until at least 2018.

### In-hospital complications and long-term outcomes associated with timing of carotid endarterectomy [^c0f01d01]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Carotid revascularization performed within 2 weeks of symptoms has proven to reduce risk of recurrent stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. However, the optimal timing of revascularization within the 2-week window has yet to be determined. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of in-hospital and long-term outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed within different time intervals after most recent symptoms.

Methods

We analyzed 2003 to 2016 data from the Vascular Quality Initiative Vascular Implant Surveillance and Interventional Outcomes Network. Only revascularizations performed for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were included. Procedures were categorized as urgent (0–2 days from latest symptom), early (3–14 days), or late (15–180 days). The primary in-hospital outcome was stroke/death. The primary long-term outcomes of interest were 5-year recurrent ipsilateral stroke/death. Multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression were utilized to compare outcomes.

Results

A total of 18,970 revascularizations were included: 1130 (6.0%) urgent, 4643 (24.5%) early, and 13,197 (69.6%) late. Earlier CEA had increased odds of in-hospital stroke/death compared with late CEA (urgent: adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.8; P = 0.001; early: adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.2; P < .001). No differences were seen in 5-year risk of stroke/death (urgent: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79–1.15; P = 0.592; early: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.07; P = 0.928).

Conclusions

Urgent and early CEA were associated with increased perioperative risk without difference in 5-year outcomes compared with late CEA. Short-term recurrent stroke prevention could not be assessed. Updated population-based studies comparing recurrent stroke prevention with urgent or early revascularization vs best medical management are warranted.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^2e89ee2a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) — evidence and rationale indicate that while combined or staged strategies are supported for symptomatic 50% to 99% stenosis, "the optimal timing for these interventions is unclear". In observational analyses, combined CABG and CEA vs CABG first showed similar risks: death (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32–1.05), stroke (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.34–2.22), and MI (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.09–4.34). Comparing CABG first vs CEA first also showed similar risks: death (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.44–2.01), stroke (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.64–3.06), and MI (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.22–1.18). In severe (> 70%) symptomatic stenosis, few studies address timing, and for unilateral 70% to 99% asymptomatic stenosis in CABG patients, "the stroke risk might be < 2%". Data are largely observational and small, with statements such as "a trend was found for decreased mortality with CAS first", and overall "the certainty of the conclusions remains low".

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^aa947c2f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — Medical management of carotid atherosclerosis emphasizes risk-factor modification and antithrombotic therapy with specified perioperative regimens. In patients with carotid artery stenosis, treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking cessation are recommended to reduce overall cardiovascular risk and risk of stroke, with targets defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). Aggressive treatment of hypertension in the setting of acute stroke is not recommended; after this period, treatment is associated with reduced risk of subsequent stroke and target parameters are not well defined (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C). Tight glucose control in diabetes has not been shown to reduce stroke risk or decrease complication rates after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is not recommended for these purposes (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence A). Anticoagulation is not recommended for transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute stroke unless there is evidence of a cardioembolic source (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). In asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce overall cardiovascular morbidity but has not been shown effective for primary prevention of stroke (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). For secondary stroke prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus dipyridamole, and clopidogrel are all effective, but clopidogrel plus aspirin is not more effective than either drug alone (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Perioperative medical management for carotid revascularization should include blood pressure control (< 140/80 mm Hg), β-blockade (heart rate, 60–80 beats/min), and statin therapy (LDL < 100 mg/dL) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Perioperative antithrombotic therapy for CEA should include aspirin (81–325 mg) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A), while use of clopidogrel perioperatively should be decided case-by-case (GRADE 2 Level of Evidence B). For carotid artery stenting (CAS), perioperative antithrombotic management should include dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel; dual therapy should be initiated at least 3 days before CAS and continued for 1 month, and aspirin should be continued indefinitely (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).

### Choice and selection of treatment modalities for cardiac patients: an interventional cardiology perspective [^a8a2d5f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Besides the controversies that surround the management of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, treatment of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is even more controversial. In the current era of optimal medical therapy, the role of carotid revascularization by CAS or CEA is unclear and is being sought by the CREST‐2 trial. 45 Furthermore, there is ongoing controversy regarding the role of operator experience while comparing CAS and CEA, along with differing certification requirements for the 2 interventions. The rate of periprocedural stroke among symptomatic patients undergoing CAS was 6% in the CREST trial as compared to 9.6% in the EVA‐3S trial, 40, 43 emphasizing the importance of training, credentialing, and auditing the CAS operators.

So, how do we put all this information into perspective for decision‐making? Overall, it has been demonstrated that CAS and CEA are durable procedures that are effective in preventing major strokes that lead to death or disability in the majority of patients. CAS seems to have the disadvantage of causing minor nondisabling strokes in the postprocedural period and possibly in the long term. However, this increased risk of minor strokes must be weighed against the increased risk of MI, cranial nerve palsies, and access site complications associated with CEA. The choice between CAS and CEA should take into account the different procedure‐related risks, demographic characteristics such as age and sex, patient preferences, along with other comorbidities that may relatively or absolutely contradict a procedure. We have established that there is a complementary role for both CAS and CEA but have not been able to establish clearly as to who will benefit the most from which procedure. The risk–benefit issue is a little complex at the moment and should be discussed with patients in a transparent fashion to facilitate collaborative and individualized choice of treatment. The current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend CEA as the revascularization strategy of choice among low‐ or medium‐risk patients with significant carotid stenosis presenting with stroke or transient ischemic attack (Class I recommendation). 36 However, the guidelines also recognize CAS as an alternative to CEA (Class I recommendation) among patients who are at low risk for endovascular intervention, giving rise to controversy about patient selection. 36 Finally, the importance of optimal medical therapy and control of modifiable traditional cardiovascular risk factors cannot be ignored. However, according to the current guidelines, in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients at high risk of complications for carotid revascularization by either CEA or CAS because of comorbidities, the effectiveness of revascularization versus medical therapy alone is not well established. 36

### Risk factor profile and anatomic features of previously asymptomatic patients presenting with carotid-related stroke [^404f17c2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Although carotid atherosclerotic-mediated stroke remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, some have suggested intervention in carotid stenosis should be limited to symptomatic patients given the advances in medical therapy. The present study was conducted to assess the atherosclerotic risk factor profiles, anatomic features, and clinical outcomes of previously asymptomatic patients admitted with stroke of carotid etiology.

Methods

We reviewed the data from 3382 patients admitted to a tertiary referral center with an ischemic stroke during 2005 to 2015. We focused on patients admitted with a radiographically confirmed infarct ipsilateral to a documented carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%, with the admitting neurology team adjudicating the stroke etiology as carotid related. Patients were excluded if they had had a previous transient ischemic attack, previous infarct ipsilateral to any carotid lesion, or previous carotid revascularization, intracranial hemorrhage, or malignancy. Patient demographic data, medical treatments before stroke, stroke admission carotid imaging, and stroke treatments and outcomes were assessed.

Results

A total of 219 carotid stroke patients (7% of all strokes) were identified, of whom 61% were white and 66% were men, with a mean age of 68 ± 12 years. Hypertension (79%) and smoking (33% current; 29% former) were predominant risk factors. On admission, 50% were receiving antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, n = 92 [41%]; clopidogrel, n = 9 [4%]; dual therapy, n = 11 [5%]) and 55% were receiving lipid-lowering agents (statin, n = 115 [53%]; other, n = 6 [2%]); 77 patients (35%) were receiving both antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapy. Of the 219 patients, 156 (71%) presented with a moderate or severe stroke (National Institutes of Health stroke scale ≥ 5 at admission), 54 (25%) received lytic therapy, 96 (43%) presented with an occluded ipsilateral internal carotid artery, and 117 (53%) ultimately underwent carotid revascularization at a median of 4 days. Individuals receiving both antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapy were significantly less likely to experience a moderate or severe stroke (44% vs 78%; P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Internal carotid artery occlusion is the culprit lesion in 43% of carotid-related strokes in those without previous symptoms. Previously asymptomatic patients not receiving combined antiplatelet and lipid-lowering medical therapy presenting with carotid-related stroke are significantly more likely to experience a severe, debilitating stroke. However, those receiving appropriate risk-reduction medical therapy are still at risk of carotid-mediated stroke. These results suggest medical therapy alone is unlikely to be sufficient stroke prevention for patients with significant carotid stenosis.

### Early carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis of internal carotid artery in patients affected by transient ischemic attack or minor-to-moderate ischemic acute stroke: a single-center experience [^abbb9223]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the setting of carotid transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor/moderate ischemic stroke, early surgical endarterectomy (CEA) seems to decrease the number of recurrences. The aim of the present study was to report a single-center experience with early surgical carotid revascularization in patients affected by TIA and minor/moderate ischemic acute stroke.

Methods

A retrospective data collection was carried out on all consecutive patients surgically treated for an extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) hemodynamic NASCET stenosis in the Vascular Unit of Foch Hospital, in Suresnes (France) between January 2011 and July 2016. All patients undergoing ICA endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis (SCS) within 48 hours and 14 days after the acute neurologic onset were included in the present study. Outcomes were evaluated by a prospective follow-up. Primary outcomes were the rate of postoperative ipsilateral stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) and the death/stroke/MI at 30-day and at the long-term follow-up. Secondary outcomes were local and systemic complications' rate. Outcomes were stratified according to NIHSS score and comorbidities, and a univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to define any correlation between preoperative data and postoperative outcomes.

Results

A total of 249 consecutive patients (45.4%, 113 symptomatic vs. 54.6%, 136 asymptomatic) underwent CEA for hemodynamically significant ICA stenosis at our institution. According to inclusion criteria, 72 patients affected by SCS (27.7% women vs. 72.3% men; median age 71.9 years, range: 42–89; median preoperative NIHSS score 3, range 1–17) were enrolled in the present study. Median delay for surgery was 4 days (range: 2–14). No in-hospital stroke, nor myocardial infarction nor death were detected during in-hospital post-operative period. The combined death/stroke/MI rate was 0% and 5.5% at 30-days at 6 years follow-up respectively. In-hospital NIHSS score improved post-operatively of more than 2 points (range 0–15) in 47.2% of cases. A total of 10 patients (13.8%) experienced a local complication (hematoma, permanent or regressive nerve injury). No systemic complications (renal/respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, pneumoniae) were registered. At long-term follow-up a total of four patients (5.5%) died and six patients (8.3%) were lost. The stratification of outcomes according to NIHSS status, sex, comorbidities and preoperative surgical procedure did not show any statistical relation neither at 30 days nor at the long term-follow up. Diabetes was statistically correlated to a higher rate of complication at the long-term follow-up (P 0.049).

Conclusions

In properly selected patients affected by minor/moderate ischemic acute stroke and TIA early carotid endarterectomy can be performed without any worsening of neurological status.

### Incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis without surgical intervention [^f088587b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Optimal management of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis is uncertain, due to advances in medical care and a lack of contemporary data comparing medical and surgical treatment.

Objective

To estimate stroke outcomes among patients with medically treated asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who did not undergo surgical intervention.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study that included 3737 adult participants with asymptomatic severe (70%-99%) carotid stenosis diagnosed between 2008 and 2012 and no prior intervention or ipsilateral neurologic event in the prior 6 months. Participants received follow-up through 2019, and all were members of an integrated US regional health system serving 4.5 million members.

Exposures

Imaging diagnosis of asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 70% to 99%.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Occurrence of ipsilateral carotid-related acute ischemic stroke. Censoring occurred with death, disenrollment, or ipsilateral intervention.

Results

Among 94 822 patients with qualifying imaging studies, 4230 arteries in 3737 (mean age, 73.8 [SD 9.5 years]; 57.4% male) patients met selection criteria including 2539 arteries in 2314 patients who never received intervention. The mean follow-up in this cohort was 4.1 years (SD 3.6 years). Prior to any intervention, there were 133 ipsilateral strokes with a mean annual stroke rate of 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7%-1.2%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of ipsilateral stroke by 5 years was 4.7% (95% CI, 3.9%-5.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In a community-based cohort of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who did not undergo surgical intervention, the estimated rate of ipsilateral carotid-related acute ischemic stroke was 4.7% over 5 years. These findings may inform decision-making regarding surgical and medical treatment for patients with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis.

### Management of carotid stenosis in women: consensus document [^ace01d6a]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Specific guidelines for management of cerebrovascular risk in women are currently lacking. This study aims to provide a consensus expert opinion to help make clinical decisions in women with carotid stenosis.

Methods

Proposals for the use of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid stenting (CAS), and medical therapy for stroke prevention in women with carotid stenosis were provided by a group of 9 international experts with consensus method.

Results

Symptomatic women with severe carotid stenosis can be managed by CEA provided that the perioperative risk of the operators is low (< 4%). Periprocedural stroke risks may be increased in symptomatic women if revascularization is performed by CAS; however, the choice of CAS vs CEA can be tailored in subgroups best fit for each procedure (e.g., women with restenosis or severe coronary disease, best suited for CAS; women with tortuous vessels or old age, best suited for CEA). There is currently limited evidence to consider medical therapy alone as the best choice for women with neurologically severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis, who should be best managed within randomized trials including a medical arm. Medical management and cardiovascular risk factor control must be implemented in all women with carotid stenosis in periprocedural period and lifelong regardless of whether or not intervention is planned.

Conclusions

The suggestions provided in this article may constitute a decision-making basis for planning treatment of carotid stenosis in women. Most recommendations are of limited strength; however, it is unlikely that new robust data will emerge soon to induce relevant changes.

### Symptomatic nonstenotic carotids: a topical review [^b4db5947]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Historically, the management of carotid artery disease has primarily focused on the degree of stenosis as the main indicator for assessing stroke etiology, risk, and need for intervention. However, accumulating evidence suggests that structural and biological features within the arterial wall, such as intraplaque hemorrhage, may have superior diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic values. Under current guidelines, unless an atheroma results in ≥ 50% stenosis, it is not considered the cause of a cerebrovascular event. This results in extensive and often unproductive diagnostic workup, prescription of ineffective medical therapy, and preclusion of patients from receiving revascularization procedures that have been shown to prevent recurrent cerebrovascular events in cases of ≥ 50% stenosis. A subset of embolic strokes of undetermined source, which account for up to 25% of all ischemic cerebrovascular events, are thought to be due to thromboembolic phenomena from undiagnosed plaque disruptions in nonstenotic arteries (< 50% stenosis). Recently, it has been proposed to reclassify this subgroup of patients as symptomatic nonstenotic carotid if the carotid plaque ipsilateral to the cerebrovascular event presents with high-risk features including intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap, and ulceration. In this review, we first provide a historical overview of the chain of events and circumstances that resulted in the present management of carotid artery disease. Second, we embed the contemporary biomarkers of plaque vulnerability in a modern mechanistic paradigm of carotid plaque disruption and thromboembolization. Third, we review the clinically available imaging tools to detect these biomarkers, and how their use has started to shed light on the prevalence and natural history of this underdiagnosed condition. Fourth, we review recent clinical studies employing a contemporary definition of symptomatic nonstenotic carotid and discuss targeted treatments for this condition. Finally, we make a case to generate the much-needed high-level evidence to align the clinical management of patients with symptomatic nonstenotic carotid with a contemporary understanding of plaque disruption and thromboembolization.

### Comparative safety and efficacy of transcarotid artery revascularization versus transfemoral carotid artery stenting: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fa4898e5]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid artery stenosis is a significant cause of ischemic stroke. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), a newer technique utilizing dynamic flow reversal, has emerged as a potentially safer alternative to transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare TCAR and TFCAS in patients undergoing carotid revascularization.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science through June 2025 for comparative studies evaluating TCAR vs TFCAS. Primary outcomes included 30-day and in-hospital mortality, stroke, and composite stroke/death. Secondary outcomes assessed myocardial infarction (MI), transient ischemic attack (TIA), procedural times, and periprocedural complications. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were pooled using random-effects models.

Results

Thirteen studies involving 142,032 patients were included in the analysis. TCAR significantly reduced 30-day mortality (RR 0.45; p < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (RR 0.45; p < 0.001), 30-day stroke (RR 0.66; p < 0.001), and composite 30-day stroke/death (RR 0.57; p < 0.001). TIA (RR 0.72; p < 0.001) and stroke/TIA (RR 0.66; p < 0.001) were also lower with TCAR. MI rates were similar overall, though asymptomatic patients had a higher 30-day MI risk with TCAR. TCAR reduced reperfusion injury (RR 0.38; p < 0.001) and hospital stay length (RR 0.76; p < 0.001), but had slightly longer operative times. Long-term data from two large cohorts confirmed TCAR's durable stroke risk reduction up to 3 years.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis of current observational data demonstrates that TCAR is associated with superior perioperative outcomes compared to TFCAS, with significantly lower rates of stroke and death. These findings support TCAR as a preferred endovascular treatment for eligible patients with carotid artery stenosis.

### Early results of carotid stent placement for treatment of extracranial carotid bifurcation occlusive disease [^13001ecb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the initial results of carotid artery angioplasty with stenting (CAS) performed by vascular surgeons to treat bifurcation occlusive disease. Most patients were selected for CAS if they had indications for endarterectomy (CEA) but were considered at high risk for surgery.

Methods

Since December 2000, 74 carotid arteries in 69 patients underwent CAS, with distal balloon embolization protection in 96%. Mean patient age was 72 years; 82% of patients were men. Indications for CAS included asymptomatic disease (62%), transient ischemic attack (TIA; 23%), and cerebrovascular accident (15%). Mean internal carotid artery diameter stenosis was 82%. CAS was chosen over CEA because of cardiac (49%) or pulmonary (4%) comorbid conditions, hostile neck (25%), distal extent of disease (6%), and contralateral cranial nerve injury (1%). CAS was performed in 15% patients who were good surgical candidates, because of patient preference. Pathologic conditions were primary atherosclerosis (81%), recurrent carotid stenosis (18%), and dissection (1%). Procedures were transfemoral in 95% of cases and transcarotid in 5%. In 30% of cases the contralateral carotid artery had 80% or greater stenosis or was completely occluded.

Results

Technical success was achieved in 96% of cases. There were no deaths, no major strokes, one minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 3), and one TIA (neurologic event rate, 2.6%). The single minor stroke resolved completely by 1 month. One patient (1.3%) had a perioperative myocardial infarction. Transient neurologic changes occurred in 8% of patients during the protection balloon inflation, and all resolved with deflation. Bradyarrhythmia requiring pharmacologic treatment occurred in 14% of patients. At mean follow-up of 6 months there have been two instances of recurrent stenosis greater than 50% as noted at duplex scanning. During the same period, 266 carotid CEAs were performed, with a neurologic event rate of 0.8% (major stroke, 0.4%; no minor strokes; TIA, 0.4%) and a myocardial infarction rate of 3%. Combined stroke and death rate was 1.3% in patients who underwent CAS and 0.5% in patients who underwent CEA.

Conclusion

CAS with cerebral protection can be performed safely in patients at high surgical risk, with low perioperative morbidity and mortality. The durability of the procedure must be determined with longer follow-up.

### Cough-induced transient ischemic attack treated with revascularization of the external carotid artery [^784f9cb7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old man presented with right arm and face weakness associated with severe coughing fits. A computed tomography angiogram revealed an occlusion of the left common and internal carotid arteries and an incomplete circle of Willis. An arch angiogram demonstrated reconstitution of the left external carotid artery, which collateralized with the intracranial left internal carotid artery. The patient underwent left subclavian-to-external carotid artery bypass with reversed saphenous vein, with complete resolution of symptoms over 1 year of follow-up. Cough-induced hemispheric transient ischemic attack is a rarely described hemodynamic phenomenon that can be managed with revascularization of the external carotid artery in select patients.

### Safety of carotid revascularization in symptomatic patients with less than 70 years [^b2cc3038]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Age is a main risk factor for stroke and perioperative risk. This study aims to analyze the effect of age by symptomatic status in young patients receiving carotid revascularization.

Methods

Consecutive carotid revascularization procedures performed during the period 2001–2009 were reviewed. Patients were analyzed by age using the 70-year threshold as suggested by trials. Primary end point was perioperative stroke or death rate. Secondary end points included survival and late stroke incidence at 6 years.

Results

A total of 2,196 procedures (1,080 by carotid artery stenting [CAS] and 1,116 by carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) were analyzed. Symptomatic patients (n = 684) showed higher perioperative stroke or death risks (24 of 684 [3.5%] versus 29 of 1,512 [1.9%], odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–3.22; P = 0.034) and lower 6-year survival (74% vs. 82%, P < 0.0001) or freedom from late stroke (93% vs. 97%, P = 0.001) when compared with asymptomatic patients with similar differences detected within CEA or CAS procedure. Overall 949 procedures were in patients with 70 years or less at the time of intervention (500 CEA and 449 CAS); 282 were in patients symptomatic for minor stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months before revascularization. For young symptomatic patients, primary end point rates were < 2.5% after both CEA and CAS procedure. Perioperative stroke or death rates were 2.4% in symptomatic versus 1.5% in asymptomatic (4 of 170 vs. 5 of 330; OR 1.57; 95% CI 0.42–5.91; P = 0.50) within the CEA group and 1.8% in symptomatic versus 1.2% in asymptomatic (2 of 112 vs. 4 of 337; OR 1.51; 95% CI 0.27–8.38; P = 0.64) within the CAS group. At 6 years, symptomatic young patients showed survival (89.5% vs. 89%, P = 0.76) and freedom from late stroke (97% vs. 98%, P = 0.56) rates comparable to those found in asymptomatic patients, with similar incidences after CAS or CEA procedure.

Conclusions

Outcomes after carotid revascularization are related to patients' age. At younger ages (< 70 years), after carotid revascularization, symptomatic patients show low perioperative risks of stroke or death, comparable with those in asymptomatic patients. The same, 2.5% or lower, threshold for perioperative stroke or death risk related to asymptomatic carotid procedures must be applied today to symptomatic patients when younger than age of 70 years.

Society for Vascular Surgery — screening indications and high-prevalence cohorts: Association guidelines noted that screening before CABG is probably indicated for the following subset of patients: age ≥ 65 years; left main coronary artery stenosis; a history of smoking, TIA, stroke, or carotid bruit; and PAD. Based on these and other reports, the SVS does advocate carotid artery screening for high-risk patients aged ≥ 55 years with appropriate cardiovascular risk factors. Reported prevalence signals include higher rates in diabetes (8.7% vs 2.8%) and in patients requiring hemodialysis with tunneled catheter placement (9.8%), with an overall prevalence of significant stenosis of 5.2% in a study of 1500 subjects. One investigator reported that screening of asymptomatic patients is appropriate if they were aged ≥ 60 years and had three or more traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. A systematic review and meta-analysis found screening in these defined populations revealed a benefit for mortality and less so for stroke, and identified cohorts expected to have an approximate prevalence of ≥ 20% of significant carotid stenosis even if asymptomatic — making them appropriate to consider for screening — including patients with current cigarette smoking; patients with hypertension and CAD; patients with renal failure and diabetes, hypertension, or CAD; and patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and CAD.

### Procedural safety comparison between transcarotid artery revascularization, carotid endarterectomy, and carotid stenting: perioperative and 1-year rates of stroke or death [^d0f3f09a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis is a major risk factor for stroke, the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. The mainstay for stroke‐risk reduction for patients with carotid stenosis is noninvasive best medical therapy (BMT), including risk factor identification and amelioration using lifestyle interventions and appropriate medications. In addition to BMT, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been demonstrated repeatedly to incrementally reduce the risk of stroke among appropriately selected patients (Table 1).,

Table 1
Patient Subgroups That Have a Stroke‐Risk Reduction Benefit With CEA Over BMT Alone Based on Historical Randomized Clinical Trials.,

Two additional procedures have since been widely adopted in the treatment of carotid occlusive disease, under the assumption that they too will provide a stroke‐reduction benefit over BMT. In the 2000s the Food and Drug Administration approved transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF‐CAS) to treat patients with carotid stenosis, despite mixed evidence surrounding its periprocedural risks compared with CEA. More recently, in 2015 the Food and Drug Administration approved a third procedure to treat high‐risk patients, called transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). This approval was granted in the absence of a dedicated randomized trial comparing it to BMT or other procedures. TCAR has since been rapidly adopted into practice and now accounts for ≈1 in 5 carotid procedures across the 247 US centers that offer it as of June 2020. Moreover, in May 2022 the approved indications were broadened to include standard‐risk patients.

The patient subgroups with carotid stenosis with an overall benefit from CEA in the above‐mentioned randomized trials (or with an overall benefit from early versus deferred CEA) had to satisfy all trial selection criteria, have a life expectancy of at least 3 to 5 years, and fit into 1 of the 4 following groups,:
Men aged < 75 to 80 years with 60% to 99% asymptomatic (or recently asymptomatic) carotid stenosis (by way of conventional intra‐rterial angiography or ultrasound and NASCET [North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial] criteria),
Symptomatic women with 70% to 99% stenosis (by way of conventional intra‐arterial angiography and NASCET criteria) having CEA within 2–3 weeks of their last same‐sided nonsevere stroke or transient ischemic attack.
Symptomatic men with 50% to 69% stenosis (by way of conventional intra‐arterial angiography and NASCET criteria) having CEA within 2 to 3 weeks of their last same‐sided nonsevere stroke or transient ischemic attack.
Symptomatic men with 70% to 99% stenosis (by way of conventional intra‐arterial angiography and NASCET criteria) having CEA within 3 months of their last same‐sided nonsevere stroke or transient ischemic attack. However, the benefit fell rapidly over this time and was highest within 2 to 3 weeks of their last same‐sided nonsevere stroke or transient ischemic attack.

### Common reasons that asymptomatic patients who are 65 years and older receive carotid imaging [^8693775f]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

National guidelines do not agree on the role of carotid screening in asymptomatic patients (ie, patients who have not had a stroke or transient ischemic attack). Recently, several physician organizations participating in the Choosing Wisely campaign have identified carotid imaging in selected asymptomatic populations as being of low value. However, the majority of patients who are evaluated for carotid stenosis and subsequently revascularized are asymptomatic.

Objective

To better understand why asymptomatic patients who undergo revascularization receive initial carotid imaging.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study of 4127 Veterans Health Administration patients 65 years and older undergoing carotid revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis between 2005 and 2009.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Indications for carotid ultrasounds were extracted using trained abstractors. Frequency of indications and appropriateness of initial carotid ultrasound imaging for patients within each rating category after the intervention were reported.

Results

The mean (SD) age of this cohort of 4127 patients was 73.6 (5.9) years; 4014 (98.8%) were male. Overall, there were 5226 indications for 4063 carotid ultrasounds. The most common indications listed were carotid bruit (1578 [30.2% of indications]) and follow-up for carotid disease (stenosis/history of carotid disease) in patients who had previously documented carotid stenosis (1087 [20.8% of indications]). Multiple vascular risk factors were the next most common indication listed. Rates of appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate imaging were 5.4% (227 indications), 83.4% (3387 indications), and 11.3% (458 indications), respectively. Among the most common inappropriate indications were dizziness/vertigo and syncope. Among the 4063 patients, 3373 (83.0%) received a carotid endarterectomy. Overall, 663 procedures were performed in patients 80 years and older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Carotid bruit and follow-up for carotid disease accounted for approximately half of all indications provided by physicians for carotid testing. Strong consideration should be given to improving the evidence base around carotid testing, especially around monitoring stenosis over long periods and evaluating carotid bruits. Targeting carotid ultrasound ordering with decision support tools may also be an important step in reducing use of low-value imaging.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^98e56494]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Extracranial carotid disease — screening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis: To date, there is no consensus on which patients should undergo carotid screening for the detection of carotid stenosis. When the prevalence of stenosis is ≥ 20%, screening reduced the risk of stroke in a cost-effective manner; with intermediate prevalence of between 5% and 20%, screening reduced the risk of stroke in a cost-effective manner in some studies, but the benefit was usually marginal and was lost if complications of the intervention > 5%; with a prevalence of < 5%, screening has not been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a cost-effective manner and may be harmful. Given these assumptions, screening of the general population is not indicated. The American Stroke Association/American Stroke Council concluded that highly selected patient populations may benefit, but screening of the general population for asymptomatic carotid stenosis was unlikely to be cost-effective and might have the potential adverse effect of false-negative or false-positive results. A Clinical Expert Consensus Panel on Carotid Stenting recommended screening for asymptomatic patients with carotid bruit who are potential candidates for carotid intervention and for those in whom coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is planned.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^a1330ff4]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — AHA/ASA key points 6–10 state that atrial fibrillation remains a common and high-risk condition for second ischemic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended if the patient has no contraindications; heart rhythm monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation is usually recommended if no other cause of stroke is discovered. Extracranial carotid artery disease is an important and treatable cause of stroke, and patients with severe stenosis ipsilateral to a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack who are candidates for intervention should have the stenosis fixed, likely relatively early after their ischemic stroke; the choice between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting should be driven by specific patient comorbidities and features of their vascular anatomy. Patients with severe intracranial stenosis in the vascular territory of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should not receive angioplasty and stenting as a first-line therapy for preventing recurrence, and aggressive medical management of risk factors and short-term dual antiplatelet therapy are preferred. For selected patients with patent foramen ovale, it is now considered reasonable to percutaneously close patent foramen ovale in patients who meet each of the following criteria: age 18–60 years, nonlacunar stroke, no other identified cause, and high risk patent foramen ovale features. Patients with embolic stroke of uncertain source should not be treated empirically with anticoagulants or ticagrelor because it was found to be of no benefit.

A single-center series reported a 30-day death and stroke rate of 2.4% when CEA was performed within 48 hours of symptom onset, and multivariate analysis across stratified cohorts showed that performing CEA at 3 to 7 days after stroke was protective for postoperative stroke/death (P = 0.003) and any postoperative complication (P = 0.028); the investigators concluded that surgery should be delayed for ≥ 48 hours after acute stroke and should be performed within 14 days. In the Swedish Vascular Registry including 2596 patients, the combined stroke/death rate was 11.5% within the first 2 days versus 3.6%, 4.0%, and 5.4% at 3 to 7, 8 to 14, and 15 to 180 days, respectively; patients undergoing CEA within the first 2 days had a relative OR of 4.24 (95% CI, 2.07–8.70; P < .001) for perioperative complications compared with those undergoing surgery within 3 to 7 days. Additional data demonstrated an increased risk of complications if CEA were performed within 48 hours (RR, 2.305) for stroke but no difference between 2 and 14 days. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that CEA performed early (< 2 weeks) after an acute stroke is preferable to a delay of 4 to 6 weeks to CEA.

### Impact of carotid interventions on headache relief in patients with carotid stenosis: a retrospective analysis of carotid endarterectomy versus stenting [^88fb7dde]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carotid artery stenosis is an important risk factor for stroke, and carotid revascularization is important for reducing stroke risk in patients with moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial showed a definitive benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with symptomatic 70–99% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. There are two techniques used for carotid revascularization: CEA, which involves the surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaques, and carotid artery stenting (CAS), which involves placing a stent to widen the narrowed artery. Both methods effectively reduce the incidence of stroke, but have different procedural characteristics and effects. The late 20th century Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Trial reported an incidence of death or stroke in the first 3 years. Similarly, in the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy (SPACE) study, the adverse events between the two groups did not differ at the 2-year follow-up. Notably, studies comparing CAS and CEA have focused primarily on major adverse events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality. However, headaches are a common symptom of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. Fisherobserved headache occurrence in 31% of individuals with ICA disease. Edmeads and Barnettreported a similar prevalence, with 35% of patients with carotid artery disease experiencing headache. Major adverse events are commonly studied, but post-procedural symptom management, such as headache relief, is less well explored. Limited research has explored post-procedural headache, yet, to date, no direct comparison of headache outcomes following CAS and CEA exists in the literature. In this retrospective study, we aimed to address this gap by comparing the incidence and severity of postprocedural headaches in patients with carotid artery stenosis who underwent CAS or CEA, offering insights into symptom relief outcomes following revascularization.

### Carotid shunt provides cerebral protection during emergency coronary artery bypass grafting in a patient with bilateral high grade carotid stenosis: a case report [^bc36c912]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The optimal management of patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease remains controversial. Various strategies have been proposed such as CEA alone, or CABG alone, or staged CEA and CABG, or staged carotid artery stenting (CAS) and CABG, and simultaneous CEA and CABG, or simultaneous CAS and CABG. In the majority of these approaches the CEA or CAS precedes the CABG because it seems that reduces the perioperative neurological morbidity and mortality. We report a case where the CEA procedure was interrupted by the CABG. The carotid procedure was finished after the completion of the CABG. All these handlings were possible through a temporary carotid shunt which proved sufficient to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion for 90 minutes. To our knowledge prolonged cerebral perfusion through a shunt during on pump emergency CABG in patients with bilateral severe carotid stenosis has not been previously reported.

Besides carotid artery stenosis, other stroke risk factors during CABG, frequently quoted in the literature, are: ascending aortic atherosclerosis, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, left ventricular dysfunction, left main CAD, renal failure, and increased cardiopulmonary bypass time. Our patient had the majority of these risk factors (age, left CAD, heavy smoker in the past, left ventricular dysfunction, peripheral arterial disease). The only preventive measure against stroke were the carotid shunt, which proved to be adequate, and the patent vertebral arteries.

In a recent case report the authors applied a 14 Fr cannula into the distal part of the internal carotid artery. A separate pump was connected in cannula and arterial blood at 23°C was delivered at a flow rate of 300 ml/min. Although, based on classical findings, the normal carotid artery flow rate is 133–200 ml/min, the appropriate flow rate of the active cerebral perfusion is still unclear. However, under CPB the cerebral autoregulation is severely impaired, thus a flow rate of 300 ml/min may result to hyperperfusion syndrome and cerebral hemorrhage. Moreover, differences between our technique and the previous mentioned are obvious. Our technique is less complicated, less expensive and less time consuming. Therefore, our report suggests that a carotid shunt could maintain cerebral perfusion and could provide cerebral protection for at least 90 minutes ECC in patient with high grade bilateral carotid stenosis.

Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) carotid screening — general asymptomatic individuals: We recommend against the routine screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis for individuals without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease. Screening has been found to reduce the risk of stroke in a cost-effective manner when the prevalence of significant stenosis is ≥ 20%, but with a prevalence of < 5% in the general population, screening does not appear to reduce the stroke risk and might, in fact, be harmful; the rate of false-positive carotid Duplex ultrasound findings could be increased in a population with such a low prevalence of disease.

Extracranial cerebrovascular and carotid duplex ultrasound — appropriate use and surveillance: In patients with signs or clinical symptoms of cerebrovascular disease, 7 of 8 clinical indications rated as appropriate and 1 clinical indication rated as uncertain. For suspected vertebral artery stenosis, guidelines recommend other imaging modalities (i.e., magnetic resonance angiogram or computed tomography angiography) rather than ultrasound as the initial imaging test. For carotid artery dissection in trauma, carotid ultrasound is not recommended and another other imaging modality (i.e. MRA or CTA) should be used. For syncope with no obvious cardiac cause, use was rated as uncertain by the panel. For asymptomatic patients with risk factors or comorbidities associated with carotid artery stenosis, 6 of 7 indications received an uncertain rating and only 1 indication received an appropriate rating, and all clinical scenarios for cerebrovascular duplex examination prior to cardiac surgery were rated as uncertain, including prior to CABG and valvular surgery. Regarding surveillance after initial diagnosis, any follow-up was deemed inappropriate after a normal baseline carotid examination; for plaque without narrowing or mid stenosis of < 50%, only surveillance during the first year of follow-up was deemed inappropriate and beyond the first year was uncertain. For moderate internal carotid artery lesions, repeat studies within the first year were rated as inappropriate (at 3 to 5 months) or uncertain, with annual studies rated as appropriate; for severe internal carotid artery lesions, an ultrasound at 6 months and then every 6 or 12 months were rated as appropriate, while the risks versus benefits of revascularization should be considered. After carotid revascularization, obtaining a baseline bilateral cerebrovascular duplex examination was highly rated as appropriate, and cerebrovascular ultrasound was rated as appropriate for patients with suspected vertebrobasilar occlusive disease with posterior circulation symptoms.

### An uncommon cause of stroke in young adults… [^ca734df3]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. We describe a previously healthy 48-year-old man who presented with clinical characteristics suggestive of internal carotid artery dissection, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. He developed a massive infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and died after 3 days of transtentorial herniation. Postmortem examination identified a dissection of the thoracic aorta caused by Erdheim-Gsell cystic medionecrosis, with the characteristic degeneration of the elastic fibers of the lamina media. The dissection showed an unusually large extension not only distally into both iliac arteries, but also proximally into both carotid arteries. To our knowledge, such an extensive dissection has not been described previously. Underlying vessel wall disorders of the aorta, such as Erdheim Gsell cystic medionecrosis, should be considered in young patients with spontaneous arterial dissection.

Although ischemic stroke is more common with increasing age, it is certainly not rare in young adults. Estimates of its incidence in patients aged 15 to 39 years, for example, range from 6 per 100, 000 in whites to 15 per 100, 000 in blacks. 1 In this case report, we describe a 48-year-old male patient with a massive infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere caused by a rather uncommon nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy that has received little attention in the neurological literature. Report of a case On January 18, 1997, a previously healthy, nonsmoking 48-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital. A few hours before admission, he experienced acute pain on the left side of the neck while he was exercising on a running belt. Thirty minutes later, he experienced failing vision in his left eye, followed shortly thereafter by the loss of muscle strength in his right arm and expressive dysphasia.

There was complete restoration of neurological function after approximately 30 minutes. The patient's family history was negative for vascular events. General examination on admission showed blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg; auscultation revealed normal heart and lung sounds. Results of routine hematologic and biochemical blood investigation were unremarkable. Computed tomography of the brain showed no abnormalities. One hour after admission, the patient suddenly developed mixed aphasia with flaccid hemiparalysis of the right side and an ipsilateral Babinski sign. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thrombus in the left internal carotid artery with a large arteria cerebri media infarction. No anticoagulant treatment was started because of the extent of the infarction. Three days later, he died with the clinical symptoms of a transtentorial herniation. Autopsy showed a dissection of the thoracic aorta, with a tear of about 1.

5 cm just below the opening of the left subclavian artery that continued distally into the abdominal aorta and both iliac arteries and proximally into both internal carotid arteries. At the level of the left carotid bifurcation, there was almost complete obstruction of the internal carotid artery caused by a thrombus in the dissected vessel wall. More distally into the left internal carotid artery, continuing into the left middle cerebral artery, a thrombus completely occluded the vessel lumen. The left cerebral hemisphere was edematous, with signs of transtentorial herniation. Microscopic examination of the aortic tissue and other larger arteries showed elaborate degeneration of the elastic fibers in the media that was compatible with the histopathological diagnosis of Erdheim-Gsell cystic medionecrosis. Microscopic examination of the carotid artery of the patient.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) among asymptomatic patients involves a trade-off between a higher short-term perioperative risk in exchange for a lower long-term risk of stroke. The clinical benefit observed in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may not extend to real-world practice.

Objective

To examine whether early intervention (CEA) was superior to initial medical therapy in real-world practice in preventing fatal and nonfatal strokes among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study was conducted from August 28, 2018, to March 2, 2020, using the Corporate Data Warehouse, Suicide Data Repository, and other databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Data analyzed were those of veterans of the US Armed Forces aged 65 years or older who received carotid imaging between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009. Patients without a carotid imaging report, those with carotid stenosis of less than 50% or hemodynamically insignificant stenosis, and those with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack in the 6 months before index imaging were excluded. A cohort of patients who received initial medical therapy and a cohort of similar patients who received CEA were constructed and followed up for 5 years. The target trial method was used to compute weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and estimate the risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes in each cohort in the pragmatic sample across 5 years of follow-up. This analysis was repeated after restricting the sample to patients who met RCT inclusion criteria. Cumulative incidence functions for fatal and nonfatal strokes were estimated, accounting for nonstroke deaths as competing risks in both the pragmatic and RCT-like samples.

Exposures

Receipt of CEA vs initial medical therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Fatal and nonfatal strokes.

Results

Of the total 5221 patients, 2712 (51.9%; mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.0] years; 2678 men [98.8%]) received CEA and 2509 (48.1%; mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.0] years; 2479 men [98.8%]) received initial medical therapy within 1 year after the index carotid imaging. The observed rate of stroke or death (perioperative complications) within 30 days in the CEA cohort was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%). The 5-year risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes was lower among patients randomized to CEA compared with patients randomized to initial medical therapy (5.6% vs 7.8%; risk difference, -2.3%; 95% CI, -4.0% to -0.3%). In an analysis that incorporated the competing risk of death, the risk difference between the 2 cohorts was lower and not statistically significant (risk difference, -0.8%; 95% CI, -2.1% to 0.5%). Among patients who met RCT inclusion criteria, the 5-year risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes was 5.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-6.5%) among patients randomized to CEA and was 7.6% (95% CI, 5.7%-9.5%) among those randomized to initial medical therapy (risk difference, -2.1%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -0.2%). Accounting for competing risks resulted in a risk difference of -0.9% (95% CI, -2.9% to 0.7%) that was not statistically significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that the absolute reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes associated with early CEA was less than half the risk difference in trials from 20 years ago and was no longer statistically significant when the competing risk of nonstroke deaths was accounted for in the analysis. Given the nonnegligible perioperative 30-day risks and the improvements in stroke prevention, medical therapy may be an acceptable therapeutic strategy.

### Safety of carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis by age: meta-analysis with individual patient data [^bc00a929]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The search of electronic published work produced 8726 references (including 986 duplicates), of which 39 articles were eligible for inclusion. A total of 32 articles were further identified by hand-searching of reference lists, 8 of which were eligible. Forty-seven studies, comprising 107 587 patients and 23 188 octogenarians, met the inclusion criteria: 7 prospective cohort studies, 25 retrospective cohort studies, 6 registries, and 7 randomized controlled trials. Most of the cohorts were from North America (n = 16), Europe (n = 11), with 3 from Asia, 1 from Australia, and 1 from New Zealand. The year of publication, demographic details, study design, and surgical methods are summarized in.

Data from 104 689 patients, including 21 115 octogenarians, were included in the meta-analysis of perioperative stroke, MI, and death. Older versus younger patients had higher risk of stroke, MI, and death via in-study cut-point analysis (Figure 1). Risk of perioperative stroke was 1.89% (95% CI, 1.79–1.95%) overall, and 2.04% (95% CI, 1.94–2.14%) in octogenarians (390 strokes in 19 101 patients) versus 1.85% (95% CI, 1.75–1.95%) in nonoctogenarians (1395 strokes in 75 537 patients); P = 0.046. Risk of perioperative MI was 1.39% (95% CI, 1.32–1.46%) overall, and 1.66% (1.55–1.77%) in octogenarians (141 MI in 8470 patients) versus 1.31% (95% CI, 1.24–1.38%) in nonoctogenarians (349 MI in 26 722 patients); P = 0.009. Perioperative death was 0.65% (95% CI, 0.60–0.70%) overall, and 1.09% (95% CI, 0.94–1.25%) in octogenarians (203 deaths in 18 702 patients) versus 0.53% (95% CI, 0.48–0.59%) in nonoctogenarians (392 deaths in 73 327 patients); P < 0.001. Meta-analysis of studies with age cut-points from 65 through 80 years revealed an increased risk of perioperative events across all age cut-points; maximal (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.07–1.53]) for stroke, (OR, 1.83 [CI, 1.51–2.21]) for MI, and (OR, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.56–3.61]) for mortality. Sensitivity analysis in relation to study type revealed higher pooled perioperative stroke risk in elderly patients in registries (OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.07–1.35]), but not in trials (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.95–1.26]), and cohort studies (OR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.7–1.59]). When stratified by study quality, meta-analysis of high-quality studies showed consistent results with the main analysis (OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06–1.35]). The age effect was not significant in meta-analysis of studies with low to medium quality (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.97–1.26]).

### Long-term stroke risk with carotid endarterectomy in patients with severe carotid stenosis [^fd6d68ef]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Informed debate regarding the optimal use of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for stroke risk reduction requires contemporary assessment of both long-term risk and periprocedural risk. In this study, we report long-term stroke and death risk after CEA in a large integrated health care system.

Methods

All patients with documented severe (70%-99%) stenosis from 2008 to 2012 who underwent CEA were identified and stratified by asymptomatic or symptomatic indication. Those with prior ipsilateral interventions were excluded. Patients were followed up through 2017 for the primary outcomes of any stroke/death within 30 days of intervention and long-term ipsilateral ischemic stroke; secondary outcomes were any stroke and overall survival.

Results

Overall, 1949 patients (63.2% male; mean age, 71.3 ± 8.9 years) underwent 2078 primary CEAs, 1196 (58%) for asymptomatic stenosis and 882 (42%) for symptomatic stenosis. Mean follow-up was 5.5 ± 2.7 years. Median time to surgery was 72.0 (interquartile range, 38.5–198.0) days for asymptomatic patients and 21.0 (interquartile range, 5.0–55.0) days for symptomatic patients (P < .001). Most of the patients' demographics and characteristics were similar in both groups. Controlled blood pressure rates were similar at the time of CEA. Baseline statin use was seen in 60.5% of the asymptomatic group compared with 39.9% in the symptomatic group (P < .001), and statin adherence by 80% medication possession ratio was 19.3% asymptomatic vs 12.4% symptomatic (P < .001). The crude overall 30-day any stroke/death rates were 0.9% and 1.5% for the asymptomatic group and the symptomatic group, respectively. The 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke and a combined end point of any stroke/death by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were 2.5% and 28.7% for the asymptomatic group and 4.0% and 31.4% for the symptomatic group, respectively. Unadjusted cumulative all-cause survival was 74.2% for the asymptomatic group and 71.8% for the symptomatic group at 5 years.

Conclusions

In a contemporary review of CEA, outcomes for either operative indication show low adverse events perioperatively and low long-term stroke risk up to 5 years. These results are well within consensus guidelines and published trial outcomes and should help inform the discussion around optimal CEA use for severe carotid stenosis.

### Submaximal angioplasty for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis: a prospective phase I study [^f464cdc0]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) accounts for approximately 10% of ischemic strokes. The recent Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study demonstrated a high incidence of perioperative complications (15%) for treatment of ICAD with stenting. Although the incidence of stroke was lower in the medical arm, recurrent stroke was found in 12% of patients despite aggressive medical management, suggesting that intervention may remain a viable option for ICAD if perioperative risk is minimized. Angioplasty without stenting represents an alternative and understudied revascularization treatment for ICAD. Submaximal angioplasty limits the risks of thromboembolism, vessel perforation, and reperfusion hemorrhage that were frequently reported with stenting in the SAMMPRIS trial. The authors conducted a prospective Phase I trial designed to assess the safety of submaximal angioplasty in patients with symptomatic ICAD. METHODS This study was approved by the local institutional review board. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Angioplasty was performed with a balloon undersized to approximately 50%-70% of the nondiseased vessel diameter in patients with symptomatic ICAD who had angiographically significant stenosis of ≥ 70%. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of periprocedural complications (combined rate of death, stroke, and hemorrhage occurring within 30 days and at 1 year). RESULTS Among the 65 patients with symptomatic ICAD who were screened, 24 had significant angiographic stenosis that met the inclusion criteria of this study. The mean age was 64.08 years (median 65 years; SD ± 11.24 years), most were men (62.5%), and most were white (66.67%). Many patients had concomitants of vascular disease, including hypertension (95.8%), hyperlipidemia (70.83%), smoking history (54.1%), and diabetes mellitus (50.0%). Coronary artery disease (41.66%) and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (45.83%) were frequently present. Most patients (75%) had anterior circulation stenosis. The mean preprocedure stenosis was 80.16% (median 80%, range 70%-95%). Submaximal angioplasty was performed in patients who met the inclusion criteria, with a mean postangioplasty stenosis rate of 54.62% (median 55.5%, range 31%-78%). Rates of ischemic stroke in the territory of the treated artery were 0% within 30 days and 5.55% (in the only patient who presented with recurrent stroke) at 1 year. The mortality and hemorrhage rates in this series were 0%. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the safety of the submaximal angioplasty technique, with no permanent periprocedural complications in 24 treated patients.

### Acute carotid stenting for treatment of stuttering transient ischemic attacks after recent carotid endarterectomy [^4a7b487a]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the established standard to treat occlusive extracranial atherosclerotic carotid disease. Complications of CEA must be recognized and dealt with efficiently due to the potentially catastrophic neurologic sequelae. A 67-year-old African American man was transferred from an outside hospital for an acute stroke. He had initially presented with a small right frontal subcortical infarct and had undergone a right CEA 2 days prior to transfer. He had a fluctuating examination with left-sided hemiplegia to slight hemiparesis and inconsistent neglect. Head CT demonstrated a watershed infarct of the right hemisphere. CT angiography demonstrated high grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the CEA anastomosis. He was promptly taken for angiography and underwent acute stenting of the right internal carotid artery. This case demonstrates that carotid artery stenting is a safe management strategy for the treatment of complications associated with failed distal anastomosis during CEA.
