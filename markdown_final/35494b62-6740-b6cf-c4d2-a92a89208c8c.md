## Question

A 12-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents due to increased irritability, difficulty sleeping, and weight loss over the past month. On examination, she is anxious, has a fine tremor, and her heart rate is 118 beats per minute. Laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis of Graves' disease. She has no history of asthma or other contraindications to beta-blockers.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate next step in the initial management of this patient's symptoms?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in the initial management of a 12-year-old girl with newly diagnosed Graves' disease, symptomatic with tachycardia, tremor, anxiety, and weight loss, and no contraindications to beta-blockers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate symptomatic control versus disease-modifying therapy. Then, I should verify pediatric-specific guideline recommendations for beta-blockade. Next, I will consider which beta-blocker to choose and why. After that, I need to check dosing and monitoring. Finally, I should confirm when to taper and how this integrates with antithyroid drug therapy and follow-up labs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priority. In symptomatic hyperthyroidism, especially with adrenergic features like tachycardia, tremor, and anxiety, immediate symptomatic relief with beta-blockade is indicated while definitive therapy with antithyroid drugs is initiated in parallel, because beta-blockers act within hours to days, whereas methimazole takes weeks to normalize thyroid hormone levels [^ef3aee9b] [^e7de517c].

> Wait, let me verify the pediatric-specific guidance. The 2016 ATA guideline explicitly recommends initiating beta-adrenergic blockers in children with symptomatic hyperthyroidism, particularly when heart rate exceeds 100 bpm, which fits this patient at 118 bpm. The 2022 ETA pediatric guideline similarly advises initiating beta-blockers in children with marked signs of thyroid hormone excess and discontinuing once biochemically euthyroid, reinforcing early use for symptom control [^ef3aee9b] [^c708171b].

> I should confirm the rationale and scope of benefit. Beta-blockers mitigate adrenergic symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, tachycardia, heat intolerance, and anxiety, and they are safe to start promptly in children without contraindications. They do not treat the underlying disease, so they must be paired with antithyroid therapy for definitive control [^e7de517c] [^ae9c4c86].

> Hold on, I should verify the choice of agent. Historically, propranolol was used for its nonselective blockade and inhibition of T4-to-T3 conversion, but long-acting, once-daily, beta-1 selective agents like atenolol or metoprolol are now preferred for convenience and tolerability. In children, propranolol remains commonly used and acceptable, but atenolol is a reasonable alternative when beta-1 selectivity is desired or asthma is a concern, even though this patient has no asthma history [^e7de517c] [^ae9c4c86].

> Let me think about dosing and monitoring. Typical pediatric dosing uses propranolol in the range of 1–2 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours, with adjustments based on heart rate and symptom control. Given the severity here, starting at the higher end and titrating to effect is reasonable, with reassessment of heart rate, tremor, and anxiety within 24–48 hours. I should double-check that we plan to continue beta-blockade until thyroid hormone levels normalize, usually 4–6 weeks, and then taper as euthyroidism is achieved [^ae9c4c86] [^c708171b].

> Next, I should review integration with definitive therapy. Antithyroid drug therapy with methimazole should be initiated concurrently or as soon as feasible, with baseline CBC and liver function tests, and early follow-up of free T4 and total T3 every 2–6 weeks initially, since TSH can remain suppressed for months. This parallel approach ensures symptom control while disease-modifying therapy takes effect [^4176f055] [^8c2496a0].

> But wait, what if symptoms are mild or heart rate is borderline? I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. The ATA still supports beta-blockade for symptomatic pediatric patients, especially with HR > 100 bpm, and the ETA advises initiation when there are marked signs of hormone excess; thus, even moderate symptoms with clear adrenergic features justify beta-blockade in this case [^ef3aee9b] [^c708171b].

> Final answer: Initiate a beta-blocker now for immediate symptomatic relief, with propranolol as a common first choice in pediatrics, while starting methimazole for definitive control. Continue beta-blockade until the patient is biochemically euthyroid and symptoms resolve, then taper and discontinue [^ef3aee9b] [^c708171b] [^e7de517c].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **start a beta-blocker** (e.g. propranolol or atenolol) for rapid symptom control of adrenergic symptoms (tachycardia, tremor, anxiety) while initiating antithyroid therapy (methimazole) for definitive treatment. Beta-blockers are **first-line for symptomatic relief** in pediatric Graves' disease, especially with heart rate > 100 bpm, and can be tapered once euthyroidism is achieved [^ef3aee9b] [^c708171b]. Methimazole should be started concurrently or shortly thereafter to normalize thyroid hormone levels, with baseline CBC and liver function tests and close monitoring of thyroid function every 2–6 weeks [^4176f055] [^8c2496a0].

---

## Rationale for beta-blocker therapy

Beta-blockers provide **rapid relief** of adrenergic symptoms (tachycardia, tremor, anxiety, heat intolerance) within hours, improving comfort and safety while definitive therapy takes effect [^e7de517c]. They are indicated in pediatric Graves' disease when there are marked signs of thyroid hormone excess, particularly with heart rate > 100 bpm [^c708171b] [^ef3aee9b]. Propranolol is commonly used and is nonselective with additional benefit of inhibiting T4-to-T3 conversion; atenolol is a selective beta-1 alternative with once-daily dosing and fewer CNS effects [^e7de517c] [^ae9c4c86].

---

## Recommended beta-blocker dosing and monitoring

- **Propranolol**: 1–2 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours; titrate to effect and tolerance.
- **Atenolol**: 1–2 mg/kg once daily; monitor for bradycardia, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
- **Monitoring**: Check heart rate and blood pressure at each visit; taper and discontinue once biochemically euthyroid and symptoms resolve [^c708171b].

---

## Concurrent initiation of antithyroid drug therapy

Methimazole is the **first-line antithyroid drug** for pediatric Graves' disease due to efficacy, safety, and once-daily dosing [^c571a3fb]. Typical pediatric dosing is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day, adjusted to thyroid hormone levels; higher initial doses may be used in severe cases, then reduced as euthyroidism is achieved [^c571a3fb] [^cd9d9b7d]. Baseline CBC and liver function tests are recommended before starting methimazole, with thyroid function monitoring every 2–6 weeks initially [^4176f055] [^8c2496a0].

---

## Clinical guidelines supporting beta-blocker use

Both the ATA and ETA recommend **beta-blockers** for symptomatic pediatric Graves' disease, especially with heart rate > 100 bpm or marked adrenergic symptoms, and advise continuation until biochemical euthyroidism is achieved [^ef3aee9b] [^c708171b]. They also emphasize initiating antithyroid therapy promptly to prevent complications of prolonged hyperthyroidism [^0390fa26].

---

## Potential risks and contraindications

Beta-blockers are generally safe in children without significant contraindications; however, **asthma** is a relative contraindication — if needed, use a selective beta-1 blocker (e.g. atenolol) with caution and monitor for bronchospasm [^ef3aee9b]. Rare adverse effects include bradycardia, fatigue, and sleep disturbance; monitor closely and adjust dosing as needed [^ae9c4c86].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Timing** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blocker (propranolol or atenolol) | Symptomatic hyperthyroidism (HR > 100, tremor, anxiety) | Immediate | Heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms |
| Methimazole | Definitive therapy | Concurrent or shortly after beta-blocker | - CBC <br/> - LFTs <br/> - Thyroid function every 2–6 weeks |

---

The most appropriate next step is to **initiate a beta-blocker** for rapid symptom control while starting methimazole for definitive therapy, with close monitoring of symptoms and thyroid function [^ef3aee9b] [^c708171b].

Medical Management of GD

Initial Management

Initial management of hyperthyroidism due to GD often occurs while awaiting confirmatory testing. The goals of initial management are to mitigate symptoms of hyperthyroidism using beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and normalize thyroid hormone levels with ATDs.

Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism that are caused by increased adrenergic tone like tremors, palpitations, tachycardia, heat intolerance, and anxiety. They should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made. All beta-blockers are equally effective in relieving such symptoms. Propranolol is nonselective beta-blockade that has been historically used to control adrenergic symptoms because it blocks the peripheral conversion of FT4 to FT3. However, its short duration of action and need for multiple doses a day has given way to preferred use of long-acting beta-1 receptor selective blockers like atenolol and metoprolol with once-a-day dosing (Table 2). – In the setting of severe thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm in patients with hemodynamic instability, esmolol drip in the intensive care setting can be considered. Common side effects of beta-blockers are described in Table 2.

As thyroid hormone levels normalize and symptoms resolve, beta-blockers can be tapered and ultimately discontinued. In patients who do not tolerate or are not candidates for beta-adrenergic blockade, calcium-channel blockers like verapamil and diltiazem have been shown to affect rate control.

### Approach to the pediatric patient with Graves' disease: when is definitive therapy warranted? [^a7880231]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Pediatric Graves' disease accounts for 10–15% of thyroid disorders in patients less than 18 yr of age. The onset of symptoms may be insidious and subsequently associated with a delay in diagnosis. Decreased concentration and poor school performance are frequent complaints and can be quite frustrating for the patient and family. Severe ophthalmopathy is uncommon. The diagnosis is established by the findings of an increased heart rate and goiter in the setting of a suppressed TSH and elevated T(3) and/or T(4). The majority of pediatric patients are initially placed on antithyroid medications and maintained on these medications for prolonged periods of time in hopes of achieving remission. Unfortunately, for many children and adolescents remission is unattainable, ultimately occurring in only 15–30% of patients. Several recent studies have suggested that the age of the patient, the degree of thyrotoxicosis at diagnosis, the initial response to therapy, and the level of TSH receptor antibodies serve as reasonable predictors of remission and relapse. However, a consensus on the utility of these markers has not been reached. The present clinical case describes an adolescent with Graves' disease and highlights the negative impact that prolonged medical therapy can have on quality of life and school performance; it reviews pertinent data on the diagnosis, comorbidities, and treatment options; and it identifies gaps in knowledge for when definitive therapy should be pursued. The case serves as a reminder that earlier discussion and decision for definitive therapy should be more commonplace in caring for our pediatric patients with Graves' disease.

Clinical assessment

The diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis is relatively simple in children presenting with the typical features of tremor and goitre on a background of tiredness and weight loss. However, a wide variety of symptoms and signs may be present at diagnosis (figures 1 and 2) thereby making clinical diagnosis challenging, especially in mild cases. In thyrotoxicosis, deteriorating academic performance and anxiety could be incorrectly attributed to psychosocial stressors, while mild degrees of lid retraction or a small goitre might be overlooked. Nonetheless, the presence of more than one symptom/sign should prompt investigation to explore the possibility of thyrotoxicosis. In most cases, a thorough history and examination should be sufficient to identify even the mildest cases. Reluctance to walk upstairs in children previously capable, suggesting proximal muscle weakness, could be missed as a sign of thyrotoxicosis in preschool children. At this age, clinical features such as heat intolerance and inadequate weight gain may be less frequent, being overshadowed by behavioural changes, sleep disturbances and feeding problems. Asymptomatic presentations have been reportedbut subtle features may have been overlooked in such cases.

Acute presentations

In children with significant hyperthyroidism, signs of thyrotoxicosis reflect a rapid metabolic and cardiovascular state. An extreme form, although rare, is thyroid storm. Diagnosis is clinical (table 1), and no specific laboratory tests are available. Precipitating factors include incompletely treated thyrotoxicosis, major trauma, stress, infection and medications. Scoring systems to indicate the likelihood of thyroid storm are available for adultsand, although not validated in children, have reasonable rationale for use in young people. In all cases, suspicious features should prompt an urgent referral to paediatric endocrine services.

Diagnosis of GD

Awareness of common and atypical presentations of GD is necessary as failure to diagnose GD in a timely manner may lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Most patients with GD present with classic signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, but they can also present with TED in about 40%of cases and dermopathy in 5% to 15% of patients. Thymic enlargement has also been reported. Clinical presentation depends on the age of onset, severity, and duration of hyperthyroidism.

Common presentations such as heat intolerance, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, palpitation, tremors, anxiety, nervousness, as well as eye symptoms and palpable goiter are often seen in younger population. In older patients, symptoms are usually subtle with fatigue, weight loss, and new onset atrial fibrillation. Atypical presentation of hyperthyroidism in older adults is also referred as apathetic thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

GD is a challenging condition for young people and their families, and the clinician has an important role in counselling them about the disease course, available treatment options and the likely long road ahead. It is important that a holistic approach is adopted that considers the needs of the young person as an individual, with extra support provided as needed. The emergence of potential novel therapeutic options is an exciting prospect for the future management of GD.

Adjunctive early therapy: beta adrenergic blockers

Most children have 'toxic' featureswith palpitations and tremor at diagnosis. Beta-adrenergic blockers provide symptomatic relief before carbimazole takes effect and can be continued until the thyroid hormone levels have normalised (usually around 4–6 weeks). Propranolol is most commonly used. Rare side effects include alopecia, neuromuscular dysfunction, postural hypotension, psychosis and thrombocytopaenia. Atenolol can be used as an alternative as it has the advantage of beta-1 adrenergic receptor selectivity, and therefore, safely used in patients with asthma.

Recommendation: In children with palpitations and tremor, commence beta-adrenergic blocking agents alongside carbimazole and continue until symptoms resolve or thyroid levels normalise.

Management after unsuccessful 1–2 years of methimazole (MMI) in pediatric Graves' disease (GD) — Pediatric patients with GD who are not in remission following at least 1–2 years of MMI therapy should be considered for treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) or thyroidectomy. Alternatively, if children are tolerating antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy, ATDs may be used for extended periods, which may be especially useful for the child not considered to be a candidate for either surgery or RAI. Individuals on prolonged ATD therapy (> 2 years) should be reevaluated every 6–12 months and when transitioning to adulthood. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. As already noted, adverse reactions typically occur within the first few months of therapy.

Initial management

Not all thyrotoxicosis or indeed autoimmune thyroid disease with associated thyrotoxicosis reflects GD. It is therefore important to establish the underlying mechanism at an early stage. If TRAb concentrations are elevated, then the thyrotoxicosis is due to GD and is unlikely to remit in the near future. In the absence of TRAb, the presence of TPO antibodies can suggest underlying thyroiditis which can be self-limiting. Hence, it may be appropriate to monitor thyroid function tests for a few weeks before intervening with ATD treatment if the young person is not significantly unwell in the context of a low TRAb titre. If the child has GD then ATD should be commenced to avoid the negative physical and psychological effects of prolonged thyroid hormone excess.

Children with signs of GO should be reviewed by an orbital specialist, preferably in a combined (ophthalmologist/clinician) thyroid eye clinic.

Beta blockade

A beta-blocker (eg, propranolol or atenolol) should be prescribed for patients presenting with signs of moderate to severe thyroid hormone excess. This can be stopped once the patient is biochemically euthyroid. Beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma.

Thyroid storm

A thyroid storm (acute thyrotoxic crisis) may arise in someone with undiagnosed or poorly controlled GD and can occur very occasionally following RAI therapy. A beta-blocker is indicated in the rare case of a thyroid storm, where it is typically used alongside ATD, a glucocorticoid and iodine.

### Hyperthyroidism symptoms, management, and outcomes in children and adults seeking definitive surgical treatment [^1a8520f6]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the difference in presentation, time to treatment, and outcomes between hyperthyroid adults and children referred to surgical evaluation.

Background

There is little data on differences in presenting symptoms, time to treatment, and outcomes between adults and children presenting for thyroidectomy for Graves' disease.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with hyperthyroidism referred for thyroidectomy between January 2016 and April 2017. We divided our cohort into 2 groups based on age, children (age ≤ 18 years), and adults (age > 18), and evaluated the difference in prevalence of symptoms, time from diagnosis, and initiation of antithyroid medications to surgery, and outcomes.

Results

We identified 38 patients (27 adults and 11 children) with data on hyperthyroidism symptoms referred for thyroidectomy. Relative to hyperthyroid adults, children with hyperthyroidism were more likely to present with hoarseness (55% vs 15%, P = 0.01) and difficulty concentrating (45% vs 7%, P = 0.01) at initial presentation. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of vision changes, exophthalmos, pretibial myxedema, palpitations, fatigue, temperature intolerance, dysphagia, tremors, or constitutional symptoms. A median of 15 months elapsed from diagnosis to thyroidectomy among adult and 6 months among pediatric patients. Adult and pediatric patients waited a median of 13 and 6 months from initiation of antithyroid medications to thyroidectomy, respectively. There was no significant difference in outcomes.

Conclusions

Children with hyperthyroidism were more likely to present with hoarseness and difficulty concentrating than adults. Concentration and communication are critical skills in developing children, and early intervention with definitive therapy may improve such symptoms.

### Increased incidence and severity of new Grave's disease diagnoses in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic [^cdff2c6b]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Graves disease (GD), an autoimmune disease of the thyroid, is likely caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Recent data suggest that COVID-19 may be associated with the development of autoimmune disease. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and characteristics of new GD diagnoses in youth prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all new GD diagnoses in patients aged 0 to 18 years diagnosed at a tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021.

Results

Over a 4-year period, 51 patients had been diagnosed with new-onset GD. We observed an increased incidence in new-onset GD during the pandemic compared with that in the 2 prior years (P = 0.01). During the pandemic period, heart rates (P = 0.03) as well as systolic (P = 0.005) and diastolic (P = 0.01) blood pressures were higher at initial evaluation, patients more frequently reported palpitations (P = 0.03) and tremors (P = 0.04), and an increased proportion of patients required beta-blockade treatment at diagnosis (P = 0.002). The percentage of patients requiring thionamide treatment and thionamide doses had been similar over time.

Conclusion

We identified an increase in new-onset pediatric GD diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, youths had increased severity of symptoms and more frequently required beta-blockade treatment at diagnosis. Further study of the relationship between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroid disease is needed.

### Notes for the general paediatrician: managing thyrotoxicosis in children and young people [^4cec1d5e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis due to hyperthyroidism is a serious disorder in childhood often presenting to general paediatricians with a range of clinical manifestations. The commonest cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder resulting from thyrotropin receptor stimulation by autoantibodies. Early recognition and accurate interpretation of investigations are essential to achieve and maintain a euthyroid state. This will not only optimise growth, development and transition from childhood to young adult life but also avoid the potentially severe and life-threatening complications of acute thyrotoxicosis. In this review, we have focussed on the general paediatrician's perspective of the presentation and management of thyrotoxicosis and the need to network with specialist paediatric endocrine centres to optimise patient care. We have discussed nuances of therapy, side effects and long-term outcomes, while recognising that limited remission rates in this age group often necessitate more definitive management. While carbimazole is usually used as first-line medical therapy, we have provided useful information to guide paediatricians in the discussion of individualised safe and effective treatment plans for both short-term and long-term management.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^4ada3aa4]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Management of Grave's disease: a review [^193d1dee]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Graves disease is the most common cause of persistent hyperthyroidism in adults. Approximately 3% of women and 0.5% of men will develop Graves disease during their lifetime.

Observations

We searched PubMed and the Cochrane database for English-language studies published from June 2000 through October 5, 2015. Thirteen randomized clinical trials, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 52 observational studies were included in this review. Patients with Graves disease may be treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine (RAI), or surgery (near-total thyroidectomy). The optimal approach depends on patient preference, geography, and clinical factors. A 12- to 18-month course of antithyroid drugs may lead to a remission in approximately 50% of patients but can cause potentially significant (albeit rare) adverse reactions, including agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity. Adverse reactions typically occur within the first 90 days of therapy. Treating Graves disease with RAI and surgery result in gland destruction or removal, necessitating life-long levothyroxine replacement. Use of RAI has also been associated with the development or worsening of thyroid eye disease in approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Surgery is favored in patients with concomitant suspicious or malignant thyroid nodules, coexisting hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with large goiters or moderate to severe thyroid eye disease who cannot be treated using antithyroid drugs. However, surgery is associated with potential complications such as hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord paralysis in a small proportion of patients. In pregnancy, antithyroid drugs are the primary therapy, but some women with Graves disease opt to receive definitive therapy with RAI or surgery prior to becoming pregnant to avoid potential teratogenic effects of antithyroid drugs during pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Management of Graves disease includes treatment with antithyroid drugs, RAI, or thyroidectomy. The optimal approach depends on patient preference and specific patient clinical features such as age, history of arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease, size of goiter, and severity of thyrotoxicosis. Physicians should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy to best counsel their patients.

### Graves' disease presenting with hypomania and paranoia to the acute psychiatry service [^7f8eb590]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

Physical symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, along with paranoid ideation and anxiety, gradually dissipated over the first 8 weeks of carbimazole treatment. At clinic review, 8 weeks after starting carbimazole, she was both biochemically and clinically euthyroid: she reported a complete return to her normal mental state, which was corroborated by her partner. At that stage, the community psychiatry crisis team discharged her from their care and she was assessed by an occupational health physician. She began a phased return to work 3 months after the initial attendance.

Thyroid function was stable on propylthiouracil 100 mg once daily — 9 months after the initial diagnosis, propylthiouracil was reduced to 50 mg once daily but, 1 month later, she developed subclinical thyrotoxicosis and propylthiouracil was increased back to 100 mg once daily and maintained at that level. At the time of writing, 15 months after the initial diagnosis of Graves' disease, she remained well and was in the first trimester of a planned pregnancy.

### Management of Graves' disease: an overview and comparison of clinical practice guidelines with actual practice trends [^14895646]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last century, much has been learned about the pathogenesis, manifestations, and management of Graves' disease leading to the establishment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists give recommendations on both the diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism. A survey of clinicians performed that same year, however, revealed that current practices diverge from these recently published guidelines in multiple areas. These differences will need to be assessed serially to determine the impact of the guidelines on future clinical practice and perhaps vice versa.

A 67-year-old Caucasian woman with no prior medical history was admitted to our hospital with complaints of generalised weakness, nausea, diarrhoea and weight loss. The patient suffered from tachycardia and hypotension. Blood tests revealed Graves' thyrotoxicosis and the patient was treated accordingly. However, patient's health continued to decline rapidly and further tests revealed a concomitant Addisonian crisis. Additional treatment with corticosteroids led to a full recovery. It is well known that autoimmune endocrine disorders tend to cluster. However, the presentation is usually sequential in time.

### Notes for the general paediatrician: managing thyrotoxicosis in children and young people [^442616cd]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis due to hyperthyroidism is a serious disorder in childhood often presenting to general paediatricians with a range of clinical manifestations. The commonest cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder resulting from thyrotropin receptor stimulation by autoantibodies. Early recognition and accurate interpretation of investigations are essential to achieve and maintain a euthyroid state. This will not only optimise growth, development and transition from childhood to young adult life but also avoid the potentially severe and life-threatening complications of acute thyrotoxicosis. In this review, we have focussed on the general paediatrician's perspective of the presentation and management of thyrotoxicosis and the need to network with specialist paediatric endocrine centres to optimise patient care. We have discussed nuances of therapy, side effects and long-term outcomes, while recognising that limited remission rates in this age group often necessitate more definitive management. While carbimazole is usually used as first-line medical therapy, we have provided useful information to guide paediatricians in the discussion of individualised safe and effective treatment plans for both short-term and long-term management.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^220ebbbe]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Hyperthyroidism… [^a5f021eb]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Thyrotoxicosis in children is most often caused by Graves disease. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder and occurs due to production of thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Ophthalmopathy is rare in children. Diagnosis of Graves disease is established by measuring serum levels of free T. 4, thyrotropin, and TRAbs. Methimazole is prescribed to make patient euthyroid or make patient hypothyroid and provide thyroid hormone therapy. β-adrenergic blockade may be necessary to control symptoms due to hyperactive sympathetic system. Definitive therapy includes thyroidectomy or treatment with radioactive iodide.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^f61ce967]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Duration of methimazole therapy in children with Graves' disease — If methimazole is chosen as first-line therapy, it should be administered for 1–2 years and then discontinued or the dose reduced to assess remission (1/+00). In children, antithyroid drug (ATD) courses of 1–2 years yield remission rates generally 20%–30%, defined as being euthyroid for 1 year after stopping therapy, and the chance of remission after 2 years is low when the thyroid is more than 2.5 times normal size for age, age is < 12 years, or initial FT4 is > 4 ng/dL; 50 pmol/L; likelihood is higher with achievement of euthyroid state within 3 months.

### Monitoring and management of autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis patients treated with alemtuzumab: practical recommendations [^e153b21e]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

### Management of pediatric Grave's disease: a review [^791abe79]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The incidence of Graves disease (GD) is rising in children, and adequate care of these patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. Whether patients are seen in the context of endocrinology, nuclear medicine, or surgery, it is important to know the nuances of the therapeutic options in children.

Observations

Given the rarity of GD in children, it is important to recognize its various clinical presenting signs and symptoms, as well as the tests that may be important for diagnosis. The diagnosis is typically suspected clinically and then confirmed biochemically. Imaging tests, including thyroid ultrasonography and/or nuclear scintigraphy, may also be used as indicated during care. It is important to understand the indications for and interpretation of laboratory and imaging tools so that a diagnosis is made efficiently and unnecessary tests are not ordered. Clinicians should be well-versed in treatment options to appropriately counsel families. There are specific scenarios in which medical therapy, radioactive iodine therapy, or surgery should be offered.

Conclusions and Relevance

The diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with GD requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving pediatric specialists in the fields of endocrinology, ophthalmology, radiology, nuclear medicine, and surgery/otolaryngology. Antithyroid drugs are typically the first-line treatment, but sustained remission rates with medical management are low in the pediatric population. Consequently, definitive treatment is often necessary, either with radioactive iodine or with surgery, ideally performed by experienced, high-volume pediatric experts. Specific clinical characteristics, such as patients younger than 5 years or the presence of a thyroid nodule, may make surgery the optimal treatment for certain patients.

Management

Key considerations when managing a young person with GD are summarised in box 1. The general approach involves a course of ATD medication. If this is not possible or if this fails to result in remission, definitive treatment (RAI or thyroidectomy) needs to be considered. Ultimately, the main objectives when treating GD are restoration of euthyroidism in the short term and preservation of endogenous thyroid function in the long term without the need for medication. Unfortunately, with the currently available therapies, this is not a realistic prospect for many children.

Box 1
Key points when managing paediatric Graves' disease

Use CBZ or MMI, avoid PTU.
CBZ is commenced in a dose of 0.25–0.75 mg/kg/day (0.15–0.5 mg/kg/day MMI).
A dose at the lower end of this range will be appropriate if thyroid hormone excess is at the less profound end of the spectrum.
DT is the preferred method of ATD treatment, although BR may be helpful if there is persistent relapse on small-dose ATD.
Beta-blockade is recommended in patients presenting with signs of marked thyroid hormone excess.
An FBC and LFTs should be checked at baseline.
Be guided by thyroid hormone concentrations (not TSH) in first few months to alter dosage.
Counsel families about the risk of excessive weight gain when ATD is commenced.
A TRAb level should be checked before antithyroid medication is stopped — remission is much more likely in the context of a normal value.
ATD is normally administered for at least 3 years. Longer courses (≥ 5 years) should be considered if the likelihood of remission is low.
Patients who relapse after a course of ATD can return to ATD or choose definitive treatment (RAI/surgery).
If there are academic concerns, then consider liaising with the child's school to ensure specific support is provided as required.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^a0b19423]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Painless thyroiditis — clinical course and management: The thyrotoxic phase occurs in 5%–20% of patients and typically lasts 3–4 months, the hypothyroid phase may last up to 6 months, and normal thyroid function is reestablished by 12 months in most patients, though 10%–20% have persistent hypothyroidism; recurrences are about 5%–10%, with a long-term recurrence rate of 65% reported in one Japanese study. During the thyrotoxic phase, serum TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4, and the absence of TRAb antibodies helps distinguish painless thyroiditis from GD. Patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis should be treated with β-adrenergic-blocking drugs to control symptoms, ATDs have no utility, and corticosteroids have been used rarely but should be reserved for severe cases only.

Summary

The most common cause of pediatric thyrotoxicosis is GD. Nevertheless, it is important to consider other causes of pediatric thyrotoxicosis. Involvement of a pediatric endocrinologist may help in the diagnostic workup of these children since these other causes are very rare. For children diagnosed with GD, a recent clinical guideline is available. In this paper we discuss some challenges we experienced in the treatment of pediatric GD that are not captured by the guideline and may be helpful for clinicians facing challenging cases of pediatric GD.

Ablative Therapies for Benign Thyroid Nodules

Clinical Case

A 38-year-old woman was referred to the endocrine clinic for re-evaluation of a right thyroid nodule initially diagnosed, biopsied, and found benign 3 years ago. She can now see the nodule and endorses pressure when hugging her children. In the past few months, she also noticed fine tremors, insomnia, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. On physical examination she has fine hand tremors, a regular pulse at 82 beats/minute, and there is an easily noticeable right thyroid nodule occupying most of the right lobe. The examination is otherwise unremarkable while the thyroid tests reveal thyrotoxicosis with thyrotropin (TSH) 0.02 mIU/L (0.30–4.20 mIU/L) and normal triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Neck ultrasound showed a 4.2 × 1.9 × 2.8 cm (11.2 mL) solid, isoechoic nodule in the right thyroid lobe with smooth margins and increased vascularity, with normal surrounding parenchyma and no lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1A and 1B). 123 I scintigraphy showed a hot right thyroid nodule with suppression of uptake in the surrounding thyroid tissue. She would like to eliminate the local pressure sensation but avoid surgery and RAI due to concerns about hypothyroidism.

Ablation of Benign Nontoxic Thyroid Nodules

In this patient the change in nodule volume over time has made it visible and generated local compressive symptoms. The standard approach would be to treat such a patient with a lobectomy or with RAI therapy in the case of toxic nodules. However, sufficient data indicate that for these cases consideration can also be given to the newly emerging minimally invasive TA modalities (Table 2).

The treatment options in the young patient with Graves' disease are the same as in adults, namely antithyroid drug (ATD), surgery (partial or total thyroidectomy) and radioiodine. However, the emphasis and expectation is different in the young person, reflecting a range of considerations including age, pubertal status, disease natural history, likely impact of ATD on disease course and the implications of radiation exposure. New therapeutic strategies that could increase the likelihood of long-term remission are being explored.

### A patient with stress-related onset and exacerbations of Grave's disease [^d0be0dc5]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

An 18-year-old, nonsmoking woman presented to her general practitioner with a 1-week history of weakness, fatigue, palpitations, nervousness, tremors, insomnia, heat intolerance, and sudden enlargement of a thyroid goiter that had been detected 2 years earlier. The patient's symptoms had started shortly after she experienced emotional stress. Diagnostic work-up disclosed an avid radioactive iodine uptake by the goiter. On ultrasound examination, the thyroid gland was enlarged with a diffusely hypoechogenic structure and intense vascularization.

Investigations

Thyroid scintigraphy with (131)I; ultrasonography of the thyroid gland; and measurements of serum free T(3), free T(4), TSH levels and thyroid autoantibodies, including autoantibodies against thyroglobulin (TgAb), thyroperoxidase (TPOAb) and TSH receptor (TRAb).

Diagnosis

Graves disease, with stress-related onset and subsequent stress-related exacerbations.

Management

The patient was treated with methimazole to normalize levels of thyroid hormone and thyroid autoantibodies, and with bromazepam to help her cope with stress. The daily dose of methimazole was kept low during pregnancy. Over the 4 year period when the patient was taking methimazole, exacerbations of hyperthyroidism occurred twice: during her first pregnancy and 9 months after her first delivery. On all three occasions, symptoms were preceded by stressful life events. Further exacerbations were avoided by starting bromazepam treatment soon after the patient experienced stressful events.

### Graves' disease in the young: could we change the weather? [^0cf3f18e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease is a distressing disease for patients. They are told that doctors understand the mechanisms but not the origin of the disease, that it is usually not a life-threatening disease but a long-lasting unpredictable one, that they will have to be on medication for months with no guarantee they will be cured, that the medication may cause some side effects, and that in the rare event of side effects or, more frequently, in case of relapse, they will be offered a definitive treatment leading to hypothyroidism, another disease requiring lifelong treatment.

Graves' disease is a vexing disease for doctors. They have only poorly grounded guidelines and consensus to address simple questions that deserve simple and clear answers: How come? How long? Are you sure it will work? Is there a risk of complications? What about my eyes? Can I become pregnant? The poor performance of our therapeutic approach to Graves' disease is even worse in the case of children and adolescents.

Several years ago, French pediatric endocrinologists conducted a large prospective observational study of medically treated Graves' disease in children and teenagers. This provided important and practical information. The risk of relapse of hyperthyroidism after 24 months of carbimazole was higher in younger, non-Caucasian patients presenting with severe disease (high free thyroxine and high thyrotropin receptor antibodies), whereas a longer duration of antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment was associated with a higher probability of remission. Quite deceptive was the near 60% and 70% relapse rate, 1 and 2 years, respectively, after carbimazole withdrawal. The study was prolonged with 2 to 3 rounds of treatment if a relapse had occurred. Repeating long periods of treatment improved the estimated remission rate from 20% at 4 years to a near 50% plateau after 10 years, solid but disappointing results. Who can be satisfied and expect a teenager to be compliant and happy with treatment for 4 years to get an 80% relapse risk, and up to 10 years for a 50% risk? Young patients would rather have a definitive treatment recommended.

### Diary from a week in practice… [^483ba71c]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Monday "I'm a mess, " Gwen confessed. Struggling to hold back her tears, this 54-year-old woman described a recent history of feeling nervous, shaky, and hot. She had unintentionally lost 12 lb, even though her appetite was good. Lately, she'd been experiencing palpitations. Less than one year ago, Gwen had been at the office for a checkup and laboratory work. At that time, everything looked fine. Now, her examination revealed a fine tremor, mild tachycardia, increased deep tendon reflexes, and the explanation for all her symptoms — a small, diffuse nontender goiter. Gwen's thyroid-stimulating hormone level was less than 0. 1 μU/mL, and her total T. 4 was 14. 8 μg/dL. A repeated TSH was 0. 03 μU/mL. Nine months ago, her TSH and thyroxine levels were normal. Radioactive iodine uptake was now elevated at 60 percent. Gwen's thyrotoxicosis was probably secondary to Graves' disease. Her symptoms improved with propra-nolol, and she was then treated with radioactive iodine.

She understands the need to monitor her thyroid function closely for the development of hypothyroidism. Gwen is still bewildered about how her thyroid status could have changed so quickly and disappointed to learn that normal laboratory tests are not guaranteed. In Gwen's case, it didn't even come with a one-year warranty. Tuesday Rocky, a large 44-year-old man who tended to be suspicious of doctors, didn't exactly sit on the examination table; he overwhelmed it. "I just can't catch my breath, and it's getting worse. " Rocky described a syncopal episode yesterday that failed to hurt him. He appeared weak, pale, and clammy. His pulse was 112 and blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. I noted tachypnea and heard inspiratory crackles in his chest. His feet were swollen with no calf tenderness. He denied chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia. A chest x-ray demonstrated car-diomegaly. His oxygen saturation was 90 percent on room air. I was puzzled.

He might have congestive heart failure or pneumonia not yet apparent on chest x-ray, but neither diagnosis was a good fit. I admitted Rocky to the hospital, uncertain about the diagnosis but not the severity of his illness. Almost as an afterthought, I added a final admitting order: stat ventilation-perfusion lung scan, which turned out to show a high probability of pulmonary emboli with multiple perfusion defects in the right lung. A Doppler study identified a deep venous thrombosis in the right leg. Rocky was treated with intravenous heparin, oxygen and, eventually, warfarin. It pays to be suspicious — clinically speaking, of course. Wednesday It certainly helps to have nine lives… especially if you're going to spend three of them. Ninety-five-year-old Magdalene was brought to the emergency room in respiratory failure because of pulmonary edema. A vibrant woman, Magdalene had cultivated her longevity the old-fashioned way — she earned it.

She had worked hard every day of her life, until recently. In the past few years, she had fractured a hip and had two brushes with death: a myocardial infarction and a severe episode of congestive heart failure. "Ever since I turned 90, I've just gone to pieces, " Magdalene lamented. Now she was unresponsive and critically ill. Her family reminded me that she had a living will, with an emphasis on "living". Magdalene had made it clear that she wanted everything done to prolong her survival. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator. Almost miraculously, she was extubated a day later and soon talking non-stop, albeit with a slightly raspy voice. "I'm doing great, Doc. Can I go home. " Five days later she was discharged, seemingly unfazed by her close encounter with death. "At my age, " she informed me, "you have to be prepared for anything. " Magdalene may be down to six lives, but she believes she has ample mileage remaining on her first.

A previously well, 4-year-old girl presented with a 4–6 weeks' history of increased appetite, weight loss, tiredness, sleep difficulty, excessive sweating, swelling in the neck and new-onset 'prominent, protruding eyes'. Family history revealed paternal grandmother receiving treatment for hyperthyroidism. Clinical assessment demonstrated features of thyrotoxicosis (tachycardia, warm peripheries, small smooth goitre with no nodules, exophthalmos). TFT (Free T4 = 101pmol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone < 0.05mIU/L) with raised thyroid peroxidase antibody levels (TPO = 541IU/mL) confirmed autoimmune hyperthyroidism. Observation on the ward showed features of thyrotoxic crisis with persistent severe tachycardia on ECG (sinus tachycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)) and hypertension. Ultrasound thyroid showed diffuse thyroiditis with no focal lesion. Echocardiogram confirmed the above findings. A diagnosis of Graves' disease with thyrotoxic crisis was made. Antithyroid treatment (carbimazole) and beta-blocker (propranolol) was commenced. Thyrotoxic crisis resolved over 2 weeks and the child has continued to respond to carbimazole treatment at 1-year follow-up.

Hyperthyroidism and Graves' Disease in Pediatric Patients

In children, the primary cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease (GD). GD is an autoimmune condition that results from the presence of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb; also known as thyrotropin binding inhibiting immunoglobulins, abbreviated as TBII) and leads to an overactive thyroid gland (Graves' hyperthyroidism). In GD, TRAb act as an agonist of the TSH receptor, causing excessive thyroid hormone secretion and disrupting pituitary control of the thyroid. In adults GD is quite prevalent; in children it is a rare disease with an incidence of 4.58/100 000 per year, and the incidence is even lower under the age of 15 years (1 to 2.91/100 000 per year). This is also reflected in the fact that (only) approximately 5% of all GD patients have their onset during childhood. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism in pediatric GD are similar to those in adults, but they may also include accelerated growth and bone maturation and a decline in academic performance. Unfortunately, there is often diagnostic delay due to suspected behavioral, gastrointestinal, respiratory, or cardiac conditions. In 2022 the European Thyroid Association (ETA) published a guideline on the management of pediatric GD. Although treatment options, like antithyroid drugs (ATD), radioactive iodine (RAI), and thyroid surgery, are similar to those in adults, the advantages and disadvantages differ in the pediatric population. A prolonged course of ATD treatment for 3 to 5 years or more aiming at immunological and biochemical remission is stated to be the first-line treatment option, with a preference for dose titration compared to block and replace treatment strategy. If definitive treatment is indicated, either total thyroidectomy or RAI aiming at complete thyroid ablation is recommended. Local expertise plays an important role in the choice between thyroidectomy or RAI as definitive treatment. Current management of pediatric GD is extensively described in the 2022 ETA guideline.

Dose titration or block and replace?

There are two main strategies when administering ATD therapy. A 'dose titration' (DT) method can be used where the ATD dose is titrated against circulating thyroid hormone concentrations. Alternatively, the 'block and replace' (BR) approach can be used which involves completely blocking thyroid hormone production while adding exogenous thyroxine supplementation. Both are used in the UK although data from a randomised UK trial showed no difference between the two approaches in terms of biochemical stability. There is some evidence to suggest that higher doses of ATD, as used with BR, may increase the likelihood of drug side effects and recent European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines suggest using the DT approach in most instances. It is also possible that the simpler DT regimen (one medication rather than two) facilitates earlier resolution of the hyperthyroid state. There is still an argument for using the BR approach in patients who, for example, repeatedly undergo a biochemical relapse while on a reducing dose of ATD.

Monitoring response to ATD treatment

In the initial period of treatment, thyroid hormone concentrations should be checked at least every 4 weeks until thyroid hormone concentrations have normalised, after which monitoring can potentially be reduced to every 2–3 months.TSH levels can remain low for a significant period after ATD has been commenced, with approximately one-third of patients still having a suppressed TSH at 6 months after diagnosis. This highlights the importance of using thyroid hormone concentrations (FT3/FT4) to make decisions about altering the dose of ATD in the initial months. After a month of treatment, around 50% of patients will have normalised their FT4 concentrations, rising to 90% by 6 months. Younger, prepubertal children often present with more severe thyrotoxicosis and can take longer to normalise thyroid hormone levels than older children. Prepubertal children can also present with an isolated elevated T3 (T3 toxicosis), highlighting the importance of measuring FT3. Excessive weight gain can occur as euthyroidism is restored. Families should be made aware of this possibility and pertinent advice provided.

Graves' disease (GD) is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism in children. However, compared to adults, GD in children is a rare condition. In a recent guideline issued by the European Thyroid Association, the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of pediatric GD is described extensively. In this article, we go beyond the guideline and describe the potential challenges of establishing the right etiology of thyrotoxicosis in children, illustrated by cases of thyroid hormone resistance, autonomous functioning thyroid nodules, and subacute thyroiditis with a thyrotoxic phase. In addition, we report therapeutic challenges in pediatric GD such as recurrent immunological flare-ups under antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment, innovative ways to improve ATD compliance and the role of definitive treatment in persistent complaints of malaise under ATD treatment.

### Different doses of methimazole treatment of children and adolescents with Graves' disease: a clinical study based on 161 cases of outpatients [^cd9d9b7d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most pediatric endocrinologists recommend MMI as initial treatment in the hope that the patient's Graves' disease will be resolved. The typically used MMI dose is 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/day. For severe clinical or biochemical hyperthyroidism, doses exceeding 50–100% may be employed. The fundamental principle followed with MMI is to begin with a high dosage, then gradually reduce and maintain it. While the initial dosage of MMI may vary based on the severity of Graves' disease, there is a scarcity of clinical research investigating the effectiveness and potential adverse events associated with these initial dosages concerning disease severity, especially in the context of Chinese children and adolescents. In our clinical practice, we have also observed an increased occurrence of adverse effects in children and adolescents with severe hyperthyroidism who are given high doses of MMI as initial treatment. Therefore, our study selected varying MMI doses for the treatment of young Chinese individuals with Graves' disease, taking into account disease severity. The study aimed to analyze short-term efficacy and associated adverse effects, offering a clinical foundation for the scientific management of Graves' disease.

### Management aspects of medical therapy in Grave's disease [^15f90a12]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

ATD, RAI, and thyroidectomy are 3 main treatment options when managing GD. Although RAI and surgery are associated with a high likelihood of subsequent hypothyroidism, ATD provide a way to achieve euthyroidism without increasing the risk for complications. ATDs have been the initial choice of treatment in many countries for years and have gained considerable popularity in the United States over the past 2 decades. The conventional duration of ATDs use for 18 to 24 as currently suggested by the ATA is associated with high relapse rates with GD. Long-term management with ATD for 5 years or more has demonstrated safety with higher rates of remission.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^c571a3fb]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Graves' disease — antithyroid drug selection and dosing: Methimazole (MMI) should be used in virtually every child receiving antithyroid drug therapy, can be given once daily, and adult data show better compliance with once-daily MMI versus multiple daily PTU (83% vs. 53%). Typical MMI dosing is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily (range 0.1–1.0 mg/kg daily) with an age-band option of infants 1.25 mg/day; 1–5 years 2.5–5.0 mg/day; 5–10 years 5–10 mg/day; and 10–18 years 10–20 mg/day. In severe hyperthyroidism, doses 50%–100% higher than the above can be used, and when thyroid hormone levels normalize, MMI doses can be reduced by 50% or more; block-and-replace regimens adding levothyroxine are discouraged, as we suggest that this practice in general be avoided.

### A swelling in the neck… [^28cad7b9]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old girl presented with a two-week history of polyphagia, puffy eyes, palpitations, heat intolerance, nervousness, loose stools, and fatigue. She also complained of decreased concentration over several months at school. She denied experiencing weight loss or insomnia. Developmentally, she had thelarche at 10 years of age and menarche at 11 years of age, and her menstrual periods were regular. Her paternal grandmother had a goiter, but the family was unable to remember whether she had hypo- or hyperthyroidism. On examination, the patient's heart rate was 120 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and her blood pressure was 120/68 mm Hg. She had mild exophthalmos, lid lag, and a fine hand tremor. The thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged and nontender. Her skin was very warm and moist, and her face was flushed. Results of the rest of the examination were normal.

Laboratory investigations showed a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0. 01 mU per L, a free thyroxine level of 12 ng per dL, and markedly elevated levels of antithyroid peroxidase and TSH-receptor antibodies. Question Discussion The answer is C: Graves' disease. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antibodies directed against thyroid antigens such as the TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase. This results in excessive thyroid hormone production, leading to accelerated metabolism. Graves' disease most often affects adult women; when it occurs in youth, however, it usually happens during adolescence. Girls are affected five times more often than boys. 1 The onset usually is insidious.

Classic symptoms include heat intolerance, fatigability, weight loss, nervousness, palpitations, insomnia, oligomenorrhea, and increased frequency of bowel movements. Impaired attention span, behavioral problems, and deterioration in school performance are common. 2 Physical examination signs include diffuse thyromegaly, tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, excessive perspiration, rapid tendon reflex relaxation phase, tremor, exophthalmos, lid lag, and lid retraction. Height for age and bone age may be advanced. 3 Pretibial myxedema and periodic paralysis may occur.
4. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis presents with painful, diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland associated with symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. It is usually viral in origin. The free T 4 level is elevated, and TSH is suppressed. Unlike in Graves' disease, a radioactive iodine scan shows a low uptake.

The hyperthyroidism is self-limited and usually lasts for one to two months. It can be followed by transient hypothyroidism. Acute suppurative thyroiditis is bacterial in origin and often related to a pear-shaped sinus fistula or thyroglossal duct remnant. The condition often presents with fever, sore throat, local erythema, and painful mass in one thyroid gland lobe. 5 Leukocytosis usually is present, and thyroid function test results are normal.
5. Toxic adenoma presents as a thyroid nodule with biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism. Lack of ocular changes helps differentiate toxic adenoma from Graves' disease. 6 Although many patients show elevation of T 4 and triiodothyronine levels, preferential elevation of T 3 often occurs.
7. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence.

### A challenging presentation of Graves' disease… [^27291fb7]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A 14-year-old African-American female presented with a 12-day history of fever, LUQ abdominal pain, 22-lb weight loss, headache, malaise and diffuse erythematous annular rash. She had just completed a 1-month sentence in the juvenile detention center. Initial labs on presentation were remarkable for pancytopenia, diffuse bilateral lymphadenopathy, low reticulocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers. Workup for fever focused primarily on infectious, malignant, and rheumatic etiologies
- differential diagnosis was extensive but most acutely concerning for lymphoma. However, peripheral blood smear, flow cytometry, and biopsies of lymph node and bone marrow all showed normal findings without abnormal immunophenotyping. Infectious workup consisting of serological and antigen studies for etiologies including adenovirus, HIV, EBV, CMV and TB returned negative. Autoantibody labs were significant for elevated ANA titer with confirmation on repeat testing.

Nevertheless, the remaining tests investigating rheumatic disease were unremarkable, including a brain MRI showing no evidence of cerebral lupus. Further investigation and patient questioning prompted thyroid studies, eventually revealing elevated free T4 and undetectable levels of TSH. Thyroid ultrasound showed diffusely heterogeneous enlarged thyroid gland with mild hyperemia. Finally, additional studies resulted in abnormal TSI levels, confirming Graves' disease. Discussion Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder more commonly found in women which presents with weakness, palpitations, diarrhea and weight loss. Our patient's presentation was confounded mostly by presence of diffuse lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia, two abnormalities less commonly associated with hyperthyroidism. However, there exists several case reports of severe untreated hyperthyroidism presenting with pancytopenia, though very little of that literature is found in pediatrics.

Clinical improvement was described in cases of pancytopenia-associated hyperthyroidism after initiation of therapy. But, on follow-up, pancytopenia persisted in several cases for weeks to months. Our patient was started on propranolol and prednisone for treatment of Graves' disease, as well as topical and oral antifungals for presumed tinea corporis, resulting in clinical improvement. She underwent radioactive iodine ablation therapy on final day of hospitalization and afterwards discharged with appropriate follow-up. Conclusion Graves' disease has known, safe treatment options with a great prognosis given appropriate follow-up. Nevertheless, in a rare case such as this, we believe an extensive workup is warranted to rule out even more serious diseases such as lymphoma or opportunistic infection. Furthermore, before steroid therapy may be initiated, appropriate workup must be done to ensure no underlying disease or insidious conditions reveal itself during treatment.

### Approach to the patient: challenging cases of pediatric thyrotoxicosis [^a24454ab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This case illustrates that complaints of malaise, like persistent fatigue and arthralgia, may be present in patients who are being treated with ATDs. These symptoms may be related to the ATD treatment itself. Before definitive treatment is considered, we suggest having a trial off ATD to evaluate the evolution of symptoms as illustrated by case 7. If symptoms disappear, this suggests that the complaints are related to ATD treatment. In that case, definitive treatment can be considered, especially in cases where a low likelihood of achieving permanent remission is suspected. Recurrent hyperthyroidism during the trial off ATD can be treated symptomatically using beta blockade if a longer trial off ATD is wanted.

Another challenging aspect in the management of patients with GD is the current differences between the pediatric and adult treatment guidelines. While pediatric patients with newly diagnosed GD are medically treated for 3 years or longer, adult patients are treated with ATD for 12 to 18 months. If after this period TRAb levels are still high, ATD treatment is continued, with repeat TRAb measurement 12 months later. Alternatively, definitive therapy (RAI or thyroidectomy) is advised, according to the latest ETA guideline for the management of adult GD.

Solid evidence for the best medical treatment strategy in adolescence during the transition from pediatric to adult care is lacking. Looking back at our own experience in the last 10 years (2014–2023), we saw a total of 136 newly diagnosed pediatric GD patients at our tertiary pediatric endocrinology clinic; 22.8% of them (n = 31 out of 136) were 16 or 17 years of age at diagnosis and therefore encounter the aforementioned guideline differences. These adolescent patients should have an individually tailored treatment duration aiming at lifelong immunological remission. Definitive treatment before a minimum ATD treatment duration of 3 years can only be considered in cases with a very low likelihood of achieving immunological remission. Future treatment guidelines on (pediatric) GD should include evidence-based advice on how to treat young GD patients during transition from pediatric to adult care.

Abstract

Graves' disease (GD) is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism in children. However, compared to adults, GD in children is a rare condition. In a recent guideline issued by the European Thyroid Association, the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of pediatric GD is described extensively. In this article, we go beyond the guideline and describe the potential challenges of establishing the right etiology of thyrotoxicosis in children, illustrated by cases of thyroid hormone resistance, autonomous functioning thyroid nodules, and subacute thyroiditis with a thyrotoxic phase. In addition, we report therapeutic challenges in pediatric GD such as recurrent immunological flare-ups under antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment, innovative ways to improve ATD compliance and the role of definitive treatment in persistent complaints of malaise under ATD treatment.

### Perioperative management of the thyrotoxic patient [^b050d461]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Preoperative thyrotoxicosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires medical intervention before surgery. Most patients are undergoing thyroidectomy for persistent thyrotoxicosis, usually Graves' disease, either having contraindications to or failing medical therapy. Fewer patients are undergoing nonthyroidal surgery that is likely urgent or emergent. The choice of treatment depends on the time available for preoperative preparation, the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, and the impact of any current or previous therapies. Generally treatment is directed at a combination of targets in the thyroid hormone synthetic, secretory, and peripheral pathway with concurrent treatment to correct any decompensation of normal homeostatic mechanisms. Thionamides are the preferred initial treatment unless contraindicated, but do require several weeks to render a patient euthyroid. beta-Blockers should always be used unless absolutely contraindicated because they improve thyrotoxic symptoms especially of the cardiovascular system. Other agents including iodine and steroids can be used if rapid preparation is required or more severe thyrotoxicosis is present. The goal of therapy is to render the patient as close as possible to clinical and biochemical euthyroidism before surgery. Overall, the morbidity and mortality of adequately prepared patients is low.

### Neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms as an initial presentation of pediatric thyroid storm: report of three cases [^6c7a1434]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Thyroid storm (TS) is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by decompensated hyperthyroidism. There is no consensus on how to diagnose pediatric TS. We report three pediatric cases of TS presenting with central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as the initial presentation of Graves' disease.

Case Presentation

They were previously healthy adolescents without family history of thyroid disease. CNS symptoms varied from agitation to coma. GI symptoms included abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Their laboratory studies revealed thyrotoxicosis and positive result of thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb). They were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and received the combination of an antithyroid drug, Lugol's solution, a beta antagonist, and hydrocortisone. The most severe case was a 13 year-old Japanese girl who presented with loss of consciousness and hemodynamic shock. She died after 5 days of intensive treatment.

Conclusions

Pediatricians should consider TS in the differential diagnosis when a patient exhibits both CNS and GI symptoms.

### Graves' disease presenting with hypomania and paranoia to the acute psychiatry service [^26143804]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 32-year-old woman was brought to the accident and emergency (A&E) department by her husband in June 2019, as she had demonstrated increasingly erratic behaviour over the previous 6 months.

In the 4 months prior to presentation, she had been sleeping for only 2–3 hours per night on the family sofa and eating only one meal per day. She had lost 15 kg in weight and had developed palpitations. Her thoughts were racing, and while she spent long hours working, she was unfocused and less productive than normal. She had developed paranoid ideas, reporting to her husband that she was receiving messages from her mobile telephone directly into her brain, despite it being turned off. She had been feeling increasingly anxious, which was attributed to 'stress' and financial difficulties. She was finding it more difficult to look after her 16-month-old child; at the peak of her symptoms, her husband found her wandering around the kitchen and placing spoons in the fridge. She was previously fit, never smoked and was not on any regular medication. There was no family history of thyroid disease. She works as an inclusion manager in a primary school, with responsibility for children with special educational needs.

The situation reached a crisis point 3 days prior to attendance, when she was asked to leave work. Her husband arranged an appointment with their general practitioner the next day. The patient was suspicious of her husband's insistence that she see a doctor and asked him to wait outside during her consultation with the general practitioner (GP). Symptoms were initially diagnosed as 'anxiety', but as symptoms progressed she was referred to acute psychiatry services and was seen in the A&E department. When assessed by the liaison psychiatry nurse, the patient was easily distracted, with intermittent eye contact and was agitated, pacing around the room. There was pressure of speech, but no hallucinations or thoughts of self-harm. The patient expressed paranoid ideas, but these were not held with delusional intensity. Blood tests were performed to help exclude biological causes of acute psychosis: she was referred to the medical team on call as blood tests revealed that she was markedly thyrotoxic.

Carbimazole: dose titration V block and replace

Historically, there have been two options when treating patients with carbimazole: 'dose-titration', where the dose is adjusted to ensure an euthyroid state on a lower dose; and 'block and replace', where a daily dose is used that stops endogenous thyroid hormone production completely and levothyroxine is then added as a replacement dose. A randomised controlled trialcomparing these two regimens found no difference in biochemical control in young people. This trial supported a recommendation of dose titration as the preferred option as block and replace regimens are associated with greater side effects due to the higher doses required. Unless extenuating circumstances suggest otherwise, a dose-titration plan should be the default treatment choice.

Perioperative medication management and thyroid hormone replacement after thyroidectomy for Graves' disease — "Antithyroid drugs should be stopped at the time of thyroidectomy for GD, and beta-adrenergic blockers should be weaned following surgery". After surgery, "L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.7 μg/kg), and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively", and "Once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently if clinically indicated".

Background

The link between psychiatric disturbance and thyrotoxicosis was first described by von Basedow in the 19th century. Although overt psychotic features are not often seen in patients with thyrotoxicosis, it is important to recognise the phenomenon. It is very rare for psychosis to be the presenting symptom of Graves' disease. The estimated incidence of psychosis as the presenting feature of Graves' is 1% according to a New Zealand-based case series. Equally it is rare for thyrotoxicosis to be the underlying cause of a new psychiatric presentation.

Initiation of thionamides plus beta-blockade to treat agitation, anxiety and sympathomimetic symptoms is of paramount importance. While patients presenting with hypomania often receive treatment with antipsychotic medications, when thyrotoxicosis is the cause of mental health deterioration, treatment with thionamides with or without beta-blockers may be all that is required. Those patients who have antipsychotics administered as primary treatment may be misdiagnosed or left on long-term antipsychotic medication inappropriately. Nevertheless, there will be situations where management of psychosis requires a combination of antipsychotic therapy and thionamide drugs.
