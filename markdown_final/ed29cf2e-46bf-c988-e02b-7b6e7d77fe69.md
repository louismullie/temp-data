## Question

How to differentiate between different causes of hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate between different causes of hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states. Then, I should classify by volume status and integrate urine studies. Next, I will consider special scenarios like SIADH, cerebral/renal salt wasting, endocrine causes, and exercise-associated hyponatremia. After that, I should review adjunctive markers such as fractional uric acid excretion and copeptin. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight pitfalls and monitoring needs, making sure I verify each step against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude non-hypotonic causes, because I need to ensure we are dealing with true hypotonic hyponatremia before proceeding. I should measure serum osmolality and confirm it is less than 275 mOsm/kg to establish hypotonicity, while simultaneously checking for hyperglycemia, mannitol, glycine, or radiocontrast that can raise effective osmoles and cause translocational hyponatremia, and I should also screen for pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia or paraproteinemia, since these do not reflect true hypotonicity and would change management entirely [^0632c300] [^68a3796b] [^19dbc176].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and classify by volume status, but wait, let me verify that I am not over-relying on exam alone. Hypovolemic hyponatremia typically shows signs of volume depletion and often has low urine sodium less than 30 mmol/L, whereas hypervolemic hyponatremia presents with edema from heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome and usually has low urine sodium with high urine osmolality, and euvolemic hyponatremia lacks overt volume disturbances and often reflects SIADH or endocrine causes; however, I should double-check because clinical assessment of volume status can be misleading, especially in older adults or those with mixed states, so I need to integrate history, exam, and urine chemistries rather than rely on a single sign [^a3af82a4] [^06c7e275] [^19dbc176].

> I will now examine urine osmolality as the initial discriminator in hypotonic hyponatremia, and I should confirm that a spot urine osmolality is obtained early. If urine osmolality is 100 mOsm/kg or less, I should consider primary polydipsia or low solute intake, whereas if urine osmolality is greater than 100 mOsm/kg, I should proceed to urine sodium and volume status to refine the differential, keeping in mind that inappropriately concentrated urine in the face of hypotonic plasma supports vasopressin-mediated water retention [^28477fe5] [^2791a906] [^19dbc176].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about SIADH just because urine sodium is high and the patient is euvolemic. I need to ensure I exclude hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency first because they are reversible causes of euvolemic hyponatremia, and I should confirm that the diagnosis of SIADH remains one of exclusion after ruling out these endocrine etiologies and reviewing medications that potentiate vasopressin action, including SSRIs, SNRIs, thiazides, and antiepileptics, before labeling the case as SIADH [^19dbc176] [^0043acdd].

> Let me consider the neurocritical care scenario carefully, because distinguishing SIADH from cerebral salt wasting is crucial and often challenging. Initially, I thought CSW was exceedingly rare outside neurosurgical contexts, but wait, I should verify newer data suggesting CSW may be underrecognized on general wards; the key is that CSW reflects renal sodium wasting with true volume depletion, so the therapeutic imperative is salt and water repletion rather than fluid restriction, whereas SIADH is volume-expanded and responds to fluid restriction; if I cannot distinguish confidently, hypertonic saline is a safe bridge in symptomatic patients while I continue to reassess volume status and urine chemistries [^b335ead5] [^b4781cfd] [^4d0f153e].

> I should double-check for endocrine causes in euvolemic patients with inappropriately concentrated urine. Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency impair free water excretion and can mimic SIADH biochemically, so I need to check TSH and free T4, and either cortisol with ACTH stimulation or an 8 am cortisol with clinical judgment, because correcting these primary disorders will normalize sodium without the risks of overly rapid correction [^19dbc176].

> But wait, what if the presentation is exercise-associated hyponatremia. I need to ensure I ask about prolonged exertion, fluid intake patterns, and whether the athlete gained weight during the event, because EAH is typically euvolemic or hypervolemic from overdrinking with retained fluid, and management hinges on fluid restriction and, in severe cases, hypertonic saline rather than isotonic fluids, which can worsen the hyponatremia; I should also remember that EAH can mimic heat illness, so I must differentiate based on history and, when available, sodium testing [^f4e652e5] [^a970d691] [^fd5701c6].

> Next, I should review adjunctive diagnostic markers, and I need to be cautious not to overinterpret them. Fractional excretion of uric acid less than 12 percent supports decreased effective arterial blood volume, whereas greater than 12 percent favors SIADH, and although copeptin has been proposed to help distinguish AVP-driven states, I should confirm that copeptin alone lacks sufficient diagnostic accuracy and that a copeptin-to-urine sodium ratio may perform better in select cohorts, so I should not replace basic evaluation with copeptin testing [^7a64bcf8] [^835b78f1] [^18091091].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm, and I should verify that it aligns with major guidelines. First, confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia with measured osmolality and exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic causes, then obtain urine osmolality to separate dilutional from concentrated urine, then assess volume status clinically and with urine sodium, and finally tailor testing to suspected etiologies, including thyroid, adrenal, and medication review, recognizing that most guidance documents converge on this osmolality, volume status, and urine studies framework despite minor threshold differences [^0632c300] [^28477fe5] [^19dbc176].

> I should confirm severity and chronicity because treatment urgency depends on both. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia with encephalopathy, seizures, or respiratory compromise warrants immediate hypertonic saline to raise sodium by about 4 to 6 mEq/L rapidly, whereas chronic hyponatremia carries a higher risk of osmotic demyelination if corrected too fast, so I need to set a correction limit of no more than 8 to 10 mEq/L in 24 hours and monitor closely to avoid overshoot, especially in patients with alcohol use disorder, liver disease, or malnutrition [^90dd948b] [^64a8cacf] [^19dbc176].

> Hold on, I should verify common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Misclassification of volume status, anchoring on SIADH without excluding endocrine causes, and failure to check urine studies are frequent errors, and real-world data show that basic diagnostic steps are often omitted, leading to suboptimal outcomes; to mitigate this, I need to use a structured approach, document reasoning at each step, and reassess if the clinical course deviates from expectations, particularly in cancer, neurocritical care, and polypharmacy settings [^45c03e3c] [^94c62697] [^19dbc176].

> Finally, I need to ensure the management plan matches the diagnosis and that I build in safety. Hypovolemic hyponatremia responds to isotonic saline, euvolemic SIADH to fluid restriction and possibly urea or vaptans, and hypervolemic hyponatremia to fluid restriction and disease-directed therapy such as optimizing heart failure or cirrhosis management, with hypertonic saline reserved for severe symptoms; throughout, I should calculate expected sodium changes, monitor frequently, and be prepared to administer desmopressin to halt overly rapid correction if needed, keeping the patient's chronicity and risk profile front and center [^77f9855a] [^5d817d8e] [^90dd948b].

Hyponatremia is best differentiated by **serum osmolality** to exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states, then by **volume status** (hypovolemic, euvolemic, hypervolemic) and **urine studies** (urine sodium and osmolality) to pinpoint the cause [^19dbc176] [^0632c300]. Hypovolemic hyponatremia shows low urine sodium (< 30 mmol/L) with high urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/kg), euvolemic hyponatremia often reflects SIADH with high urine sodium (> 30 mmol/L) and high urine osmolality, and hypervolemic hyponatremia (heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) has low urine sodium with high urine osmolality [^a3af82a4] [^2791a906]. Acute vs chronic onset guides safe correction limits to avoid osmotic demyelination [^64a8cacf] [^19dbc176].

---

## Step 1: confirm true hyponatremia and exclude pseudohyponatremia

Measure **serum osmolality** to distinguish hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatremia [^0632c300]:

- **Hypotonic hyponatremia**: serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg [^0632c300].
- **Hypertonic hyponatremia**: serum osmolality > 295 mOsm/kg (e.g. hyperglycemia, mannitol) [^68a3796b].
- **Isotonic hyponatremia**: serum osmolality 275–295 mOsm/kg (e.g. pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia) [^68a3796b].

---

## Step 2: classify by volume status

Assess **clinical volume status** to categorize hyponatremia as hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic [^19dbc176]:

| **Category** | **Clinical features** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | - Dry mucosa <br/> - Orthostatic hypotension <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Decreased skin turgor | - GI losses <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency <br/> - Cerebral/renal salt wasting [^b335ead5] |
| Euvolemic | - No edema <br/> - No signs of volume depletion | - SIADH <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency <br/> - Polydipsia <br/> - Medications (SSRIs, NSAIDs, thiazides) [^19dbc176] [^0043acdd] |
| Hypervolemic | - Peripheral edema <br/> - Ascites <br/> - Pulmonary edema | - Heart failure <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome [^9e2e1ac0] |

---

## Step 3: evaluate urine studies

Urine sodium and osmolality refine the differential within each **volume category**:

- **Hypovolemic hyponatremia**: urine sodium < 30 mmol/L suggests extrarenal losses; > 30 mmol/L suggests renal losses (e.g. diuretics, salt-wasting nephropathy) [^a3af82a4].
- **Euvolemic hyponatremia**: urine sodium > 30 mmol/L and urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg suggest SIADH; urine osmolality < 100 mOsm/kg suggests primary polydipsia or low solute intake [^2791a906].
- **Hypervolemic hyponatremia**: urine sodium < 30 mmol/L with high urine osmolality reflects decreased effective arterial blood volume (heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) [^a3af82a4].

---

## Step 4: consider special etiologies

- **SIADH**: diagnosis of exclusion; euvolemic, high urine sodium (> 30 mmol/L), high urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/kg), normal renal, hepatic, adrenal, and thyroid function [^9e2e1ac0].
- **Endocrine disorders**: hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency cause euvolemic hyponatremia; check TSH, free T4, cortisol, and ACTH as indicated [^19dbc176].
- **Medication-induced**: thiazides, SSRIs, NSAIDs, and others can cause SIADH-like hyponatremia [^0043acdd].
- **Exercise-associated hyponatremia**: euvolemic or hypervolemic from excessive hypotonic fluid intake; treat with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline if severe [^f4e652e5].

---

## Step 5: determine chronicity

Establish **acute (< 48 hours) vs chronic (≥ 48 hours)** to guide safe correction limits and prevent osmotic demyelination [^8623e8d2] [^64a8cacf].

---

## Step 6: integrate clinical context

Combine history, exam, and labs to identify the cause and guide therapy; **treat the underlying cause** and correct sodium safely with close monitoring [^19dbc176].

---

Differentiating hyponatremia relies on **serum osmolality**, **volume status**, and **urine studies**, with chronicity guiding safe correction. This structured approach ensures accurate diagnosis and reduces complications.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^4781b0ea]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Plasma osmolality measurement… [^9e2e1ac0]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Total body sodium is primarily extracellular, and any increase results in increased tonicity, which stimulates the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion. Arginine vasopressin then acts on the V2 receptors in the renal tubules, causing increased water reabsorption. The opposite occurs with decreased extracellular sodium: a decrease inhibits the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion, resulting in diuresis. In most cases, hyponatremia results when the elimination of total body water decreases. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia will be discussed later in this article. HYPERVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in the presence of edema indicates increased total body sodium and water. This increase in total body water is greater than the total body sodium level, resulting in edema. The three main causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia are congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal diseases such as renal failure and nephrotic syndrome.

These disorders usually are obvious from the clinical history and physical examination alone. EUVOLEMIC AND HYPOVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in a volume-depleted patient is caused by a deficit in total body sodium and total body water, with a disproportionately greater sodium loss, whereas in euvolemic hyponatremia, the total body sodium level is normal or near normal. Differentiating between hypovolemia and euvolemia may be clinically difficult, especially if the classic features of volume depletion such as postural hypotension and tachycardia are absent. DECREASED PLASMA OSMOLALITY Patients with low plasma osmolality can be hypovolemic or euvolemic. The level of urine sodium is used to further refine the differential diagnosis. SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be suspected when hyponatremia is accompanied by urine that is hyperosmolar compared with the plasma.

This situation implies the presence of a low plasma osmolality with an inappropriately high urine osmolality, although the urine osmolality does not necessarily have to exceed the normal range. Another suggestive feature is the presence of hypouricemia caused by increased fractional excretion of urate.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^cc2b8ddc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^e1611723]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Conclusions

Current guidelines on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia often fail to meet methodological criteria for development and reporting as described by AGREE II. Despite many similarities, recommendations are sometimes inconsistent, but to what extent this is attributable to the underlying development process remains unclear.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^0f3b94b5]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Managing hyponatremia in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^a879bad9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^19dbc176]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^e6f1a16b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^b3bf34d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Management of hyponatremia [^18e583f0]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Incidence and prevalence of hyponatremia [^42fff03d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in clinical practice. The reported frequency of the disorder is determined by a number of factors, including the definition of hyponatremia, the frequency of testing, the healthcare setting, and the patient population. This review focuses on the incidence and prevalence of hyponatremia. In acute hospital care, particular attention is given to admission versus hospital-acquired hyponatremia. Although less well studied, the epidemiology of hyponatremia in the ambulatory-based setting and the geriatric/nursing home population is also summarized. Finally, the frequency of hyponatremia occurring in special clinical conditions — including congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, pneumonia, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome — as well as in marathon runners will be reviewed. Substantial additional work is still required to determine the true occurrence of hyponatremia in the various clinical settings. Beyond the phenomenologic value, advances in the epidemiology of hyponatremia should also provide insights in the prognostic implications as well as the preventive and management strategies of the disorder in various clinical settings.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^be299382]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Utility and limitations of the traditional diagnostic approach to hyponatremia: a diagnostic study [^7a64bcf8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia is often challenging because of its association with multiple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diseases, and treatment options. Several algorithms are available to guide the diagnostic approach to hyponatremia, but their diagnostic and clinical utility has never been evaluated. We aimed to assess in detail the diagnostic utility as well as the limitations of the existing approaches to hyponatremia.

Methods

Each of the 121 consecutive subjects presenting with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmoL/L) underwent 3 different and independent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: inexperienced doctor applying an established Algorithm, intensive care senior physicians acting as Senior Physician, and senior endocrinologist serving as Reference Standard.

Results

The overall diagnostic agreement between Algorithm and Reference Standard was 71% (respective Cohen's kappa and delta values were 0.64 and 0.70), the overall diagnostic agreement between Senior Physician and Reference Standard was 32% (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). Regarding the therapeutic consequences, the diagnostic accuracy of the Algorithm was 86% (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and of the Senior Physician was 48% (0.01 and 0.04, respectively). In retrospect, by disregarding the patient's extracellular fluid volume and assessing the effective arterial blood volume by determination of the fractional urate excretion, the Algorithm improved its diagnostic accuracy to 95%.

Conclusion

Although the Algorithm performed reasonably well, several shortcomings became apparent, rendering it difficult to apply the Algorithm without reservation. Whether some modifications may enhance its diagnostic accuracy and simplify the management of hyponatremia needs to be determined.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^92379137]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f3154383]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^f430c9d4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^d18691e4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Risk of adverse clinical outcomes in hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions: a population-based cohort study [^ec4a2036]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

We found robust results in almost 5600 SIAD patients, leading to an alternative, more hypothetical explanation that (over-)production of the antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) during acute medical conditions might be an appropriate sign of immediate hormonal response. It is well established that various stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increasing vasopressin secretion. Thus, hyponatremia may simply be a marker for high levels of a stress hormone to maintain blood pressure and preserve fluid volume, an evolutionary advantage in "flight-or-fight" situations. Therefore, we may postulate that patients showing an adequate high vasopressin response in a "stress" situation have a survival advantage compared to comparably ill patients without such a capability. However, whether the increase in antidiuretic hormones is appropriate or inappropriate warrants further elucidation.

The major strength of this study is its high external validity, which is based on the large nationwide sample comprising nearly 100 000 patients. Within this cohort, weighted analysis allowed for highly accurate estimates at the national level.

Our data must be interpreted in the context of the study design. First, a certain risk of misclassification and underreporting needs to be acknowledged because administrative data were used in our analyses and we were not able to ascertain the diagnoses. Second, in our study population, merely 2.2% of all included hospitalized medical patients were diagnosed with hyponatremia and qualified for propensity-score matching, although current evidence suggests a much higher prevalence among hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, we were able to include more than 47 000 patients into our propensity-score matched analysis of real-world data. This rather strong data basis, in conjunction with the consistency of the observed effects of hyponatremia on clinical outcome measures in this study, indicates a high degree of internal validity and generalizability. Third, the diagnosis of hyponatremia was based on ICD-10 classification in discharge reports and in some of these reports non-SIAD and SIAD causes of hyponatremia were not distinguished. Because we do not have information on clinical symptoms and severity of hyponatremia, we are unable to account for unmeasured and unmeasurable residual confounding (eg, etiology of hyponatremia, thirst perception, volume status, body mass index, smoking status).

In conclusion, there is a relevant health-care burden among hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions. Further studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms on how hyponatremia may differentially modulate clinical outcomes.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^f4e652e5]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) guidelines — EAH is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity, and it is reported in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in environments with limited medical care and delayed evacuation. To mitigate mismanagement, care providers in the prehospital and in hospital settings must differentiate from other causes because EAH most commonly has overlapping signs and symptoms with heat exhaustion and exertional heat stroke, and rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form. The Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel in May 2018 to update WMS Practice Guidelines for Treatment of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia published in 2014; recommendations are made based on presenting with symptomatic EAH, particularly when point-of-care blood sodium testing is unavailable in the field, and are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balanced between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians. Reports have primarily focused on incidences of EAH in organized endurance events conducted in the front country, where medical tents and local emergency medical services are available onsite, but prolonged exertional activities also occur in the backcountry and EAH has been documented in hikers, trekkers, climbers, and cold climate endurance athletes.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

[Na], Serum sodium concentration; +, always; +/–, If clinically indicated/sometimes useful.

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^ecf0d2d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

### Hyponatremia and brain injury: historical and contemporary perspectives [^c6ec670c]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in neurocritical care patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research into the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW), their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood. This paper reviews the history behind our understanding of hyponatremia in patients with neurologic injury, including the first reports of CSW and SIADH, and current and future challenges to diagnosis and management in this setting. Such challenges include distinguishing CSW, SIADH, and hypovolemic hyponatremia due to a normal pressure natriuresis from the administration of large volumes of fluids, and hyponatremia due to certain medications used in the neurocritical care population. Potential treatments for hyponatremia include mineralocorticoids and vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists, but further work is required to validate their usage. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlining hyponatremia in neurocritical care patients remains our biggest obstacle to optimizing patient outcomes in this challenging population.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to risk of osmotic demyelination, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome depends on the following factors:

- biochemical degree and duration of hyponatremia at presentation

- speed of increase in serum sodium concentration

- history of alcohol abuse and/or liver disease

- use of thiazide or antidepressant medications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^758a0619]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^9abf1fb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to urine osmolality, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to attribute hyponatremia to relative excess water intake in patients with a urine osmolality ≤ 100 mOsm/kg.

### Systemic diseases associated with disorders of water homeostasis [^51c1ad25]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Disorders of AVP secretion and action sometimes present as the first manifestation of a variety of different systemic diseases. It is prudent for the clinician to consider these causes in the differential diagnosis of hypoosmolar hyponatremia, polyuria and polydipsia, since recognizing the underlying disorder may affect treatment decisions, and intervention directed at the primary disorder often can reverse the abnormal water metabolism in these patients. Although much of the pathophysiology of these disorders is not understood completely, great progress has been made toward appreciating the complex and precise system involving thirst, AVP secretion, and renal responsiveness to AVP. Further investigation in this field likely will allow physicians to offer more effective and potent treatments in the future, such as the development of AVP V2 receptor antagonists for the treatment of SIADH [81] and edema-forming states [18, 109].

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) management principles and heat illness definition — For this guideline, heat illness is defined "as any total body water deficit (> 2% of body weight) that can occur from sweat loss during physical activity in high environmental temperatures." When EAH is confirmed or strongly suspected, "empiric treatment of symptomatic EAH is an acceptable option," and "treatment options should be predicated on the presence (or absence) of neurologic impairment to differentiate mild EAH from severe EAH and guide resuscitative choices." The page notes this algorithmic empiric approach "can be lifesaving and is unlikely (but unconfirmed) to induce harm," and emphasizes that "individuals can rapidly progress from mild to severe EAH," so "initial resuscitation and symptomatic care to minimize morbidity and progression of disease are of paramount importance."

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Hyponatremia in acute decompensated heart failure: mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options [^baf2f194]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common and is increasingly recognized as an independent prognostic marker that adversely affects morbidity and mortality in various disease states, including heart failure. In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the degree of hyponatremia often parallels the severity of cardiac dysfunction and is further exacerbated by any reduction in glomerular filtration rate and arginine vasopressin dysregulation. A recent study showed that even modest improvement of hyponatremia may have survival benefits. Although management of hyponatremia in ADHF has traditionally focused on improving cardiac function and fluid restriction, the magnitude of improvement of serum sodium is fairly slow and unpredictable. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of hyponatremia in ADHF, review its evolving prognostic significance, and evaluate the efficacy of various treatments for hyponatremia, including the recently approved vasopressin receptor antagonists for managing hyponatremia among patients hospitalized for ADHF.

### Biochemical and etiological characteristics of acute hyponatremia in the emergency department [^2e7a7c9d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia can be classified as acute or chronic depending on its duration, and treatment options are tailored to this classification. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate acute from chronic hyponatremia in the Emergency Department (ED). The objective of this study was to identify characteristics to help diagnose and manage acute hyponatremia in the ED. Patients with acute hyponatremia in the ED were enrolled from a retrospective 2-year chart review. Eleven patients (0.8%) were identified with acute hyponatremia out of a total of 1321 hyponatremic patients. There were nine women and two men. The mean age was 48.9 years. The mean sodium (Na(+)) level was 115 ± 4 mmol/L. Accompanying biochemical abnormalities included hypouricemia and hypouremia with increased fractional excretions of uric acid (UA) and urea. The estimated amount of water intake ranged from 2.5 to 10 liters (mean, 5.1 ± 2.3 liters) during the day before ED presentation. All patients were treated with hypertonic saline and furosemide at a correction rate of 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L/h. No patients had neurological sequelae after treatment. The causes of acute hyponatremia included induction of abortion with oxytocin (n = 1), primary polydipsia on neuroleptic agents (n = 2), polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation for colonoscopy (n = 1), diuretic therapy for hypertension (n = 4), ecstasy use (n = 1), and weight-reducing herbal teas (n = 2). We conclude that in the right clinical setting, high free water intake and low serum urea and UA favor acute hyponatremia. A detailed drug history may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of acute hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^329658e7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

### Evolution and evolving resolution of controversy over existence and prevalence of cerebral / renal salt wasting [^b335ead5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The topic of hyponatremia is in a state of flux. We review a new approach to diagnosis that is superior to previous methods. It simplifies identifying the causes of hyponatremia, the most important issue being the differentiation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) from cerebral/renal salt wasting (RSW). We also report on the high prevalence of RSW without cerebral disease in the general wards of the hospital.

Recent Findings

We applied our new approach to hyponatremia by utilizing sound pathophysiologic criteria in 62 hyponatremic patients. Seventeen (27%) had SIADH, 19 (31%) had a reset osmostat, 24 (38%) had RSW with 21 having no evidence of cerebral disease, 1 had Addison's disease, and 1 was because of hydrochlorothiazide. Many had urine sodium concentrations (UNa) less than 30mmol/l.

Summary

RSW is much more common than perceived in the general wards of the hospital. It is important to change the terminology from cerebral to RSW and to differentiate SIADH from RSW. These changes will improve clinical outcomes because of divergent therapeutic goals of water-restricting in SIADH and administering salt and water to a dehydrated patient with RSW. The present review will hopefully spur others to reflect and act on the new findings and different approaches to hyponatremia.

### Encephalopathy at high altitude: hyponatremia or high altitude cerebral edema? [^64748c63]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveBrain dysfunction at high altitudes can be caused by both high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and hyponatremic encephalopathy. Differentiating them is important for proper treatment but can be difficult. We present a case series of 11 patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy, all initially misdiagnosed as HACE, and we discuss key signs and symptoms that will help clinicians differentiate the 2 pathologies. MethodsWe compiled 11 cases of patients with severe hyponatremia who were diagnosed with HACE, verified through direct patient care or referral consultation. ResultsPatients included 5 males and 6 females aged 19 to 65 y, exercising between 2100 and 4300 m. Serum Na + concentration ranged from 112 to 127mmol·L -1. Features included ataxia, confusion, and progression to coma without the hallmark imaging features of HACE. Clinically, the rapid progression of symptoms, moderate altitude, short duration of altitude exposure, and seizure activity suggested hyponatremia rather than HACE. All but 1 patient shared classic risk factors for exercise-associated hyponatremia: moderate to extreme exercise, rapid high volume (> 5 L) fluid intake, clamminess, pallor, and nausea. Five patients suffered seizures, 4 used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, 4 had pulmonary edema, and 3 showed features of the syndrome of antidiuretic hormone secretion. ConclusionsSevere hyponatremia should be considered in persons with encephalopathy at high altitudes. Although there is no established causal link between hypobaric hypoxia and hyponatremia, the potential for high altitude exposure to exacerbate exercise-associated hyponatremia warrants further investigation because the consequences of developing or misdiagnosing this process may be severe.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^7eb9cd53]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^c929f35f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with stroke and associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality risk. The present review presents the underlying causes and provides a thorough algorithm for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in stroke patients. Concomitant diseases and therapies, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, along with diuretics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors are the most common causes of hyponatraemia in community. In the setting of acute stroke, the emergence of hyponatraemia might be attributed to the administration of hypotonic solutions and drugs (ie. mannitol and antiepileptics), poor solute intake, infections, as well as stroke-related conditions or complications, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, cerebral salt wasting syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatraemia, usually caused by hyperglycaemia or recent mannitol administration in patients with stroke. Determining urine osmolality, urine sodium level and volume status are the following steps in the differentiation of hypotonic hyponatraemia. Of note, specific parameters, such as fractional uric acid and urea excretion, along with plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic yield. Therapeutic options are based on the duration and symptoms of hyponatremia. In the case of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline administration is recommended. Hypovolaemic chronic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic solution administration. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for the rest forms of chronic hyponatraemia, therapies increasing renal free water excretion may be necessary. Loop diuretics and urea serve this purpose in patients with stroke, whereas sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors appear to be a promising therapy. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the appropriate restoration of sodium level improves outcomes in such patients. Randomized trials designed to compare therapeutic strategies in managing hyponatraemia in patients with stroke are required.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^cbdaad74]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia is frequently observed in cancer patients and can be explained by malignant disease itself, concomitant comorbidities, physical stress (e.g. pain), or medication. In hospitalized cancer patients, hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and length of hospital stay, and higher costs. It is widely accepted that the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) due to ectopic release of vasopressin accounts for the majority of cases. However, drugs including chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies, hypo- or hypervolemia, as well as other less frequent disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, myxedema, etc. must be ruled out as possible alternative causes. Diagnostic work-up is often viewed as complex, and treatment is considered cumbersome and potentially dangerous. However, despite the urgent need for better education on how to approach the hyponatremic patient, no evidence-based guideline for hyponatremia management specific to cancer patients is available. Current management strategies are not well characterized.

The multinational Hyponatremia Registry (NCT01240668) assessed the current state of treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in real-world hospital settings. This report focuses on the subgroup of patients with cancer and SIADH with the aim to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum [Na +].

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^835b78f1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Copeptin Measurement in Hyponatremia

Copeptin has also been proposed as a diagnostic marker in hyponatremia, which makes sense from a pathophysiological point of view: underlying conditions leading to hyponatremia are assumed to be AVP dependent or AVP modulating and can be classified according to the patient's volume status (hypervolemic, hypovolemic, and euvolemic hyponatremia). Hypervolemic (due to heart failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) and hypovolemic hyponatremia (eg, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal losses) are both characterized by decreased effective arterial blood volume, whereas euvolemic hyponatremia with SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis) as the most frequent cause is not.

The diagnostic approach to patients with hyponatremia is unsatisfactory and complex and accurate diagnostic markers would be of major clinical importance since hyponatremia is common and associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. The first prospective study investigating the role of copeptin in the differentiation of hyponatremia included 106 hyponatremic patients and showed no diagnostic utility of copeptin alone, but the ratio of copeptin to urinary sodium helped to discriminate between SIAD and conditions with decreased effective arterial blood volume and, therefore, hemodynamically stimulated AVP release (sensitivity 85%, specificity 87%).

A larger prospective observational study with copeptin measurements in 298 hypo-osmolar hyponatremic patients showed that clearly elevated copeptin levels > 84 pmol/L were indicative for hypovolemic hyponatremia (specificity 90%, sensitivity 23%). Conversely, very low levels < 3.9 pmol/L were diagnostic for primary polydipsia (specificity 91%, sensitivity, 58%). Although specificity for highest and lowest copeptin values was quite high, sensitivity was poor as most patients harbored copeptin measurements within the middle range. Those values overlapped widely between the different hyponatremia categories and copeptin was not helpful in differentiating between SIAD and other main causes of hyponatremia, such as hypovolemic and hypervolemic or diuretic-induced hyponatremia. Moreover, copeptin values also showed a broad variability within single categories (Fig. 3).

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

### Cerebral salt wasting versus SIADH: what difference? [^4d0f153e]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The term cerebral salt wasting (CSW) was introduced before the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was described in 1957. Subsequently, CSW virtually vanished, only to reappear a quarter century later in the neurosurgical literature. A valid diagnosis of CSW requires evidence of inappropriate urinary salt losses and reduced "effective arterial blood volume". With no gold standard, the reported measures of volume depletion do not stand scrutiny. We cannot tell the difference between CSW and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Furthermore, the distinction does not make a difference; regardless of volume status, hyponatremia complicating intracranial disease should be treated with hypertonic saline.

Duloxetine was associated with hyponatremia at a greater rate than the other studied antidepressants. Bupropion and paroxetine were associated with the lowest risks of hyponatremia.

Our study suggests that patients on duloxetine and other antidepressants with higher risks of hyponatremia might benefit from more rigorous monitoring for hyponatremia.

Several classes of commonly used antidepressants can cause hyponatremia via the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) through mechanisms involving the central nervous system. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can lead to increased release of ADH from the posterior pituitary by potentiating the activation of adrenergic receptors within the hypothalamus. With SSRIs, the incidence of drug‐induced SIADH has been reported in 0.5 to 32% of patients using these drugs.

SSRIs, SNRIs, and norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) are widely used for the treatment of mood disorders (such as major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain. In clinical practice, the selection of antidepressants is based on optimizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity. Other common side effects of these medications can include changes in eating habits, changes in sleep patterns, and changes in sexual function.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^94c62697]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Reassessing the role of copeptin in emergency department admissions for hypotonic hyponatremia [^18091091]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypotonic hyponatremia is a major electrolyte imbalance in the general population and the most common encountered during hospitalization.

In acute settings, reduced serum sodium (s-Na) may result from impaired electrolyte-free water clearance due to strong stimulation of hypothalamic arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion during acute inflammatory states. Additionally, in cases of acute-onset or moderate to severe hyponatremia, considerable neurological symptoms may occur due to plasma hypotonicity, which can lead to cerebral edema.

All things considered, patients suffering from hypotonic hyponatremia are characterized by a wide variety of signs and symptoms, sometimes serious and leading to access to the emergency department (ED), where a correct diagnostic classification and a timely adequate therapeutic approach are essential.

The determination of plasma copeptin (C-terminal portion of pro-AVP, CT-proAVP) in hyponatremia characterization has shown mixed results. In fact, on the one hand, copeptin boasts a better correlation with plasma osmolality (p-Osm) than AVP in the presence of lower preanalytical issues, and an accurate automated assay. On the other, its determination does not seem capable of simplifying the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia, where persistent secretion of AVP remains the primary mechanism leading to the reduction of electrolyte-free water clearance.

Even mild and minimally symptomatic cases of hyponatremia are associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization risk. In particular, chronic reduced s-Na are significant, independent predictor of frailty, irrespective of age, a condition associated to an increased risk of disability, hospitalization, postoperative complications and death. Moreover, low s-Na levels adversely affect the prognosis of chronic conditions like heart failure (HF) and cancer.

In this context, copeptin has shown potential in predicting various clinical conditions associated with hypotonic hyponatremia. It has been recognized for its ability to predict exacerbations of chronic HF, the need for advanced treatments in patients unresponsive to standard therapy, and the severity of sepsis or pneumonia. Consistently, some studies suggest that copeptin may have predictive value in hyponatremic patients presenting to the ED, with implications beyond the electrolyte disorder itself.

### Serum sodium in relation to various domains of cognitive function in the elderly US population [^e4cd3a79]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium is one of the major extra-cellular fluid electrolytes, which is important in maintaining extracellular fluid volume and potentials across cell membranes. Imbalances in sodium concentrations have been known to manifest as headaches, confusion, nausea, and restlessness, while rapid changes in sodium concentrations result in acute neurologic symptoms such as seizures and impaired mental status. Hyponatremia is commonly defined as serum sodium concentrations less than 135 mmol/L and is prevalent in the elderly due to impaired water-excretory capacity associated with normal aging. Most cases of hyponatremia are mild and relatively asymptomatic; however, recent evidence suggests that hyponatremia may be associated with gait disturbances, falls, and cognitive impairment.

Only a few studies have addressed the relationship between serum sodium levels and cognitive function; however, the definition of cognitive function appears to vary among studies. In addition, studies only examine single domains of cognitive function, or assess multiple domains grouped as a single variable. Previous studies addressing the relationship between serum sodium levels and cognitive function have assessed cognitive function using a combination of attention tests (Visual Vigilance, Working Memory or Digit Span, Go/No Go, Intermodal Comparison, Divided Attention, Phasic Alert tests), the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screening (ARCS) tool, a combination of the modified Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and the Trail Making Test, and a combination of the MMSE and Clock Completion Test. In addition, most previous studies are limited to specific populations (i.e. men or single hospital settings).

Cognitive change is part of the normal process of aging. In contrast to cognitive domains such as language, some cognitive abilities such as memory, executive function, and processing speed decline over time, and the rate of decline varies among individuals. Cognitive performance is usually categorized in terms of domains of functioning (i.e. executive functioning, processing speed), and these domains are linked to specific areas of the brain. In order to differentiate between the various types of conditions causing cognitive impairment, specific subdomains are assessed separately. As a result, it is of importance to determine the specific domains of cognitive function associated with serum sodium levels. Our study aims to assess the relationship between serum sodium levels and various domains of cognitive function including, memory, executive function, and processing speed using the CERAD Word Learning Test (CERAD WLT), Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST) in the elderly population of the US aged 60 and older.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^315f6da1]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (HN), defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) below the lower limit of normal, is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence as high as 30–42%. HN is independently associated with mortality in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and hospitalized patients in general, and with increased hospital costs and readmission rates. Chronic HN has been linked to impaired gait and balance, increased falls and fracture rates, and osteoporosis. However, a causal role of HN for these associations is largely unproven.

Correction of severe HN of sudden onset can be genuinely lifesaving, and treatment of chronic HN associated with neurological symptoms is undeniably beneficial. Despite the widespread clinical impression that correction of less severe chronic HN is also worthwhile, evidence-based data demonstrating clinical benefit are limited.,

Hypovolemic HN responds readily to volume repletion. Until recently, treatment of hypervolemic HN has been limited to fluid restriction (FR) and correction of the underlying disorder. Treatment modalities for euvolemic HN have included FR, hypertonic saline (HS), loop diuretics, demeclocycline, and urea. With the approval of the vasopressin-receptor antagonists conivaptan and tolvaptan, more targeted treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic HN became available. It remains uncertain how treatment options are employed, and how correction magnitude and incidence of adverse outcomes are affected by the type of therapy. With this background, the multinational HN Registry was initiated to assess the current state of treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic HN in diverse, real-world hospital settings. Its specific purpose was to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in [Na +]. An additional goal was to determine which treatments posed the greatest risk of overly rapid correction and osmotic demyelination.

### Evaluation and management of hyponatremia: an emerging role for vasopressin receptor antagonists [^67c34057]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists, collectively known as the 'vaptans', provide a new approach to the treatment of hyponatremia; therefore, an updated Review of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia is particularly timely. After briefly defining hyponatremia and introducing its clinical aspects and complications, we present an approach to the diagnosis and evaluation of hyponatremia that is based primarily on the often-underused concept of free water clearance and, more specifically, the electrolyte-free water clearance. Then we review the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists in the management of hyponatremia from the standpoint of their pharmacology, their mechanism of action, and available efficacy data from clinical trials.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^69c2c422]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity," while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema." Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity." Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke." Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia." Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)." Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)," and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure."

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^3c391830]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically synthesize and appraise clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia In accordance with the Prisma statement, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and searched an additional 337 websites of specialist societies and guideline organizations (Additional file 6). We used AGREE II, a validated and reliable instrument, and an adequate number of reviewers to individually appraise the guidance documents. On top of the individual appraisals, we included an attempt to resolve major discrepancies and increase consistency by introducing an audiotaped group consensus meeting. During this meeting, reviewers could explain and motivate their scores and adapt them if they wanted to. This mostly resulted only in modest downgrading of domain scores by 1% to 10%. Most of the changes happened because reviewers felt they had scored inconsistently for a same rationale, or because they missed information during the initial appraisal that was in fact available in the document. Although the scores did not change substantially, the group felt the discussion further highlighted the qualitative differences between the guidance documents. In addition, even the reviewers with large deviations from the mean in their initial scores felt they agreed with the conclusion. It means that final average scores were truly a product of consensus rather than a mathematical calculation, as proposed in the original AGREE protocol. We believe that a consensus meeting is valuable in any guideline appraisal process, and particularly useful if reviewer groups have the intention to select a guideline for local use.

This study has its limitations. We based our assessment on what guideline organizations actually reported. Reporting by guideline developers may not wholly reflect what occurred in practice with respect to the AGREE criteria, and we did not seek additional clarification. However, contacting guideline developers is not standard practice when using AGREE as the instrument specifically aims to provide a framework for assessing the quality of reporting of recommendations. We aimed to summarize the existing recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia as formulated by other guideline development groups and to evaluate the quality of the guideline development process. We did not aim to summarize or critically appraise the evidence base itself. Consequently, it is difficult to assess to what extent differences between guidance documents stem from differences in development procedures rather than important limitations in the evidence base that underpin individual recommendations. Secondly, the purpose of using the AGREE instrument was not to accuse guideline development groups of being biased, but rather to highlight both strengths and weaknesses of existing guidance to suggest on how we could make improvements in the future.

### Adenoma mimicking hyponatremia of SIAD [^5ef28068]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder, with prevalence as high as 20% in inpatient settings. It is classified based on volume status, urine sodium and osmolality results. While this approach might help narrow down the differential diagnoses, it can leave other diagnoses unentertained. In this case, we report recurrent and refractory hyponatremia secondary to hypocortisolism due to non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma. Interestingly, urine studies mimicked syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, but exclusively responded to hydrocortisone replacement. Hospital course was also complicated by hyponatremia-induced rhabdomyolysis, which is a rare complication of severe hyponatremia. We also discuss the role of anchoring heuristics and how they influence the physician's decision leading to possible diagnostic errors. One way to minimise the effect of anchoring bias on physicians is their cognitive awareness of such bias. In addition, discussing complicated cases with all members of medical team can highlight the clinician's thought processes, share uncertainty and help broaden differential diagnoses.

### Hyponatremia in the neurosurgical patient: diagnosis and management [^b4781cfd]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients who have undergone neurosurgery for intracranial processes. Making an accurate diagnosis between the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW) in patients in whom hyponatremia develops is important because treatment differs greatly between the conditions. The SIADH is a volume-expanded condition, whereas CSW is a volume-contracted state that involves renal loss of sodium. Treatment for patients with SIADH is fluid restriction and treatment for patients with CSW is generally salt and water replacement. In this review, the authors discuss the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia, distinguish SIADH from CSW, and highlight the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia, which is commonly encountered in patients who have undergone neurosurgery, specifically those with traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, recent transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary tumors, and postoperative cranial vault reconstruction for craniosynostosis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^fb44250d]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.
