## Question

How many units of blood should be administered for an estimated blood loss of 3500 ml?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many units of red blood cells should be administered for an estimated blood loss of 3500 mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's total blood volume and what percentage 3500 mL represents. Then, I should verify the transfusion thresholds and whether this degree of blood loss mandates immediate transfusion. Next, I will consider the need for plasma and platelets in balanced resuscitation and the role of massive transfusion protocols. After that, I should review pediatric versus adult dosing and the principle of reassessing after each unit. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, scenario-based recommendation and note key caveats about estimation accuracy and coagulopathy management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of 3500 mL of blood loss. In a typical 70 kg adult, total blood volume is about 5 liters, so 3500 mL corresponds to roughly 70% of blood volume, which exceeds the thresholds where RBC transfusion is immediately indicated and where coagulopathy and organ hypoperfusion become likely if uncorrected [^898d60fe].

> Wait, let me verify the transfusion triggers. For massive hemorrhage, RBC transfusion is indicated when 30–40% of blood volume is lost, and it is immediately required when more than 40% is lost; 3500 mL clearly meets the latter criterion, so RBCs should be given urgently alongside hemorrhage control and supportive care [^898d60fe]. I should also confirm that contemporary guidelines endorse restrictive hemoglobin thresholds in stable, non-bleeding patients, but this does not apply to active massive hemorrhage where oxygen-carrying capacity must be restored promptly [^c7dab591] [^1225f45d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fixed unit counts. I initially thought "about 7 units" based on 3500 mL divided by roughly 500 mL per unit, but I need to check the modern approach: in massive hemorrhage, transfusion is typically protocolized and ratio-based rather than calculated unit-by-unit, with RBC:FFP:platelets commonly delivered in 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 ratios until hemostasis and labs guide de-escalation; thus, a better answer is to activate a massive transfusion protocol and transfuse in balanced ratios rather than a predetermined number of RBC units [^db806ac6] [^c8a0bf62] [^d1953f58].

> I should confirm the need for plasma and platelets. With losses approaching one blood volume, dilutional coagulopathy is expected; guidelines recommend early plasma in at least a 1:2 ratio with RBCs if results are pending, and many trauma protocols use 1:1:1 initially. Platelets are indicated when counts fall below about 50–75 × 10⁹/L in bleeding patients, which is common in massive transfusion, so platelets should be included early in the resuscitation bundle [^669b1912] [^80ccabd2] [^f93ffed2].

> Let me consider pediatric implications. In children, transfusion should be prescribed by volume rather than units, with RBCs typically 10–15 mL/kg per dose; for a 10 kg child, 3500 mL blood loss is catastrophic and would require rapid, protocolized resuscitation with weight-based volumes of RBCs, plasma, and platelets, ideally via a pediatric massive transfusion protocol if available [^9d98a2a2].

> Next, I should review the principle of reassessment. Even in massive transfusion, best practice is to reassess hemodynamics, bleeding, and labs after each unit or pack when feasible, adjusting the component mix toward goal-directed therapy once coagulation results return; this helps avoid both under-resuscitation and over-transfusion once hemorrhage control is achieved [^644c3f25] [^881620bb].

> But wait, what if the 3500 mL estimate is inaccurate? Visual estimation of blood loss is notoriously unreliable, with a tendency to underestimate at high volumes; quantitative methods improve accuracy, and in obstetrics, standardized quantitative blood loss has been emphasized to guide timely transfusion decisions, so I should double-check the actual loss using scaled canisters, weighed sponges, or validated tools when possible before anchoring on a fixed unit count [^e6141997] [^045f190f].

> I will now examine coagulation targets to guide when to taper. Once labs are available, maintain PT/INR less than about 1.5 times normal with plasma, keep fibrinogen above roughly 1.5–2.0 g/L using cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate, and maintain platelets above about 50–75 × 10⁹/L in actively bleeding patients; these thresholds help transition from empiric ratio-based resuscitation to goal-directed therapy [^0d70f4b7] [^b7525a61].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: for an estimated 3500 mL blood loss in an adult, activate a massive transfusion protocol immediately, transfuse RBCs in balanced ratios with plasma and platelets (commonly 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 initially), and continue until hemorrhage control and hemodynamic stability are achieved, then transition to restrictive, lab-guided transfusion thresholds. A precise unit count cannot be fixed without patient-specific factors, but this degree of loss typically requires multiple units of each component in the first hours of resuscitation [^db806ac6] [^c8a0bf62] [^669b1912].

---

For a 3500 mL blood loss, **activate a massive transfusion protocol** and transfuse 6–8 units of RBCs initially, alongside 3–4 units of plasma and 1 unit of platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio [^c8a0bf62] [^80ccabd2]. This balances oxygen-carrying capacity with clotting factors and platelets to prevent dilutional coagulopathy [^669b1912]. Adjust subsequent transfusions to maintain **hemoglobin 7–9 g/dL** [^174ebf3d] and correct coagulopathy using lab-guided targets (INR ≤ 1.5, platelets ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L, fibrinogen ≥ 1.5 g/L) [^0d70f4b7] [^b7525a61]. Reassess after each unit and tailor to clinical response and ongoing bleeding [^644c3f25].

---

## Initial transfusion strategy

- **Massive transfusion protocol (MTP)**: Activate immediately for 3500 mL blood loss to ensure rapid, coordinated delivery of blood products [^db806ac6].

- **Initial RBC transfusion**: Give 6–8 units of RBCs initially (about 1 blood volume in a 70 kg adult), aiming for hemoglobin 7–9 g/dL [^174ebf3d] [^accdc947].

- **Balanced transfusion**: Administer plasma and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio with RBCs to prevent dilutional coagulopathy [^c8a0bf62] [^80ccabd2].

---

## Recommended transfusion ratios

| **Blood product** | **Recommended ratio** |
|-|-|
| RBCs | 6–8 units initially |
| Plasma (FFP) | 3–4 units (1:1–2 with RBCs) |
| Platelets | 1 unit (1:1 with RBCs) |

---

These ratios are **supported by trauma and critical care guidelines** for massive hemorrhage [^c8a0bf62] [^80ccabd2].

---

## Clinical targets and monitoring

- **Hemoglobin target**: Maintain 7–9 g/dL in actively bleeding patients, adjusting to clinical context and comorbidities [^174ebf3d] [^accdc947].

- **Coagulation targets**: Aim for INR ≤ 1.5, platelets ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L, and fibrinogen ≥ 1.5 g/L; use lab-guided therapy when available [^0d70f4b7] [^f35fa637].

- **Reassessment**: Check hemoglobin, coagulation parameters, and clinical status after each unit to guide ongoing needs [^644c3f25] [^881620bb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, and baseline hemoglobin influence transfusion needs and thresholds [^c7dab591] [^1225f45d].

- **Pediatric patients**: Use weight-based volumes (typically 10–15 mL/kg RBCs) and pediatric MTP protocols [^9d98a2a2].

- **Obstetric hemorrhage**: Apply obstetric-specific MTPs and consider uterotonic agents and surgical interventions early [^a9c2ae81].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Activate MTP**: Immediate activation for 3500 mL blood loss.

- **Initial transfusion**: 6–8 RBC units with 3–4 plasma units and 1 platelet unit in a 1:1:1 ratio.

- **Targets**: Hemoglobin 7–9 g/dL; correct coagulopathy with INR ≤ 1.5, platelets ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L, fibrinogen ≥ 1.5 g/L.

- **Reassess**: After each unit, adjust to clinical response and labs [^644c3f25].

---

For a 3500 mL blood loss, **start with 6–8 RBC units plus plasma and platelets in a 1:1:1 MTP**, then tailor to hemoglobin and coagulation targets with ongoing reassessment.

Study design: Pharmacokinetic study using a dose-escalation design. Trial treatment and dosage regimen: Following recruitment and prior to the caesarean delivery, the anaesthesiologist will insert a large-bore cannula into the participant's antecubital vein and draw blood for a complete blood count, which will be used in tandem with 24-hour post-delivery CBC to estimate blood loss, and serum creatinine to rule out elevated serum creatinine levels, a study exclusion criterion. Following birth of the infant, and upon clamping the umbilical cord, the anaesthesiologist will administer a single dose of IV TxA in 100ml of 0. 9% sodium chloride at 50mg/min according to the dose-escalation schedule described below.

All participants will receive oxytocin 20 international units IV in 1 litre of 0. 9% sodium chloride at the rate of 125 ml/hour with placental delivery, as part of active management of the third stage of labour. Endpoints Primary endpoints

### Transfusion guidelines: when to transfuse [^65dabbe3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Transfusion of blood and blood components has been a routine practice for more than half a century. The rationale supporting this practice is that replacement of blood loss should be beneficial for the patient. This assumption has constituted the underpinning of transfusion medicine for many decades. Only over the past 20 years, we have seen a more concerted effort to answer very basic questions regarding the value of transfusion therapy. An assessment of the value of transfusion based on well-designed and appropriately powered randomized, controlled trials is the first step in optimizing transfusion practices. Systematic reviews provide the second step by building the knowledge base necessary to assess the impact of transfusion practice on patient outcomes. The third step is the development of clinical practice guidelines, and this occurs when systematic reviews are interpreted by individuals with expertise in transfusion medicine. Such guidelines are typically supported by professional organizations and/or health authorities. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines can be challenging, especially in an area as heterogeneous as transfusion medicine. However, clinical practice guidelines are necessary for the practice of evidence-based medicine, which optimizes patient care and improves patient outcomes. This review focuses on clinical practice guidelines for transfusion of three blood components: RBCs, platelets and plasma. In addition, we provide the approach used to implement clinical practice guidelines at our own institution.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — red cell transfusion for acute stabilization is indicated in acute hemorrhage with thresholds including estimated blood loss > 30–40% of blood volume (1500–2000 ml) with symptoms of severe blood loss and estimated blood loss < 25–30% blood volume with no evidence of uncontrolled hemorrhage if hypovolemia recurs despite colloid/crystalloid resuscitation. In acute coronary syndrome, studies have reached differing conclusions and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not make any recommendations concerning transfusion; in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, 30-day adverse cardiovascular risk was higher with Hb below 11 g/dl (110 g/l) than with Hb ≥ 11 g/dl (≥ 110 g/l). In heart failure, limited data are available, correction of anemia is not an evidence-based therapy per cited guidelines, and general indications for red cell transfusion apply with careful attention to volume status.

Cardiac surgery — acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) efficacy and practice are summarized as follows: A 2017 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that patients who underwent ANH had an estimated 388 mL total blood loss vs 450 mL in controls with a mean difference of −0.64 and a lower transfusion risk (26% reduced risk; absolute risk reduction 14%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62–0.87), and ANH was associated with 0.79 fewer units of red blood cells (RBCs) used, based on 2439 patients from 29 RCTs. Although there are no published standardized protocols, ANH typically involves the removal of 1 to 3 units of the patient's blood before heparinization, yet an observational study showed it was performed in only 17% of patients before surgery. Care must be taken in patients who are preoperatively anemic, smaller patients with lower overall blood volumes, and unstable patients; it is also important to avoid profound anemia while on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and blood that has been removed can be reinfused at any time, including while on bypass; the benefits of ANH are directly linked to the amount of whole blood withdrawn.

### Blood conservation [^45fe7bb1]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Patient blood management requires multi-modality and multidisciplinary collaboration to identify patients who are at increased risk of requiring blood transfusion and therefore decrease exposure to blood products. Transfusion is associated with poor postoperative outcomes, and guidelines exist to minimize transfusion requirements. This review highlights recent studies and efforts to apply patient blood management across disease processes and health care systems.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^898d60fe]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Red blood cells

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is indicated when 30–40% of circulating blood volume is lost (approximately 1500 mL in a 70 kg male, female equivalents are unknown) and is immediately required if more than 40% of blood volume is lost (1500–2000 ml). Red blood cell transfusion aims to improve oxygen delivery and recent guidelines recommend a target haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 70–90 g.l −1. Haemoglobin concentration is routinely used to guide transfusion; however, limitations in its interpretation include the confounding effects of resuscitation measures such as intravenous fluids. It is important to realise that initial Hb measurements (before fluid resuscitation) may be normal and not accurately reflect blood loss. This is also because patients lose whole blood and compensatory mechanisms that shift interstitial fluid take time (up to 1 h). In such cases, physiologic transfusion triggers such as haemodynamic compromise, ECG changes and acidaemia may be useful. In particular, lactate and/or base deficit are sensitive tests to estimate and monitor the severity of bleeding.

Red blood cells should be transfused through a warming device to minimise the risk of the patient developing hypothermia and rapid infuser devices may be required in life‐threatening bleeding. For immediate transfusion, group O RBCs should be issued after samples have been obtained for group and crossmatch. Group O Rhesus negative and Kell negative should be prioritised for females of childbearing potential.

### Blood transfusion and the anaesthetist: management of massive haemorrhage [^97e0e6a8]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Blood components

This section advises on the appropriate use of blood components during massive haemorrhage (see Dealing with coagulation problems). This advice is required because red cell concentrates do not contain coagulation factors or platelets.

Patients with massive haemorrhage may require all blood components. Blood may be required not just at the time of resuscitation, but also during initial and repeat surgery. The benefits of timely and appropriate transfusion support in this situation outweigh the potential risks of transfusion and may reduce total exposure to blood components.

(Further information is available in Blood Transfusion and the Anaesthetist – Blood Component Therapy. AAGBI:).

Paediatric components

A comprehensive guideline for neonatal and paediatric transfusion together with a recent update statement is available at. Useful principles are: minimise and stop blood loss; minimise donor exposure; and use paediatric components where readily available (See Table 2).

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^cb671a8a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 13: maintain acute normovolemic haemodilution to help minimise bleeding and transfusion. (Grade of recommendation: 1C)

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a blood conservation technique consisting in removal of whole blood from a patient immediately after induction of anesthesia, with maintenance of normovolemia using fluid replacement with crystalloid and/or colloid. The amount of blood removed typically varies between 1 and 3 units (450 to 500 mL = one unit), although 3 to 4 units may be withdrawn safely in selected patients.

The main factors determining the efficacy of hemodilution are (I) Initial red cell mass where patients with greater red cell masses can provide more blood and this is mainly determined by the initial hematocrit and the blood volume.

(II) The magnitude of hemodilution. In fact, if lower hematocrits are achieved and tolerated by the patients after hemodilution, less red cell loss will be lost during surgical procedures. However, the more dilution is high the more profound are hemodynamic and physio-metabolic consequences. Red blood cells are important for hemostasis, and the risk of anemia has to be considered.

(III) Intraoperative blood loss.

(IV) Intraoperative management. Normovolemia should be effectively reestablished and managed after autologous blood removal. If this does not happen potential benefits in terms of reducing red cell losses may be vanished. In fact, in the absence of hemodilution, operative blood loss would occur as per preoperative hematocrit level.

The intraoperative lower hematocrit may request additional cardiovascular monitoring.

ANH can be used as the sole blood conservation technique, but for better results, it can be combined with other strategies to minimize or avoid transfusion.

Meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused and the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood for major cardiac, orthopaedic, thoracic, or liver surgery. Additional meta- analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH combined with intraoperative red blood cell recovery compared with intraoperative red blood cell recovery alone is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused.

The most common contraindications for ANH are severe sepsis; acute respiratory insufficiency; acute renal failure and hemorrhagic shock secondary to trauma. Patients suffering from severe coronary arterial disease should only be assigned after careful assessments of the risks and benefits of this procedure. Patients with surgical emergencies need to be well clinically evaluated before the indication of ANH.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^a48ea723]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB 2023 red blood cell transfusion — evidence base and general conclusions: For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL; for pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds, and for most adult patient populations, results provided moderate certainty evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes; it is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^b7525a61]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Pre‐operative:
All patients should have their haemoglobin concentration measured before listing for major elective surgery.
Where blood transfusion is anticipated, this and alternatives to transfusion should be discussed with the patient before surgery, and their consent should be documented according to local protocols.

Minimising peri‐operative blood loss:
3 Management of anticoagulants in the peri‐operative period should balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombosis.
4 The use of cell salvage and antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, is recommended in all patients who are bleeding, where blood loss > 500 mL (> 8 ml.kg ‐1 in children weighing > 10 kg) is possible and/or in patients are unable to receive donor blood.
5 Minimise iatrogenic anaemia by managing blood sampling appropriately.

Recognition and management of major bleeding:
Early recognition of obstetric bleeding is essential and should be measured accumulatively, leading to a clear escalation plan of intervention and involvement of the multidisciplinary team.
Every institution should have a major haemorrhage protocol which is regularly audited and reviewed. They should be concise but targeted, and allow for immediate release and protocolised administration of blood components.
In an emergency, surgical implementation of damage/proximal control strategies may be required until haemorrhage control is achieved.
Group O red blood cells (RBCs) for transfusion should be readily available in the clinical area, in case haemorrhage is life‐threatening. Group‐specific RBCs should be made available by the laboratory as soon as possible after receiving correctly labelled samples and being informed of the emergency requirement for blood, and according to local laboratory protocols.
During major haemorrhage due to trauma, preference should be given to transfusing RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Clear fluids (crystalloids) should be avoided unless there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components.
Blood components should be prescribed for children as a volume (ml.kg ‐1) rather than in units.
Patients who continue to bleed actively should be monitored by point‐of‐care and/or regular laboratory tests for coagulation, fibrinogen and platelet counts and/or function. A guide for transfusion should be: FFP if INR > 1.5; cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 1.5 g.l ‐1 (< 2.0 g.l ‐1 in obstetrics); and platelets if platelet count < 50 × 10⁹.l ‐1 (< 75 × 10⁹.l ‐1 in obstetrics).

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^e51ca77a]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Perioperative blood management — transfusion avoidance, massive transfusion, and ordering practices — states: A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used as a strategy to reduce blood loss for patients in whom transfusion is refused or is not possible. A massive (i.e., hemorrhagic) transfusion protocol may be used when available as a strategy to optimize the delivery of blood products to massively bleeding patients. Use a maximal surgical blood order schedule, when available and in accordance with your institutional policy, as a strategy to improve the efficiency of blood ordering practices.

### Blood transfusion and the anaesthetist: management of massive haemorrhage [^faf9bf08]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Management of haemostasis

The coagulopathy during massive haemorrhage is likely to evolve rapidly and regular clinical review and blood tests are required. It is important to anticipate and prevent haemostatic failure, but if haemostatic failure has occurred, standard regimens (e.g. FFP 15 ml.kg −1) can be predicted to be inadequate and larger volumes of FFP are likely to be required.

Prevention of coagulopathy

Emerging evidence supports the early use of FFP to prevent dilutional coagulopathy. If an experienced clinician anticipates a blood loss of one blood volume, FFP should be infused to prevent coagulopathy. While FFP 15 ml.kg −1 is appropriate for uncomplicated cases, increased volumes of FFP will be needed if a consumptive coagulopathy is likely or the patient has underlying liver disease.

A minimum target platelet count of 75 × 10 9.l −1 is appropriate in this clinical situation.

1:1:1 red cell:FFP:platelet regimens, as used by the military, are reserved for the most severely traumatised patient and are not routinely recommended.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^644c3f25]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Preprocedure preparation blood management protocols — Multimodal protocols or algorithms may be employed as strategies to reduce the usage of blood products, although no single algorithm or protocol can be recommended at this time. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration, with determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10g/dl justify or require red blood cell transfusion based on bleeding, volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and cardiopulmonary reserve; red blood cells should be administered unit‑by‑unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation. A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used for patients in whom transfusion is refused or not possible, and transfusion of red blood cells is rarely necessary when the hemoglobin concentration is more than 10g/dl.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^4040c295]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — updated recommendations from previous guidelines state that preoperative identification of high-risk patients should be performed, and all available preoperative and perioperative measures of blood conservation should be undertaken in this group as they account for the majority of blood products transfused. It is reasonable to discontinue low-intensity antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin) only in purely elective patients without acute coronary syndromes before operation with the expectation that blood transfusion will be reduced. Minimization of phlebotomy through a reduction in blood sampling volumes and frequencies is a reasonable means of blood conservation. The addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin therapy, if indicated, in the immediate postoperative care of coronary artery bypass grafting patients prior to ensuring surgical hemostasis may increase bleeding and the need for surgical reexploration, and is not recommended until the risk of bleeding has abated. Prophylactic use of plasma in cardiac operations in the absence of coagulopathy is not indicated, does not reduce blood loss, and exposes patients to unnecessary risks and complications of allogeneic blood component transfusion. Direct reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood from postoperative chest tube drainage is not recommended as a means of blood conservation and may cause harm. A comprehensive multidisciplinary blood conservation program led by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers should be part of any patient blood management program to limit utilization of blood resources and decrease the risk of bleeding.

### Transfusion and patient blood management… [^da7d03bd]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Blood transfusion is firmly established in contemporary medical practice. More than 16 million units are administered each year in the US, 1 cementing its status as one of the most commonly used medical procedures. Over the past century, pioneers in transfusion medicine have markedly improved the safety of allogeneic transfusion from donor recruitment and screening through collection, processing, testing, modification, storage, administration, and posttransfusion monitoring. These advances have established transfusion medicine as a mature branch of medicine and a cornerstone of modern surgical and medical care. Warner MA, Shore-Lesserson L, Burns C.

Indications for the transfusion of other blood products

Intraoperative massive bleeding and massive autologous red blood cell transfusion are often accompanied by the loss of platelets and coagulation factors. In this case, other blood products, such as platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate, should be appropriately infused. It is recommended that when the amount of bleeding exceeds 3500 mL, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be infused. If ordinary frozen plasma is infused, cryoprecipitate should be supplemented appropriately. If the amount of bleeding exceeds 2000 mL, platelet transfusion should be given. Patients were released from the operating room if their haemoglobin concentration was maintained at ≥ 80 g/L.

Anaesthesia and surgery

General or spinal anaesthesia was applied to all participants of the study by the responsible anaesthesiologist. The type, dose and management of anaesthetics, surgical procedure and ICU treatment were determined by the centre.

Blood transfusion management and data collection

In addition to intraoperative grouping, different blood transfusion methods were used after the operation. If the haemoglobin concentration was < 80 g/L, allogeneic blood was transfused until the patient's haemoglobin concentration was ≥ 80 g/L. Perioperative treatments using other blood transfusions were also conducted following the existing guidelines. Blood loss during the operation was calculated by the research team to minimize variation.

Baseline visits

Patients participating in the study met all inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria and signed the informed consent form. The patient's important underlying conditions, such as age, body weight, nulliparity, demographic data, weeks of gestation, comorbidities, caesarean section, placental position, intraoperative blood loss, eligibility criteria, and informed consent, were required to be included in the case report form (CRF). Haemoglobin, coagulation function and blood gas analyses were performed before surgery.

During surgery

During the surgery, vital signs, haemoglobin concentration, volume of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion, autologous blood recovery and transfusion, other blood product transfusion, fluid infusion, urine, type and dose of anaesthetics, and other drug dosages were monitored.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^0eceb7a5]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

American Burn Association guideline — erythropoietin (EPO) in adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA) summarizes limited evidence and no demonstrated transfusion benefit: We identified 3 low to moderate strength papers that met the criteria for this question. In Still et al.'s double-blind RCT, there was no significant difference in the volume of transfused blood over the first 30 days postburn, and no significant difference in calculated total blood loss between the two groups (EPO: 2539 ± 2787 mL vs Placebo: 1693 ± 1460 mL); no differences in mortality were reported between the study groups. Reports also noted that thromboembolic complications were not different between groups, and a small randomized control trial found no difference in the number of transfused RBC units between those administered rHEPO and those given placebo. In summary, it is still unclear what the effect of exogenous EPO administration is for thermally injured patients, and low to moderate strength evidence suggests no benefit to administering rHEPO with respect to the amount of blood transfused.

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) — Meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused and the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood for major cardiac, orthopedic, thoracic, or liver surgery (Category A1‑B evidence). Additional meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH combined with intraoperative red blood cell recovery compared with intraoperative red blood cell recovery alone is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused (Category A1‑B evidence) and is equivocal regarding the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood (Category A1‑E evidence). Consider ANH to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion in patients at high risk for excessive bleeding (e.g., major cardiac, orthopedic, thoracic, or liver surgery), if possible, noting that ANH may not be possible due to pre‑existing patient factors such as small blood volume, low hemoglobin, or presence of ischemic disease.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents — evidence and consensus indicate that one nonrandomized comparative observational study is equivocal regarding discontinuing warfarin and replacing it with low-molecular-weight heparin on transfusion requirements (Category B1-E evidence). Observational studies report blood loss volumes ranging from 265 to 756 mL and transfusion requirements ranging from a mean of 0.08 to 0.5 units when clopidogrel is discontinued preoperatively (Category B3 evidence). The literature is insufficient to evaluate discontinuing aspirin before surgery, with two RCTs versus placebo reporting equivocal findings (P > 0.01) for perioperative blood loss, transfusion, or postoperative adverse events (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state both consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding discontinuing anticoagulation therapy for elective surgery in consultation with a specialist, if clinically possible discontinuing nonsurgical antiplatelet agents sufficiently in advance except in patients with prior percutaneous coronary interventions, and considering thrombosis versus increased bleeding risk when altering anticoagulation status.

### Massive transfusion of blood in the surgical patient [^f3c73aee]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Hemorrhage remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in both civilian and military trauma. Restoration of effective end-organ perfusion by stopping hemorrhage and restoring intravascular volume in such a way as to minimize acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, almost always requires the use of blood and/or blood-component therapy. The best method to manage life-threatening hemorrhage is to avoid the circumstance that prompted it or to mitigate blood loss early in the injury cycle; otherwise, blood replacement must suffice. This article reviews current understanding of massive transfusion, along with its attendant unintended consequences, in the management of patients with profound hemorrhage.

### Why does a point of care guided transfusion algorithm not improve blood loss and transfusion practice in patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery? A prospective randomized controlled pilot study [^d5efdcf9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adult cardiac surgery is often complicated by elevated blood losses that account for elevated transfusion requirements. Perioperative bleeding and transfusion of blood products are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnostic and goal-directed therapies aim at the reduction of bleeding and need for allogeneic transfusions.

Methods

Single-centre, prospective, randomized trial assessing blood loss and transfusion requirements of 26 adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery at high risk for perioperative bleeding. Primary endpoint was blood loss at 24 h postoperatively. Random assignment to intra- and postoperative haemostatic management following either an algorithm based on conventional coagulation assays (conventional group: platelet count, aPTT, PT, fibrinogen) or based on point-of-care (PoC-group) monitoring, i.e. activated rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) combined with multiple aggregometry (Multiplate®). Differences between groups were analysed using nonparametric tests for independent samples.

Results

The study was terminated after interim analysis (n = 26). Chest tube drainage volume was 360 mL (IQR 229–599 ml) in the conventional group, and 380 mL (IQR 310–590 ml) in the PoC-group (p = 0.767) after 24 h. Basic patient characteristics, results of PoC coagulation assays, and transfusion requirements of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma did not differ between groups. Coagulation results were comparable. Platelets were transfused in the PoC group only.

Conclusion

Blood loss via chest tube drainage and transfusion amounts were not different comparing PoC- and central lab-driven transfusion algorithms in subjects that underwent high-risk cardiac surgery. Routine PoC coagulation diagnostics do not seem to be beneficial when actual blood loss is low. High risk procedures might not suffice as a sole risk factor for increased blood loss.

### Intraoperative transfusion practices in Europe [^1f129440]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies suggest that often more than 1 unit of pRBC are transfused once a decision to administer blood has been made, in part because of blood allocation strategies. In our study more than 40% of patients had two pRBC units transfused; as less than 25% of patients received three or more units of pRBC it can be speculated that because two pRBC units is often ordered initially, they were given as package. To overcome this problem Australia initiated a campaign, known as the 'one unit policy' where Hb levels are measured after each pRBC administered to determine the necessity for further transfusion. The results of the present study suggest that a similar campaign should be implemented across Europe.

In our study the mean estimated blood loss was 1392 (2040) ml, reflecting a high variability in blood loss, which warrants cautious interpretation of our data. Unlike in trauma, where massive transfusion protocols have been developed and shown to improve outcome, protocols for the administration of blood products in the actively bleeding patient in the operating room are missing. Modern guidelines promote use of a point of care monitoring and coagulation factor-based bleeding management. This was not the case in the present study. Almost half of the patients received FFP, platelet concentrates or coagulation factor concentrates. FFP, despite several adverse effects and poor efficacyis still the most commonly used agent during intraoperative bleeding, whereas in five percent and two percent of patients fibrinogen concentrate and PCC were used, respectively. Parameters of routine coagulation tests did not reveal coagulopathy either preoperatively and at the end of surgery. However, as immediate pre-transfusion coagulation tests were not documented for participating patients, conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the administration of FFP, platelets or coagulation factors cannot be made.

Our study has some limitations. We recorded selected data and might therefore miss some of the factors that might influence transfusion habits. We did not collect data on those not transfused intraoperatively, not in those transfused before or after surgery. We did not find clinically relevant differences between countries. As centres participating and procedures included varied essentially from country to country, differences in transfusion habits might be more centre-specific than country-specific.

### Blood transfusion and the anaesthetist: management of massive haemorrhage [^f4056d5a]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are an increasing number of severely injured patients who present to hospital each year. Trauma is the leading cause of death in all ages from 1 to 44 years. Haemorrhagic shock accounts for 80% of deaths in the operating theatre and up to 50% of deaths in the first 24 h after injury. Only 16% of major emergency departments in the UK use a massive haemorrhage guideline.

The management of massive haemorrhage is usually only one component of the management of a critically unwell patient. These guidelines are intended to supplement current resuscitation guidelines and are specifically directed at improving management of massive haemorrhage. The guidance is intended to provide a better understanding of the priorities in specific situations. Effective teamwork and communication are an essential part of this process.

Definitions of massive haemorrhage vary and have limited value. The Working Party suggests that the nature of the injury will usually alert the anaesthetist to the probability of massive haemorrhage and can be arbitrarily considered as a situation where 1–1.5 blood volumes may need to be infused either acutely or within a 24-h period.

The formulation of guidance in the style of previous AAGBI guidelines has been difficult in such a rapidly changing area. The grade of evidence has not been mentioned within the text, but the editing of the final draft and Working Party membership have been cross-checked with other recently published documents. The Working Party believes that at the current time, its advice is consistent with recently published European guidelines and the availability of current evidence.

It is envisaged that the website version of this document will be updated at least annually and earlier if an addendum or correction is deemed urgent.

### Estimation of intraoperative blood loss in hepatopancreatobiliary surgery: a Delphi consensus process of the European-African hepato-pancreato-biliary association (E-AHPBA) [^4acbdbee]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The most critical aspect of blood loss is represented by its potential association with perioperative outcomes and survival. It has been demonstrated, however, that most of the existing literature exploring this relationship is biased by inconsistent and inaccurate blood loss estimation. For this reason, the present consensus expressed only general concern regarding the association between blood loss and postoperative complications after pancreatic and major and minor liver surgery, leaving it to future studies designed in compliance with a standardized method to further explore the relationship of blood loss with specific complications and long-term outcomes. Finally, the consensus proposed blood loss grading, mixing quantitative categories with qualitative factors (for example, requiring transfusions, or clinically threatening to the patient). Despite being subordinate to the treating clinician's judgement, this represents an attempt to increase accuracy with regard to clinical impact when dealing with severe bleeding, rather than pursuing cut-off measures exclusively. Of note, the presence of qualitative factors upscaling a patient to a higher blood loss grade does not cancel the need for quantitative reporting, allowing for future studies comparing outcomes and accounting for qualitative, quantitative, and patient factors (for example, a B-grade patient with blood loss 400 mL and coronary artery disease requiring transfusion may differ from a patient with blood loss 1000 mL not requiring transfusion).

All the statements included in this consensus reached the agreement threshold after the first round. Besides a high level of agreement between experts, this may also reflect a high degree of homogeneity among them. Indeed, an important limitation of the present consensus is that the project uniquely included surgeons who were members of the same society. Despite the exquisite surgical pertinence of many of the included statements, blood loss reporting and estimation is also common practice among anaesthetists. Surgeons and anaesthetists should share decision-making in response to significant bleeding.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^c4e5c4cc]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The administration of blood components and their alternatives can be lifesaving. Anaemia, bleeding and transfusion are all associated with poor peri-operative outcomes. Considerable changes in the approaches to optimal use of blood components and their alternatives, driven by the findings of large randomised controlled trials and improved haemovigilance, have become apparent over the past decade. The aim of these updated guidelines is to provide an evidence-based set of recommendations so that anaesthetists and peri-operative physicians might provide high-quality care.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary, multi-society working party conducted targeted literature reviews, followed by a three-round Delphi process to produce these guidelines.

Results

We agreed on 12 key recommendations. Overall, these highlight the importance of organisational factors for safe transfusion and timely provision of blood components; the need for protocols that are targeted to different clinical contexts of major bleeding; and strategies to avoid the need for transfusion, minimise bleeding and manage anticoagulant therapy.

Conclusions

All anaesthetists involved in the care of patients at risk of major bleeding and peri-operative transfusion should be aware of the treatment options and approaches that are available to them. These contemporary guidelines aim to provide recommendations across a range of clinical situations.

### Transfusion of blood products in trauma: an update [^03486237]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Blood transfusion in the management of severely injured patients can be lifesaving. These patients are susceptible to developing early coagulopathy, thus perpetuating bleeding.

Objectives

This article presents recent advances in both the civilian and military clinical arena to improve the treatment of trauma patients with severe hemorrhage, the use of agents to support coagulation, perspectives on restrictive transfusion strategies, and transfusion-related risks.

Discussion

Massive blood transfusion is an adjunct to surgical care. The volume of blood products transfused and the ratio of blood components have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. The adverse clinical effects of transfusion and the limited supply of blood products have resulted in modern resuscitation protocols to limit the volume of blood transfused.

Conclusion

A restrictive blood transfusion strategy and the use of hemostatic agents may decrease morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, but insufficient data are available for their use in trauma patients. Massive transfusion should reflect an equal ratio of packed red cells and plasma to limit coagulopathy. Prospective randomized trials are needed to standardize an effective protocol.

### Bone marrow harvest: a white paper of best practices by the NMDP marrow alliance [^dc590a74]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood Consent

Consent for peri-BMH blood component support should be discussed with the donor when obtaining informed consent prior to the BMH. The associated procedural blood loss can be roughly calculated to determine the likely post-BMH hematocrit (Hct) concentration (see example below). The anticipated volume of BM to be collected should be determined and discussed with the donor during the pre-BMH review. The volume of BM to be collected is usually in the range of 10 to 15 mL/kg of recipient weight; however, larger-volume BMH may be required for some protocols. Alternatively, a TNC dose, often corrected for the donor's WBC count, may serve as a goal for BMH. When a TNC dose is established as the goal for BMH, the anticipated BM volume can be estimated based on either the CC's expected average BM TNC count or the NMDP predicted median TNC count of 0.183 × 10⁸/mL. The NMDP and many CCs limit the maximum volume collected to 20 mL/kg donor weight, although some centers will collect to a maximum of 1500 mL.

The associated blood loss can be roughly calculated to determine the likely post-BMH Hct level; a sample calculation is shown in Table 3. Assume that the Hct of the BM product will be roughly 30% (ie, 300 mL RBC volume loss per liter of BM harvested), and that the patient may lose a unit of blood into the soft tissues for each liter of BM harvested. The threshold at which the donor likely would require a blood transfusion should be discussed. At one author's center, for example, the threshold for post-BMH transfusion in healthy adult BM donors is a Hct ≤ 21%. Irradiated, allogeneic blood transfusions should be available in the event of significant blood loss. The donor should be made aware of potential risks of receiving allogeneic blood, including infection, and informed of the laboratory and/or clinical parameters that may indicate the need for transfusion.

American Society of Anesthesiologists perioperative blood management — definitions and scope include that perioperative blood management refers to perioperative blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies. Perioperative blood transfusion addresses the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative administration of blood and blood components (e.g., allogeneic or autologous blood, red blood cells, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and plasma products, fresh-frozen plasma [FFP], PF24, or Thawed Plasma). Adjuvant therapies refer to drugs and techniques to reduce or prevent blood loss and the need for transfusion of allogenic blood. The purposes of these updated Guidelines are to improve the perioperative management of blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies.

### Society for the Advancement of Blood Management administrative and clinical standards for patient blood management programs. 4th edition (pediatric version) [^1b8c3de9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Patient Blood Management is the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to maintain hemoglobin concentration, optimize hemostasis, and minimize blood loss to improve patient outcomes. Conceptually similar to a "bundle" strategy, it is designed to improve clinical care using comprehensive evidence-based treatment strategies to manage patients with potential or ongoing critical bleeding, bleeding diathesis, critical anemia, and/ or a coagulopathy. Patient Blood Management includes multimodal strategies to screen, diagnose and properly treat anemia, coagulopathies and minimize bleeding, using goal-directed therapy and leverages a patient's physiologic ability to adapt to anemia while definitive treatment is undertaken. Allogeneic blood component transfusion is one traditional therapeutic modality out of many for managing blood loss and anemia and, while it may be the best choice in certain situations, other effective and more appropriate options are available and should be used in conjunction or alone. Therefore, comprehensive Patient Blood Management is the new standard of care to prevent and manage anemia and optimize hemostasis and has been recommended by the World Health Organization, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the European Society of Anaesthesiology and the Australian National Blood Authority. While there is a plethora of expert consensus and good practice guidelines published for blood component transfusion from multiple professional organizations and societies, there remains a need for more comprehensive and broader standards of patient medical management to proactively reduce the risk of exposure to allogeneic transfusions. In 2010, the Society for Advancement of Blood Management published the first comprehensive standards to address the administrative and clinical components of an effective, patient-centered Patient Blood Management program. Recognizing the need to reduce inappropriate transfusions, some professional organizations have placed their emphasis on transfusion guidelines. In contrast, the focus of the Society for Advancement of Blood Management Standard is on the centrality of the patient and the full spectrum of therapeutic strategies needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients at risk for blood loss or anemia, thereby reducing avoidable transfusions as well. The Standards are meant not to replace, but to complement transfusion guidelines by more completely addressing the need for a multi-modal clinical approach with the goal to improve patient outcomes. Compared to adult programs, Pediatric Patient Blood Management programs are currently not commonly accepted as standard of care for pediatric patients. This is partly due to the fact that, until recently, there was a paucity of robust evidence-based literature and expert consensus guidelines on pediatric PBM. Managing pediatric bleeding and blood product transfusion presents a unique set of challenges. The main goal of transfusion is to correct or avoid imminent inadequate oxygen carrying capacity caused by inadequate red blood cell mass. Determining when, what, and how much to transfuse can be difficult. Neonates, infants, children, and adolescents each have specific considerations based on age, weight, physiology, and pharmacology. In this edition of Pediatric Anaesthesia we provide, in abbreviated format, the 4th edition of the Administrative and Clinical Standards for Patient Blood Management; Pediatric Version, first published in 2010 with the addition of a new Pediatric section in 2016. These Standards provide guidance for implementing a comprehensive Pediatric Patient Blood Management program at both pediatric and adult medical institutions. While every hospital may not be equipped to have a dedicated Pediatric Patient Blood Management program, this document highlights important universal clinical strategies that can be implemented to optimize pediatric bleeding management and minimize allogeneic blood product exposure through the use of multi-modal therapeutic strategies that have their central emphasis on the patient rather than the transfusion. Important strategies include: treatment of preoperative anemia, standardized transfusion algorithms, the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds, goal-directed therapy based on point of care and viscoelastic testing, antifibrinolytics, and avoidance of hemodilution and hypothermia as supported by evidence.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^9517d1c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Most clinical practice guidelines recommend restrictive red cell transfusion practices with the goal of minimising exposure to allogeneic blood (from an unrelated donor). The purpose of this review is to compare clinical outcomes in patients randomised to restrictive versus liberal transfusion thresholds (triggers).

Objectives

To examine the evidence on the effect of transfusion thresholds, on the use of allogeneic and/or autologous blood, and the evidence for any effect on clinical outcomes.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified by: computer searches of OVID Medline (1966 to December 2000), Current Contents (1993 to Week 48 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000 Issue 4). References in identified trials and review articles were checked and authors contacted to identify any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials in which patients were randomised to an intervention group or to a control group. Trials were included where the intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion "trigger", described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a RBC transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed using criteria proposed by Schulz et al. (1995). Relative risks of requiring allogeneic blood transfusion, transfused blood volumes and other clinical outcomes were pooled across trials using a random effects model.

Main Results

Ten trials were identified that reported outcomes for a total of 1780 patients. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion by a relative 42% (RR = 0.58: 95%CI = 0.47,0.71). This equates to an average absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 40% (95%CI = 24% to 56%). The volume of RBCs transfused was reduced on average by 0.93 units (95%CI = 0.36,1.5 units). However, heterogeneity between these trials was statistically significant (p < 0.00001) for these outcomes. Mortality, rates of cardiac events, morbidity, and length of hospital stay were unaffected. Trials were of poor methodological quality.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The limited published evidence supports the use of restrictive transfusion triggers in patients who are free of serious cardiac disease. However, most of the data on clinical outcomes were generated by a single trial. The effects of conservative transfusion triggers on functional status, morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with cardiac disease, need to be tested in further large clinical trials. In countries with inadequate screening of donor blood the data may constitute a stronger basis for avoiding transfusion with allogeneic red cells.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^31fc121d]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when?

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality 2, 98, 99, 100. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to the manufacturer and health systems 101. Moreover, red cell transfusion risks infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, cardiac and pulmonary complications 2, 98. Despite successful implementation of PBM programmes, red cell transfusion is still widely used as a default treatment for the majority of patients with acute postoperative anaemia 102.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, namely haemoglobin level < 100 g.l −1 (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards haemoglobin 70–80 g.l −1, according to data derived from a number of RCTs evaluating the effect on patient outcomes of restrictive vs. more liberal red cell transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. When subjected to pooled analysis in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Supporting Information online, Appendix S2) 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, data from these RCTs show that, in terms of morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy 101, 109.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. One of the most recently published guidelines on red cell transfusion thresholds recommends a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haemoglobin < 70 g.l −1) for hospitalised adult patients who are haemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients 49. However, a transfusion threshold of at least 80 g.l −1 is suggested for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, cardiac or oncological surgery, and those with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease 12, 49, 110, 111. Nevertheless, transfusion of red cells for higher haemoglobin levels should be evaluated case by case, considering acute ongoing blood loss, comorbidities and signs of organ ischaemia or symptoms indicative of hypoxia. In any case, published guidelines agree that red cell transfusion is not beneficial when haemoglobin is > 100 g.l −1 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49, 112. Confounding factors on haemoglobin levels have to be considered, as discussed above.

### Part II: blood transfusion and donor exposure in the surgical management of trigonocephaly patients: a protocol from alder hey craniofacial unit [^7358f1ec]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Trigonocephaly is a craniofacial malformation caused by premature fusion of the metopic suture. Surgical correction frequently results in the need for blood transfusion. Transfusion complications include transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), immune-mediated reactions, and volume overload. Donor exposure (DE) describes the number of blood products from unique donors with increasing DE equating to an increased risk of TTI. We evaluate data on 204 trigonocephaly patients covering 20 years of practice with respect to blood transfusions and DE. This represents the largest series from a single unit to date. A protocol based on our experiences has been devised that summarizes the key interventions we recommend to minimize blood transfusions and DE in craniofacial surgery. Patients operated on between 2000 and 2020 were included. DE and a range of values were calculated including estimated red cell loss (ERCL) and estimated red cell volume transfused (ERCVT). Groups were established by relevant interventions and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Mean DE fell from 1.46 at baseline to 0.85 (P < 0.05). Median allogenic transfusion volume fell from 350 mL at baseline to 250 mL (P < 0.05). Median ERCL fell from 15.05 mL/kg at baseline to 12.39 mL/kg and median ERCVT fell from 20.85 to 15.98 mL/kg. Changes in ERCL and ERCVT did not reach statistical significance. DE can be minimized with the introduction of key interventions such as a restrictive transfusion policy, preoperative iron, cell saver, tranexamic acid, and use of a matchstick burr for osteotomies.

### Practice bulletin no. 183: postpartum hemorrhage [^a9c2ae81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transfusion therapy timing in postpartum hemorrhage — indications and precautions — notes that initiation of transfusion therapy generally is based on estimated blood deficit and ongoing blood loss, but in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage, acute changes in hemoglobin or hematocrit will not accurately reflect blood loss and maternal vital signs typically do not change drastically until significant blood loss has occurred. In women with ongoing bleeding that equates to the blood loss of 1,500 mL or more or in women with abnormal vital signs (tachycardia and hypotension), immediate preparation for transfusion should be made. Inadequate early resuscitation and hypoperfusion may lead to lactic acidosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome with accompanying multiorgan dysfunction, and coagulopathy, and because such a large blood loss includes depletion of coagulation factors, the patients will require platelets and coagulation factors in addition to packed red blood cells.

### Validation of a new method to automatically select cases with intraoperative red blood cell transfusion for audit [^9c160dea]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitals review allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for appropriateness. Audit criteria have been published that apply to 5 common procedures. We expanded on this work to study the management decision of selecting which cases involving transfusion of at least 1 RBC unit to audit (review) among all surgical procedures, including those previously studied.

Methods

This retrospective, observational study included 400,000 cases among 1891 different procedures over an 11-year period. There were 12,616 cases with RBC transfusion. We studied the proportions of cases that would be audited based on criteria of nadir hemoglobin (Hb) greater than the hospital's selected transfusion threshold, or absent Hb or missing estimated blood loss (EBL) among procedures with median EBL < 500 mL. This threshold EBL was selected because it is approximately the volume removed during the donation of a single unit of whole blood at a blood bank. Missing EBL is important to the audit decision for cases in which the procedures' median EBL is < 500 mL because, without an indication of the extent of bleeding, there are insufficient data to assume that there was sufficient blood loss to justify the transfusion.

Results

Most cases (> 50%) that would be audited and most cases (> 50%) with transfusion were among procedures with median EBL < 500 mL (P < .0001). Among cases with transfusion and nadir Hb > 9 g/dL, the procedure's median EBL was < 500 mL for 3.0 times more cases than for procedures having a median EBL ≥ 500 mL. A greater percentage of cases would be recommended for audit based on missing values for Hb and/or EBL than based on exceeding the Hb threshold among cases of procedures with median EBL ≥ 500 mL (P < .0001). There were 3.7 times as many cases with transfusion that had missing values for Hb and/or EBL than had a nadir Hb > 9 g/dL and median EBL for the procedure ≥ 500 mL.

Conclusions

An automated process to select cases for audit of intraoperative transfusion of RBC needs to consider the median EBL of the procedure, whether the nadir Hb is below the hospital's Hb transfusion threshold for surgical cases, and the absence of either a Hb or entry of the EBL for the case. This conclusion applies to all surgical cases and procedures.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^d1953f58]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

What is the optimal:transfusion ratio?

In the absence of any coagulation tests being available, empiric ratio‐based resuscitation is now advocated by many major haemorrhage protocols. A low ratio is pragmatically defined as 2 units of RBC for every 1 unit of FFP (2:1). Observational studies in military settings demonstrated improved survival in patients who received higher ratios, but survivor bias is a major confounder in these studies. This is a time‐dependent bias that occurs where patients who live longer are more likely to receive a treatment than patients who die early.

In 2015, Holco et al. carried out a landmark trial which allocated randomly 680 severely injured patients who arrived at trauma centres in North America to early administration of plasma, platelets and RBCs in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio. The authors found no difference in overall survival (the primary outcome). Death due to exsanguination was lower in the 1:1:1 (high ratio) group. More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved anatomic haemostasis in the operating theatre; defined as an objective assessment by the surgeon indicating that bleeding in the surgical field was controlled and no further haemostatic interventions were necessary. However, for all 23 prespecified complications (including sepsis, transfusion‐related complication, acute respiratory distress syndrome and venous thromboembolism), no differences were seen between these two groups at 30 days post‐randomisation.

Clinicians have raised concerns regarding the implementation of these high ratios in yet‐to‐be‐studied, non‐trauma patient populations where the underlying pathophysiology may be different. For example, in obstetrics, the most common causes of haemorrhage are uterine atony and genital tract trauma. These are not associated with significant coagulopathy, and fibrinogen levels are relatively well maintained even with large blood losses. One observational study found no difference in 30‐day survival in patients without traumatic injury who required a massive transfusion and received a high RBC:FFP ratio compared with those who received a low ratio. Another meta‐analysis, mainly based on observational studies, found that the highest survival benefit was at a RBC:FFP ratio of 1.5:1 in trauma and non‐trauma settings. Taken together, these data highlight the need for further studies to refine major haemorrhage protocols in non‐trauma populations.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^c2d027ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^db806ac6]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Massive transfusion protocols — implementation and agreement — are implemented in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage after trauma and/or during a procedure and are intended to minimize the adverse effects of hypovolemia and dilutional coagulopathy; these protocols require availability of large amounts of allogeneic blood and blood products and often prescribe fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets in a higher (e.g., 1:1) ratio with the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs); an observational study indicates the ratio of FFP to RBCs is higher after implementation; the consultants and ASA members both strongly agree regarding use of a massive transfusion protocol when available, as a strategy to optimize the delivery of blood products to massively bleeding patients.

### Perioperative blood transfusion and blood conservation in cardiac surgery: the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists clinical practice guideline [^41ad2559]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A minority of patients having cardiac procedures (15% to 20%) consume more than 80% of the blood products transfused at operation. Blood must be viewed as a scarce resource that carries risks and benefits. A careful review of available evidence can provide guidelines to allocate this valuable resource and improve patient outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed all available published evidence related to blood conservation during cardiac operations, including randomized controlled trials, published observational information, and case reports. Conventional methods identified the level of evidence available for each of the blood conservation interventions. After considering the level of evidence, recommendations were made regarding each intervention using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology classification scheme.

Results

Review of published reports identified a high-risk profile associated with increased postoperative blood transfusion. Six variables stand out as important indicators of risk: (1) advanced age, (2) low preoperative red blood cell volume (preoperative anemia or small body size), (3) preoperative antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs, (4) reoperative or complex procedures, (5) emergency operations, and (6) noncardiac patient comorbidities. Careful review revealed preoperative and perioperative interventions that are likely to reduce bleeding and postoperative blood transfusion. Preoperative interventions that are likely to reduce blood transfusion include identification of high-risk patients who should receive all available preoperative and perioperative blood conservation interventions and limitation of antithrombotic drugs. Perioperative blood conservation interventions include use of antifibrinolytic drugs, selective use of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery, routine use of a cell-saving device, and implementation of appropriate transfusion indications. An important intervention is application of a multimodality blood conservation program that is institution based, accepted by all health care providers, and that involves well thought out transfusion algorithms to guide transfusion decisions.

Conclusions

Based on available evidence, institution-specific protocols should screen for high-risk patients, as blood conservation interventions are likely to be most productive for this high-risk subset. Available evidence-based blood conservation techniques include (1) drugs that increase preoperative blood volume (eg, erythropoietin) or decrease postoperative bleeding (eg, antifibrinolytics), (2) devices that conserve blood (eg, intraoperative blood salvage and blood sparing interventions), (3) interventions that protect the patient's own blood from the stress of operation (eg, autologous predonation and normovolemic hemodilution), (4) consensus, institution-specific blood transfusion algorithms supplemented with point-of-care testing, and most importantly, (5) a multimodality approach to blood conservation combining all of the above.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^e84823ae]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Quality and performance measures — The hemoglobin concentration before and after any RBC transfusion administered outside of the OR is measured. Ideally, where adequate resources are available, dynamic VET is considered prior to administration of FFP, PLTs, cryoprecipitate, or factor VII concentrate during the perioperative period. We recognize that this quality measure may not be suitable for all burn centers or under austere conditions. Strategies to minimize volume and frequency of blood draws for diagnostic tests are used to limit anemia from repetitive phlebotomy. While we did not directly form a PICO question about this strategy to lessen blood loss and hence, RBC transfusion, we believe that an overarching theme in this CPG is the use of strategies to limit blood loss and blood product transfusion. A transfusion protocol with standard indications is identified and followed outside of the OR for transfusing RBC to burn patients who are not hemodynamically unstable from acute bleeding. If the transfusion protocol is not followed, a rationale for the deviation should be documented.

- the number of cases of post partum hemorrhage According to the World Health Organization, postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly one quarter of all maternal deaths globally.

An estimated blood loss in excess of 500 mL following a vaginal birth or a loss of greater than 1, 000 mL following cesarean birth often have been used for the definition of postpartum hemorrhage, but the average volume of blood lost at delivery can approach these amounts when actually measured rather than estimated. Estimates of blood loss at delivery are notoriously inaccurate, with under-estimation more common than over-estimation. Traditionally, the surgeon performing the cesarean section would estimate the blood loss by visually assessing the blood collected in the surgical drape and counting the number of lap sponges used thru out the procedure. Current detection and management of hemorrhage is heavily based on clinical judgment, which often leads to delay in recognition and intervention. Often, interventions such as fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion are not initiated until significant hemorrhage has already taken place.

The traditional method for estimating blood loss is based on the surgeon and surgical staff's subjective assessment that is severely limited by human error and the presence of large volumes of amniotic fluid, irrigation, or both. Another limitation is that blood loss is frequently estimated at the end of the procedure. Early detection and treatment of this potentially life threatening obstetric complication is of utmost importance in the field of obstetrics. Simulations and didactic training have been shown to improve visual estimations, but there are still poor associations between experience level and accuracy, and a significant decay in blood loss estimation skills over time. The Triton system is a novel mobile monitoring platform that combines mobile computing with Gauss Feature Extraction Technology to directly assess Hb mass absorbed by surgical sponges from an image.

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^6ceaea25]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion are uncertain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

Evidence Review

Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

Findings

It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: < 10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.

### The visually estimated blood volume in scaled canisters based on a simulation study [^045f190f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we were able to show that the visual measurement of blood loss only moderately correlated with the actual blood loss collected in suction canisters. Both, the univariate analysis and the Bland Altman analysis revealed relevant deviations which are of great clinical relevance.

On the median, the estimated blood loss was greater than the median RBL. Especially for small volumes, the overestimation was higher than for larger volumes. The presented deviations added up to 1233 mL per scenario and were therefore severe and of highest clinical relevance. Why is knowledge about blood loss relevant? Intraoperative volume and transfusion management is of great importance for patient safety. Avoiding blood loss and thus preventing transfusions is a core element of Patient Blood Management. The indication for a transfusion should be set by individual transfusion triggers. Here, the consideration of blood loss is a crucial factor.

We therefore strongly discourage the use of visual blood loss estimates. Currently, however, V-EBL is the most common method for measuring intraoperative blood loss.

The accuracy of measurement using a scaled canister depends on the degree of dilution. In our study we established Hb values between 4.9 and 6.2 g/dl by dilution, comparable to the cases of massive bleeding with little dilution. Internal measurements in the operating room have shown a high variance of Hb values in suction canisters. Under use of high amount of irrigation fluid, e.g. in orthopedics, Hb values as low as 0.5–1.0 g/dl were observed.

What implications do our results have? The recording of blood losses is complex. Clinical decisions are rarely made based on only one piece of information. In particular, volume and hemotherapy should be based on multiple factors and primarily on physiologic transfusion triggers. Especially in prolonged operations with continuous blood loss, correct recording of blood loss is an essential component, since Hb, etc. will only change with adequate volume replacement. Losses in canisters, drapes, operating theatre areas and even the floor must be calculated. However, the largest amount of blood usually gets into the suction canister, so that the canisters have a more important role to play. This has not yet been sufficiently taken into account in the research.

### Massive transfusion and severe blood shortages: establishing and implementing predictors of futility [^73db7023]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Massive transfusion protocols were developed to deliver blood for life-threatening haemorrhage; however, there are no guidelines to advise when massive transfusion protocols may be considered futile. Early recognition of clinical futility remains a challenge as studies have not identified variables that can accurately determine early mortality. As blood is a scarce resource, efforts to distribute it equitably to all patients who would benefit are of paramount importance. In this editorial we discuss recent data and various aspects important in developing and implementing tools that assist with determining futility in massive transfusion.

### Emergency department blood transfusion: the first two units are free [^d0518bd6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Studies on blood product transfusions after trauma recommend targeting specific ratios to reduce mortality. Although crystalloid volumes as little as 1.5 L predict increased mortality after trauma, little data is available regarding the threshold of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion volume that predicts increased mortality.

Materials and Methods

Data from a level I trauma center between January 2000 and December 2008 were reviewed. Trauma patients who received at least 100 mL RBC in the emergency department (ED) were included. Each unit of RBC was defined as 300 mL. Demographics, RBC transfusion volume, and mortality were analyzed in the nonelderly (< 70 y) and elderly (≥ 70 y). Multivariate logistic regression was performed at various volume cutoffs to determine whether there was a threshold transfusion volume that independently predicted mortality.

Results

A total of 560 patients received ≥ 100 mL RBC in the ED. Overall mortality was 24.3%, with 22.5% (104 deaths) in the nonelderly and 32.7% (32 deaths) in the elderly. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that RBC transfusion of ≥ 900 mL was associated with increased mortality in both the nonelderly (adjusted odds ratio 2.06, P = 0.008) and elderly (adjusted odds ratio 5.08, P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Although transfusion of greater than 2 units in the ED was an independent predictor of mortality, transfusion of 2 units or less was not. Interestingly, unlike crystalloid volume, stepwise increases in blood volume were not associated with stepwise increases in mortality. The underlying etiology for mortality discrepancies, such as transfusion ratios, hypothermia, or immunosuppression, needs to be better delineated.

### Massive transfusion protocol in adult trauma population [^c8a0bf62]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute blood loss in trauma requires quick identification and action to restore circulating volume and save the patient. Massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have become standard at Trauma Centers, in order to rapidly deliver blood products to bleeding patients. This literature review presents current standards of transfusion ratios, as well as insights into adjuncts during massive transfusions.

Methods

PubMED was searched for articles from 2005 to 2020 on MTPs, the article were assessed for single vs. multi-institutional, mechanism of injury, type of MTP, timing in which blood products should be administered, timing of delivery of blood products to trauma bay, pre-hospital treatment and adjuncts, and outcomes.

Results

Eleven studies addressed transfusion ratios. Seven studies looked at timing of blood products. Nine studies addressed MTP pre-hospital treatment and adjuncts. Prior to 2015, studies supported the benefits of a balanced transfusion ratio, which was then confirmed by the PROPPR randomized controlled trial. The shorter the time to blood product delivery the better the outcomes. New advances in technology have allowed us to measure different patterns of coagulation, allowing more individualized approaches to the bleeding patient.

Conclusion

Current massive transfusion protocols should utilize between 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 ratios of the 3 main products; plasma, platelets, and red blood cells. Massive transfusion protocols are effective in decreasing mortality. Better resuscitation efforts were seen when blood products were readily available in the trauma bay when the patient arrived and the faster the replacement of blood, the better the outcomes.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^9d98a2a2]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Paediatrics

Evidence to guide the use of blood components in children undergoing surgery is limited, and often extrapolated from adult practice. Serious Hazards of Transfusion has identified a higher incidence of serious adverse events in children receiving blood components. Transfusion in children is largely the same as transfusion in adults, with adaptations of volumes and dose. Normal range for haemoglobin concentrations in children are shown in Table 5. Restrictive thresholds (< 70 g.l ‐1) for RBC transfusion are appropriate for almost all children over 3 months of age. Higher transfusion thresholds are often applied to neonates and children with congenital heart disease. Although thresholds are not clearly defined, there is evidence that transfusion volumes can be reduced in these patients by applying moderately restrictive thresholds without adverse effect on outcomes. In children who are critically ill, haemodynamically stable and not bleeding, maintaining a haemoglobin > 70 g.l ‐1 is recommended, including situations where oxygen delivery is limited (e.g. septic shock, acute traumatic brain injury and post‐cardiac surgery). Neonates should receive components specified for neonatal use, including cytomegalovirus‐negative blood components.

Table 5
Normal ranges for haemoglobin in children.

The volume of blood needed should be modified depending on the size of the patient. It is recommended that blood in children should be prescribed in volume rather than number of units. A single pre‐operative RBC transfusion of 10 ml.kg ‐1 should increase the Hb by approximately 20 g.L ‐1. A formula used commonly to calculate the volume of RBCs to transfuse is provided below:

Other blood components should be given as follows:
Cryoprecipitate: 5–10 ml.kg ‐1
Platelets: 10–20 ml.kg ‐1
FFP: 10–15 ml.kg ‐1
Fibrinogen concentrate: 70 mg.kg −1 (max 2 g); this can be increased to 100 mg.kg −1 in severe bleeding (with hypofibrinogenaemia) where doses > 2 g have been used

Tranexamic acid should be used in children undergoing major surgery likely to be associated with major blood loss such as cardiac surgery, major scoliosis surgery and craniosynostosis surgery, often as part of a multi‐component patient blood management intervention (Table 4). It can also be used in major traumatic haemorrhage as part of a massive haemorrhage protocol. Tranexamic acid dosing is uncertain and other dosing schedules (including higher infusion rates) are also acceptable and in current use. Children > 12 years old should receive the adult dose.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to transfusion strategies, massive bleeding, ESICM 2021 guidelines recommend to consider using high-ratio transfusion strategies (at least 1 unit plasma per 2 units of packed RBCs) over low-ratio transfusion strategies in critically ill patients with massive bleeding due to trauma.

### Practical management of major blood loss [^cbbad994]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of bleeding, regardless of cause, is complex and ill understood. For traumatic or sudden unexpected haemorrhage, the use of transfusion packs with red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets being given in ratios of between 1:1 and 1:3 seems reasonable. This removes the requirement for 'wait and see tests' and should be part of an overall resuscitation and stabilisation plan that may improve outcome following sudden haemorrhage. The replacement of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate with low-volume, targeted concentrates is attractive. There is increasing evidence for the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrates as a single agent. The combination of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates could be powerful and has the possibility to the management of bleeding and improve outcome in patients but, as yet, remains unproven.

### Definitions of massive transfusion in adults with critical bleeding: a systematic review [^562e14dc]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major bleeding requiring blood transfusion can occur in almost any clinical setting and is a medical emergency. The impact of blood component transfusion and other haemostatic interventions on improving outcomes of bleeding patients has been a topic of increasing research interest, as demonstrated by multiple recent randomised controlled trials (RCT), giving momentum to trials evaluating haemostatic resuscitation. Several studies have also shown that morbidity and mortality rates increase as transfusion requirements increase,﻿ emphasising the importance of blood transfusion requirement as a predictive measure of patient outcome. Many recent RCTs are now using transfusion requirement as a primary or key secondary outcome to evaluate interventions (e.g. iTACTIC), recognising in part the convenience of quantification of blood component needs as well as the relevance of this outcome to patients and healthcare resources. However, there is no standardised or universally accepted definition for massive transfusion (MT) in major bleeding, which makes comparing or synthesising the results of such trials difficult.

Historically, MT has often been arbitrarily defined as transfusion of ≥ 10 units of whole blood or red blood cells (RBC) within 24 h, as an approximation of the replacement of ≥ 1 total blood volume. However, this definition has several limitations: it fails to capture patients who die early, before the 24-h or 10-unit threshold is reached, resulting in survivorship bias and it is a retrospective definition. In the last decade, other more dynamic definitions for MT have been introduced, including transfusion of ≥ 5 RBC units in 4 h, the replacement of ≥ 50% of total blood volume in 3 h, or ≥ 3 RBC units during any 1-h period in the first 24 h after hospital arrival, which capture the acuity of the transfusion response. However, none of these definitions take into account other blood components/products, such as plasma and platelets, or other haemostatic agents that are key parts of contemporary transfusion resuscitation. As the number of studies on bleeding increases, the absence of an agreed-upon international consensus for definitions of MT adds even more complexities to designing research studies, synthesising findings, and comparing research outcomes and clinical services across countries.

In collaboration with the International Society for Blood Transfusion Clinical Working Party, and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines, we performed a systematic review of the literature to scope out the most common MT definitions used in RCTs of adult patients with critical bleeding to inform broader discussions around the need for consensus definitions of MT.

### AAGBI guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives 2016 [^d6471a9b]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion can be life-saving. Anaesthetists regularly request and administer blood components to their patients. All anaesthetists must be familiar with indications and appropriate use of blood and blood components and their alternatives, but close liaison with haematology specialists and their local blood sciences laboratory is encouraged. Considerable changes in approaches to optimal use of blood components, together with the use of alternative products, have become apparent over the past decade, leading to a need to update previous guidelines and adapt them for the use of anaesthetists working throughout the hospital system.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^1225f45d]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guideline — adult good practice and recommendations: For hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which the transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remark: in accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most of the trials for subgroups of patients, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. For hospitalized adult patients, the panel suggests a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL in those with hematologic and oncologic disorders (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Good practice considerations state clinicians should consider not only the hemoglobin concentration but also symptoms, signs, other laboratory data, patients' values and preferences, and the overall clinical context, and that clinicians should consider alternatives to transfusion, including medical treatment of anemia and blood conservation strategies; the guideline also notes this practice guideline will not apply to all individual RBC transfusion decisions.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^ba410d2b]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Trauma physicians must quickly and accurately assess and predict when a massive transfusion protocol, including corresponding logistics, should be activated and terminated. While blood loss may sometimes be obvious, neither visual estimation nor physiological parameters are satisfactory guides to estimate the degree of bleeding. Knowledge about the mechanism of injury provides useful information to identify patients at risk of significant haemorrhage at an early stage. For example, the American College of Surgeons defined a threshold of 6 m (20 ft) as a "critical falling height" associated with major injuries, including haemorrhage. Further critical mechanisms include high-energy deceleration impact as well as low-velocity versus high-velocity gunshot injuries. The mechanism of injury combined with injury severity and the patient's physiological presentation should further guide the decision to initiate early surgical bleeding control as outlined in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) survey. Table 3 summarises estimated blood loss based on initial presentation according to the ATLS classification system of hypovolaemic shock. This classification has been shown to be useful as a rough estimation of sustained blood loss in patients with haemorrhagic shock. However, several groups have highlighted discrepancies associated with the weight assigned to each parameter when assessing blood loss that makes it challenging to classify patients using this system. Mutschler and co-workers have analysed the adequacy of this classification and found that > 90% of all trauma patients could not be categorised according to the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock. The same group analysed the validity of the ATLS classification and concluded that this system may underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolaemic shock, while overestimating the degree of tachycardia associated with hypotension. A retrospective analysis of the validity of the ATLS classification showed that increasing blood loss produces an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure, but to a lesser degree than suggested by the ATLS classification. In addition, there are no significant changes in respiratory rate or in level of consciousness with bleeding. Other parameters used for this classification, such as pulse pressure and urinary output, may not be adequately assessed during the initial phase of care. The individual response to fluid challenge as suggested by the ATLS survey should be viewed critically in the context of low-volume resuscitation and "permissive hypotension", which is currently advocated in bleeding trauma patients.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to transfusion thresholds (massive bleeding), BSH 2022 guidelines recommend to use a standard threshold and target hemoglobin range for RBC transfusion to provide critical life-saving support in major bleeding, alongside clinical judgment on the severity of bleeding (hemoglobin 7 g/dL, target range for the post-transfusion hemoglobin level of 7–9 g/dL).

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^439a1b90]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — preoperative interventions include that preoperative identification of high-risk patients should be performed, and all available preoperative and perioperative measures of blood conservation should be undertaken in this group as they account for the majority of blood products transfused (Class I, Level A). Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits. In patients undergoing cardiac operations, it is reasonable to implement standardized transfusion protocols in order to reduce transfusion burden. In patients who have (i) preoperative anemia, (ii) refuse blood transfusion, (iii) or are deemed high-risk for postoperative anemia, it is reasonable to administer preoperative erythropoietin-stimulating agents and iron supplementation several days before cardiac operations to increase red cell mass. Minimization of phlebotomy by reduced volume and frequency of blood sampling is a reasonable means of blood conservation. Preoperative treatment of asymptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia with transfusion is of uncertain benefit (Class III: No Benefit, Level B-NR).

### THOR-AABB working party recommendations for a prehospital blood product transfusion program [^0eae931e]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2021). High credibility.

THOR-AABB prehospital transfusion benefits — saline vs blood products: The use of saline as a volume expander can lead to increased mortality in certain trauma patients and therefore it should not be utilized as the first-choice resuscitation fluid. Supplementing the resuscitation fluid standard of care with blood products during transport has been shown to reduce mortality in a multicenter randomized trial. The greatest survival benefit was seen in patients who received both red blood cells (RBC) and plasma during their transport, whereas patients who received saline without blood products had the lowest survival. Additional civilian and military studies have demonstrated benefits, including a survival benefit following the early transfusion of blood products.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^55c65b07]. Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on current evidence, guidelines recommend the prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytic agents within 3 h of trauma or bleeding onset to reduce bleeding, transfusion, and mortality. Evidence that antifibrinolytics agents increase the risk of thrombotic complications is lacking. In trauma, there is a concern regarding fibrinolytic shutdownand the potential role of antifibrinolytic agent administration more than 3 h after the event. In cardiac surgery, optimal tranexamic acid dosing to balance efficacy and safety still needs further investigation.

In the presence of major bleeding and coagulopathy, current management strategy relies on the replacement of the blood volume lost with allogeneic transfusions and the missing coagulation factors. Particularly in severe trauma, following current guidelines, initial hemostatic resuscitation usually is performed by balanced ratios of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, (FFP), and platelets. However, during the last decade, goal-directed therapy based on coagulation monitoring has been increasingly used, and includes viscoelastic testing. This approach has also promoted the use of coagulation factors concentrates rather than whole blood or plasma. Although the use of factor concentrates remains the topic of debate, the rationale comes from the more specific and efficient replacement of the missing coagulation factors with those concentrates when compared to plasma or whole blood. It is indeed important to remember that plasma and whole blood contain only physiologic concentrations of coagulation factors, and therefore large volumes (greater than 20 to 30 ml/kg) are needed to obtain a significant improvement in plasma levels. Severe side effects, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory overload, are described. However, data for the efficacy and safety of this widely used practice and guideline recommended intervention are scant and diluted by the large proportion of studies with prophylactic FFP transfusions.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^f35fa637]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

When platelet transfusion was introduced in the 1950s, no clinical trials were employed to assess the utility of platelet therapy compared with placebo, and such trials today might be considered unethical. The appropriate dose of platelets is therefore uncertain. Platelet concentrate produced from a unit of whole blood contains 7.5 × 10¹⁰ platelets on average and should increase the platelet count by 5 to 10 × 10⁹/l in a 70 kg recipient. Aphaeresis platelet concentrates generally contain approximately 3 to 6 × 10¹¹ platelets, depending on local collection practice, and physicians should be cognisant of the doses provided locally. A pool of four to eight platelet concentrates or a single-donor aphaeresis unit is usually sufficient to provide haemostasis in a thrombocytopaenic, bleeding patient. If required, the dose of platelets (× 10⁹) can be calculated in more detail from the desired platelet increment, the patient's blood volume in litres (estimated by multiplying the patient's body surface area by 2.5, or 70 ml/kg in an adult), and a correction factor of 0.67 to allow for pooling of approximately 33% of transfused platelets in the spleen.

Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate

Recommendation 26

We recommend treatment with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate if significant bleeding is accompanied by thrombelastometric signs of a functional fibrinogen deficit or a plasma fibrinogen level of less than 1.5 to 2.0 g/l (Grade 1C). We suggest an initial fibrinogen concentrate dose of 3 to 4 g or 50 mg/kg of cryoprecipitate, which is approximately equivalent to 15 to 20 units in a 70 kg adult. Repeat doses may be guided by thrombelastometric monitoring and laboratory assessment of fibrinogen levels (Grade 2C).

### Effect of intravenous aminocaproid acid on blood loss and transfusion requirements after bilateral varus rotational osteotomy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^c19c6692]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of EACA in reducing calculated intraoperative blood loss associated with bilateral VROs. There was no difference in calculated blood loss or transfusion requirements between patients who received IV EACA versus placebo. Similarly, transfusion rates and all secondary outcomes were similar between the EACA and placebo groups. This study does not currently support the routine use of EACA in pediatric patients undergoing bilateral VRO; however, differences in preoperative hematocrit despite randomization, heterogeneity in associated procedures, and high variability in calculated blood loss may have impacted results.

Given the extent of osseous and soft tissue surgery and baseline patient factors such as poor nutrition and concomitant use of medications that inhibit coagulation, blood loss and transfusion requirements are relatively high in this patient population. This phenomenon has been noted in our clinical experience and corroborated by Tomak et al, who reported the need for a blood transfusion in all patients undergoing bilateral femoral osteotomies. Other authors have found that the mean blood loss after bilateral VRO can range from 260 to 400 mL. In this study, we report similar estimates of blood loss and over half of patients in each group required a blood transfusion. Since these surgeries are commonly performed in children, these blood volumes comprise a greater percentage of total blood volume and have significant physiologic implications.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^881620bb]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse". When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time". This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely", but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided", and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)".

### Definitions of massive transfusion in adults with critical bleeding: a systematic review [^325ff14c]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

As we see an increasing number of RCTs being performed in major bleeding, we should be able to identify the rates of severe bleeding that require a large volume blood transfusion from these trials, so we can better understand the impact of different interventions on this important outcome. For example, the harmonisation of major bleeding definition by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in surgical and non-surgical patients was crucial to evaluating and quantifying the safety of different direct antithrombotic agents in both surgical and medical settings. We hope that similar benefits will arise by harmonising definition for MT.

The next step should be to move to a stakeholder consultation and a Delphi process to reach a consensus on an MT definition in all relevant clinical settings, with the hope of reconciling the diverse range of definitions that have appeared in the transfusion literature to date. Based on our review, we propose that the following considerations be made for reaching a consensus for MT definitions: involvement of a wider range of stakeholders, including patients; consideration of the age of patients (e.g. adult or paediatric); consideration of a specific clinical setting (e.g. trauma, gastrointestinal, obstetric, surgical or medical); inclusion of other blood components (e.g. plasma, platelets); inclusion of other blood products (e.g. fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate, cell salvage); and associating the timepoint for defining MT with patient-centred outcomes (e.g. mortality, organ failure, hospital stay) (Fig. 3).

### Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm [^2deff117]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In sub-Saharan Africa, children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia [defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) of < 60 g/l] present a major public health burden on in-patient and blood transfusion services. Although timely transfusion is frequently lifesaving, equitable access to adequate supplies of safe blood remains a key challenge. In 2013 the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Database on Blood Safety reported that < 5 units of blood were donated per 1000 people in most African countries, far fewer than estimated requirements of 20 units/1000 per year. Despite considerable investment by external funders in the decade since their previous report (2004–2005), few countries had made significant improvements in their collection rates.

Guidelines developed by the WHO encourage the conservative use of blood in children, restricting routine transfusion to those with severe anaemia, defined as an Hb < 40 g/l, or 40–60 g/l with clinical signs of severity. However, the underpinning evidence base for this recommendation is weakand adherence to these guidelines is poor, which is compounded by inconsistent Hb threshold recommendations for transfusion for malaria. Currently, 20 ml/kg of whole blood (or 10 ml/kg of packed cells) is recommended for severe anaemia. However, if standard formulae for transfusion volume were applied, the one-size-fits-all 20 ml/kg recommendation would underestimate transfusion requirements by ~30%. A consensus international guideline on transfusion of critically ill children also noted a weak global evidence base and specifically highlighted the need to evaluate optimal transfusion volumes.

### Accuracy of estimated blood loss in predicting need for transfusion after delivery [^f5b7fe55]. American Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The definition of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was developed more than 50 years ago. Since then, the obstetric population has changed dramatically. We sought to determine how well we estimated blood loss (EBL) and find thresholds predicting need for transfusion.

Study Design

We performed a prospective cohort study from 2010 to 2012, comparing those who needed transfusion postpartum and those who did not. EBL, calculated EBL (cEBL), and change in hematocrit were calculated for patients who did not receive transfusion, and EBL was calculated for those who did receive transfusion, stratified by delivery type. Receiver operator curves were created and optimal thresholds of EBL to predict transfusion were estimated.

Results

Among 4,804 patients, transfusion was required for 0.65% of vaginal and 8.7% of cesarean deliveries. Median EBL was higher in women requiring transfusion. A weak correlation was noted between EBL and cEBL for all deliveries. Thresholds of 500 mL blood loss for vaginal delivery and 1,000 mL for cesarean had the best predictive ability for transfusion.

Conclusion

In this modern obstetric, cohort EBL is weakly correlated with cEBL, suggesting that accuracy of clinical estimates of blood loss is modest. However, EBL predicts need for transfusion, with optimal thresholds of 500 mL for a vaginal delivery and 1,000 mL in a cesarean. This validates the traditional definitions of PPH in our modern population.

### Recombinant activated factor VII in spinal surgery: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial [^d6496510]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, Phase IIa study.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of recombinant-activated Factor VII (rFVIIa) in major spinal surgery.

Summary Of Background

Spinal fusion surgery can cause substantial blood loss and blood product transfusions. Recombinant FVIIa is approved for treatment of bleeding in patients with coagulation abnormalities and has been shown to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in surgery in patients with no underlying coagulopathy.

Methods

Forty-nine patients undergoing fusion of 3 or more vertebral segments were randomized and treated on losing 10% of their estimated blood volume (with total expected surgical blood loss ≥ 20%) and received 3 doses (2-hour intervals) of placebo (n = 13) or 30, 60, or 120 microg/kg rFVIIa (n = 12 per group). The primary endpoint was safety. A priori-defined efficacy endpoints included blood loss and transfusion requirements between placebo and each rFVIIa dose group, adjusted for surgery duration, number of segments fused, and estimated blood volume.

Results

Serious adverse events did not occur at any greater frequency in any of the treatment groups. One patient (3 x 30 microg/kg rFVIIa) with advanced cerebrovascular disease (undiagnosed, trial exclusion criterion) died 6 days after surgery due to an ischemic stroke. Mean blood loss was as follows: 2270 mL for placebo; 1909, 1262, and 1868 mL for 3 x 30, 3 x 60, and 3 x 120 microg/kg rFVIIa, respectively (differences not statistically significant). Mean adjusted surgical blood loss was as follows: 2536 mL for placebo; 1120, 400, and 823 mL for 3 x 30, 3 x 60, and 3 x 120 microg/kg rFVIIa, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). Mean surgical transfusion volume was reduced by 27% to 50% with rFVIIa treatment (not significant). The mean adjusted surgical transfusion volume was reduced by 81% to 95% with rFVIIa treatment (P ≤ 0.002).

Conclusion

No safety concerns were indicated for the use of rFVIIa in patients at all doses tested; rFVIIa reduced adjusted blood loss and adjusted transfusions during spinal surgery.

### Quantitative blood loss in obstetric hemorrhage: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 794 [^e6141997]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 794 — recommendations and conclusions on blood loss assessment — states that quantitative methods of measuring obstetric blood loss have been shown to be more accurate than visual estimation in determining obstetric blood loss, and that visual estimation is more likely to underestimate the actual blood loss when volumes are high and overestimate when volumes are low. Although quantitative measurement is more accurate than visual estimation for identifying obstetric blood loss, the effectiveness of quantitative blood loss measurement on clinical outcomes has not been demonstrated. Implementation of quantitative assessment of blood loss includes the following two items: 1) use of direct measurement of obstetric blood loss (quantitative blood loss) and 2) protocols for collecting and reporting a cumulative record of blood loss postdelivery. Interprofessional protocols for the assessment of blood loss, including quantitative assessment, for both vaginal and cesarean births are best developed by a multidisciplinary team. Successful obstetric hemorrhage bundle implementation is associated with improved outcome measures related to obstetric hemorrhage.

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^e88c82b5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop evidence-based clinical practice recommendations regarding transfusion practices and transfusion in bleeding critically ill adults.

Methods

A taskforce involving 15 international experts and 2 methodologists used the GRADE approach to guideline development. The taskforce addressed three main topics: transfusion support in massively and non-massively bleeding critically ill patients (transfusion ratios, blood products, and point of care testing) and the use of tranexamic acid. The panel developed and answered structured guideline questions using population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) format.

Results

The taskforce generated 26 clinical practice recommendations (2 strong recommendations, 13 conditional recommendations, 11 no recommendation), and identified 10 PICOs with insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

Conclusions

This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of massively and non-massively bleeding critically ill adult patients and identifies areas where further research is needed.
