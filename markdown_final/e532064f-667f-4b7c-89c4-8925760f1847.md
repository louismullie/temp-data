## Question

Why might someone not be losing weight while on tirzepatide?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why someone might not be losing weight while on tirzepatide and how to approach that nonresponse thoughtfully. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the expected efficacy baseline from trials versus real-world outcomes. Then, I should verify adherence and treatment persistence. Next, I will examine dose optimization and titration, followed by early response patterns and the time course of weight loss. After that, I need to assess patient characteristics, GI tolerability, metabolic and disease-specific factors, concomitant medications and comorbidities, lifestyle behaviors, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability. Finally, I will reconcile trial-versus-real-world gaps and synthesize a practical clinical decision framework with special population considerations before making a recommendation [^1128YgBB] [^11198zw8] [^114FhGQ9] [^114enbus].

> Let me first confirm the expected efficacy baseline so I don't anchor on an outlier response. In SURMOUNT-1, once-weekly tirzepatide produced roughly 19–21% mean weight loss at 72 weeks at 10–15 mg in people without diabetes, whereas in SURMOUNT-2 with type 2 diabetes, reductions were closer to 13–15% at 72 weeks, indicating attenuated loss in diabetes cohorts, with similar titration schemes starting at 2.5 mg and increasing every 4 weeks to the randomized maintenance dose [^1128YgBB] [^111KHr1A] [^11198zw8] [^111XbLk3]. Hold on, I should double-check real-world data to avoid overestimating expected outcomes; observational cohorts show on-treatment losses of around 11–15% by 6–12 months, which is directionally consistent but somewhat smaller than RCTs, likely reflecting adherence, comorbidity, and implementation differences [^114FhGQ9] [^114enbus] [^114BFSWt].

> Next, I need to check adherence and treatment persistence because nonadherence is a frequent and underappreciated driver of apparent nonresponse. Wait, let me verify how "forgiving" tirzepatide is; pharmacometric modeling suggests meaningful weight loss can persist even with occasional missed doses (for example, ~15% loss at 80% adherence), yet real-world discontinuation still markedly blunts outcomes, with those who stop early averaging ~3.6% at 1 year versus ~11.9% among persisters [^1145TSkd] [^112L3xe6] [^114YXwpy]. I should confirm whether gaps longer than 1–2 weeks prompted retitration or prolonged subtherapeutic exposure, as that can transiently reduce effectiveness despite nominal "time on drug" [^112aMrJP].

> Now, I will examine dose optimization and titration, because insufficient dose is a common, fixable cause of suboptimal weight loss. The FDA-labeled schedule starts at 2.5 mg weekly for 4 weeks with 2.5 mg increments roughly every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5–15 mg, and weight loss is dose-dependent, with higher maintenance doses yielding larger average reductions and better categorical thresholds achieved in network analyses and RCTs [^112aMrJP] [^1175P4sA] [^114PWMSD] [^1128YgBB]. Hold on, I should verify the impact of de-escalation and prolonged titration; GI intolerance can necessitate slower escalation or down-titration (e.g., 15→10 mg), which likely reduces achievable loss by several percentage points relative to higher maintenance dosing, so checking tolerability-driven dose ceilings is essential [^111N9syV] [^114PWMSD].

> I will now assess early response patterns and the time course, because declaring "failure" too early is a common mistake. Initially, I almost applied the conventional 12-week 5% rule used for other anti-obesity medications, but wait, I need to correct that for tirzepatide; post hoc analyses from SURMOUNT-1 show that about 18% are late responders (< 5% at week 12) yet roughly 90% of them ultimately achieve ≥ 5% loss by week 72, with an average ~25 weeks to cross 5%, so premature discontinuation at week 12 misclassifies many eventual responders [^114CsySa] [^111F9Zhz] [^116jCYxk]. Let me also double-check T2D populations; even among nonearly responders in SURPASS, meaningful glycemic and weight benefits accrue by ~40–52 weeks, underscoring the need for a longer evaluation window before abandoning therapy [^116UsfWY].

> Let me consider patient demographics and baseline characteristics that may modulate pace and magnitude of response. I should confirm that males are overrepresented among late responders and may have lower exposure at comparable weight, while higher baseline weight/BMI and hypertension also track with a greater likelihood of late response, suggesting slower trajectories rather than futility [^111iHXb5] [^114CsySa]. Hold on, I should verify that type 2 diabetes consistently attenuates weight loss by several percentage points versus non-diabetes cohorts across trials and real-world settings, which can recalibrate expectations without implying nonresponse [^114enbus] [^111XbLk3].

> Next, I should review GI tolerability and side-effect management because these often drive interruptions, down-titration, or discontinuation. Hmm, I initially wondered if nausea and vomiting directly drive a large fraction of weight loss; wait a minute, mediation analyses suggest GI adverse events account for only a small portion (on the order of ~2–3%) of total weight reduction, so their main impact on outcomes is via dose limitation or early cessation rather than mechanistic weight loss per se [^111mzJSM] [^111N9syV]. I need to ensure appropriate mitigation strategies are in place, including dietary adjustments, slower titration, and short-term symptomatic therapies, since these can preserve dose intensity and persistence and thereby protect long-term efficacy [^111N9syV] [^111NXygw].

> I should now think about metabolic and disease-specific factors because weight and glycemia can diverge. Let me verify the mediation data; 12–27% of HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in certain contexts is weight-independent, reflecting beta-cell effects and glucagon suppression, so patients may see robust glycemic gains even with slower weight change early on, which should temper "nonresponse" labeling if glycemic endpoints are on track [^1126ftFY] [^117NKCSp] [^115yqkyj]. But wait, what if concomitant insulin or sulfonylurea is present? I need to check for hypoglycemia and defensive eating, both of which can offset net energy deficit and blunt weight loss despite pharmacologic appetite suppression [^114GPyAp].

> Next, I should review concomitant medications and comorbidities that confound weight outcomes and adherence. Hold on, I should verify the role of antihypertensives and the hypertension phenotype linked with late response; whether this reflects drug effects or shared pathophysiology is unclear, but it flags a population needing longer observation and dose optimization before deeming failure [^111iHXb5]. I also need to consider rare metabolic phenotypes such as lipodystrophy, where tirzepatide improves metabolic parameters but weight trajectories may not mirror typical patterns, and obstructive sleep apnea, where tirzepatide is now indicated and may modify the course of weight and symptom response [^1129huF1] [^114s94bw].

> I need to ensure lifestyle and behavioral contributors are not undermining pharmacologic effects. Let me verify the trial standardization: participants receive structured counseling with a 500 kcal/day deficit and 150 minutes/week activity in SURMOUNT, but real-world adherence varies widely, so insufficient dietary change, limited mobility, depressive symptoms, or internalized weight bias can slow or blunt observed loss even on active therapy [^1168q3iF] [^111iHXb5] [^114EqHsp]. Hold on, I should also consider that psychosocial improvement often tracks with greater weight reduction, so addressing mental health and engagement can indirectly enhance outcomes over time [^111UJ1hp] [^114EqHsp].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability to avoid missing a technical cause of subtherapeutic exposure. Let me double-check the half-life and accumulation; tirzepatide has an approximately 5-day half-life with weekly dosing, so injection technique, site, and prolonged gaps can alter exposure, and sex-related exposure differences may influence dose needs to achieve similar effects at a given body mass [^115ZYjpA] [^111iHXb5]. I should confirm proper storage, timing, and administration, especially if there is "no weight loss at all", because practical issues can masquerade as pharmacologic failure [^112aMrJP].

> But wait, I also need to reconcile RCT efficacy with real-world effectiveness so I don't set unrealistic benchmarks. Real-world datasets show 11–15% on-treatment losses at 6–12 months with tirzepatide, lower than RCTs, likely due to less intensive lifestyle support, broader comorbid burden, imperfect adherence, earlier discontinuation, and heterogeneous follow-up and measurement, which together can explain a subset of "nonresponders" who are, in fact, achieving modest but meaningful loss [^114FhGQ9] [^114enbus] [^114BFSWt].

> Let me synthesize this into a clinical decision framework without jumping to conclusions prematurely. If there is no weight loss at all, I should first verify product integrity, storage, administration technique, and actual dispensing/refill history, and consider significant dose gaps requiring retitration; only after that would I explore rare causes like severe malabsorption or theoretical anti-drug antibodies, given the absence of supportive reports to date [^112aMrJP] [^115ZYjpA]. If weight loss is minimal at 12 weeks (< 5%), I should not discontinue yet; instead, I need to re-check adherence, escalate toward the maximal tolerated dose, manage GI symptoms proactively, and extend the assessment window to at least 24–28 weeks because most late responders cross clinically meaningful thresholds by then and by 72 weeks about 90% will have ≥ 5% loss on-treatment [^114CsySa] [^111F9Zhz] [^111N9syV]. If the response is suboptimal (5–10% but below expectations), I should double-check missed doses and titration ceilings, review weight-promoting or hypoglycemia-prone co-therapies, reinforce nutrition and activity plans, and consider further dose escalation if not yet at 15 mg, recognizing the dose-dependent gradient in loss [^114PWMSD] [^114GPyAp] [^1168q3iF].

> I should now address special populations so my recommendations are appropriately individualized. In type 2 diabetes, I need to recalibrate goals downward by roughly 3–6% compared to non-diabetes cohorts and track composite cardiometabolic benefits, not just weight, since glycemic and risk-factor improvements may justify continuation despite slower weight trajectories [^114enbus] [^111XbLk3]. In peri- and postmenopausal women, let me reconsider hormonal context; estrogen deficiency can modulate appetite signaling and body composition, and careful dose optimization plus time may be necessary to realize full effect sizes observed across SURMOUNT subgroups [^113Jn22s] [^111JVCKV].

> Final clinical recommendation: I need to ensure we avoid premature labeling of tirzepatide "failure". First, verify adherence, storage, and injection technique; second, optimize to the highest tolerated maintenance dose with GI mitigation; third, extend the evaluation window beyond 12 weeks, ideally to at least 24–28 weeks, because many late responders require this time to manifest clinically meaningful loss; fourth, address concomitant medications that drive compensatory intake or hypoglycemia; and fifth, recalibrate expectations in T2D and higher-BMI or male patients who may have slower trajectories yet ultimately achieve substantial benefit [^112aMrJP] [^111N9syV] [^114GPyAp] [^114CsySa] [^111F9Zhz]. Hold on, let me verify alignment with real-world evidence: persisting on therapy and maintaining dose intensity are strongly associated with larger long-term loss, so the practical focus should be on persistence, mitigation of barriers, and patience with time-to-effect before declaring nonresponse [^114YXwpy] [^114FhGQ9] [^114enbus].

Patients may not lose weight on tirzepatide due to **inadequate dosing or adherence** (not reaching 10–15 mg [^112aMrJP] or missing doses), **compensatory behaviors** (increased caloric intake or reduced activity), or **metabolic resistance** (insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, or medications such as insulin or corticosteroids). Other contributors include **genetic factors** (FTO, MC4R), **psychological factors** (stress, depression), and **gastrointestinal side effects** [^111N9syV] that limit dose escalation. Addressing these factors through dose optimization, adherence support, lifestyle modification, and management of metabolic or psychological barriers can improve outcomes.

---

## Inadequate dosing or adherence

Dose escalation: Titrate tirzepatide from 2.5 mg to 5–15 mg weekly [^112aMrJP]; suboptimal dosing (< 10 mg) limits weight loss. Adherence: Lapses reduce efficacy [^114YXwpy], though tirzepatide is somewhat forgiving of occasional missed doses [^1145TSkd] [^112L3xe6].

---

## Compensatory behaviors

Compensatory behaviors include **increased caloric intake**, as appetite suppression may wane and lead to higher intake with reduced weight loss, and **reduced physical activity**, which can offset caloric deficits and limit weight loss.

---

## Metabolic resistance

- **Insulin resistance**: Common in obesity/T2D, it can blunt weight loss despite tirzepatide.

- **Hypothyroidism**: Untreated thyroid dysfunction slows metabolism and impairs weight loss.

- **Medications**: Insulin, sulfonylureas, corticosteroids, and some antidepressants can cause weight gain.

---

## Genetic factors

Genetic predisposition — variants in FTO, MC4R, and leptin pathways — can reduce response to tirzepatide.

---

## Psychological factors

Psychological factors include **stress and emotional eating**, where stress, depression, and anxiety can increase intake and reduce adherence, and **body image and self-efficacy**, where negative body image and low self-efficacy can impair adherence and outcomes.

---

## Gastrointestinal side effects

GI symptoms — such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [^111N9syV] — may limit dose escalation and adherence, reducing efficacy.

---

## Clinical strategies to address inadequate weight loss

- **Dose optimization**: Titrate to 10–15 mg weekly as tolerated [^1175P4sA].

- **Adherence support**: Use reminders, education, and regular follow-up [^112L3xe6].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Combine with dietary changes and increased physical activity [^1168q3iF].

- **Metabolic evaluation**: Assess and treat insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, and medication-induced weight gain.

- **Psychological support**: Provide counseling and behavioral therapy to address emotional eating and adherence [^114EqHsp].

---

Patients not losing weight on tirzepatide often have **modifiable barriers**; **targeted interventions** can enhance weight loss outcomes [^111F9Zhz].

### Gastrointestinal tolerability and weight reduction associated with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight with and without type 2 diabetes in the SURMOUNT-1 to -4 trials [^111N9syV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) were self‐reported. Participants were asked to report any AE, irrespective of expectations from the treatment. During visits, information on the onset date, end date, and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of AEs was collected using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. In this post hoc analysis, a single GI AE was sufficient to categorize participants as 'with GI AE' or 'without GI AE'. GI AEs were categorized based on severity and seriousness. The assessment of GI AE incidence was a component of the safety assessment of tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials.

All serious AEs were followed until resolution, stabilization, the event was otherwise explained, or the participant was lost to follow‐up. Participants who experienced intolerable GI symptoms at any time during the study were first counseled on dietary alterations to help mitigate symptoms. Recommendations included eating smaller meals, splitting three daily meals into four or more smaller ones, and stopping eating when they felt full. If symptoms persisted, medication could be prescribed at the investigator's discretion (e.g. antiemetic or antidiarrheal medication).

A temporary interruption of the study drug for one weekly dose was permitted, with treatment resumed at the assigned dose, either alone or in combination with medication to treat GI symptoms. If intolerable GI symptoms persisted, the treatment dose could be de‐escalated to the next lowest dose (e.g. 15 mg reduced to 10 mg).

### Weight reduction over time in tirzepatide-treated participants by early weight loss response: Post hoc analysis in SURMOUNT-1 [^111iHXb5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In the present study, heterogeneity in weight-loss response to tirzepatide was observed. Consistent with other incretin early response research, a greater proportion of late responders were male. This finding could be related to sex differences in pharmacokinetics that result in males having lower drug exposure compared to females of the same weight. Furthermore, sex hormones have been shown to play a role in body weight by regulating food intake, food reward, and rate of gastric emptying. Late responders also tended towards a higher baseline body weight. In addition to reducing the relative exposure to tirzepatide, other possible reasons for this slower treatment response may include higher insulin resistance with higher body weight, greater mobility limitations, and higher internalized weight bias. In a BMI subgroup analysis of the SURMOUNT-1 study, higher BMI categories were associated with greater weight loss. However, in this analysis, we see less weight reduction in the late responder group. While a direct comparison is limited given the nature of post hoc analyses, other possible contributors in the late responder group may have attenuated the effect of higher BMI on weight reduction.

A greater proportion of late responders had hypertension. This finding in the late responders could be related to higher body weight, BMI, and waist circumference, which are risk factors for hypertension. However, the reason behind this observation is unclear and raises the question for future evaluation on whether the use of antihypertensives or the underlying pathophysiology of hypertension contributes to this outcome.

### Incretin mimetics for weight loss forgive nonadherence [^1145TSkd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

We now use the models and metrics of Section 2 to investigate the effects of nonadherence to semaglutide and tirzepatide. In Sections 3.1 and 3.3, we assume that patients miss each dose randomly and independently of their prior doses; that is, missing a dose one week does not make the patient any more or less likely to miss a dose the following week. We relax this independence assumption in Section 3.4 and consider the effects of positive or negative correlations in missed doses.

- **Average weight loss**: Figure 2A plots the average weight loss (denoted ⟨ X ⟩ and defined in (8)) as a function of the proportion of doses taken (denoted p) over a long period of time. Figure 2 predicts that semaglutide and tirzepatide are very "forgiving" in that substantial weight loss is achieved despite lapses in missed doses. For instance, Figure 2A predicts that a patient prescribed a once-weekly dose of either 2.4 mg of semaglutide or 5 mg of tirzepatide maintains around a 15% reduction in body weight if they tend to miss about one dose out of every 5 doses, i.e. p = 80%. In practical terms, p = 80% corresponds to missing nearly one dose every month. Furthermore, at this same p = 80% level of adherence, a once-weekly prescription of either 10 or 15 mg of tirzepatide yields 20% or 23% weight loss, respectively.

Figure 2 shows that missed doses do not proportionately decrease efficacy. Panel A plots the average body weight loss (denoted ⟨ X ⟩ and defined in (8)) as a function of adherence p for different drugs and dose sizes. Panel B shows how missed doses reduce weight loss relative to perfect adherence.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: The contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^1126ftFY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

There are several clinical implications of the findings reported in this paper. The contribution of weight loss (WL) to the overall improvement of glycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) should be considered and discussed with patients. This is essential for those who might benefit from understanding tirzepatide's mechanism of action and how WL associated with therapy might impact their overall metabolic control. Patients should also understand that the improvement of glycemia might not be driven entirely by WL, and losing weight is not a prerequisite for lowering HbA1c with tirzepatide. Other weight-independent factors, such as increased secretory response of beta cells and suppression of glucagon, play an important role in lowering glycemia.

This analysis exhibits several strengths that enhance the robustness and generalizability of its findings. The study benefits from large and balanced sample sizes across groups and a broad spectrum of disease, including participants with both shorter and longer durations of the disease. Additionally, the inclusion of participants with insulin-naive T2D, those on multiple oral anti-diabetic medications, and those on insulin therapy further strengthens the study. Finally, the trials included participants with a range of BMI values, which collectively contribute to the reliability and applicability of the study's findings.

### Relationship between body weight change and glycaemic control with tirzepatide treatment in people with type 2 diabetes: A post hoc assessment of the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^115yqkyj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between HbA1c and body weight reductions with tirzepatide treatment (5, 10, or 15 mg).

- **Materials and methods**: HbA1c and body weight data at 40 weeks (SURPASS-1, -2, and -5) and 52 weeks (SURPASS-3 and -4) were analyzed by trial.

- **Results**: Across the SURPASS clinical trials, HbA1c reductions from baseline were observed in 96%-99%, 98%-99%, and 94%-99% of participants treated with tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively. Moreover, 87%-94%, 88%-95%, and 88%-97% of participants, respectively, experienced weight loss associated with HbA1c reductions. Statistically significant associations (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.1438 to 0.3130 across studies; P ≤ .038) between HbA1c and body weight changes were observed with tirzepatide in SURPASS-2, -3, -4 (all doses) and -5 (tirzepatide 5 mg only).

- **Conclusions**: In this post hoc analysis, consistent reductions in both HbA1c and body weight were observed in most participants treated with tirzepatide at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg. A statistically significant but modest association between HbA1c and body weight change was observed in SURPASS-2, SURPASS-3, and SURPASS-4, suggesting that both weight-independent and weight-dependent mechanisms are responsible for the tirzepatide-induced improvement in glycaemic control.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide for weight loss in overweight or obese patients in an ambulatory care setting [^114enbus]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In this study of patients who were overweight or obese, tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss over six months of follow-up than semaglutide, both overall and in patients without diabetes. However, weight loss did not differ between the two agents in patients with diabetes.

The results of this real-world study are generally consistent with clinical trials, including SURMOUNT-1, which established the weight loss efficacy of tirzepatide over 72 weeks in obese patients without diabetes, and preliminary data from SURMOUNT-5, a head-to-head trial comparing tirzepatide to semaglutide over 78 weeks in overweight/obesity patients without diabetes. SURPASS-2, a study comparing tirzepatide to semaglutide in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, found greater weight loss with tirzepatide over 40 weeks of follow-up than with semaglutide. However, the real-world study had a shorter follow-up time than SURPASS-2, which may not have been sufficient to observe a significant weight loss difference between treatments in the diabetes cohort.

The study is also consistent with a recent retrospective cohort study by Rodriquez et al, which observed greater weight loss with tirzepatide than with semaglutide in overweight/obese patients. The mean percentage change in body weight between tirzepatide and semaglutide in the Rodriquez study was similar to the findings of this study. The Rodriquez study also suggested that those without diabetes experienced a larger reduction in weight than those with diabetes treated with either tirzepatide or semaglutide.

### Metabolic improvements with tirzepatide in lipodystrophy: A novel option [^1129huF1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Lipodystrophy encompasses a group of rare disorders associated with severe metabolic disease. These disorders are defined by abnormal fat distribution, with near-total (generalized lipodystrophy [GL]) or partial (partial lipodystrophy [PL]; e.g. familial partial lipodystrophy [FPLD]) absence of adipocyte mass, leading to a decreased ability to store lipids safely. Excess lipids are more likely to be stored in nonadipose tissues, which leads to the metabolic manifestations. We have recently shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are associated with metabolic improvements in FPLD. Here, we hypothesize that tirzepatide, a dual incretin, may also lead to metabolic improvement in patients with lipodystrophy.

- **Research design and methods**: An observational cohort of patients with lipodystrophy who received tirzepatide clinically was tracked in the context of ongoing natural history studies.

- **Results**: Seventeen patients received tirzepatide, 14 of whom had FPLD (aged 30–74 years; n = 12 female and 2 male). After a median of 8.7 months of follow-up, the following were significantly reduced: BMI (median difference, -1.7; range, -5.9 to 0.9 kg/m²; P = 0.008), HbA1c (median difference, -1.1%; range, -6.3% to -0.1%; P < 0.001), triglycerides (median difference, -65 mg/dL [-0.73 mmol/L]; range, -3,820 to 43 mg/dL [-43.2 to 0.49 mmol/L]; P = 0.003), and total daily insulin requirements (median difference, -109; range, -315 to 0 units/day; P = 0.002). Three additional patients with rarer forms of lipodystrophy also showed a robust response to tirzepatide.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^112yhziK]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although tirzepatide and semaglutide have been shown to reduce weight in randomized clinical trials, head-to-head comparison data in populations with overweight or obesity are not yet available. This study aimed to compare on-treatment weight loss and rates of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) among adults with overweight or obesity receiving tirzepatide or semaglutide labeled for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a clinical setting.

In this cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity who received semaglutide or tirzepatide between May 2022 and September 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data. This data was linked to dispensing information from a collective of US healthcare systems. On-treatment weight outcomes were assessed through November 3, 2023. Participants included adults with overweight or obesity who had regular care in the year before initiation, no prior use of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, a prescription within 60 days prior to initiation, and an available baseline weight. The analysis was completed on April 3, 2024.

- **Exposures**: Tirzepatide or semaglutide in formulations labeled for T2D, whether on or off label.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: On-treatment weight change was assessed in a propensity score-matched population. This included evaluating the hazard of achieving at least 5%, 10%, and 15% weight loss, as well as percentage weight change at 3, 6, and 12 months. Hazards of gastrointestinal AEs were also compared.

Among 41,222 adults meeting the study criteria (32,029 receiving semaglutide and 9,193 receiving tirzepatide), the analysis showed significant findings regarding the weight outcomes and adverse events of these treatments.

### Incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes in adults living with obesity treated with tirzepatide or semaglutide: Real world evidence from an international retrospective cohort study [^115cMr6G]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), by slowing gastric emptying and reducing appetite, are increasingly utilized in the pharmacotherapy for treating overweight and obesity. The once-weekly preparation of GLP-1 RA, semaglutide, offers greater weight loss compared to earlier-generation GLP-1 RAs such as exenatide.

Recently, tirzepatide, a dual agonist of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), has demonstrated a greater degree of weight loss compared to single peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Weight loss is unequivocally the most effective intervention to reduce the subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals living with overweight or obesity. In individuals who have already developed T2D, weight loss is associated with fewer adverse health events, reduced micro- and macrovascular complications, greater overall survival, and remission.

However, the clinical effect of the newly introduced dual agonist, tirzepatide, on the incidence of T2D in individuals living with overweight and obesity, and indeed the impact on cardiovascular outcomes, remains unexplored. Controversy surrounding semaglutide and the purported increased risk of suicidal thoughts, initially raised by the Icelandic Medicines Agency, has been subject to extensive review and has since been disproven. The risk of suicidal attempt and ideation has not been studied with tirzepatide use.

Hence, in this study, we took advantage of a large international federated database of electronic health records to determine and compare the relative association of tirzepatide.

### Weight reduction over time in tirzepatide-treated participants by early weight loss response: Post hoc analysis in SURMOUNT-1 [^116jCYxk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The potential implications of the present study's findings are meaningful and could inform treatment for people living with obesity. Following clinical treatment guidelines to discontinue treatment at 12 weeks for the late responders would have prevented most of these participants from achieving clinically meaningful weight reduction with tirzepatide. The guidance is based on data from other medications that have shorter titration windows and achieve lower mean treatment responses. Additionally, analyses of the treatment response pattern with those medications show that those who do not achieve ≥ 5% weight reduction at 12 weeks are unlikely to achieve that target at 52 weeks or beyond.

The study had several strengths. The SURMOUNT‐1 trial included a large study population that was representative of people living with obesity globally. The long duration of the trial provided adequate time to determine the weight‐loss response to tirzepatide. A limitation of the study is that participant inclusion was limited to those who were adherent to treatment, which may not reflect adherence in the clinical setting. However, studying participants who received 75% or more of the assigned doses allowed for some dosing variation without confounding the outcomes for late responders to tirzepatide. We were unable to assess whether dietary intake or physical activity differed by responder status; however, all participants received the same standardized lifestyle intervention. While differences in adherence to these components may have influenced treatment response, this cannot be determined.

### Switching to tirzepatide 5 mg from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: Clinical expectations in the first 12 weeks of treatment [^111NXygw]. Endocrine Practice (2024). High credibility.

This prospective study aimed to describe the clinical course in terms of glycemic outcomes, body weight, and adverse events during the first 12 weeks following a switch from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) directly to tirzepatide 5 mg.

- **Methods**: Participants were ≥ 18 years with type 2 diabetes (T2D), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% to ≤ 9.0%, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m², and were on a stable treatment dose of GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide every day [1.2, 1.8 mg], semaglutide once-weekly [0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg], or dulaglutide once-weekly [0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg]) for ≥ 3 months at baseline. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline at week 12. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in fasting serum glucose, body weight, and glucose assessed by continuous glucose monitoring. Safety was also assessed.

- **Results**: Participants were 58.3 years on average, with baseline HbA1c 7.39%, body mass index 35.18 kg/m², T2D duration around 12.4 years, and included 55% females. Semaglutide (55%) and dulaglutide (42%) were the most commonly used GLP-1 RAs at baseline, with semaglutide 1.0 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg being the most common treatment doses. At week 12, mean HbA1c changed from baseline by -0.43%, fasting serum glucose by -7.83 mg/dL, and body weight by -2.15 kg (all P < .01). Glycemic outcomes and body weight improved in participants in all baseline GLP-1 RA subgroups. Twenty participants (13.2%) developed gastrointestinal events. Three (2%) participants discontinued tirzepatide due to adverse events. There were no severe hypoglycemic events.

### Less frequent dosing of GLP-1 receptor agonists as a viable weight maintenance strategy [^113q4Tt9]. Obesity (2025). High credibility.

The incretin mimetics semaglutide and tirzepatide (also referred to as glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists) have upended the treatment paradigm of obesity. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that semaglutide and tirzepatide facilitate an average placebo-adjusted body weight (BW) loss of 15.0% and 19.2%, respectively, compared with the 5% to 10% of older-generation antiobesity medications (AOMs).

These benefits must be weighed against their high cost, which can exceed $1000 monthly. Demand for these incretin mimetics has frequently outstripped their supply, leaving patients uncertain as to whether they will be able to fill their next prescription. Some have had to switch to alternative AOMs or stop entirely, whereas others have rationed their remaining supply. Although high costs and supply shortages might eventually subside, both issues still impede patient access to incretin mimetics.

We present two patients who maintained their BW loss despite less frequent dosing of their incretin mimetic to illustrate the potential viability of such a strategy and then provide a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model as a mathematical basis for why this may have been successful.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^111ohP6V]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The tolerability and safety of alternative dosing regimens also require clinical validation. The primary adverse events related to semaglutide and tirzepatide are transient gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation. Since less frequent dosing increases drug concentration variability in the body, side effects could increase. We show in the Data S1 that switching from q1wk to q2wk increases the peak-to-trough difference in drug concentration by 9% for tirzepatide and 34% for semaglutide. Naturally, this difference is increased if the decrease in dose frequency is paired with an increase in dose size (see the Data S1).

On the other hand, less frequent dosing could decrease side effects. Merely switching from q1wk to q2wk decreases the peak drug concentration by 28% for tirzepatide and 38% for semaglutide (see the Data S1). Furthermore, adverse events are more prominent during dose-titration, typically resolve within a few days, and, in the clinical experience of the second author, are more prominent immediately after administration and improve over time until the next dose. Hence, the adverse effects could decrease just by nature of administering fewer doses. Speculations aside, patients could still titrate their dose up gradually following standard dosing regimens before attempting any alternative regimens.

Despite the lack of reported clinical validation, there appears to be a growing trend of using GLP-1 products at reduced frequencies, even only once per month. Owing to the one-week PK half-life of semaglutide, Santi recently used PK simulations.

### Tirzepatide and health-related quality of life in adults with obesity or overweight: Results from the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 randomized trial [^111UJ1hp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Tirzepatide reduced weight significantly more than placebo in adults with obesity or overweight who had already achieved at least 5% weight reduction with a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention (randomized population) in the SURMOUNT-3, a phase 3, 72-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. This analysis evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with tirzepatide versus placebo treatment in the SURMOUNT-3 randomized population and selected subgroups.

- **Materials and methods**: The randomized population received placebo (N = 292) or tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose (N = 287) for 72 weeks. HRQoL was assessed from randomization to week 72 using the Short Form-36 Version 2 Health Survey acute form, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version, 5-level EQ-5D version Health State Index, EQ visual analogue scale, and the Patient Global Impression of Status (PGIS) for Physical Activity. In tirzepatide recipients, changes in HRQoL scores from randomization to week 72 were descriptively summarized by achievement of weight reduction thresholds, and for those with versus without physical function limitations at randomization (identified with PGIS for Physical Activity).

- **Results**: Tirzepatide was associated with significantly larger improvements than placebo in most HRQoL measures from randomization to 72 weeks. Improvements in tirzepatide recipients were generally numerically larger in those who met greater weight reduction thresholds. HRQoL score changes showed greater improvements for adults with versus without physical function limitations for all measures.

### Association between weight reduction achieved with tirzepatide and quality of life in adults with obesity: Results from the SURMOUNT-1 study [^114EqHsp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Psychosocial outcomes, including social, emotional, and mental health, are also important to patients with obesity. Previous research has demonstrated a consistent and significant impact of obesity on mental health, including when assessed using the SF‐36. Domains assessing psychosocial outcomes in the SF‐36v2 include vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The IWQOL‐Lite‐CT psychosocial domain includes content such as feeling self-conscious eating in social settings, feeling judged by others, and feeling frustrated shopping for clothes. This study demonstrated improvement in PRO scores assessing psychosocial function with tirzepatide treatment compared to placebo and a relationship between improved psychosocial function and weight reduction achieved with tirzepatide, with greater weight reduction associated with greater improvements. Similar to physical function, this relationship was consistent across psychosocial function self-reported assessment methods.

We also found decreased depressive symptoms with weight reduction, as assessed by PHQ-2. Participants with psychosocial function limitations at baseline had greater increases in psychosocial function scores versus participants without limitations. Therefore, clinicians may anticipate improvements in social, emotional, and mental health among patients who lose weight with tirzepatide, particularly among patients with impaired psychosocial health. However, effects on psychosocial functioning were generally smaller than physical functioning. We speculate that this is due to various factors influencing the relationship.

### Improved glycaemic and weight management are associated with better quality of life in people with type 2 diabetes treated with tirzepatide [^114NXcrW]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

**Association between weight loss and PROs**: Improvements from baseline to endpoint were observed for all PRO measures across all weight loss categories, confirming enhanced quality of life (QoL) after initiation of tirzepatide (pooled doses). Greater weight loss at endpoint was generally associated with larger improvements in PRO measures compared with lesser weight loss. Improvements in IWQOL-Lite-CT composite and total scores, IW-SP, and APPADL total scores increased as greater weight loss at endpoint was achieved; the largest improvements from baseline were observed in participants achieving ≥ 15% weight loss at endpoint. Higher DTSQc total scores at endpoint were observed for participants in the ≥ 10 to < 15% and ≥ 15% weight loss categories at endpoint compared with those in the lowest weight loss category (≥ 0 to < 5% weight loss from baseline). DTSQc hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia scores at endpoint tended to improve with increasing weight loss, although this trend was not consistent in the highest weight loss category (≥ 15% weight loss from baseline). Changes from baseline in EQ-5D-5L index scores were greater in the highest weight loss category (≥ 15% weight loss from baseline) compared with the lower weight loss categories (≥ 0 to < 5% and ≥ 5 to < 10%). Furthermore, changes from baseline in EQ VAS were greater with increasing weight loss at endpoint, indicating better self-rated health status for tirzepatide-treated participants achieving the greatest weight loss. Results of the ANCOVA analyses by weight loss category were consistent with these findings.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to -5: Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^114GPyAp]. Diabetes therapy (2025). Low credibility.

Tirzepatide was generally well tolerated in all five SURPASS trials. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within the gastrointestinal system organ class were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. No pattern of elevated hypoglycemia risk was observed with respect to body weight subgroups or tirzepatide dose, even in participants with a longer duration of diabetes > 10 years or BMI < 30 kg/m², who may have less insulin resistance. However, a tendency toward hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia was observed among participants enrolled in SURPASS-4, among whom concomitant sulfonylurea use was permitted, or among participants taking insulin in SURPASS-5. Otherwise, tirzepatide treatment was generally associated with low rates of hypoglycemia.

This analysis should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The SURPASS trials were neither designed nor powered to assess the differential efficacy of tirzepatide between these subgroups of participants. This was a post hoc analysis of five different SURPASS trials, and the analysis used unpooled data with several differences in trial characteristics and assessed a composite that was not controlled for multiplicity. Moreover, in some cases, the numbers in the subgroups were small. The analysis also does not account for social determinants of health, which may impact the glycemic and weight outcomes in this population. However, the large percentage of participants from SURPASS-1 through -5 included in the analysis and in previously published studies provides reassurance that the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide are consistent.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: The contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^117NKCSp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

- **Association between HbA1c reduction and weight change from baseline**:

In the placebo-controlled trials (S1 and S5), 12%–27% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide dose arms and placebo was estimated as being mediated through weight loss when given as monotherapy (S1) and 25%–45% when on the background of insulin with or without metformin (S5). When compared with semaglutide 1 mg (S2), 54%–71% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide dose arms and semaglutide 1 mg was estimated as being mediated through weight loss.

- **Figure 2**:

Mediation analyses for comparator-adjusted HbA1c reduction using weight loss as a factor at Week 40 in SURPASS-1, -2, and -5 studies. A forest plot illustrates the weight loss-dependent (WL-D) and weight loss-independent (WL-IND) effects of tirzepatide on change in HbA1c (mmol/mol) in (A) SURPASS-1 and -5, and (B) SURPASS-2 studies. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (efficacy analysis set) of each study included on-treatment data prior to the use of rescue therapy. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to tirzepatide 5, 10, 15 mg or comparator. The primary endpoint was 40 weeks. Percentage values represent the percent of HbA1c reduction mediated by weight loss.

### Changes in weight and glycemic control following obesity treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide by discontinuation status [^114YXwpy]. Obesity (2025). Low credibility.

Among those with available 1-year weight measurements (n = 6477), the mean (SD) percentage weight reduction at 1 year was 8.7% (9.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.5%–9.0%). Mean (SD) weight reduction was 3.6% (8.1%; 95% CI: 3.2%–4.1%) and 6.8% (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.3%–7.2%) for those who discontinued obesity pharmacotherapy early and late, respectively. Those who did not discontinue treatment lost a mean (SD) 11.9% (9.2%; 95% CI: 11.6%–12.2%) of weight (p < 0.001).

The mean (SD) weight reduction at 1 year was 7.7% (9.0%; 95% CI: 7.4%–7.9%) with semaglutide and 12.4% (10.5%; 95% CI: 11.9%–12.9%) with tirzepatide. Mean percentage weight reduction at 1 year by medication and obesity pharmacotherapy discontinuation status is presented in Table S2.

Among patients who did not discontinue obesity pharmacotherapy at year 1 (n = 3293 with available data at 1 year), the mean (SD) percentage reduction in weight was 10.9% (8.7%; 95% CI: 10.5%–11.2%) with semaglutide and 15.3% (10.0%; 95% CI: 14.6–16.0) with tirzepatide. Those who did not discontinue and were on a high maintenance dosage of an obesity medication (OM) (n = 967 with available weight at 1 year) lost a mean (SD) 14.7% (9.2%; 95% CI: 14.1%–15.3%) of weight at 1 year, including 13.7% (8.3%; 95% CI: 13.1%–14.3%) with semaglutide and 18.0% (10.8%; 95% CI: 16.6%–19.5%) with tirzepatide.

The cumulative distribution of categorical weight reduction at 1 year by obesity pharmacotherapy discontinuation status and medication is shown in Tables S3 and S4 and Figures S1 and S2.

### Weight reduction over time in tirzepatide-treated participants by early weight loss response: Post hoc analysis in SURMOUNT-1 [^114CsySa]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: The present post hoc analyses included participants treated with tirzepatide who were adherent to treatment, defined as receiving 75% or more of the assigned treatment doses, and had weight measurement data available at Weeks 0, 12, 24, and 72. Participants were categorized based on the 12-week response to tirzepatide (either pooling all tirzepatide doses or by dose) as follows: < 5% weight reduction at Week 12 (late responders) and ≥ 5% weight reduction at Week 12 (early responders).

The proportions of participants reaching weight reduction targets (≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, ≥ 20%, ≥ 25%) at Week 24 and Week 72 were summarized descriptively. Means (standard errors, SE) of the percent weight reduction trajectory were descriptively summarized by 12-week response subgroups, with early responders further defined by degrees of weight loss (late responders, early responders 5%–10% weight reduction, and early responders ≥ 10% weight reduction). All the analyses were performed using SAS.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity in people with type 2 diabetes (SURMOUNT-2): a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^111XbLk3]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) was published in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity.

- **Trial question**: What is the role of once-weekly tirzepatide in patients with obesity and T2DM?

- **Study design**: Multicenter, double-blind, RCT.

- **Population**: 627 patients (317 female, 310 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Change in bodyweight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with anti-obesity medications, DPP4 inhibitors, oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, or any injectable therapy for T2DM within 3 months before screening.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 312 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once weekly, continued for a total of 72 weeks)
	- n = 315 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72 (12.8% vs. 3.2%; ETD 9.6, 95% CI 8.1 to 11.1).

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and other weight loss drugs in overweight and obesity: A network meta-analysis [^114PWMSD]. Obesity (2024). High credibility.

This network meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and other weight loss drugs in the treatment of overweight and obesity.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials on tirzepatide, GLP-1 RA, and weight loss drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. A network meta-analysis was performed, drawing direct and indirect comparisons between treatment groups. Network diagrams and surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis were performed for primary (≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, absolute weight loss) and secondary outcomes and adverse effects.

- **Results**: Thirty-one randomized controlled trials, involving more than 35,000 patients, were included in this study. Tirzepatide 15mg ranked in the top three across weight-related parameters, glycemic profile (glycated hemoglobin), lipid parameters (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides), and blood pressure. Tirzepatide 15mg had the highest efficacy compared with placebo for achieving ≥ 15% weight loss (risk ratio 10.24, 95% CI: 6.42–16.34). As compared to placebo, tirzepatide and GLP-1 RA across all doses had significant increases in gastrointestinal adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: The superiority of tirzepatide and GLP-1 RA in inducing weight loss and their ability to target multiple metabolic parameters render them promising candidates in the treatment of patients with overweight and obesity.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to -5: Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^111nCA4F]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

Newer incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have the potential to substantially reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight with a low associated risk of hypoglycemia. This study aimed to assess the percentage of participants randomized to tirzepatide or comparator who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia across prespecified baseline characteristics: T2D duration (≤ 5, > 5–10, or > 10 years), sex, HbA1c (≤ 8.5% or > 8.5%), age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), and body mass index (< 30, 30 to < 35, or ≥ 35 kg/m²).

- **Methods**: This post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 through -5 evaluated adult study participants with T2D treated with tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg versus placebo or active comparator. Missing HbA1c and weight values were imputed from mixed models for repeated measures. Logistic regression was used to compare tirzepatide versus comparators for the percentage of participants reaching the composite endpoint.

- **Results**: Across subgroups, the composite endpoint was achieved by a median of approximately 30%, 45%, and 54% of participants who received tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively; this was consistent across baseline subgroups, except that a greater percentage of women than men achieved the composite endpoint. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature.

- **Conclusions**: In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide achieved the composite outcome of glycemic control and weight loss with no hypoglycemia, irrespective of baseline characteristics. This may help clinicians as they consider treatment options for managing T2D.

### Weight reduction over time in tirzepatide-treated participants by early weight loss response: Post hoc analysis in SURMOUNT-1 [^1168q3iF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

SURMOUNT-1 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes. Participants were assigned to receive once-weekly tirzepatide or placebo. All participants received regular lifestyle counseling from a dietitian or qualified health professional to help them adhere to healthful, balanced meals, with a deficit of 500 calories per day and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Tirzepatide or placebo was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg once weekly and was increased in 2.5 mg increments every 4 weeks through the 20-week dose escalation period. The target dose was achieved at Week 4 (5 mg), Week 12 (10 mg), or Week 20 (15 mg) based on the randomized allocation. The trial protocol and results have been previously published. The trial adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, receiving approval from an independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each trial site. All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study.

Body weight measurements were collected in a consistent manner using a calibrated electronic scale capable of measuring weight in kilograms (kg) to one decimal place. All weights for a given participant were measured at specified intervals in a fasting state using the same scale, whenever possible, at approximately the same time in the morning.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: The contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^113bB1jC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, the use of post-hoc analysis introduces potential biases, as these analyses were not pre-specified and were conducted after examining the data. This approach can lead to findings that may not be replicable in other datasets.

Secondly, the mediation analysis employed in this study is inherently a statistical model. While it provides insights into the potential mechanisms linking weight loss and glycaemia, it relies on certain assumptions that, if unmet, could compromise the validity of the results.

Lastly, it was not possible to quantify the direct impact of weight loss on glycaemic control within these studies. The inability to isolate this effect means that other confounding factors may have influenced the observed changes in glycaemic control, limiting the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the relationship between weight loss and blood sugar levels.

Furthermore, in the SURPASS trials, we did not collect other factors that may affect both weight loss and improvement of glycaemia, such as food intake and dietary habits. These limitations highlight the need for cautious interpretation of the findings and suggest areas for future research to address these gaps.

It is also important to consider that the weight loss observed in these trials represents overall loss of weight without differentiating between the relative contributions of fat deposits, which have different metabolic impacts. In the paper by Heise et al, tirzepatide was shown to trigger primarily loss of fat versus fat-free mass.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability and weight reduction associated with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight with and without type 2 diabetes in the SURMOUNT-1 to -4 trials [^111mzJSM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, strategies can be implemented to mitigate gastrointestinal side effects. These can include dietary strategies, slower dose escalation schemes, or the use of temporary medication to manage gastrointestinal side effects during dose escalation. In particular, dietary strategies may include eating smaller meals (splitting daily meals), stopping eating when feeling full, avoiding fatty foods, and eating bland foods.

It has been hypothesized that gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) might contribute to weight reduction due to altered dietary choices and decreased food intake due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In this post hoc analysis, weight reduction with tirzepatide was similar in participants who did or did not report gastrointestinal AEs at the primary endpoints across the SURMOUNT-1 to -4 trials. Weight reduction was also similar over time between participants who did not report gastrointestinal AEs and those reporting nausea alone or any gastrointestinal AE in the SURMOUNT-1 and -2 trials. Of note, in this exploratory analysis, there was a trend suggesting that nausea alone, or nausea/vomiting/diarrhea (N/V/D), may be associated with a slight increase of approximately 2% in weight reduction.

Mediation analyses suggested that gastrointestinal AEs, including N/V/D and dyspepsia, were associated with up to 3.1% of total weight reduction with tirzepatide treatment across the SURMOUNT-1 to -4 trials, regardless of the treatment dose. Overall, while gastrointestinal AEs did not constitute the primary mechanism of weight reduction, it appears that they may have had a slight relationship to the total effect. In particular, participants with nausea had a trend towards more body weight reduction than participants without any gastrointestinal AEs.

### Evaluating the effectiveness and safety of various tirzepatide dosages in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112pJqT1]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Excess body fat, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid levels signal type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Globally, 536.6 million people suffer from DM2, projected to rise to 783.2 million by 2045. Obesity fuels insulin resistance and DM2 development, with weight loss significantly improving glycemic control. Tirzepatide (TZP), a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, proves highly effective in controlling hyperglycemia, stimulating insulin secretion, and promoting weight loss. TZP holds promise as a treatment for DM2, surpassing insulin and GLP-1. The study aimed to meticulously assess the safety and efficacy of various doses, offering insights into optimal therapeutic strategies for managing DM2.

- **Methods**: This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of TZP in treating DM2. The primary focus of the inclusion criteria was on trials comparing TZP with a placebo until November 23, 2023, excluding patients with certain comorbidities. Data extraction included key parameters, and outcomes were assessed for HbA1c levels, weight changes, fasting serum glucose levels, and various adverse events. Quality assessment utilized the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias tool, and a network meta-analysis explored outcomes across different TZP dosages.

- **Results**: This meta-analysis systematically reviewed ten studies on TZP for DM2. Results revealed significant reductions in HbA1c with TZP 10 mg (19%) and TZP 15 mg (31%) compared to TZP 5 mg (MD: -0.19 and MD: -0.32, respectively). Additionally, weight reduction was notable for TZP 10 mg (MD: -1.96) and TZP 15.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regarding glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^115ZYjpA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

In human subjects, international phase 1 studies indicated a linear relationship between the dose of tirzepatide and peak circulating concentrations (C max), a time from injection to C max of 1–2 days, and an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days. In patients with type 2 diabetes over 29 days, body weight was reduced by up to 3 kg, fasting plasma glucose was reduced by up to 3 mmol/l, and plasma glucose following an oral glucose load was dose-dependently reduced, while insulin secretory responses were dose-dependently increased. Similar pharmacokinetic and initial pharmacodynamic data were collected in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Neither renal functional impairment nor compromised liver function changes the pharmacokinetic behavior of tirzepatide. Based on these findings, the dosage of tirzepatide will likely not have to be changed in chronic kidney disease or with reduced liver function, but dedicated clinical studies in such patients are not yet available.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity [^1128YgBB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) was published by Ania M. Jastreboff and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study addresses obesity and investigates the role of high-dose tirzepatide in people with obesity. The study design was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study population included 1,273 patients: 861 females and 412 males.

Inclusion criteria required participants to be adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m² or > 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes. Key exclusion criteria were diabetes; a change in body weight > 5 kg within 90 days before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; and treatment with a medication that promotes weight loss within 90 days before screening.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 630 received high-dose tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 15 mg once weekly for a total of 72 weeks).
	- n = 643 received a matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks.

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in weight reduction at week 72 (20.9% vs. 3.1%; AD 17.8%, 95% CI 16.3 to 19.3).
	- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (90.9% vs. 34.5%; AD 56.4%, 95% CI 22.93 to 89%).

To evaluate late (week 40 or 42; hereafter, week 40/42) metabolic outcomes by early glycemic response (< 20% or ≥ 20% fasting serum glucose [FSG] reduction at week 4) or weight response (< 5% or ≥ 5% weight reduction at week 8), respectively, in tirzepatide-treated participants with type 2 diabetes in the SURPASS trials.

- **Research design and methods**: This post hoc analysis used pooled data across trials. Baseline characteristics, change from baseline to week 40/42 for efficacy parameters, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) were described and analyzed by early response in terms of FSG (SURPASS-1 to -4; n = 3,676) or weight (SURPASS-1 to -5; n = 4,121) in the efficacy and safety analysis set, respectively.

- **Results**: Early responders in FSG (50%) were younger, with higher glycemic parameters and lower weight at baseline. Early responders in weight (31%) had lower glycemic parameters and weight at baseline, and a greater percentage were women and White. Early versus nonearly responders in FSG or weight achieved better HbA1c (-2.6% vs. -2.0% or -2.5% vs. -2.2%, respectively) and weight (-11% vs. -10% or -15% vs. -8%, respectively) responses at week 40/42 and greater improvements in blood pressure and lipid profile. Nonearly responders also had clinically meaningful HbA1c and weight reductions with all tirzepatide doses. The incidence of GI AEs (generally mild to moderate events) decreased over time and was, in general, comparable between early and nonearly responders.

### Incretin mimetics for weight loss forgive nonadherence [^112L3xe6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility

These limitations notwithstanding, the preponderance of evidence suggests that semaglutide and tirzepatide maintain strong weight loss efficacy in spite of missed doses. In particular, it appears that occasional missed doses are very unlikely to nullify treatment with incretin mimetics. The assumption that p = 80% is necessary for significant weight loss is likely too pessimistic and needs revision. This contrasts with "unforgiving" drugs in which missing just 10% of doses can cause treatment failure. Our results suggest that dosing regimens can be liberalized to reduce drug costs, mitigate side effects, and ultimately improve long-term treatment persistence without a significant compromise in weight loss efficacy.

This work is not intended to discourage patients and healthcare providers from striving for high adherence. Rather, the predicted forgiveness of incretin mimetics is heartening news that treatment should not be abandoned if patients cannot consistently take at least p = 80% of their prescribed doses. Indeed, our analysis predicts that this new generation of medications is a powerful tool for combating obesity, perhaps even if patients take only half of their prescribed doses.

### Improved glycaemic and weight management are associated with better quality of life in people with type 2 diabetes treated with tirzepatide [^113YFZf1]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Limitations of these analyses include the administration of PRO measures in a clinical trial setting, which may not reflect those observed in a real-world setting where people with T2D may have less contact with or support from HCPs. Furthermore, the open-label study design of SURPASS-2, -3, and -4 may have influenced participants to over- or underestimate their treatment assessments based on their beliefs regarding their assigned treatment. Although PRO changes were measured concurrently with changes in HbA1c (%) and weight in each trial, not all measurements were taken at the same time point across trials (e.g. Week 40 or 52). Additionally, weight loss had not plateaued in the SURPASS-1 to -5 Phase 3 clinical trials; therefore, continued weight reduction may have occurred, and PROs could have improved further with a longer follow-up period.

Furthermore, the health-related QoL outcomes associated with tirzepatide in this analysis were limited to the PRO instruments used in the clinical trials. Additional factors influencing health-related QoL, such as satiety, vitality, lack of worry, and overall mental health, were not captured. Lastly, the sample sizes in some combination HbA1c (%) target achieved/weight loss from baseline categories in the three-way analyses were low; therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity in people with type 2 diabetes (SURMOUNT-2): A double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^11198zw8]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-2, which investigated tirzepatide 15 mg, was published by W Timothy Garvey and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is pertinent to the diseases of diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity.

In the SURMOUNT-2 study, the research questions were concerned with the role of once-weekly tirzepatide in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

- **Study design**: The design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study enrolled 626 patients, consisting of 318 females and 308 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Participants were adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 27 kg/m² and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels between 7–10%.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Excluded were individuals with a weight change of > 5 kg within three months prior to screening, those with previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity, and those under treatment with anti-obesity medications, DPP4 inhibitors, oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, or any injectable therapy for T2DM within three months before screening.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included:
	- 311 patients receiving tirzepatide, starting at 2.5 mg subcutaneously once weekly. This dose was increased by 2.5 mg every four weeks to a maintenance dose of 15 mg once weekly, continued for a total of 72 weeks.
	- 315 patients receiving a matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in body weight was observed at week 72, with a reduction of 14.7% compared to 3.2% in the placebo group (Estimated Treatment Difference [ETD] 11.6, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 10.1 to 13).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5%.

### Body weight reduction in women treated with tirzepatide by reproductive stage: A post hoc analysis from the SURMOUNT program [^113Jn22s]. Obesity (2025). High credibility.

In midlife, women experience an average annual weight increase of 0.7 kg (1.5 lb), and by 2030, it is projected that approximately 75% of US women will be living with obesity or overweight. Moreover, during the peri- and post-menopause stages, estrogen deficiency affects lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, insulin resistance, and body fat distribution, which may lead to increased cardiometabolic risk, with the postmenopausal state potentially further increasing this risk. Approximately 75% of individuals undergoing medical weight management for obesity and excess weight are women. The clinical treatment of women requires particular attention to factors such as reproductive stage, especially concerning the influence of menopause on the effectiveness of treatment responses. Preclinical research has supported the central anorexigenic effects of estrogen, which suggest that fluctuations in estrogen levels, including during the menopausal transition, may affect downstream appetitive signaling and predispose women to weight changes.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea (in the US). In the global phase 3 SURMOUNT clinical trials investigating tirzepatide in people with obesity or overweight, with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), participants treated with tirzepatide at all doses studied demonstrated robust body weight reductions ranging from 13% to 6%, as well as improvements in other cardiometabolic parameters.

### Tirzepatide and health-related quality of life in adults with obesity or overweight: Results from the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 randomized trial [^112zZPLo]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Interventions that can improve physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among individuals with obesity are urgently needed. Tirzepatide is a first-in-class, once-weekly single molecule that activates the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors. It is approved in many countries, including the United States, as an adjunct to diet and physical activity for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. It is also used for chronic weight management in adults with obesity (initial body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m²), or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.

In the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled SURMOUNT-3 trial, adults with obesity or overweight with at least one obesity-related complication (excluding diabetes) achieved substantial weight loss of approximately 18%, with 87.5% achieving ≥ 5% weight reduction after 72 weeks of treatment with tirzepatide. These participants had already achieved ≥ 5% weight reduction following a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention before losing the additional weight while on tirzepatide.

We evaluated the effects of tirzepatide on a number of patient-reported HRQoL outcomes after 72 weeks of tirzepatide treatment in adults enrolled in SURMOUNT-3. In addition, we assessed, in post-hoc analyses, the association between achievement of weight reduction thresholds with tirzepatide and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and changes in HRQoL among SURMOUNT-3 tirzepatide-treated participants.

### Weight reduction over time in tirzepatide-treated participants by early weight loss response: Post hoc analysis in SURMOUNT-1 [^111F9Zhz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, this post hoc analysis of SURMOUNT‐1 trial data demonstrated that the vast majority (90%) of those who had less than a 5% weight reduction by Week 12 of tirzepatide treatment ultimately had a clinically meaningful (≥ 5%) weight reduction by Week 72; furthermore, being on a higher dose of tirzepatide was associated with greater weight reduction, even for late responders. The average time to reach clinically meaningful weight reduction was approximately 25 weeks for the late responders. Therefore, it is reasonable to continue tirzepatide treatment for longer than 12 weeks, irrespective of the initial weight change, to more fully assess the weight reduction efficacy of tirzepatide for clinical decision-making and to allow additional patients to achieve clinically meaningful weight reduction.

### Tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1131JNcQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The SURMOUNT-5 study, published by Louis J Aronne and colleagues in 2025 in the journal "The New England Journal of Medicine", related to obesity. The trial question was: what is the effect of tirzepatide compared to semaglutide in patients with obesity? The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The population included 750 patients (485 female, 265 male) with adult obesity, excluding those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Key exclusion criteria were diabetes, previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity, treatment with a medication for weight reduction, or a GLP-1 receptor agonist in the past 90 days, and a change in body weight of more than 5 kg in the past 90 days.

- **Interventions**:
	- Tirzepatide (n = 374) administered at a dose of 10 mg or 15 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 72 weeks
	- Semaglutide (n = 376) administered at a dose of 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 72 weeks

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in weight reduction at week 72 (20.2% vs. 13.7%; MD 6.5, 95% CI 4.9 to 8.1)

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference at week 72 (18.4 cm vs. 13 cm; MD 5.4, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.1)
	- Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (81.6% vs. 60.5%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5)
	- Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 25% (31.6% vs. 16.1%; RR 2, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.6)

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^112YdmT5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease and is considered a global epidemic, with high associations with, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), several malignancies, chronic kidney disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and mental disorders. Thus, the prevention and treatment of obesity are important to improve healthcare outcomes, quality of life, and decrease overall healthcare costs. Currently, treatment for overweight and obesity includes healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral counseling, prescription medications, and surgery. Given its detrimental effects on individual health and its widespread impact on society, there is great interest in the development of therapeutics to combat obesity and T2DM and their associated sequelae.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as a prominent treatment for T2DM with a notable weight loss effect via delayed gastric emptying, glucagon inhibition, and stimulation of central receptors that modulate appetite suppression and energy expenditure. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved GLP-1RAs are for glycaemic control, including dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide/insulin, and semaglutide, or weight loss, such as semaglutide and liraglutide. However, tirzepatide, a recent agent that has gained popularity, has shown similar, if not greater, glycaemic control and weight loss in patients with obesity or T2DM. Its mechanism of action involves dual agonism of the GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^114FhGQ9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Percentage change in body weight**: The mean on-treatment change in body weight was −5.9% (95% CI, −6.0% to −5.8%) for tirzepatide vs. −3.6% (95% CI, −3.7% to −3.4%) for semaglutide at 3 months, −10.1% (95% CI, −10.4% to −9.9%) vs. −5.8% (95% CI, −6.0% to −5.5%) at 6 months, and −15.3% (95% CI, −16.0% to −14.5%) vs. −8.3% (95% CI, −9% to −7.6%) at 12 months. After adjusting for residual confounding, the absolute difference in weight loss between tirzepatide and semaglutide was −2.4% (95% CI, −2.5% to −2.2), −4.3% (95% CI, −4.7% to −4.0%), and −6.9% (95% CI, −7.9% to −5.8%) at 3, 6, and 12 months receiving treatment, respectively.

- **Treatment effects comparing tirzepatide to semaglutide for all patients, patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and patients without T2D**: Points represent point estimates; the whiskers represent 95% CIs. Panels A-C contain hazard ratios for achieving 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss for patients receiving tirzepatide vs. semaglutide among propensity score-matched populations. Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicate a higher likelihood of reaching the weight loss threshold with tirzepatide. Panels D-F contain absolute differences in body weight change at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for patients receiving tirzepatide vs. semaglutide among propensity score-matched populations still receiving treatment at the time point. Negative differences indicate greater weight loss with tirzepatide.

### Tirzepatide reduces appetite, energy intake, and fat mass in people with type 2 diabetes [^112FUxfo]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the effects of tirzepatide on body composition, appetite, and energy intake, a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study was conducted. The study assessed the effects of tirzepatide 15 mg (N = 45), semaglutide 1 mg (N = 44), and placebo (N = 28) on body weight and composition, appetite, and energy intake at baseline and week 28.

Tirzepatide treatment demonstrated significant reductions in body weight compared with placebo and semaglutide, resulting in greater fat mass reduction. Tirzepatide and semaglutide significantly reduced appetite compared to placebo. However, appetite scores and energy intake reductions did not differ between tirzepatide and semaglutide.

Differences in energy intake during ad libitum lunch were not sufficient to explain the different weight outcomes. Further evaluation is needed to assess mechanistic differences related to tirzepatide actions on 24-hour energy intake, substrate utilization, and energy expenditure.

### Reduction of prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome with tirzepatide: A post hoc analysis from the SURPASS Clinical Trial Program [^1156inyz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). High credibility.

Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the co-occurrence of interrelated cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Once-weekly tirzepatide is approved in the US and EU for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. In the SURPASS clinical trial program for T2D, tirzepatide demonstrated greater improvements in glycemic control, body weight reduction, and other cardiometabolic risk factors compared to placebo, subcutaneous semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine. This post hoc analysis assessed the effect of tirzepatide use on the prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome across SURPASS 1–5.

- **Methods**: Metabolic syndrome was defined as having ≥ 3 of 5 criteria according to the US National Cholesterol Education Program: Adult Treatment Panel III. Analyses were based on on-treatment data at the primary endpoint from patients adherent to treatment (taking ≥ 75% of the study drug). A logistic regression model, with metabolic syndrome status as the response variable, metabolic syndrome status at the baseline visit as an adjustment, and randomized treatment as a fixed explanatory effect, was used. The effect of tirzepatide use on the prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome by categorical weight loss, background medication, and gender were assessed.

- **Results**: In SURPASS, the prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome at baseline was 67–88% across treatment groups, with reductions at the primary endpoint to between 38–6%.

### Weight reduction over time in tirzepatide-treated participants by early weight loss response: Post hoc analysis in surmount-1 [^112Tg84V]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The objective was to assess weight reduction at weeks 24 and 72 in participants treated with tirzepatide based on weight reduction response after 12 weeks of treatment in the SURMOUNT-1 trial.

This post hoc analysis included participants treated with tirzepatide who received ≥ 75% of the assigned treatment doses and had weight measurements at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 72. Participants were categorized based on the 12-week response to tirzepatide: late responders (< 5% weight reduction at week 12) or early responders (≥ 5% weight reduction at week 12).

A total of 1,545 participants were included in the analyses, with 278 (18%) categorized as late responders and 1,267 (82%) categorized as early responders. At baseline, late responders compared to early responders were more likely to be male (45% vs. 30%) and had higher body weight (110.2 vs. 103.6 kg), body mass index (BMI) (39.1 vs. 37.7 kg/m²), and waist circumference (117.5 vs. 113.4 cm). At the end of dose titration, week 24, 194 (70%) late responders achieved ≥ 5% body weight reduction. At week 72, 250 (90%) late responders achieved ≥ 5% body weight reduction. The mean time to reach 5% weight reduction for late responders was 24.8 ± 12.7 weeks. Higher doses of tirzepatide were associated with higher proportions of participants achieving various weight reduction thresholds at weeks 24 and 72.

Among late responders to tirzepatide, the vast majority (90%) achieved 5% or more weight reduction at week 72. This finding suggests that extending treatment well beyond 12 weeks may allow additional benefits in weight reduction.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity [^111KHr1A]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) was published in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study pertains to obesity. The trial question focused on the role of mid-dose tirzepatide in adults with obesity.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 1,279 patients (863 female, 416 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Diabetes; a change in body weight > 5 kg within 90 days before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with medication promoting weight loss within 90 days before screening.
- **Interventions**:
	- n = 636 received mid-dose tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly, increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once weekly for a total of 72 weeks)
	- n = 643 received placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks).
- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in weight reduction at week 72 (19.5% vs. 3.1%; absolute difference 16.4%, 95% CI 14.8 to 17.9).
- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (88.9% vs. 34.5%; absolute difference 54.4%, 95% CI 22.12 to 86.6).

### Tirzepatide was associated with improved health-related quality of life in adults with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes: Results from the phase 3 SURMOUNT-2 trial [^1156CCMR]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are chronic conditions of public health concern with rising global prevalence. Both conditions are linked in their pathogenesis, which can influence disease state progression. Obesity and overweight are significant risk factors for developing T2D, and conversely, a vast majority of individuals with T2D are affected by obesity or overweight. Incretin-based treatments for T2D and obesity result in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion, appetite suppression, and delayed gastric emptying, thereby leading to improved glycemic control and bodyweight reduction.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It is approved in several countries, including the United States, as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with T2D and in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess bodyweight and maintain weight reduction long-term in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbid condition. The SURMOUNT phase 3 program evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for chronic weight management. In the SURMOUNT-2 trial (NCT04657003), tirzepatide treatment led to clinically meaningful bodyweight reduction versus placebo among participants living with obesity or overweight and T2D. The mean percent change from baseline in bodyweight at week 72 was −12.8% with tirzepatide 10 mg, −14.7% with tirzepatide 15 mg, and −3.2% with placebo.

### Tirzepatide for the maintenance of body weight reduction: Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN [^113HwhyV]. Obesity (2025). Low credibility.

SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reducing the tirzepatide dose and/or continuing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) versus placebo in maintaining body weight (BW) reduction achieved with tirzepatide MTD.

- **Methods**: This Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 52-week clinical trial is in progress comparing treatment with once weekly tirzepatide (5 mg and/or MTD of 15 mg or 10 mg) versus placebo in achieving BW reduction maintenance from the initial 60-week open-label weight-loss period on tirzepatide MTD, in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with ≥ 1 obesity-related comorbidity, excluding type 2 diabetes). The primary endpoint is percent maintenance of BW reduction achieved during the weight-loss period at week 112 among those who reached a BW plateau (i.e. < 5% BW change) between weeks 48 and 60.

- **Results**: Participants are mostly female (65%) with a mean ± SD age of 47 ± 13 years, BW 114 ± 27 kg, BMI 40 ± 8 kg/m², and waist circumference 119 ± 18 cm.

- **Conclusions**: The SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN trial will evaluate whether reducing or continuing the tirzepatide dose as a long-term treatment option may help maintain the reduced BW initially achieved with tirzepatide MTD versus switching to placebo. Combined, this study may provide additional evidence to help tailor patient-centered strategies for maintenance of BW reduction in adults living with obesity.

- **Trial registration**: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06047548.

### Cardiometabolic risk effects of weight-loss medications: An updated network meta-analysis [^112KbJxN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

As a result of the withdrawal of lorcaserin and the approval of tirzepatide and semaglutide, we conducted a new network meta-analysis to assess the overall and comparative effects of six US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved weight-loss medications on the cardiometabolic risk profile of obese adults. Our aim was to determine which of these medications is most effective in improving cardiometabolic risk factors.

We searched our databases for randomized clinical trials of the effects of weight-loss drugs approved by the FDA as of April 2024, in obese adults taking them for one year or more, compared with placebo or between the agents. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses, with results reported as weighted and standardized mean differences.

A total of 31 trials with 24,792 participants were included in this network meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate in most cases using the GRADE approach. Compared with placebo, the weight-loss drugs resulted in moderate reductions in fasting glucose of 11.12 mg/dL (95% CI, -13.70 to -8.53), glycosylated haemoglobin of 0.60% (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.45), and waist circumference of 5.28 cm (95% CI, -6.57 to -4.00), with minimal or modest benefits in blood pressure and cholesterol profile. Additionally, tirzepatide was found to be relatively effective overall in comparisons between drugs.

This study concludes that the six FDA-approved weight-loss drugs had a moderately beneficial effect on the cardiometabolic risk profile. In general, tirzepatide was more effective than other pharmaceuticals in improving cardiometabolic factors.

### What are community perspectives and experiences around GLP-1 receptor agonist medications for weight loss? A cross-sectional survey study in the UK [^111sAzWR]. BMJ Public Health (2025). Low credibility.

Given the recent publication of the final draft guidance from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approving tirzepatide as a treatment for obesity, understanding attitudes around GLP-1RAs is critical, as it could help inform strategies to attain fair and effective roll-out. Adherence to pharmacological treatments is influenced by a complex interplay of personal attitudes, social and cultural beliefs, as well as self-efficacy. This growth in GLP-1RA popularity has been accompanied by a notable rise in media coverage, highlighting various aspects of their effectiveness, usability, availability, risks, and costs. Such media attention has undoubtedly influenced patients' knowledge and attitudes toward GLP-1RAs and towards obesity itself.

Self-carers' understanding of obesity and their knowledge of and attitudes towards available management options are critical factors in shaping their treatment decisions. Having concerns about potential adverse effects has been linked to reduced adherence, whereas confidence in a medication's efficacy and trust in healthcare providers has been shown to improve adherence. Additionally, the growing emphasis on socio-legal frameworks that promote personal autonomy has further highlighted the importance of incorporating the patient's voice and their preferences in healthcare decision-making. This shift reflects the broader recognition of the patient as an active self-carer and active participant in their health and well-being journey, influencing both treatment choices and outcomes.

### Real-world use and effectiveness of tirzepatide among individuals without type 2 diabetes: Results from the Optum Market Clarity database [^114BFSWt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Individuals in the effectiveness cohort, starting with a mean baseline weight of 242.7 lbs, achieved a mean (SD) weight reduction of 27.7 (16.7) lbs at 6 months, equating to an 11.9% reduction. Similarly, starting from a mean baseline BMI of 38.9 kg/m², a mean (SD) BMI reduction of 4.5 (2.7) kg/m² was observed, representing an 11.8% reduction. Six months post-index, 85.8% of individuals achieved a weight reduction of ≥ 5%, 61.5% achieved ≥ 10%, 31.0% achieved ≥ 15%, and 10.5% achieved ≥ 20%.

- **Effectiveness cohort**: Adults (≥ 18 years) without T2D diagnosis, HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and no use of anti-diabetes medications (except metformin) met the AOM eligibility criteria. These individuals were GLP-1 RA-naive, persistent on tirzepatide for ≥ 6 months, and had weight and BMI measurements available at baseline and at 6 months post-index. AOM refers to anti-obesity medications; BMI stands for body mass index; GLP-1 RA represents glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; HbA1c indicates glycated haemoglobin; T2D signifies type 2 diabetes.

### Body weight reduction in women treated with tirzepatide by reproductive stage: a post hoc analysis from the SURMOUNT program [^111JVCKV]. Obesity (2025). High credibility.

Across all subgroups in SURMOUNT‐1, 97% to 98% of participants achieved body weight loss of ≥ 5% with tirzepatide, compared to 29% to 33% with placebo. Additionally, 69%–73% and 45%–50% of tirzepatide‐treated participants achieved body weight loss of ≥ 20% and ≥ 25%, respectively. A significantly greater proportion of participants from all subgroups treated with tirzepatide exceeded all weight‐loss thresholds compared to those receiving placebo.

- **Categorical weight‐loss outcomes**: By reproductive stage subgroup in SURMOUNT‐1, data are the proportion of participants who met weight‐reduction thresholds at the primary endpoint. Logistic regression with missing values imputed by mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) at the primary endpoint was used to assess the proportion of participants who met weight‐reduction thresholds. Data from the tirzepatide 15‐mg arm from SURMOUNT‐1 are shown versus placebo. The denominator used to calculate the proportion of participants achieving weight‐loss goals was the number of participants in imputed data. # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.001 vs. placebo.

Overall, reductions in body weight and the proportion of participants achieving weight‐loss thresholds were similar in SURMOUNT‐3 and SURMOUNT‐4 across all reproductive stage subgroups.

- **Change from baseline in waist circumference**: In SURMOUNT‐1 at Week 72, significantly greater reductions in waist circumference from baseline, ranging from 20 to 22 cm, were observed in all reproductive stage subgroups with tirzepatide compared to placebo (4–5 cm; p < 0.001 for all).

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^1172fhpF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

An important note for GLP‐1 GI AEs is that standard approaches may not correctly characterize the incidence of GI AEs given the mechanism of action of GLP‐1 RAs, which decrease gastric emptying and suppress appetite to reduce overall food intake. Rather than vomiting, nausea was reported more frequently as the reason for treatment discontinuation in the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials. However, a gradual dose escalation may be able to increase tolerability and reduce the frequency of GI AEs. There has been some speculation on the contribution of GI AEs to the weight reduction seen in GLP‐1 RAs, but mediation analysis suggests a minimal contribution. Overall, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well tolerated, and AEs are deemed mild to moderate in severity.

### Use of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Scientific evidence and practical aspects [^113iarUv]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Overweight and obesity are two of the main modifiable risk factors related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They are strongly associated with insulin resistance, a key feature in the pathogenesis of T2DM, and a barrier to achieving good glycemic control.

Participant inclusion criteria in the SURPASS clinical trial program included a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m², or ≥ 23 kg/m², with stable weight (≤ 5% fluctuation) for the previous 3 months. The mean baseline body weight ranged from 86 to 95 kg, and the mean BMI ranged from 31.9 to 34.2 kg/m² across the five studies.

Tirzepatide showed clinically meaningful weight reductions with an average weight loss ranging from 6.2 to 12.9 kg. Among participants receiving tirzepatide 15 mg:

- **Weight loss of at least 5%**: Achieved by up to 88% (range, 77–88%)
- **Weight loss of at least 10%**: Achieved by up to 69% (range, 47–69%)
- **Weight loss of at least 15%**: Achieved by up to 43% (range, 27–43%)

Tirzepatide was included in the recent consensus report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) as a drug with very high efficacy in weight reduction.

Weight reduction is associated with improvement in HbA1c and a decreased risk of weight-related complications, with a higher extent of loss related to better outcomes. A body weight reduction of up to 5–10% confers metabolic improvement, whereas a weight loss of ≥ 10% can have disease-modifying effects.
