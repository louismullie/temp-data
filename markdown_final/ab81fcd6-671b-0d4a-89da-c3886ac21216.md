## Question

What's causes intermittent dull achy pain in the anterior chest, upper back, radiating to c8 dermatomal pattern

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes intermittent, dull, achy pain in the anterior chest and upper back that radiates in a C8 dermatomal pattern. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and whether a C8 radiculopathy can plausibly explain anterior chest and upper back pain. Then, I should verify how often cervical radiculopathy presents with atypical chest pain and whether C8-specific patterns are described. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis, especially thoracic outlet syndrome and cardiac causes, and check for confounders like prefixed plexus or T1 involvement. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline a practical diagnostic approach with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy and clinical plausibility. The C8 nerve root contributes to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and supplies the ulnar aspect of the forearm, ring and little fingers, and intrinsic hand muscles; classic C8 radiculopathy often presents with ulnar paresthesias and hand intrinsic weakness, and pain can radiate to the shoulder and scapular region, which aligns with "upper back" involvement [^4852b942] [^750cbfbb]. Wait, let me verify the chest component: cervical radiculopathy can indeed produce referred anterior chest pain, with large series showing anterior chest pain in about 17–18% of cervical radiculopathy patients, including atypical C7 presentations with deep breast or chest pain, supporting the concept that lower cervical roots can refer pain anteriorly [^91292b60] [^4852b942] [^7332d30c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how often C8 specifically causes chest pain. The strongest chest-pain signal in the literature is tied to C7 radiculopathy rather than C8, with atypical chest presentations reported in C6–7 cohorts, whereas C8 case series emphasize hand weakness and ulnar paresthesias without highlighting chest pain as a frequent feature [^4852b942] [^750cbfbb]. But wait, what if the pain distribution reflects a dynatomal pattern rather than a strict dermatome? Selective nerve root stimulation studies show that pain and paresthesia distributions can differ from classic dermatomal maps, so a C8-mediated pain referral to the upper back and anterior chest remains anatomically plausible even if less common than C7 patterns [^4e988cfd].

> Next, I should review the differential and actively exclude mimics. Thoracic outlet syndrome can produce neck, chest wall, and ulnar hand symptoms and is often non-dermatomal, but it lacks the objective sensory or motor deficits and reflex changes typical of radiculopathy, and diagnosis is largely clinical and exclusionary, which means I need to check for TOS with provocative maneuvers while remembering it can confound the picture [^94b7db94] [^8b0a38c4]. I need to ensure we do not miss cardiac etiologies; however, positional, fleeting, or sharply localized chest pain is less likely to be ischemic, and the AHA/ACC guidance emphasizes that point tenderness and positional pain reduce the likelihood of myocardial ischemia, though I should still screen risk factors and consider ECG when appropriate [^22b11033] [^a57daec7]. But wait, what if the C8 symptoms are actually reflecting T1 pathology or a prefixed plexus? Case series and reports document that C8-predominant presentations can occasionally reflect C7 or T1 lesions or even thoracic disc herniation, so I should keep those anatomic variants in mind if the clinical picture does not fit cleanly at C7–T1 [^bb98a391] [^98158477].

> I will now examine the symptom pattern more closely to refine the likelihood. The description of dull, achy, intermittent pain with radiation to the C8 territory fits cervical radicular pain, which can present with a dull background ache superimposed by lancinating components, and cervical radiculopathy commonly includes neck, scapular, and arm pain with dermatomal or quasi-dermatomal spread, supporting a radicular mechanism rather than purely somatic referred pain [^360fd34c] [^91292b60]. Let me reconsider the chest component: while C7 is the classic culprit for chest pain, the brachial plexus and sympathetic contributions create sufficient overlap that a C8-mediated anterior chest referral is reasonable, especially if the upper back pain localizes to the scapular region and the hand symptoms align with C8 [^4b679757] [^750cbfbb].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and confirm what tests meaningfully change management. I need to check for focal neurologic deficits in the C8 myotome and sensory loss in the ring and little fingers, and I should perform Spurling's, neck distraction, and upper-limb tension testing to reproduce or relieve symptoms, recognizing these maneuvers have better specificity than sensitivity [^9a650cd4] [^b4e09769]. If the diagnosis remains uncertain or if surgery is contemplated, MRI of the cervical spine is appropriate to identify foraminal stenosis or disc herniation at C7–T1, and electrodiagnostics can help distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathies or plexopathies, particularly when imaging is equivocal or symptoms are atypical [^839a535e] [^c05475dd]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not over-ordering imaging; in the absence of red flags or progressive deficits, a trial of conservative care is reasonable given the favorable natural history of many cervical radiculopathies [^d58db139].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is cervical radiculopathy involving the C8 nerve root, with referred pain to the upper back and anterior chest, even though C7 is the more common source of chest pain in cervical radiculopathy cohorts. The intermittent, dull, achy quality is compatible with radicular pain, and the C8 dermatomal radiation to the ulnar hand supports this localization, while thoracic outlet syndrome and cardiac causes are less likely based on the clinical pattern and guideline features, though they should remain in the differential if the exam or risk profile contradicts radiculopathy [^91292b60] [^4b679757] [^22b11033]. I should double-check for C7–T1 foraminal stenosis or disc pathology on MRI if symptoms persist or worsen, and consider selective nerve root block as both a diagnostic and therapeutic adjunct if the diagnosis remains uncertain or conservative therapy fails [^839a535e] [^eeece5db].

---

The most likely cause of intermittent dull, achy pain in the anterior chest and upper back radiating in a C8 dermatomal pattern is **C8 radiculopathy** from cervical or upper thoracic nerve root compression, often due to C7–T1 disc herniation or foraminal stenosis [^750cbfbb] [^3b96a703]. Other considerations include **thoracic outlet syndrome** (especially neurogenic) [^8b0a38c4] and **myofascial pain syndrome** of the scalene or pectoral muscles, which can mimic radicular pain but lack objective neurologic deficits [^5cfb8736]. Less common causes include T1–T2 radiculopathy or apical lung tumors. Evaluation should include a focused neurologic exam, cervical and upper thoracic MRI, and electrodiagnostics if needed; management is typically conservative, with surgery reserved for refractory or progressive cases [^8c94f631] [^7d35b79e].

---

## Anatomical and clinical correlation

The C8 nerve root innervates the **ulnar aspect of the forearm**, the ring and little fingers, and intrinsic hand muscles; sensory changes and weakness in these distributions support C8 involvement [^4b679757]. C8 radiculopathy commonly presents with:

- **Pain**: Dull, aching, or sharp, radiating from the neck to the ulnar forearm and hand [^750cbfbb].
- **Sensory symptoms**: Numbness or paresthesia in the ring and little fingers [^4b679757].
- **Motor symptoms**: Weakness of hand intrinsics, finger flexion/extension, and grip [^750cbfbb].

Anterior chest and upper back pain can occur due to **referred pain** from C8 root compression, as cervical radiculopathy often produces non-dermatomal pain patterns [^91292b60] [^eeece5db].

---

## Common etiologies

Several conditions can cause **intermittent dull, achy pain** in the anterior chest and upper back with C8 dermatomal radiation:

| **Etiology** | **Description** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| C8 radiculopathy | Compression of the C8 nerve root, often from C7–T1 disc herniation or foraminal stenosis [^750cbfbb] | - Neck pain <br/> - Ulnar forearm/hand pain <br/> - Hand intrinsic weakness <br/> - Sensory loss in ring/little fingers [^4b679757] |
| Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) | Neurogenic TOS from brachial plexus compression in the thoracic outlet [^8b0a38c4] | - Neck, shoulder, and arm pain <br/> - Paresthesias in ulnar distribution <br/> - Weakness of hand intrinsics <br/> - Symptoms worsened by overhead activity [^8b0a38c4] |
| Myofascial pain syndrome | Scalene or pectoral muscle trigger points referring pain to the chest and upper back [^notfound] | - Dull, aching pain <br/> - Reproducible with palpation <br/> - No objective neurologic deficits [^notfound] |
| T1–T2 radiculopathy | Less common, but can mimic C8 symptoms due to overlap [^98158477] | - Similar pain distribution <br/> - Hand weakness <br/> - Horner syndrome if sympathetic fibers involved [^808f34e0] |
| Apical lung tumor (Pancoast) | Tumor invading the brachial plexus or nerve roots [^notfound] | - Severe shoulder/arm pain <br/> - Horner syndrome <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Night pain [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, aggravating/relieving factors, trauma, occupational exposures, systemic symptoms (weight loss, night pain) [^94b7db94].
- **Physical examination**: Neck, shoulder, and upper extremity neurologic exam; Spurling's, Adson's, and Wright's maneuvers; palpation for trigger points [^9a650cd4].
- **Imaging**: Cervical and upper thoracic MRI to assess for disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or mass lesions [^839a535e].
- **Electrodiagnostics**: Nerve conduction studies and EMG to differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or TOS [^c05475dd].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Conservative care**: NSAIDs, physical therapy, cervical traction, and activity modification are first-line for radiculopathy and TOS [^8ea22536].
- **Interventions**: Epidural steroid injections or selective nerve root blocks for persistent radicular pain [^dc6f8b85].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for refractory cases with progressive neurologic deficits or structural compression (e.g. ACDF, posterior foraminotomy, or TOS decompression) [^7d35b79e].

---

## Conclusion

Intermittent dull, achy pain in the anterior chest and upper back radiating in a C8 pattern most often reflects **C8 radiculopathy** from cervical or upper thoracic nerve root compression, with TOS and myofascial pain as key differentials. A focused history, exam, MRI, and electrodiagnostics guide diagnosis, and most patients improve with conservative care, reserving surgery for refractory or progressive cases [^8c94f631] [^7d35b79e].

Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of TOS varies depending on the type, ie NTOS vs VTOS vs ATOS. Especially within the NTOS population, the clinical presentation can be diverse. The presentation can range from mild discomfort that is exacerbated by certain upper extremity or neck positions to the more common description of pain, paresthesias and/or numbness in the fingers, hands, forearm, or arm on the affected side.

In general, NTOS occurs more frequently in women (3–4:1), and typically presents between the ages of 20–40 years. Furthermore, certain vocations such as violinists, jobs that involve significant computer usage in non-ergonomic positions, and assembly line workers appear vulnerable given the physical nature of their occupation. Another population at risk includes athletes incorporating repetitive overhead motions such as volleyball players, swimmers, pitchers, and weightlifters.

Symptoms and clinical features include a history of neck trauma, whiplash injury, or repetitive overhead motions, pain exacerbated with certain positions, and pain often consistent with nerve irritation including complaints of pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the arm and hand. In general, these symptoms can involve all five fingers, and can even occur in the entire upper extremity in a non-dermatomal pattern. The symptoms can be further subdivided based on the areas of possible dysfunction. This includes compression of the upper brachial plexus, which involves compression of the C5-C7 nerve roots, causing complaints of ipsilateral neck, trapezius, mastoid or anterior chest wall pain, or even occipital headaches. In contrast, compromise of the lower plexus, involving the C8-T1 nerve roots can result in symptoms around the posterior aspect of the shoulder, with radiculopathy down the arm in the ulnar distribution. Despite these specific subdivisions, patients often feel that the entire limb is affected without dermatomal preference, which contributes to the controversy and difficulty surrounding the diagnosis.

### Rehabilitation management of low back pain-it's time to pull it all together! [^5e6db458]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Part 2: practical integration of the model into practice

Once a patient is deemed suitable for rehabilitation (ie, no red flags), our model proposes a structure to further guide the clinician's assessment. In essence, rehabilitation professionals should establish the patient's profile based on the presence/absence of elements within each domain – this would then identify and target where the relative treatment efforts should be focused. Accordingly, this theoretical model is designed to provide a more comprehensive management overview, by appreciating the relative contribution of each domain driving pain and disability. The following clinical profiles of two hypothetical case examples illustrates this.

Patient A presents with painful symptoms in the low back area along with left leg pain that he describes as dull and achy. The pain is considered to mainly be nociceptive. He shows centralization of his symptoms after repeated lumbar extension exercises, but also has signs of radiculopathy (decreased endurance of dorsiflexors) related to his leg pain. At 5′8″ and 245 lbs, he is aware that his extra weight probably does not help his condition and that his co-occurring history of severe bilateral knee osteoarthritis pain does not help either. He reports that his mood is good, but he scores 6/9 on the StartBack questionnaire and does not see the day when he will be ready to return to work, although his employer is already willing to accommodate him.

Patient B presents with pain located in the low back as well as the posterior aspect of both thighs that he describes as lancinating – the painDetect questionnaire points to a neuropathic component. The segmental hypomobility observed in the lower segments of the lumbar spine during the physical examination does not change his symptoms. He has full range of motion and repeated movement examination does not reveal any specific mechanical pattern of pain (no directional preference either). However, he is also complaining of intermittent pain in his upper back and neck along with sleep disturbances, as pain wakes him up 5–6 times per night. He scores 42 on the CSI questionnaire, where questions regarding fatigue and endurance scored highest. He has concomitant physical comorbidity (migraines) but no mental health comorbidities. He clearly shows pain behaviors in the clinic (grimaces, guarding) and scores 8/9 on the StartBack tool. During the initial assessment, the therapist notes poor perception regarding return to work and high occupational demands for this 49-year-old welder.

Posterior-lateral foraminotomy for cervical radiculopathy — symptoms and localization accuracy in an observational prognostic study are summarized as follows: Number of patients was 736 who underwent one or more posterior-lateral foraminotomies for simple cervical radiculopathy. Symptom frequencies were arm pain 99.4%, neck pain 79.7%, scapular pain 52.5%, anterior chest pain 17.8%, and headache 9.7%; eleven patients presented with only left chest and arm pain ('cervical angina'). Pain or paresthesia followed a dermatomal pattern in 53.9%, was diffuse or nondermatomal in 45.5%, and 0.6% reported none; sensory change to pinprick occurred in 85.2%, a specific motor deficit in 68%, and a specific decrease in deep tendon reflex (DTR) in 71.2%. One level was thought to be primary 87.3% of the time and two levels equally involved 12.7% of the time, and this paper provides evidence that 71.5% of the time, the operative site can be accurately predicted on the basis of clinical findings.

3 RELEVANT FEATURES OF RADICULOPATHY

Radiculopathy is a syndrome of neurological impairment of sensory and/or motor function of a spinal nerve root that arises from nerve root injury or compression. Patients' symptoms and signs vary depending on which nerve root is affected, as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although the precise frequency of lumbosacral radiculopathies is unknown, the vast majority involve the L5 and/or S1 nerve roots, as the L4/L5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are the most likely to herniate. Depending on the direction of herniation, either the L5 and/or S1 nerve root can be affected. Like radiculopathy from disc herniation, radiculopathy due to other etiologies, including degenerative spondyloarthropathy, typically resolve spontaneously in weeks to months but may persist in some patients.

TABLE 1
Common features of radiculopathies by level.

Radiculopathy often, but not always, includes radiating pain and/or sensory loss along dermatomal territories, and can be termed "sciatica" by patients and healthcare providers. The character of the pain may be neuropathic — burning, electric — or may be described as dull or aching. Patients may or may not have concurrent low back pain. Factors on history that correlate highly with nerve root impingement on imaging and/or radiculopathy on EDX include pain that radiates within a specific dermatome (odds ratio [OR] 4.1), pain with coughing or sneezing (OR 3.2), subjective muscle weakness (OR 2.2), and subjective sensory loss (OR 2.1).

C7 radiculopathy — atypical symptom presentations are reported in a retrospective case series of 241 consecutive patients following C6-7 discectomy, with 83% having typical C7 radicular signs while 17% had atypical symptoms; 12% reported isolated subscapular pain and 5% deep breast or chest pain. Patients with atypical symptoms had correlative pathology confirmed by surgical findings, 93% of whom experienced symptom relief, and this study provides Level IV evidence that a substantial percentage of patients may present with atypical symptoms associated with C7 nerve root compression.

Cervical radiculopathy — retrospective observational series (Henderson et al) of 736 patients reported symptom and exam frequencies: arm pain (99.4%), neck pain (79.7%), scapular pain (52.5%), anterior chest pain (17.8%), headache (9.7%); dermatomal pain or paresthesia in 53.9% versus diffuse or non-dermatomal in 45.5% with 0.6% reporting none; sensory change to pinprick 85.2%, specific motor deficit 68%, specific decrease in a DTR 71.2%; one nerve root primarily responsible in 87.3% versus two levels 12.7%. Correlation with the primary operative level was 73.8% for pain/paresthesia, 84.8% for motor deficit, and 83.5% for DTR change, and "There was a 71.5% incidence of correlation between preoperative clinical findings and operative findings". Outcomes included "Good or excellent results" in 91.5%, with relief rates for arm pain 95.5%, neck pain 88.8%, scapular pain 95.9%, chest pain 95.4%, and headache 89.8%; DTR abnormalities resolved in 96.9%, with residual sensory deficit 20.9% and motor deficit 2.3%. Methodological note: "In critique, no validated outcome measures were used in the study. Thus, it provides Level II evidence that 71.5% of the time, the surgical site can be accurately predicted on the basis of clinical findings".

### Diagnosis and treatment of C4 radiculopathy [^dcce313f]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical case series.

Objective

This study sought to clarify symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of C4 radiculopathy, and the role of diagnostic C4 root block in this entity.

Summary Of Background Data

Although well understood cervical dermatomal/myotomal syndromes have been described for symptoms originating from impingement on the C2, C3, C5, C6, C7, and C8 roots, less has been written about the syndrome(s) associated with the C4 root.

Methods

The senior author reviewed surgical records and describes his personal experience with the diagnosis and treatment of C4 radiculopathy.

Results

A total of 712 procedures for cervical radiculopathy without myelopathy were reviewed. Among that cohort, 13 procedures involved the C4 root only and five procedures involved two level procedures including the C4 root. Patients described pain as involving the axial cervical region, paraspinal muscles, trapezius muscle, and interscapular region. No patient described pain over the anterior chest wall or radiating distal to the shoulder, one described pain over the medial clavicle. All patients who were offered surgery had a positive response to a diagnostic C4 transforaminal single nerve root block. Thirteen patients underwent posterior foraminotomy (five at two levels) and five patients underwent an anterior discectomy and fusion at C3-4. Mean Oswestry Disability Index score significantly declined; preoperative score 24.3 (range 14–29), postoperative score 9.7 (range 2–18; P = 0.003) at ≥ 3 months. Mean Short Form-36v2 score significantly increased; preoperative score 34.2 (range 20–40.2), postoperative score 73.7 (range 40.5–88.3, P = 0.001) at ≥ 3 months.

Conclusion

C4 root symptoms overlap those of the C3 and C5 roots and are very similar to facet mediated pain. Asymptomatic C4 foraminal stenosis may be a common imaging finding, it can be difficult to diagnose C4 radiculopathy clinically. Diagnostic C4 root block can make an accurate diagnosis and lead to successful surgical outcomes.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^9b1acb00]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical radicular pain versus somatic referred pain — distinguishing features are organized by causes, symptom quality, modification with movement, radiation, and signs. Somatic pain causes include facet joint pain, myofascial syndrome, and discogenic pain, whereas radicular pain is associated with disc herniation, annular tear, and spinal stenosis. Somatic symptom quality is described as deep, aching, poorly localized, neck worse than arm, no paresthesia, covers a wide area, and no radicular or shooting pain; in contrast, radicular symptom quality is sharp, shooting, well localized, arm worse than neck, paresthesia are very reliable, well defined area, and radicular distribution. Somatic pain is worse with extension, better with flexion, and has no radicular pattern, while radicular pain is worse with flexion, better with extension, with a radicular pattern. Radiation for somatic pain includes neck to head, shoulder blades, upper back, with radiation below elbow — unusual, no radicular; radicular pain follows nerve root distribution with radiation below elbow common and radicular and shooting pain. For signs, somatic pain shows sensory alterations uncommon, motor changes of only subjective weakness with atrophy is rare, and reflex changes none, whereas radicular pain shows sensory alterations probable, motor changes with objective weakness and atrophy may be present, and reflex changes commonly expressed but seen occasionally.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^22b11033]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### A 20-year-old with anterior chest pain: rare diagnosis behind a common concern [^ed2bd1c7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 20-year-old previously healthy man presented to our hospital with a 2-week history of dull aching pain localized to the anterior chest wall, specifically in the sternum region. The pain was non-radiating and was exacerbated by physical activity or deep inspiration. There was no associated swelling, redness, or deformity of the chest wall. There were no associated systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Additionally, there was no history of recent respiratory infections, coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea to suggest pulmonary or cardiac involvement. The patient was of Indian ethnicity and has been living in India since birth. However, he had no known exposure to individuals with active pulmonary TB. The patient reported no history of trauma, repetitive physical strain, or prior surgical interventions, such as sternotomy or chest wall procedures. His medical history was unremarkable, with no prior hospitalizations or chronic illnesses. There was no personal or family history of autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis, and he specifically denied symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint swelling, or peripheral joint pain that might suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. The absence of gastrointestinal or urogenital symptoms further reduced the likelihood of reactive arthritis or other systemic conditions. Relevant negatives also included no history of smoking, immunosuppressive therapy, or conditions such as diabetes or HIV that could increase susceptibility to infections.

### Electrodiagnosis of cervical radiculopathy [^839a535e]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a common diagnosis with a peak onset in the fifth decade. The most commonly affected nerve root is C7, C6, and C8. The etiology is often compressive, but may arise from noncompressive sources. Patients commonly complain of pain, weakness, numbness, and/or tingling. Examination may reveal sensory or motor disturbance in a dermatomal/myotomal distribution. Neural compression and tension signs may be positive. Diagnostic tests include imaging and electrodiagnostic study. Electrodiagnostic study serves as an extension of the neurologic examination. Electrodiagnostic findings can be useful for patients with atypical symptoms, potential pain-mediated weakness, and nonfocal imaging findings.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^24eae711]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Features of somatic and radicular pain — somatic or referred pain versus radicular pain are contrasted across causes, symptoms, mechanical modification, radiation, and signs. Segment causes for somatic or referred pain include posterior elements such as "Posterior segment or element", "Facet joint pain", "Sacroiliac joint pain", "Myofascial syndrome", and "Internal disc disruption", whereas radicular pain lists "Anterior segment", "Disc herniation", "Annular tear, discogenic pain", and "Spinal stenosis". Symptoms differ with somatic described as "Dull, aching, deep" and "Like an expanding pressure", while radicular is "Sharp, shooting, superficial, lancinating" and "Like an electric shock". Somatic pain is "Poorly localized", "Covers a wide area", with "Back worse than leg", "No paresthesia", and "No radicular or shooting pain", whereas radicular pain is "Well localized", "Leg worse than back", has "Paresthesia present", is "Well defined", with "Radicular distribution". Mechanical modification shows somatic "Worse with extension" and "Better with flexion" with "No radicular pattern", while radicular is "Worse with flexion" and "Better with extension" with "Radicular pattern". Radiation for somatic is "Low back to hip, thigh, groin", with "Radiation below knee unusual" and "Quasi segmental", while radicular "Follows nerve distribution", with "Radiation below knee common" and "Radicular pattern". Signs differ in that sensory alteration is "Uncommon" for somatic and "Probable" for radicular; motor changes show somatic "Only subjective weakness" and "Atrophy rare" versus radicular "Objective weakness" and "Atrophy possibly present"; reflex changes are "None" for somatic and "Commonly described, but seen only occasionally" for radicular; straight leg raises show somatic "Only low back pain" versus radicular "Reproduction of leg pain", and somatic presents "No root tension signs" versus radicular "Positive root tension signs".

### Atypical presentation of C-7 radiculopathy [^f1cc6205]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Object

The authors retrospectively reviewed the presenting symptomatology and 6-month outcome in 241 consecutive patients who underwent C6-7 anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) from an overall series of 1008 patients in whom the senior author performed one-level procedures.

Methods

In 28 (12%) of the 241 patients, the sole complaint was subscapular pain on the side ipsilateral to nerve root compression. In 11 patients (5%), the primary complaint was unilateral deep breast or chest pain. No patient experienced any of the traditional radicular signs involving C-7 such as numbness of the second or third digits, pain in the triceps, and/or atrophy or weakness of the triceps or pronator muscles. Of the 28 patients presenting with subscapular pain 238 (93%) of 241 experienced complete symptom relief within 6 months, and of the 11 who presented with chest pain complete relief or relief to the point of requiring nonnarcotic analgesic agents occurred in nine cases.

Conclusions

Approximately 15% of patients with a C-7 radiculopathy are likely to present with atypical symptoms that, if persisting after nonsurgical therapy, will often resolve after ACD and fusion.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^38caa3a0]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy due to CDH — clinical localization is summarized as follows: Objective muscle weakness corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 77% and 12%, respectively. All cases of objective weakness in which root C5 or C8 was involved, the level was correctly localized. Sensory loss corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 65% and 35%, respectively. Author conclusions (relative to question): Clinical findings related to the fingers are the most accurate for localizing a CDH to a single level. A single level CDH may produce signs and symptoms that correspond to overlapping dermatomal levels.

We report the case of a 52-year-old patient who sought a rheumatologic consultation for anterior chest pain of 2 weeks' duration. Radiology for trauma did not reveal any pathology. The laboratory findings focusing on rheumatologic diseases remained unhelpful and no abnormalities were found. After a cutaneous linear cordlike lesion at the right lateral chest wall occurred, the diagnosis of Mondor's disease could be made on the basis of clinical and histologic investigation. Because pain precedes the typical clinical manifestation, problems of diagnosis can occur in the early phase of the illness.

Cervical spine — History and physical examination emphasize pain patterns, paresthesia validity, dermatomal mapping, and key maneuvers. Cervical spine pain is a common clinical condition affecting activities of daily living and QoL in people around the world and can manifest as neck pain, shoulder or trapezius pain, scapular pain, and upper extremity pain. Radicular pain is most likely to travel below the elbow, and somatic referred pain is most often limited to above the elbow, although either can occasionally cross these boundaries. In contrast to the lumbar spine, paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and in the hand it is considered more valid than forearm paresthesia distribution. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to localize paresthesia and they present with diffuse, nondermatomal symptoms. Digit-specific patterns include thumb or index finger paresthesia attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index involvement) assigned to C7, and the little finger assigned to C8. Assessment is based on history and an extensive examination including neurological, motor, sensory, and reflex evaluation plus provocative maneuvers such as Spurling's neck compression test, shoulder abduction test, neck distraction test, Lhermitte sign, Hoffman sign, and Addison's test.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### T1-T2 disk herniation presenting with horner syndrome: a case report with literary review [^98158477]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Historically, symptomatic thoracic disk herniation occurred with a frequency of 2 to 3/1,000 cases of disk herniation. This is likely even less frequent with the advent of MRI use in diagnosis. Patients with upper extremity radicular pain/paresthesias are often sent for radiographs and MRI. Cervical radiographs are not usually clinically useful because of the difficulty in visualizing through the shoulders. The T1-T2 interspace is not fully visualized on a cervical MRI; therefore, a thoracic MRI scan can be helpful. CT can be used to complement MRI in cases of thoracic disk herniations. This study can distinguish calcified disk herniations, which may lead to modified treatment strategies and surgical approach. The T1 nerve root supplies the ulnar nerve with C8 at a root level, the medial pectoral, medial brachial cutaneous, the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves at a cord level, and the first intercostal nerve. Delineating the location of nerve compression begins with assessing sites of peripheral compression with physical examination. Tests such as Tinel sign at carpal/cubital tunnel, elbow flexion test, ulnar nerve compression test, Phalen test, and/or Durkan test are helpful. Causes of T1 nerve root compression has been summarized in the literature (Table 2). C8 and T1 nerve roots compromise both the ulnar and median nerve root; therefore, precise examination of these roots is necessary. Dermatomal patterns for C8 and T1 radiculopathy can be difficult to discern on examination because they can mimic peripheral nerve pathology such as cubital and/or Guyon tunnel syndrome. Motor deficits of C8 compression are reflected as weakness in hand intrinsic muscles, finger flexion, and some finger abduction. Weakness with finger abduction results from C8 radiculopathy and/or peripheral ulnar nerve entrapment. The C8 nerve root innervates the extensor indicus and abductor pollicis brevis from the radial and median nerves, respectively, in addition to finger flexion (ulnar nerve). C8 root pathology will result in weakness in all three of these muscles with manual muscle testing. T1 motor root innervates the flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor pollicis longus, flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus, lumbricals, interossei, and the pectoralis major.

3.2.1.2. Radicular pain without radiculopathy

Radicular pain is likely associated with hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges of dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. The hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges may be due to inflammatory irritation, ischaemia, or mechanical deformation of neural structures or a combination of these and their downstream mechanisms (eg, inflammation).

The pain may be described as shocking, lancinating, electric, stabbing, or shooting and is often accompanied by a dull background ache. We have further added sharp and burning as potential pain descriptors as these are frequently reported by patients with lumbar radicular pain. With radicular pain, the pain may be spontaneous or evoked, for instance, by certain movements of the spine or leg. In addition to pain, patients may experience paraesthesia and dysaesthesia such as tingling, a "woolen feeling", or "a block of ice".

The pain can be felt deep or cutaneous and may radiate into the leg in areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes. The working group further agreed to remove the original description of "band-like" location of the pain, which seemed sufficiently covered by "areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes".

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^33145534]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a widespread diagnosis. Typically, CR is associated with symptoms of neck, shoulder, and upper limb pain as well as upper limb paraesthesia and weakness, which are attributed to cervical nerve root irritation. The clinical diagnosis of CR relies mainly on the outcome of history taking and a physical examination in which diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, or motor weakness with dermatomal/myotomal distribution can be found.

Epidemiological data on CR are sparse. A population-based study indicated that CR had an annual incidence rate of 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women, while the age-specific annual incidence rate reached a peak of 202.9 for the age group 50–54 years. Another study reported a prevalence of 3.5 per 1,000 people and a peak annual incidence of 2.1 case per 1,000 people, which increased to a peak at age 50–59 years.

The aetiology in 70–75% of cases is a foraminal compression of the spinal nerve. This can be due to several factors, including reduction in disc height and anterior and posterior degenerative changes of the uncovertebral and zygapophyseal joints. The most common level of nerve root compression is C7, followed by C6; compression of roots C5 and C8 are less frequent. A herniated disc in the cervical spine accounts for only 20–25% of the cases of CR. CR as a direct result of cervical trauma or metastases is infrequent. Although CR is a common diagnosis, there is still no consensus on the definition. The differential diagnosis of CR can be extensive and includes many musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that may mimic the signs and symptoms of CR.

It has been suggested that CR is a diagnosis based on clinical impression, advanced testing, electrophysiology tests, or a combination of these tests. There are no generally accepted, well-defined clinical criteria for the diagnosis of CR. A clear definition of terms is required to establish definitive diagnostic criteria for evaluating the (cost)effectiveness of treatment of patients with CR. An unambiguous diagnostic classification of CR is necessary to be able to select a homogeneous patient population for daily practice and research. It will facilitate communication and help in identifying subgroups of patients differing from the overall population in prognosis or treatment benefit.

Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the uniformity of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in intervention studies (with at least one conservative treatment group) to select patients with CR.

Ulnar neuropathy at or distal to the wrist, the so-called ulnar tunnel syndrome, is an uncommon but well-described condition. However, diagnosis of ulnar tunnel syndrome can be difficult. Paresthesias may be nonspecific or related to coexisting pathologies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8-T1 radiculopathy, or peripheral neuropathy, which makes accurate diagnosis challenging. The advances in electrodiagnosis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have improved the diagnostic accuracy. This article offers an updated view of ulnar tunnel syndrome as well as its etiologies, diagnoses, and treatments.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis - History

Although NTOS is the most common subtype, representing up to 95% of TOS diagnoses, it is also the most controversial because it is difficult to diagnose, and remains without objective measures/criteria for diagnosis. As a result, the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, and relies heavily on a detailed and thorough history and physical examination. Unlike ATOS and VTOS, which can be diagnosed using ultrasound or CTA, objective measures and testing procedures for diagnosing NTOS remain limited. Further obscuring the diagnosis is confounding diagnoses that present with similar symptoms. For instance, patients who present with neck and arm pain may be misdiagnosed with cervical radiculopathy, rotator cuff injury, or peripheral nerve entrapment.

More recently, the Society for Vascular Surgery developed reporting standards for Thoracic outlet syndrome, including standardized nomenclature, definitions, and more consistent reporting standards. The most recent definition from 2016 by Illig etdefines NTOS as the presence of three of the four criteria:

1. Local symptoms in an area of compression (e.g. chest wall, trapezius, neck) and confirmed with pain on palpation in the specific area

2. Peripheral findings of arm or hand symptoms based on history, and confirmed by provocative maneuvers that reproduce or worsen the symptoms.

3. Absence of other reasonable/likely diagnoses such as cervical, shoulder, or peripheral nerve pathology.

4. Positive response to a scalene injection (typically local anesthetic)

Patients may also note a history of trauma. It is important to evaluate occupational, avocational, or sports activity risk factors. Other key symptoms that can be obtained from a thorough history include complaints of pain, numbness, tingling, sleep disturbances, and weakness, while exacerbating factors can include exercising, overhead arm motion, and driving. Symptom distribution generally involves all five fingers but can be more pronounced in the fourth and fifth digits and the ulnar forearm. Symptoms can sometimes be distinguished from cervical disc syndrome since NTOS generally presents without dermatomal preference, while cervical stenosis or disc syndrome may often present with a more defined dermatomal pattern; however, this can also make it difficult for general physicians, as the patient may complain of a nonspecific clinical presentation thereby confounding the picture and leading to an inaccurate or delayed diagnosis.

2.2. Presence, distribution, and duration of musculoskeletal pain

The questionnaire included a detailed assessment of the presence of musculoskeletal pain. All participants were asked "During the past month, have you experienced any pain which has lasted at least 1 day or longer?" Respondents answering positively were asked to shade the location(s) of their pain on a four-view body manikin. Participants were then asked whether they had been aware of their pain for 3 months or longer (yes/no). Using their responses to these questions, participants were classified as having CWP using the definition in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgiathat was operationalised by Croft et al.as requiring axial (cervical spine, thoracic spine, anterior chest, or low back) pain and pain in contralateral body quadrants, above and below the waist, and on the right and left hand sides of the body, which has been present for at least 3 months. Remaining participants were classified as having some pain (those participants reporting pain that did not satisfy the criteria for CWP) or no pain. The data collection tool (a blank body manikin) has been shown to collect valid and reliable pain data with high between-rater reliability scoring. The original criteria for CWP defined by Croft et al.were based on the definition included in the 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia that required pain in the axial skeleton and in contralateral body quadrants. The criteria have been used in multiple population-based epidemiological studies and have face and construct validity (they identify persons with high care utilisation, poor sleep, depression, physical inactivity, and with higher tender point counts among many other findings), and have been shown to identify persons with a genetic susceptibility to developing CWP.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

The differential diagnosis of anterior chest pain has always been an important problem in clinical medicine. In the past few decades, it has grown steadily in importance and clinicians have become increasingly aware of the manifestations of coronary artery disease and its potentially malignant nature. This disease is so common and its recognition so essential that the clinician may feel safe in considering it as a possibility in any patient complaining of pain in the anterior chest wall. This is particularly true if the patient has an authenticated history of myocardial infarction or is in the so-called coronary age group. On the other hand, there are innumerable noncardiac conditions, visceral as well as somatic, that give rise to anterior chest pain and are to be suspected if one is to avoid an unwarranted diagnosis of coronary artery disease and the resultant unwise restrictions and their psychological consequences.

Clinical presentation of C8 radiculopathy at the cervicothoracic junction — case series (C7-T1 herniations): Study design was a case series with the number of patients: 10, in which symptoms included shoulder pain radiating into the lateral aspect of the hand, hand weakness and weakness in finger flexion, finger extension, and intrinsic hand muscles, sensation and DTRs were unremarkable, MRI on each patient revealed a soft disc compressing the C8 nerve, and recovery of hand strength was incomplete in two patients with symptoms greater than four months. The work group concluded that C8 radiculopathy usually presents as weakness of the hand, and pain radiates to the shoulder, scapular area, and to the fourth and fifth fingers; physical exam may reveal normal sensory and DTR's; and motor examination may show weakness of flexors and extensors of the fingers and also weakness of intrinsic muscles of the hand.

### Cervical radiculopathy, entrapment neuropathy, and thoracic outlet syndrome: how to differentiate? Invited submission from the joint section meeting on disorders of the spine and peripheral nerves, March 2004 [^6b332cbf]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2004). Low credibility.

The common diagnoses of cervical radiculopathy and upper-extremity entrapment neuropathies can at times be difficult to differentiate. Additionally, thoracic outlet syndrome is often diagnosed when, in fact, the problem is radiculopathy or neuropathy. Another source of confusion, especially in older patients, is neuralgic amyotrophy, brachial plexitis, or the Parsonage-Turner syndrome. The differential diagnosis of unilateral arm pain, weakness, and/or sensory loss includes all of these problems. The clinical and electrodiagnostic features of each are discussed as an aid to distinguishing between these common and similar entities.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^b4e09769]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — history and examination findings emphasize paresthesia distribution and specific provocative tests. Paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and the distribution of paresthesia in the hand is also considered more valid than the distribution of paresthesia in the forearm. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to vocalize the paresthesia to a distinct region. Dermatomal mapping notes that paresthesia of the thumb or index finger is attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index) to the C7 dermatome, and the little finger to the C8 dermatome. In a best evidence review, a positive Spurling's, traction/neck distraction, and Valsalva can be used to establish a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, and the existing literature appears to indicate high specificity, low sensitivity, and good to fair interexaminer reliability. For detection of radiculopathy, the presence of numbness has varied significantly from 24% to 48%, and 60% to as high as 86%; numbness is most often seen in the C6 and C7 dermatomes, and the predictive validity of numbness was calculated to be 0.7. Regarding imaging, in patients 50 years of age or older, plain spinal radiography together with standard laboratory tests are highly accurate in identifying the underlying systemic disease; however, plain radiography was not a valuable tool for nonspecific neck pain, and no systematic reviews were identified which examined the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic imaging in those with neck pain.

Symptomatology

The etiologies contributing to CPIP are varied and complex in nature. Consequently, the symptomatology of CPIP is just as complex and variable and is dependent upon the type(s) of pain that the patient is suffering from: neuropathic pain, non-neuropathic pain, somatic pain, and/or visceral pain. Patients with neuropathic pain may describe having pain (neuralgia), reduced sensation (hypoesthesia), increased sensation (hyperesthesia), or a burning sensation (paresthesia). Occasionally, patients with neuropathic pain will report pain to a non-painful stimulus (allodynia) or increased pain response to a painful stimulus (hyperalgesia). Stabbing, burning, pulling, throbbing, shooting, prickling, and sharp are descriptors that are commonly used by patients suffering from neuropathic pain. These symptoms can be constant or intermittent. Pain can be localized or radiating in nature, with common sites of radiating pain being to the scrotum, labium, and/or upper thigh. Occasionally, a "trigger point" will exist and when palpated will cause the patient to experience the neuropathic pain symptoms. Neuropathic pain symptoms typically worsen with ambulation, twisting, or stretching of the upper body, stooping or sitting, hyperextension of the hip, or sexual intercourse and are made better with lying down or flexion of the hip and thigh.

Non-neuropathic pain in CPIP is typically described as a dull ache, typically constant, usually over the entirety of the groin area, with no specific trigger point or radiating component. Words typically used to describe this type of pain include: gnawing, tender, pounding, or pulling. Somatic pain, as discussed previously, is usually localized to the pubic tubercle area as the area of maximum tenderness. Visceral pain in CPIP is generally related to sexual dysfunction or ejaculatory pain in the region of the superficial ring or the testicular/labial region. According to a study performed by Loos et al, patients with CPIP visceral pain symptoms describe them as aching, without a specific trigger point. Those with a history of anterior approach who have visceral pain have a spermatic cord that is diffusely tender to palpation.

### Unexpected neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with apparent C8 radiculopathy: broadening the clinical spectrum [^bb98a391]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

C8-root impingement by C7/T1 lesions on neuroimaging studies is not consistently observed in C8 radiculopathy. We hypothesized that C7 or T1 root lesions (with a pre- or postfixed plexus) or cervical myelopathy might explain some "C8 radiculopathies" without C8 root compression.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of cervical neuroimaging in 31 consecutive patients with EMG-confirmed C8 radiculopathy.

Results

Five patients (16%) had C8-root compression at C7/T1. Of those without C8-root compression, 5 (16%) had C7-root compression at C6/7, one (3%) had T1-root compression at T1/T2, 7 (23%) had cervical cord compression at or above the C6/7 level, 4 (13%) had intramedullary cervical lesions, and 9 (29%) had mild or nonspecific findings.

Conclusions

C8 radiculopathy without C8-root compression may be due to C7-root compression in the setting of a "prefixed" brachial plexus, upper cervical cord compression with vascular compromise of the distal cervical spinal cord ("myelopathic hand"), or intramedullary cervical cord lesions.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific findings: For acute coronary syndrome (ACS), findings include diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and MR murmur; examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. For pulmonary embolism (PE), tachycardia and dyspnea with pain with inspiration may be present. Pericarditis presents with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may show fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumonia may include fever, localized or pleuritic chest pain, friction rub, regional dullness to percussion, and egophony. Costochondritis/Tietze syndrome shows tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster produces pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch with a characteristic unilateral, dermatomal rash. Esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gall bladder disease are suggested by epigastric tenderness, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a Murphy sign.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^fa150a42]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — features distinguishing somatic or referred pain from radicular pain are tabulated, emphasizing that determining the difference is critical to diagnosis and treatment. Somatic or referred pain aligns with posterior elements and includes "Posterior segment or element", "Facet joint pain", "Sacroiliac joint pain", "Myofascial syndrome", and "Internal disk disruption", whereas radicular pain aligns with anterior elements and includes "Anterior segment", "Disk herniation", "Annular tear", and "Spinal stenosis". Somatic symptoms are described as "Dull, aching, deep" and "Like an expanding pressure", while radicular symptoms are "Sharp, shooting, lancinating" and "Like an electrical shock". Quality differs with "Back worse than leg", "No paresthesia", "Covers a wide area", and "No radicular or shooting pain", versus radicular patterns of "Leg worse than back", "Paresthesia present", "Well defined and localized", and "Radicular distribution". Radiation contrasts include "Low back to hip, thigh, groin" with "Radiation below knee unusual" versus "Follows nerve root distribution" with "Radiation below knee common". Signs also diverge: somatic shows "Uncommon" sensory alteration, "Only subjective weakness", "Atrophy rare", "None" reflex changes, and straight leg raise produces "Only low back pain", while radicular shows sensory alteration "Probably", "Objective weakness", "Atrophy possibly present", reflex changes "Commonly described, but seen only occasionally", and straight leg raise with "Reproduction of leg pain".

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

### Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: a Primer for hand and peripheral nerve Surgeons [^07a2ab0d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is a complex condition and is commonly misunderstood. Historically, much of this confusion has been because of its grouping with other diagnoses that have little in common other than anatomic location. Modern understanding emphasizes the role of small unmyelinated C type pain and sympathetic fibers. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, after ruling out other common conditions. Hand therapy is usually the first-line treatment with variable success. Local anesthetic, botulinum toxins, or steroid injections can aid in diagnosis and offer short-term relief. Although surgery can yield reliable results, it is technically challenging, and the preferred surgical approach is a matter of debate. Despite limitations in diagnosis and treatment, recognition and successful treatment of this condition can be highly impactful for the patient.

4.5.2 Exertional compartment syndrome

One of many conditions under the umbrella of exercise‐induced leg pain, exertional compartment syndrome presents with pain in any of the four compartments of the leg (anterior, lateral, superficial or deep posterior) that comes on with activity and resolves or dramatically diminishes after a period of rest that is typically reproducible within an individual but may vary between individuals. The incidence is estimated at one per 2000 persons per year and often occurs in runners and other highly active persons. Patients affected by exertional compartment syndrome often have no risk factors for vascular or neurogenic claudication, although there is significant symptom overlap given the exertional nature of this condition. In older and/or diabetic patients presenting with these features, further workup to exclude peripheral vascular disease and vascular claudication may be warranted. Additional symptoms, estimated to affect one in three patients with exertional compartment syndrome, may include weakness, cramps, and/or paraesthesiae or hypoesthesiae in one or more peripheral nerves of the leg, and may therefore be mistaken for radiculopathy. Symptoms are often but not always symmetric and start reproducibly at the same intensity, duration, and/or distance of exercise. Physical examination and electrodiagnostic testing (if undertaken) are typically normal. Diagnosis can be made with specialized testing with dynamic intra‐compartmental pressure monitoring during exercise.

Lower cervical radiculopathy–associated headaches and response to selective nerve root block (SNRB) are described in a prospective observational study in which, of 275 patients, 161 suffered from daily or recurrent headaches, most often ipsilateral to the radiculopathy. Immediately before the injections, 161 (59%) of patients experienced a headache exceeding 15 on the VAS; of these 161 patients, 101 (63%) experienced > 25% headache reduction following SNRB, 93 (58%) reported greater than 50% headache reduction, and 66 experienced 100% relief (C4 3%, C5 11%, C6 52%, C7 29%, C8 5%). The authors concluded that cervical nerve root compression from degenerative disease in the lower cervical spine producing radiculopathy can also result in headache, and therefore headache assessment together with muscle palpation should be part of the clinical exam for patients with cervical radiculopathy.

Cervical disc herniation (CDH) clinical localization — observational prognostic study: The stated objective was to correlate clinical findings with operative findings when a single cervical nerve root (C5, C6, C7, C8) is compressed by a CDH, with number of patients 100. The presence of pain in the arm corresponded to the site compression in 23% of cases, forearm pain or paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 32% and 66%, respectively, hand pain and paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 70% and 27%, respectively, and subjective weakness corresponded to a single level in 22/34 (79%) cases. Potential level was II with downgraded level II, and conclusions state that clinical findings related to the fingers are the most accurate for localizing a CDH to a single level, and that single level CDH may produce signs and symptoms that correspond to overlapping dermatomal levels.

A male aged 44years presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of intermittent right-sided abdominal pain radiating to the midline. Examination demonstrated a tender right upper quadrant with voluntary guarding and a low grade fever. One week previously, he had been admitted to hospital after an isolated, self-terminating seizure secondary to an deliberate venlafaxine overdose. His upper abdominal symptoms started immediately postseizure but at the time were attributed to musculoskeletal chest pain by the discharging team. Acute cholecystitis was suspected, but liver function tests, amylase and an erect chest radiograph were unremarkable. The abdominal pain responded well to morphine, permitting a thorough reassessment of the patient, which revealed midthoracic spine tenderness, previously undetected. Prior to this, the patient had not complained of any back pain. A CT scan confirmed a burst fracture of T8 requiring urgent transfer to the local spinal unit for posterior stabilisation.

### Validating the hierarchical nature of the AO spine upper cervical spine injury classification system [^9a8b7ed7]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Slight deviations from a perfect match between the overall UCIC hierarchy and the perceived ISS of respondents include equivalence between the ISS for neurological status modifiers N1 (transient neurological deficit) and N2 (radicular symptoms). This discrepancy may be secondary to the relatively low incidence of traumatic, as opposed to degenerative, cervical radiculopathy, and the somewhat broad range of potential interpretations of how cervical radiculopathy may present. Cervical radiculopathy can manifest as a static or progressive clinical picture of any combination of radicular pain, sensory deficits, motor deficits, or diminished reflexes correlated to the anatomic course of a cervical nerve root, with different degrees of severity. Similarly, transient neurological deficit is also somewhat broad and may conjure a wide range of different levels of impairment. Finally, radiculopathy/neuropathic pain in the upper cervical (C0-C2) region may be difficult to distinguish from fracture-related pain. This is because the C2 nerve root has a difficult to test dermatomal distribution of the back of the scalp, which would likely have substantial overlap with any neck pain the patient may be experiencing. In addition, the C2 nerve root is responsible for innervating only small paraspinal muscles including the rectus capitis anterior and lateralis, and thus is difficult to test on motor exam. Similarly, the C1 nerve root typically has only a rudimentary dorsal root ganglion with minimal sensory function. Its motor functions relate predominantly to paraspinal and anterior neck musculature that are not routinely tested. In contrast, N3 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and N4 (complete spinal cord injury) are themselves associated with robust and validated, quantitative classification systems and a body of literature supporting their respective prognoses. Thus, assigning an ISS for these modifiers is likely more straightforward.

Accuracy of clinical signs for musculoskeletal chest pain diagnosis

In one study in a cardiology emergency department specific clinical signs or symptoms compared to a standardized examination protocol showed either fair LR + and poor LR- (for example, pain worse with movement of the torso, pain relief on pain medication, no sudden pain start, age ≤ 49 years) or a poor LR + and a very good LR- (for example, anterior chest wall tenderness, biomechanical dysfunction). A score of 3 or more points in a sum score (1 point for each of five palpation findings: restriction in C4 to 7/Th1 to Th8 when sitting; prone restriction Th1 to 8; paraspinal tenderness; anterior chest wall tenderness; costosternal junction tenderness) showed an LR + of 1.52 and very good LR- of 0.03. A score of 1 or more points in a sum score for the diagnosis of a chest wall syndrome (CWS) in the GP setting (1 point for each positive finding: localized muscle tension; stinging pain; pain reproducible by palpation; absence of cough) showed a LR + of 1.82 and LR- of 0.20. A score of 2 or more points in the sum score showed a LR + of 3.02 and LR- of 0.47.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — C8 radiculopathy clinical presentation: A retrospective case series reviewed a series of 10 patients with C7-T1 herniations in which MRI on each patient revealed a soft disc compressing the C8 nerve root and sensation and DTRs were unremarkable; recovery of hand strength was noted in each patient, although recovery was incomplete in two patients with symptoms greater than four months. This study provides Level IV evidence that C8 radiculopathy usually presents as weakness of the hand and pain radiating to shoulder, scapular area, and to the fourth and fifth fingers; physical exam may reveal normal sensation and DTRs and motor examination may show weakness of finger flexion and extension and weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

### Physical examination signs, clinical symptoms, and their relationship to electrodiagnostic findings and the presence of radiculopathy [^bbb94886]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The validity of the history and physical examination varies with study method and the gold standard used. In general, symptoms are more sensitive than specific, and most patients with radiculopathy do present with some characteristic complaints. With the exception of the ipsilateral SLR, most physical examination findings are more specific than sensitive. In patients with suspected radiculopathy, having at least one abnormal physical examination finding makes the probability of having an abnormal electrodiagnostic study more likely than if the results of the physical examination are normal. Having a normal physical examination, however, does not rule out the possibility of having a radiculopathy that is revealed either electrodiagnostically or surgically. Although the history and physical examination may not be perfect tools for the diagnosis of radiculopathy or predicting electrodiagnostic outcome, they are an essential part of the clinical evaluation to assist in formulating a differential diagnosis and guiding the electrodiagnostic study.

### Are tender points associated with cervical radiculopathy? [^78889a0b]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if there is an association between cervical radiculopathy and tender spots in the neck and upper extremity on the side of radiculopathy.

Design

Prospective cross-sectional study.

Setting

Outpatient spine clinic within an academic institution.

Participants

Convenience sample of 16 subjects with unilateral cervical radiculopathy. Twelve subjects had C7 radiculopathy and 4 had C6 or C8 radiculopathy.

Intervention

Bilateral pain-pressure threshold measurement (14 muscles) of the neck and upper extremity.

Main Outcome Measure

Side-to-side difference in pain-pressure threshold.

Results

Differences in frequency of tender spots were found only in the deltoid and flexor carpi radialis. Overall, more tender spots were found on the side of radiculopathy (75 vs 34, P < .01). Among subjects with C7 radiculopathy, the number of tender spots in C7 innervated muscles was greater on the side of radiculopathy (23 vs 7, P < .02). In contrast, no significant difference in the number of tender spots between sides was found when only non-C7 innervated muscles (P > 0.1) were considered.

Conclusions

Cervical radiculopathy was associated with increased tender spots on the side of radiculopathy, with predilection toward muscles innervated by the involved nerve root.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages — evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest; pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity troponins are preferred for biomarker diagnosis; high-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Early care for acute symptoms is stressed; patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^a1d065e6]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Initial Evaluation Chest pain can present as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw and less commonly as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue without pain. Chest pain is considered acute with new onset or if it involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration; it is considered stable if it is chronic with unchanging triggers such as exertion or emotional stress. Patients commonly describe ischemic chest pain as pressure, squeezing, heaviness, tightness, exertional, stress-related, or retrosternal. Pain that is sharp, fleeting, pleuritic, positional, or shifting locations is less likely to be of cardiac origin. These guidelines suggest describing chest pain as cardiac; possible cardiac; or noncardiac. The descriptor atypical is no longer used because it can be interpreted by patients as being benign.

Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing. Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing. Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay.

Intermediate-risk patients with known CAD and acute chest pain should have blood pressure and cholesterol management maximized before additional testing. CCTA can document CAD progression in patients with previous testing demonstrating nonobstructive lesions. Patients with a history of high-risk CAD or worsening frequency of symptoms who have optimized blood pressure and cholesterol management should be evaluated with invasive coronary angiography. High-risk patients with acute chest pain should receive invasive coronary angiography. It optimizes the accuracy of identifying more patients at low risk. Also, these guidelines clarify that CCTA should be our default risk stratification method for intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain because it saves time compared with nuclear stress testing with lower cost and radiation exposure compared with invasive angiography. — Michael J.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^d5f406ad]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Fifth, the foregoing conditions should exist in the absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. The patient should exhibit a normal lower extremity neurologic exam without marked motor weakness or other deficits. Dermatomal radiation and other neurologic symptoms such as motor weakness and numbness are absent with discogenic pain.

Patients demonstrating the foregoing constellation of signs and symptoms for greater than six months can be classified diagnostically as exhibiting lumbar discogenic pain (Figure 1, Box 2). We provide the following acronym, DISCS, as a helpful cue in the initial assessment of the back pain patient:

D - Duration of symptoms: Chronic pain persisting for more than six months.

I - Increased pain with flexion: Pain is aggravated with forward flexion due to annular strain.

S - Sitting intolerance: The patient shows limited sitting tolerance, typically less than 30 minutes.

C - Central back pain: Axial midline pain without radicular symptoms.

S - Sustained hip flexion test: Pain is reproduced with sustained hip flexion in the supine position, distinguishing discogenic pain.

### Unusual and very rare presentation of wrist pain in a man with acute anterior myocardial infarction, a case report and literature of review [^87ac3885]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on our current understanding, this case of wrist pain in an AMI patient is unprecedented and has not been previously attributed to any physiological mechanism. Cardiac pain can be transmitted by afferent vagal and sympathetic nerves in response to myocardial ischemia. The first five sympathetic roots of the thoracic transmit most of the cardiac pain. Sympatic nerves innervate the heart by thoracic ganglions (superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglions) which are connected to the C4 to C8 roots. These roots also give rise to the radial nerve (C5 to T1), median nerve (C6 to T1), and (C8 to T1) nerve which are responsible for wrist pain. Somatic and visceral afferents converge on the same neurons in the CNS, causing pain in specific locations.

Even though this was an uncommon instance involving a male patient, the significance of this case report should be considered to ensure that patients coming with unusual discomfort are appropriately diagnosed. Regarding previous reviews, the statistics indicate about 1 to 2% of AMI cases remain misdiagnosed mainly in terms of atypical presentation and misinterpretation of the ECG (23).

### Electrodiagnostic approach to patients with suspected radiculopathy [^c05475dd]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviews the electrodiagnostic testing for persons suspected of having radiculopathies and the expected sensitivities that different testing modalities provide. One cannot minimize the importance of the clinical evaluation and differential diagnosis formulation by the electrodiagnostician to guide testing. The needle EMG examination is the most useful electrodiagnostic test but is limited in sensitivity. Electromyographic screening examinations using six muscles are possible that optimize identification yet minimize patient discomfort. Electrodiagnostic findings must be interpreted relative to the patient's clinical presentation, and the consultant should tailor the electrodiagnostic study to the clinical situation.

### Adjacent segment degeneration at T1-T2 presenting as chest pain: case report [^c1aba5c5]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of a T1-T2 herniated disc adjacent to a cervical spine fusion.

Objective

To describe the clinical presentation and treatment of a symptomatic T1-T2 disc herniation adjacent to an anterior cervical spine arthrodesis.

Summary Of Background Data

Symptomatic adjacent segment disease after cervical spine arthrodesis occurs most commonly in the lower cervical spine motion segments and has not been previously reported at T1-T2.

Methods

A 51-year-old female patient presented 4 years after three-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion involving the C5-T1 levels. She complained of chronic chest pain and had undergone extensive medical evaluation before presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left-sided T1-T2 herniated disc compressing the T1 nerve root. She underwent T1-T2 anterior discectomy and fusion.

Results

The patient's symptoms resolved completely.

Conclusion

Adjacent-segment degeneration after cervical spine fusion may rarely occur even at T1-T2, and the unusual symptoms of a T1 radiculopathy may obscure the diagnosis. The combination of sharp anterior paramedian chest pain and numbness or weakness of the hand should prompt consideration of the diagnosis when cardiac ischemia or other more serious conditions have been ruled out.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1b2f5909]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Musculoskeletal disorders are common in patients referred to electrodiagnostic medicine specialists. Not all pain that radiates to the buttock, thigh, leg, or foot arises from compression of one or more lumbosacral spinal nerve root(s). Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders that may mimic radiculopathy is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing, potentially inappropriate invasive procedures, and to improve patient care and satisfaction.

Clinical symptoms

Pain

Eleven studies reported pain as selection criterion. One study reported that pain intensity should be above 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). One study mentioned using the inclusion criteria from another study.

The location of pain (arm and/or neck) was described in 11 studies as criterion, but in two studies the location 'cervicobrachial pain' and 'neck pain' was not further explained. Two studies solely reported arm pain to be present, of which one study stated that arm pain, with radiation distal to the elbow, plus at least provocation of arm pain by neck movements should be positive as selection criterion. Six studies included patients with neck pain and arm pain. In three of these studies, patients also had to have nerve root distribution of the pain for inclusion.

Five studies described the duration of pain as selection criterion. These studies included patients with pain duration of < 1 month, > 1 month, < 3 months, or > 3 months. The total range of duration of pain ranged from 1 month to 1 year, from 6 months to 1 year, or from 1 month to 2 years.

We concluded that there was consensus (11 out of 13 studies; 85%) on pain as a selection criterion, but no consensus on the exact location, intensity, or duration of pain. Only 6 out of 13 studies (46%) require both neck and arm pain to be simultaneously present.

Sensory symptoms

There were five studies which used sensory symptoms as selection criteria. One study mentioned using reflex disturbances, motor and sensory deficits, together with the distribution of pain, to determine the clinical level of radiculopathy.

Other inclusion criteria used were paraesthesia, numbness, and sensory changes. A definition of these terms or what the symptoms include was often not explicitly outlined.

Three studies provided information concerning the location of the sensory symptoms. The C7 dermatome, one or more adjacent dermatomes, and symptoms in unilateral upper extremity were mentioned. The exact location of the sensory symptoms was not further explained in any of the studies.

No study described whether the information on sensory symptoms was gathered during history taking or by physical examination. In conclusion, we found no consensus (5 out of 13; 38%) across the studies about sensory symptoms as a selection criterion.

### Idiopathic spinal cord herniation of the cervical cord: unusual cause of proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs [^39bdff47]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic spinal cord herniation (ISCH) is a recognised rare cause of progressive and potentially curable myelopathy. Around 170 cases have been described in the literature, all to be found between the T2 and T8 vertebrae. We report a case of ISCH in the cervical region. A 23-year-old man with no history of trauma presented with a 6-year history of bilateral mild resting hand tremor and left scapular pain radiating to the left arm for a duration of 8months. Nerve conduction studies showed some denervation changes of the upper limbs and bulbar regions. MRI of the spine showed anterior midline herniation of the spinal cord at the level of C7 vertebra with an associated collection of cerebrospinal fluid in the extradural space in the cervical region. Owing to the non-progressive nature of symptoms, currently the patient is managed conservatively.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^dc6f8b85]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy with headache — A prospective study with selective nerve root blocks (SNRB) in 275 patients found that of 275 total patients, 161 complained of headaches; immediately before injections, 161 (59%) had a headache exceeding 15 on the VAS. Following SNRB among the 161 patients, 101 (63%) experienced > 25% headache reduction, 93 (58%) reported greater than 50% reduction, and 66 experienced 100% relief, with levels represented as C4 3%, C5 11%, C6 52%, C7 29%, C8 5%. All patients with headaches had tender points in the neck/shoulder region ipsilateral to the radiculopathy, headaches were most often ipsilateral to the patients' radiculopathy, and a significant correlation was found between reduced headache and decreased neck/shoulder pain. Work group conclusions list Potential level: II and Downgraded level: III, and conclude that complaint of headache is a common symptom with C4 and lower nerve compression, and that SNRB can reduce headaches in a significant percentage of patients and was considered significant as a diagnostic tool.

### Cervical radiculopathy [^8c94f631]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disorder involving dysfunction of cervical nerve roots that commonly manifests as pain radiating from the neck into the distribution of the affected root. Acute cervical radiculopathy generally has a self-limited clinical course, with up to a 75% rate of spontaneous improvement. Thus, nonsurgical treatment is the appropriate initial approach for most patients. When nonsurgical treatment fails to relieve symptoms or if a significant neurologic deficit exists, surgical decompression may be necessary. Surgical outcomes for relief of arm pain range from 80% to 90% with either anterior or posterior approaches.

### Can compressive thoracic cord lesions cause a pure lower motor neurone syndrome? [^becb2e40]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A pure lower motor neurone syndrome affecting the upper limbs due to degenerative cervical spine disease is well described (cervical spondylotic amyotrophy); however, the existence of a similar syndrome affecting the lower limbs and due to thoracolumbar spinal cord compression is controversial.

Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy is characterised by weakness and wasting of the upper limbs without sensory or lower limb involvement. It can be further classified depending on the muscles involved into a proximal (scapular, deltoid and biceps) and a distal type (triceps forearm and hand). Radiologically, the proximal subtype corresponds to lesions at the C4/5 intervertebral level resulting in damage to anterior horn cells supplying C5/6 nerve root innervated muscles. The distal subtype corresponds to cord lesions at either C5/6 or C6/7 that affect anterior horn cells innervating C7–T1 nerve root innervated muscles. These anatomical correlations help explain the pathomechanism of disease for the two cases reported in which the cord lesion is at T11/12 but the muscles affected are innervated by nerve roots L2–S1.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^1edb62d5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### T1-T2 disk herniation presenting with horner syndrome: a case report with literary review [^808f34e0]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Horner syndrome or oculosympathetic paresis is caused by interruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the face and eye that manifests as facial anhidrosis, blepharoptosis, and miosis. This sympathetic pathway begins in the hypothalamus and synapses in the intermediolateral gray substance of the spinal cord at C8-T2 levels making it susceptible to disruption via a high thoracic intervertebral disk herniation. We present a rare case of a patient with T1-T2 intervertebral disk herniation and Horner syndrome who was treated surgically. After confirming the diagnosis with MRI, the patient was treated with standard posterior approach with laminoforaminotomy and diskectomy. Although posterior approach surgery is most commonly used for laminectomy and/or foraminotomy, successful anterior approaches to upper thoracic lesions are valid as well. Our patient had resolution of his back pain, paresthesias, and grip weakness at 6 weeks postoperatively, but his Horner syndrome persisted at latest follow-up. Patients with cervical radiculopathy symptoms and physical examination findings consistent with Horner syndrome should be evaluated with a MRI that includes the upper thoracic spine. An accurate diagnosis and timely surgical intervention may provide the patient the best chance for regression of symptoms and a satisfactory outcome.
