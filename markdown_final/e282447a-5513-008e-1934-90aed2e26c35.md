## Question

When to stop lactulose in cirrhosis patient with loose stools?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to stop lactulose in a cirrhosis patient who develops loose stools. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the therapeutic target for lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy and whether "loose stools" alone meet that target. Then, I should verify the risks of overtreatment and the clinical thresholds that warrant dose reduction versus discontinuation. Next, I will review guideline and FDA labeling language to anchor decision points. After that, I should consider special scenarios like acute kidney injury or palliative care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and confirm monitoring priorities and alternatives if lactulose is stopped.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic goal, because I need to ensure I'm not overreacting to stool consistency alone. Lactulose is titrated to achieve about 2–3 soft or semiformed bowel movements per day in hepatic encephalopathy, and "loose stools" can still be within that target if they are not excessive or watery, so I should not jump to stopping therapy just because stools are soft or slightly loose [^117NP6Mb] [^111LvfNU].

> Wait, let me verify the risks of going past the target. Excessive lactulose can cause dehydration, electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypernatremia, and even precipitate or worsen encephalopathy, so persistent diarrhea beyond the therapeutic range is a red flag that requires action rather than tolerance [^117NP6Mb] [^115Py8sa] [^115Py8sa] [^112he5Z6].

> I should confirm the clinical thresholds. I need to check for watery diarrhea, frequent stools beyond 3 per day, or accompanying symptoms like dizziness, orthostasis, cramping, or confusion, which suggest volume depletion or electrolyte shifts. In those cases, dose reduction is indicated, and if diarrhea persists despite stepwise dose reductions, discontinuation is appropriate [^117NP6Mb] [^112gQPMD].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose-adjustment sequence before stopping outright. The practical approach is to reduce the dose by about half initially, for example from 30 mL twice daily to 15 mL twice daily, and then further down to 10 mL twice daily if diarrhea continues, with reassessment of stool frequency and consistency over 24–48 hours. If diarrhea persists at low doses, stopping lactulose is reasonable [^112zossv].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special situation where diarrhea is particularly dangerous. In acute kidney injury or hepatorenal physiology, I should lower or stop lactulose promptly to avoid worsening intravascular depletion and electrolyte losses, and in end-of-life or palliative contexts where incontinence and discomfort are major burdens, discontinuation is often preferred and guideline-supported [^113jZndV] [^112kvhnS].

> I need to ensure I am not missing an alternative explanation for the diarrhea. Let me consider precipitating factors such as infection, GI bleeding, or new medications, because correcting the precipitant may allow lactulose to be continued at a lower dose rather than stopped, and I should also remember that concomitant laxatives can confound stool patterns and should be minimized during lactulose titration [^113TpwTt] [^111TX8ve].

> Next, I should review what to do if lactulose is stopped. I should confirm that rifaximin can be continued or initiated as monotherapy in patients who cannot tolerate lactulose, recognizing that guidelines endorse rifaximin as an add-on after a second overt HE episode and that some patients may reasonably transition to rifaximin alone when lactulose is not tolerated, with attention to cost and access considerations [^115HfJEU] [^113d6v2E].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise approach and double-check it aligns with evidence. First, assess stool frequency and consistency and correlate with symptoms and vitals. If there are more than 3 watery stools per day or signs of dehydration or electrolyte disturbance, reduce the lactulose dose by 50% and monitor for 24–48 hours. If diarrhea persists at low dose, discontinue lactulose and reassess HE control. If diarrhea resolves with dose reduction, continue at the lowest effective dose to maintain 2–3 soft stools per day and monitor electrolytes if diarrhea was significant [^117NP6Mb] [^112FcBxJ].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities. After any dose change, I will check mental status, volume status, and electrolytes within 24–48 hours, and if lactulose is stopped, I will increase surveillance for HE recurrence and consider adding rifaximin or using rectal lactulose temporarily if HE recurs and oral therapy is not tolerated, while also educating the patient and caregivers to report changes in stool pattern promptly [^117NP6Mb] [^115K2YUs].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not stop lactulose for "loose stools" that still meet the therapeutic target of 2–3 soft stools per day. Instead, I should reduce the dose when stools are frequent or watery, and discontinue only if diarrhea persists despite stepwise reductions or if the clinical context makes continuation unsafe, with rifaximin as a viable alternative for maintenance when lactulose is not tolerated [^117NP6Mb] [^111LvfNU] [^113d6v2E].

---

Stop lactulose in cirrhosis patients with **loose stools** when diarrhea is persistent (> 3 loose stools/day for > 48 hours) [^112FcBxJ], causes dehydration, electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia, hyponatremia) [^115Py8sa], or worsens encephalopathy [^117NP6Mb]. First, reduce the dose to the lowest effective amount that maintains 2–3 soft stools/day [^117NP6Mb]; if diarrhea persists, stop lactulose and monitor for HE recurrence. Resume lactulose at a lower dose once stools normalize, and consider rifaximin monotherapy if lactulose is not tolerated [^113d6v2E].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized titration** of lactulose to maintain 2–3 soft stools/day [^111LvfNU], balancing efficacy with tolerability [^117NP6Mb]. The AASLD/EASL guideline advises initiating lactulose and titrating to 2–3 soft stools/day, while monitoring for adverse effects such as dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and perianal irritation [^117NP6Mb]. EASL 2022 similarly recommends lactulose titration to 2–3 bowel movements/day for secondary prophylaxis after an overt HE episode [^111LvfNU].

---

## Indications for stopping lactulose due to loose stools

While lactulose-induced diarrhea is common, **persistent or severe diarrhea** can cause significant complications in cirrhosis patients. Indications to stop lactulose include:

- **Persistent diarrhea**: More than 3 loose stools per day for more than 48 hours despite dose reduction [^notfound].
- **Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance**: Development of dehydration, hypokalemia, or hyponatremia due to excessive fluid loss [^1134NbfM].
- **Worsening encephalopathy**: Diarrhea-induced electrolyte disturbances or dehydration exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy [^notfound].
- **Patient intolerance**: Severe abdominal discomfort, cramping, or perianal irritation significantly impacting quality of life [^112oLHKC].

---

## Risks associated with continued lactulose use in patients with loose stools

Continued lactulose use in patients with persistent loose stools can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances**: Excessive fluid loss can cause dehydration, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia, worsening hepatic encephalopathy and increasing morbidity [^1134NbfM].
- **Worsening hepatic encephalopathy**: Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration can precipitate or worsen encephalopathy, leading to increased hospitalizations and mortality [^113TpwTt].
- **Malnutrition**: Chronic diarrhea can impair nutrient absorption, exacerbating malnutrition common in cirrhosis patients [^notfound].
- **Impaired quality of life**: Persistent diarrhea and associated symptoms significantly impact patient comfort and adherence to therapy [^112oLHKC].

## Clinical approach to managing loose stools in cirrhosis patients on lactulose

A **stepwise approach** is recommended for managing loose stools in cirrhosis patients receiving lactulose:

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Reduce lactulose dose to the lowest effective amount that maintains 2–3 soft stools/day | Minimize diarrhea while maintaining therapeutic efficacy [^117NP6Mb] |
| 2 | Monitor stool frequency, consistency, and patient symptoms closely | Early detection of persistent diarrhea or complications [^notfound] |
| 3 | If diarrhea persists (> 3 loose stools/day for > 48 hours) despite dose reduction, discontinue lactulose temporarily | Prevent dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and worsening encephalopathy [^1134NbfM] |
| 4 | Address precipitating factors (e.g. dietary changes, infections, medications) | Identify and manage reversible causes of diarrhea [^113TpwTt] |
| 5 | Resume lactulose at a lower dose once stools normalize | Maintain therapeutic control of hepatic encephalopathy [^111LvfNU] |
| 6 | Consider alternative therapies (e.g. rifaximin monotherapy) if lactulose intolerance persists | Provide effective HE prophylaxis without gastrointestinal side effects [^113d6v2E] |

---

## Alternative therapies and strategies

When lactulose is stopped due to persistent diarrhea, **alternative therapies** should be considered to maintain control of hepatic encephalopathy:

- **Rifaximin**: A nonabsorbable antibiotic, rifaximin is recommended as an adjunct to lactulose for secondary prophylaxis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. It is generally well-tolerated and can be used as monotherapy in patients intolerant to lactulose [^115HfJEU] [^113d6v2E].
- **Polyethylene glycol (PEG)**: Recent studies suggest PEG may be effective in acute hepatic encephalopathy, though further validation is needed before routine use [^113JqjUR].
- **Dietary modifications**: Small, frequent meals with adequate protein intake and nighttime snacks can help manage hepatic encephalopathy and improve nutritional status [^117PMsMf].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential when adjusting lactulose therapy in cirrhosis patients with loose stools. Key parameters include **stool frequency and consistency** (target 2–3 soft stools/day) [^117NP6Mb], electrolytes (potassium, sodium) to detect imbalances from diarrhea [^1134NbfM], and mental status for signs of recurrent or worsening encephalopathy [^111f2sog]. Patient education should emphasize adherence, recognition of adverse effects, and when to seek medical attention [^112kvhnS].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Reduce dose**: Reduce lactulose to the lowest effective dose maintaining 2–3 soft stools/day [^117NP6Mb].
- **Stop if persistent**: Stop lactulose if diarrhea persists (> 3 loose stools/day for > 48 hours) despite dose reduction [^notfound].
- **Monitor closely**: Monitor for dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and worsening encephalopathy [^1134NbfM].
- **Resume cautiously**: Resume lactulose at a lower dose once stools normalize [^notfound].
- **Consider alternatives**: Use rifaximin or other alternatives if lactulose intolerance persists [^113d6v2E].

---

Stopping lactulose in cirrhosis patients with loose stools is indicated when diarrhea is persistent, causes dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, or worsens encephalopathy. A **stepwise approach** — dose reduction, monitoring, and temporary cessation — is recommended, with alternative therapies such as rifaximin considered if lactulose intolerance persists.

Hepatic encephalopathy — lactulose dosing and safety — lactulose dosing should be initiated when the three first elements of the four-pronged approach are completed, using 25 mL of lactulose syrup every 1–2 hours until at least two soft or loose bowel movements per day, and subsequently titrated to maintain two to three bowel movements per day; overuse can cause aspiration, dehydration, hypernatremia, severe perianal skin irritation, and can precipitate HE. Lactulose is the first choice for treatment of episodic OHE (GRADE II-1, B, 1).

Lactulose alone

Three large single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) safety/tolerability of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics and/or no therapy. In a primary prophylaxis study, in which patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of OHE were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months, all patients treated with lactulose remained adherent to treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) with lactulose were diarrhea, distaste to lactulose and abdominal bloating, which improved following reduction of lactulose dosing. In a secondary prophylaxis study, in which patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64) or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months, all lactulose patients remained adherent to treatment. AEs in the lactulose group again comprised diarrhea, distaste to lactulose and abdominal bloating. Lactulose dosing was reduced in these patients but not stopped. In the probiotics group, AEs comprised constipation and abdominal distension, which were managed with dietary advice and on-and-off use of proton pump inhibitors. In the no therapy group, only constipation was reported, which was managed with dietary modifications. Similar results were observed in another secondary prophylaxis study, in which patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. All patients remained adherent to lactulose therapy, and AEs in the lactulose group comprised diarrhea, distaste to lactulose and abdominal bloating. Lactulose dosing was decreased in these patients but not stopped. In the placebo group, the only AE was constipation, which was managed with dietary modifications.

Results

Baseline stool specimens were collected from 35 patients with cirrhosis (median [range] age: 42 [29–65] years; 26 male; body mass index: 22.8 [17.3–32.3] Kg/m 2) and 18 controls (44.5 [24–67] y; male 14; 23.3 [20.0–25.0] Kg/m 2); the clinical and laboratory findings for patients are summarized in Table 2. Thirty of them received regular lactulose administration as a part of standard of care, and 21 of these 30 patients provided repeat stool specimens after lactulose administration for a median of 55 (42–77) days. The baseline characteristics of these 21 patients were similar to those of 14 patients for whom repeat specimens were not available, because they did not receive lactulose, were lost to follow-up, received a proton-pump inhibitor or an antibiotic during the intervening period, or had a clinical worsening or required hospitalization (Additional file 1: Table S1).

### Lactulose (Enulose) [^112FcBxJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oral

Adult: The usual adult, oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 ml, containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.

Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of Lactulose may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal-systemic encephalopathy. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose of lactulose may then be reduced to the recommended daily dose.

Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours but may not begin before 48 hours or even later.

Continuous long-term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy. The dose of lactulose for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose.

Pediatric

Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded. As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2.5 to 10 mL in divided doses.

For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 ml. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued.

Rectal

When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists, or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses, lactulose solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. Cleansing enemas containing soapsuds or other alkaline agents should not be used.

Three hundred mL of lactulose solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes. Lactulose enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours. If the enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly, it may be repeated immediately.

The goal of treatment is reversal of the coma stage in order that the patient may be able to take oral medication. Reversal of coma may take place within 2 hours of the first enema in some patients. Lactulose, given orally in the recommended doses, should be started before Lactulose by enema is stopped entirely.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112kvhnS]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

HE — palliative aspects highlight education, advance care planning, and individualized therapy choices at end of life. HE is a common symptom in patients with cirrhosis with neuropsychiatric manifestations including disturbances in sleep, mood, wakefulness, and cognition, and patients and caregivers face profound psychological, physical, and financial burdens. Education about medication administration, dose titration, and the waxing and waning course can alleviate burdens; clinicians are encouraged to discuss supportive care services and ensure a surrogate decision maker is identified and documented before onset. Although rifaximin and lactulose are standard, at the end of life preferences and tolerance may change; lactulose is associated with bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and some may prefer polyethylene glycol or discontinuation to avoid incontinence. If rifaximin is unavailable in hospice due to cost, off-label neomycin or metronidazole may be considered as an alternative to rifaximin, and zinc repletion, branched-chain amino acids, probiotics, and possibly carnitine can be offered as adjuvant therapies. Guidance states that evaluating reversible causes and addressing HE can benefit both patient and caregiver quality of life.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^113TpwTt]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Precipitating factors for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis — common HE precipitants include infections, GI bleeding, electrolyte disorders, acute kidney injury (AKI), alkalosis, dehydration, constipation, under or overuse of lactulose, and use of central nervous system depressant sedatives; early empiric antibiotics are reasonable among patients at high risk of infections or in whom infections are likely; GI bleeding should be investigated and treated promptly, and prompt identification and treatment of kidney injury and electrolyte disorders are important.

### Lactulose (Generlac) [^111TX8ve]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Since Generlac Solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL), it should be used with caution in diabetics.

In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g., hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required.

Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.

Drug Interactions

There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy.

Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with Generlac Solution.

Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portalsystemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate Generlac Solution dosage has been achieved.

### Prevention of hepatic encephalopathy by administration of rifaximin and lactulose in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): a multicentre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial (PEARL trial) [^111k1XHH]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Training and monitoring

Study staff members at participating sites are trained during an initiation visit to ensure that study procedures are carried out uniformly. The study is monitored by the Clinical Research Unit of the Amsterdam University Medical Centres. A full monitoring plan is available. Multiple site visits will take place for source data verification and to verify adherence to the study protocol and its procedures.

Safety

Both investigational medicinal products used in this trial are safe and effective for (cirrhotic) patients and widely used. Known side effects of lactulose are abdominal bloating and diarrhoea. These side effects are highly dosage dependent. Lactulose should therefore be initially administered two times per day 25 mL, or in case of a study subject already is being treated with lactulose, that dose will be used to minimise side effects. If lactulose-related side effects occur, a step-down approach is in place to minimise these unwanted side effects, as described in the intervention paragraph.

In the case that OHE grade 3 (somnolent but responsive to verbal stimuli) occurs for the first time, patients will be treated with standard care (eg, increase of lactulose), as add-on to the study medication.

In the case that OHE grade 4 (coma) occurs, study medication will be temporarily discontinued and restarted as soon as possible after recovery of the HE episode.

In the case that a patient develops a second episode of OHE, allocation will be deblinded since patients will otherwise might be withheld from standard of care.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility

There are no known human data on log-term potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility. There are no known animal data on long-term potential for mutagenicity. Administration of lactulose solution in the diet of mice for 18 months in concentrations of 3 and 10 percent (v/w) did not produce any evidence of carcinogenicity.

In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects; Pregnancy Category B.

Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 2 or 4 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Randomisation and concealment of allocation

After the screening visit, eligible study subjects will be stratified for MELD score < 10 and > 10. Study subjects are stratified randomised to the treatment or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation with random blocks of sizes 4, 6 or 8 is performed by Castor Electronic Data Capture (Ciwit B.V. The Netherlands) in an automated way and sent to the local clinical trial pharmacy. Neither the treating physician nor the patient is aware of the randomisation result. Deblinding is possible in the case standard of care that might be withheld (see safety paragraph).

Intervention

Rifaximin 550 mg two times per day will be prescribed, in combination with a starting dose of 25 mL lactulose two times per day and further dependent on the amount of daily bowel movements, with the objective of two soft stools per day. In the case of a study subject already being treated with lactulose, that dose will be used. Intervention will start 72 hours before TIPS placement and will last till 3 months after TIPS placement. The control group will receive placebo in combination with lactulose (as described above).

In the event of lactulose-related diarrhoea, dosage will be lowered to 10 mL two times a day. If diarrhoea persists: dosage is lowered to 5 mL two times a day. Once subjects have no diarrhoea anymore, dosage can be increased, with the objective to achieve two soft stools a day.

Outcome measures and study procedures

Primary outcome

The development of OHE within 3 months after covered TIPS placement is determined by the West Haven criteria.

Secondary outcomes

Ninety-day mortality; development of a second episode of OHE within the first 3 months; development of OHE in the period between 3 and 12 months after covered TIPS placement; development of MHE between covered TIPS placement and 12 months after placement; time to development of OHE or MHE episodes; increase in the PHES, S-ANT1 score and LFI compared with baseline. Difference in the composition of portal blood samples, drawn at TIPS placement. TIPS placement data will be recorded. Furthermore, quality of life will be assessed by the Liver Disease Symptom Index V.2.0 (LDSI V.2.0) and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. Costs will include costs of healthcare, productivity loss due to sick leave from work and out-of-pocket expenses.

Pain control in cirrhosis — "Opiates should generally be used at lower than standard doses and at longer dosing intervals than in the general population", and although randomized trials are lacking, "hydromorphone and fentanyl may be the preferred agents". For anxiolysis/sedation, "only short-acting benzodiazepines such as midazolam should be used". For non-opioid analgesia, "Tramadol… or acetaminophen, at a dose of no more than 2 g daily, is also recommended", whereas "routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can impair renal blood flow in patients with cirrhosis", is cautioned and "oral combination products… especially when combined with an opioid, should not be used". Postoperative encephalopathy prevention includes bowel care: "Avoid constipation… ", "Polyethylene glycol solution may be used daily", and "rifaximin may be preferable… because it generally causes less bowel distention than lactulose".

### Lactulose (Enulose) [^111WsFrD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Since lactulose solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL) it should be used with caution in diabetics.

In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g., hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required.

Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.

Drug Interactions

There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy.

Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose.

Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate lactulose dosage has been achieved.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

There are no known human data on long-term potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility.

There are no known animal data on long-term potential for mutagenicity.

Administration of lactulose solution in the diet of mice for 18 months in concentrations of 3 and 10 percent (v/w) did not produce any evidence of carcinogenicity.

In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Pregnancy category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 2 or 4 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls (15 to 30 mL, containing 10 g to 20 g of lactulose) daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement.

Note: Some patients have found that lactulose solution may be more acceptable when mixed with fruit juice, water or milk.

### Bowel movement frequency is not linked with cognitive function in cirrhosis [^111DtcWR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The spectrum of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) ranges from overt HE (OHE) to cognitive impairment (ie, covert) HE (CHE). 1 The first-line therapy is lactulose, which is titrated to achieve ~2–3 soft/loose daily bowel movements (BM). This metric is considered dogma for practitioners despite erratic results, GI adverse events, and poor tolerance in Western countries. 1 There are logistic barriers for the widespread uptake of rifaximin, the second-line therapy. Moreover, although BM frequency-directed dose titration of lactulose is the usual practice, its impact on objective cognitive performance is unclear. Our aim is to determine the impact of BM frequency on cognition in patients with/without prior OHE.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^114FjXiE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In a recent randomized controlled study, Rahimi et al. compared the effect of lactulose on HE with that of polyethylene glycol, which has a laxative effect but is not expected to alter the gut microbiota. They found the two treatments to be equally effective. This is in consonance with our finding that the effect of lactulose is not mediated by a modulation of gut microbiota and may be related simply to its laxative action.

Our data have some limitations. First, we used faecal specimens to study the gut microbiota. Bacterial composition of faeces may differ somewhat from luminal contents of the colon, particularly in the proximal colon, where most of the ammonia or other toxic substances may be produced. However, sampling the colonic luminal contents, e.g. using an endoscope, requires prior cleansing of the gut, which would disrupt the luminal microbiota per se. Second, the diet of patients with cirrhosis may differ from that in healthy persons; this may by itself influence the gut microbiota. Also, alcohol consumption is known to alter gut microbiota. To obviate this, we excluded persons with recent alcohol intake from our study. Third, our study included patients with liver disease of varied causes and severity; this variability may have limited its ability to detect differences between patients with liver cirrhosis and controls. To obviate this problem, it may be useful in the future studies to include a more homogeneous patient group. And, finally, it may be argued that the number of patients in whom we studied the effect of lactulose on gut microbiota was small. However, this component of our study had a paired design, in which each patient serves as his own control, with a higher sensitivity for detecting even minor changes. Also, on a positive note, we ensured that the dose and duration of lactulose administration were adequate.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^112b6aDo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the multicenter, retrospective, observational IMPRESS study of 207 patients with HE (all of whom were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg and 84% of whom received concomitant lactulose), 4.3% of patients had documented AEs, most commonly C. difficile infection (n = 4) and rash (n = 2). No serious AEs were reported. Of the four patients who developed C. difficile infection, none had a history of C. difficile and none was on concomitant antibiotics. All patients continued rifaximin therapy. In a single-center, retrospective, cohort study that compared the effectiveness of rifaximin (600 mg, twice daily)+lactulose (n = 318) versus lactulose alone (n = 724) in patients with cirrhosis-related HE who either did or did not have HCC, C. difficile infection rates were 0.3% with rifaximin+lactulose versus 1.0% with lactulose alone, over a median follow-up duration of 18.0 months in patients without HCC and 4.4 months in patients with HCC. In a multicenter, retrospective chart review of 211 patients treated with rifaximin (mean: 1055 mg/day; range: 600–1600 mg/day), in addition to lactulose, over a mean follow-up duration of 250 days, 8% of patients experienced diarrhea but none experienced C. difficile infection. All cases of diarrhea were resolved with standard antidiarrheal therapy, which was administered after stool analysis excluded C. difficile infection.

Direct head-to-head evidence of the long-term safety/tolerability of rifaximin versus lactulose is limited to a single-center, retrospective chart review, in which 145 patients diagnosed with HE received at least 6 months of treatment with lactulose before receiving at least 6 months of treatment with rifaximin (400 mg, three times daily). Outcomes were compared for the last 6 months of lactulose treatment versus the first 6 months of rifaximin treatment. The percentages of patients with diarrhea, flatulence and abdominal pain were significantly higher during the lactulose period than the rifaximin period (P < 0.001 for all). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with headache, which was the only other AE reported.

### Controlled diarrhea in the treatment of cirrhosis… [^115XHtg2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Fluid and electrolyte problems or ascites in patients with cirrhosis of the liver are usually managed by a combination of controlled dietary intake of fluid and sodium and enhancement of renal excretion. Occasionally, in severely ill patients oliguria develops or the kidneys are not responsive to diuretic agents. In an attempt to find an effective alternative to renal diuresis, the use of the intestinal tract to increase sodium or water loss from the body was examined. In 1933 Carr and Krantz1 observed that the oral feeding of mannitol to rats produced a marked diarrhea. Ellis and Krantz2 reported that the "threshold dose" for laxative effect in man was 10 to 20 gm of orally administered mannitol. According to information furnished by the Pharmacology Branch and on file with the Federal Drug Administration, the manufacturer has found that approximately 14 gm of mannitol will produce diarrhea in man.

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^115igLtm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

1. Acute Encephalopathy in Cirrhosis A. GENERAL MEASURES. Tracheal intubation in patients with deep encephalopathy should be considered. A nasogastric tube is placed for patients in deep encephalopathy. Avoid sedatives whenever possible. Correction of the precipitating factor is the most important measure. B. SPECIFIC MEASURES i. Nutrition. In case of deep encephalopathy, oral intake is withheld for 24–48 h and i.v. glucose is provided until improvement. Enteral nutrition can be started if the patient appears unable to eat after this period. Protein intake begins at a dose of 0.5 g/kg/day, with progressive increase to 1–1.5 g/kg/day. ii. Lactulose is administered via enema or nasogastric tube in deep encephalopathy. The oral route is optimized by dosing every hour until stool evacuation appears. Lactulose can be replaced by oral neomycin. iii. Flumazenil may be used in selected cases of suspected benzodiazepine use. 2. Chronic Encephalopathy in Cirrhosis i. Avoidance and prevention of precipitating factors, including the institution of prophylactic measures. ii. Nutrition. Improve protein intake by feeding dairy products and vegetable-based diets. Oral branched-chain amino acids can be considered for individuals intolerant of all protein. iii. Lactulose. Dosing aims at two to three soft bowel movements per day. Antibiotics are reserved for patients who respond poorly to disaccharides or who do not exhibit diarrhea or acidification of the stool. Chronic antibiotic use (neomycin, metronidazole) requires careful renal, neurological, and/or otological monitoring. iv. Refer for liver transplantation in appropriate candidates. For problematic encephalopathy (nonresponsive to therapy), consider imaging of splanchnic vessels to identify large spontaneous portal-systemic shunts potentially amenable to radiological occlusion. In addition, consider the combination of lactulose and neomycin, addition of oral zinc, and invasive approaches, such as occlusion of TIPS or surgical shunts, if present. Minimal or Subclinical Encephalopathy Treatment can be instituted in selected cases. The most characteristic neuropsychological deficits in patients with cirrhosis are in motor and attentional skills (60). Although these may impact the ability to perform daily activities, many subjects can compensate for these defects. Recent studies suggest a small but significant impact of these abnormalities on patients' quality of life (61), including difficulties with sleep (62). In patients with significant deficits or complaints, a therapeutic program based on dietary manipulations and/or nonabsorbable disaccharides may be tried. Benzodiazepines should not be used for patients with sleep difficulties.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^111Mq5RZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

It would have been interesting to compare the gut flora in patients developing HE despite lactulose treatment versus those who did not develop this complication. However, this was not possible since we did not encounter HE in any of our patients receiving lactulose.

Finally, our data do not rule out the possibility that lactulose may affect the balance of production and utilization of ammonia without changing the species composition of gut microbiota. For instance, lactulose or one of its breakdown products could alter the expression or activity of enzymes in one or more bacterial species without affecting their density or number. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing technique which we used is not able to pick up such changes. This aspect may be studied further in future studies using either shot-gun sequencing of gut bacterial transcriptome or using a metabolomic analysis of fecal water or urine.

### Cirrhosis: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112Awd3N]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. It accounted for 29,165 deaths in 2007, with a mortality rate of 9.7 per 100,000 persons. Alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis are the most common causes of cirrhosis, although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is emerging as an increasingly important cause. Primary care physicians share responsibility with specialists in managing the most common complications of the disease, screening for hepatocellular carcinoma, and preparing patients for referral to a transplant center. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma with imaging studies every six to 12 months. Causes of hepatic encephalopathy include constipation, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and noncompliance with medical therapy. These should be sought and managed before instituting the use of lactulose or rifaximin, which is aimed at reducing serum ammonia levels. Ascites should be treated initially with salt restriction and diuresis. Patients with acute episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding should be monitored in an intensive care unit, and should have endoscopy performed within 24 hours. Physicians should also be vigilant for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Treating alcohol abuse, screening for viral hepatitis, and controlling risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are mechanisms by which the primary care physician can reduce the incidence of cirrhosis.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^115bkiFc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Subjects

Patients with cirrhosis, irrespective of the cause or severity of liver dysfunction, measured using Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, and with no co-existing disease, were enrolled from the outpatient clinic of our institution between October 2013 and April 2014. Diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on a combination of typical clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and radiological findings. Patients who had taken drugs that can influence the gut microbiota, such as gastric acid suppressants, antimicrobial agents, probiotics, non-absorbable disaccharides (such as lactulose) or those that alter gastrointestinal motility, or complementary or alternative medicines, in the previous 6 weeks, were excluded. Since we also aimed to study the effect of lactulose on gut microbiota, we particularly included those patients who were likely to be prescribed lactulose, as a prophylaxis against HE in view of CTP class B or C disease.

For each patient, one stool specimen was collected at enrollment. For patients who received lactulose, a second specimen was collected after 6 weeks of lactulose administration (in a dose of 30–60 ml/day, adjusted to obtain 2–3 semisolid stools daily); any patient who had worsening of clinical condition, or received another medication or required hospitalization was excluded.

In addition, a group of healthy adult volunteers, with similar age and gender distribution, were recruited as controls from among family members of other patients presenting with minor illnesses (so that they were similar to the patients in terms of socioeconomic status, diet, lifestyle, habits, etc). The prospective control subjects underwent recording of clinical history and a physical examination by a physician, and those with any current symptom/illness or any significant previous illness, and those receiving any drug likely to affect gut microbiota were excluded. Each control subject provided one stool specimen.

The subjects, both patients and controls, collected a stool specimen in a wide-mouthed container at site (in the hospital) and placed it immediately in a box containing cool-packs which had been frozen at −80 °C. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow and each participant provided informed consent.

### Prevention of hepatic encephalopathy by administration of rifaximin and lactulose in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): a multicentre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial (PEARL trial) [^111cfwfY]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy

HE is a common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis and is associated with profound loss of quality of life. HE is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting; it manifests as a wide spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities ranging from subclinical alterations to coma.HE is classified using the West-Haven criteria: minimal HE (MHE), covert HE (grade I) or overt HE (OHE, grades II–IV).MHE is subtle cognitive impairment that is difficult to detect clinically and only by psychometric testing. The psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) and simplified one min animal naming test (S-ANT1) are two validated instruments to measure MHE.PHES exists of a line tracing test, digit symbol test, serial dotting test and a number connection test.S-ANT1 is a 1 min test in which patients name as many animals as possible. The outcome of this test was validated to score MHE.OHE presents with a varying severity and symptoms as disorientation, motor dysfunctions, abnormalities in behaviour, intellectual functions and consciousness. Thirty to forty-five per cent of patients with liver cirrhosis develop OHE during the course of their disease.HE leads to a prolonged duration of hospital admissions, an increased number of primary care contacts, an impaired quality of life and increased mortality.

Treatment and prevention of OHE

The initial treatment of OHE is non-absorbable disaccharides like lactulose. The dosing of lactulose should be initiated with 25 mL of lactulose every 12 hours and the dose should be titrated to achieve two soft or loose bowel movements per day. The working mechanism of lactulose is not fully understood, but it is assumed that the prebiotic effects and acidifying nature of lactulose have an additional benefit beyond the laxative effect.

There is currently no treatment registered for primary prevention of HE. Secondary prevention of HE can be achieved by combination therapy of lactulose with rifaximin, a poorly absorbed antibiotic. In the Netherlands, rifaximin has been approved since 2016 and will be reimbursed only to prevent a third (or following) episode of OHE.

### Lactulose therapy for patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and poor patient-reported outcomes: the Mi-kristal trial [^112pw1mi]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Poor patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are common in cirrhosis, including poor sleep and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). HE is a major driver of poor PROs. Many clinicians initiate lactulose therapy to address poor PROs. PRO-triggered therapy, however, has not been studied till date.

Methods

We conducted a 28-day randomized trial of crystalline lactulose therapy (20 g BID) compared with no HE-directed therapy in 52 patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, no prior HE, and high Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scores (0–10) attributed to cirrhosis. The primary outcome was change in global HRQOL measured with Short Form-8 Health Survey. Secondary outcomes included change in Animal Naming Test score, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment, and sleep quality (scored "very bad" to "very good").

Approach and Results

Overall, 52 patients underwent randomization; 3 subjects withdrew from the crystalline lactulose arm (1 before medication initiation, 1 due to an unrelated condition, and 1 due to high baseline bowel movements). The average age was 60 years, the average Model for Endstage Liver Disease-Sodium score was 10.5, and 56% of the patients had ascites. Baseline bowel movements were 2.3/day, with 35% of the patients having Bristol Stool Scale > 4. At 28 days, there was no improvement in HRQOL: patients receiving crystalline lactulose had an 8.1-point (95% CI: 3.7–12.4) increase compared with 6.6 (95% CI: 2.3–10.8) in the control group (p = 0.6). Lactulose was associated with a significantly (p = 0.002) increased Animal Naming Test score (3.7, 95% CI: 2.1–5.4) versus the control group (0.2, 95% CI: -1.7, 1.4). Lactulose users reported more good sleep (92% vs. 52%, p = 0.001) and lower activity impairment (3.0 vs. 4.8, p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Lactulose improves sleep and activity impairment in patients with poor PROs. We did not observe any improvement in global HRQOL after 28 days using the Short Form-8 Health Survey instrument.

Encephalopathy (delirium)

Encephalopathy is another common complication in patients with cirrhosis. A careful assessment of the cause of encephalopathy should be undertaken looking for causes such as infection, electrolyte disturbance, occult bleeding, constipation or sedative drugs. For patients with grade 4 encephalopathy (coma) consider orotracheal intubation to reduce the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. In conscious patients, oral lactulose (20 mL–30 mL four times per day) should be administered aiming for 2 soft stools per day. For patients with a reduced conscious level, phosphate enemas or lactulose administered by nasogastric tube should be considered. Consider a CT head examination in patients where the confusion is unexplained to exclude intracranial pathology, such as subdural haematoma.

Other considerations

In the recent UK audit of blood component use in cirrhosis, thrombotic events occurred in 3% of patients. Thromboprophylaxis with low-dose, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is therefore recommended to reduce the risk of thrombosis, unless the patient is bleeding or has a platelet count less than 50×10⁹/L. Recent evidence suggests that even with apparent abnormalities on blood testing suggestive of a hypocoagulable state (prolonged prothrombin time), patients with cirrhosis typically have normal clot-forming capacity provided the platelet count is > 50×10⁹/L, and some patients with advanced cirrhosis are actually hypercoagulable. Changes in the balance of the hepatic production of procoagulant and anticoagulant blood clotting factors in cirrhosis are believed to be responsible for this phenomenon. Although thromboprophylaxis with LMWH has not been specifically trialled in hospitalised patients with decompensated cirrhosis to prevent thromboembolism, a previous study demonstrated that the administration of enoxaparin 4000 µ/day for 48 weeks reduced the risk of portal vein thrombosis, liver decompensation and mortality, and no haemorrhagic side effects were seen.

### Lactulose solution, USP for oral administration Rx ONLY… [^116D4ReY]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

oral doses of lactulose reach the colon virtually unchanged. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid, and also to small amounts of formic and acetic acids, by the action of colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents. This in turn causes an increase in stool. water content and softens the stool. Since lactulose does not exert its effect until it reaches the colon, and since transit time through the colon may be slow, 24 to 48 hours may be required to produce the desired bowel movement. 12 22 11. Lactulose given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours. INDICATION AND USAGE For the treatment of constipation. In patients with a history of chronic constipation.

lactulose solution therapy increases the number of bowel movements per day and the number of days on which bowel movements occur. CONTRAINDICTIONS Since lactulose solution contains galactose, it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet. with lactulose, patients on lactulose therapy undergoing such procedures should have a thorough bowel cleansing with a non-fermentable solution. Insufflation of CO as an additional safeguard may be pursued but is considered to be a redundant measure. PRECAUTIONS General Since lactulose solution contains galactose and lactose it should be used with caution in diabetics. Information for Patients In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician. Laboratory Tests Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose for more than six months should have serum electrolytes measured periodically.

The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^112oLHKC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

For chronic conditions such as HE, the success of treatment is dependent on its tolerability, as patients will only adhere to treatment if they are able to tolerate it over the long term. Long-term tolerability problems, such as adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, also have a major effect on health-related quality of life. In the case of lactulose, tolerability is a major clinical consideration. In a study of 137 patients who received long-term secondary prophylaxis with lactulose, 75% experienced OHE recurrence, and this was associated with lactulose nonadherence in 38% of these patients, mainly because of gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as unpredictable diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating. Crucially, all patients who were nonadherent on lactulose therapy, and nearly two-thirds of those who were adherent, experienced OHE recurrence. There is evidence to suggest that patient acceptance of lactulose is influenced by sociocultural factors; for example, in a recent survey of 100 outpatients with cirrhosis from India and the USA, who did not have previous or current experience with lactulose but who underwent dedicated education about its use for HE prevention, a significantly higher proportion of Indian versus US patients agreed to accept lactulose treatment. In this context, it is perhaps noteworthy that a substantial number of the lactulose studies identified in this review were carried out in patients from the Indian subcontinent. Taken together, such findings highlight the need for additional, effective and better tolerated therapeutic options in the long-term management of HE, across all sociocultural patient groups.

"Once the diagnosis of AKI is established, the etiology of the AKI, be it hypovolemic AKI (prerenal azotemia), ATN, or HRS-AKI, is determined". "All diuretics should be withdrawn, and lactulose dosage adjusted to reduce severity of diarrhea". A fluid challenge is specified: "A fluid challenge using albumin at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight to a maximum of 100 g should be administered". In bleeding, "Patients who have had significant blood loss should be given red blood cell transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL, although volume status must be monitored carefully, and overtransfusion should be avoided". For hypovolemia response criteria, "In hypovolemic AKI, volume replacement should be associated with a reduction in the serum creatinine to ≤ 0.3 mg/dL of the baseline level".

### When to use antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient? The evidence base [^111yoZxZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

However, there is no consensus regarding how long prophylactic oral antibiotic therapy should be continued to prevent SBP or its recurrence. Not surprisingly, prolonged antibiotic treatment is associated with the emergence of resistant organisms and alternative approaches are needed. Interestingly the preliminary results of a large double-blind randomized controlled trial has shown that pentoxifylline administered orally (1200 mg/day) significantly decreases the risk of bacterial infection in patients with advanced cirrhosis.

Hepatic encephalopathy with the increasing evidence for infection or the inflammatory responses in the progression and severity is another clinical situation in which antibiotics are indicated. Although neomycin has been used for many years in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, a randomized trial of 39 patients comparing neomycin at a dose of 6 g/day to placebo showed no difference in outcomes between the two treatment groups. Furthermore, neomycin is associated with ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, limiting long-term use. Other antibiotics, such as metronidazole, oral vancomycin, and rifaximin have been found to be effective in clinical trials and are better tolerated than neomycin. A meta-analysis of five controlled trials of rifaximin showed it had a similar efficacy as nonabsordable disaccharides for acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy, but was found to be better tolerated. Later placebo-controlled trials showed that rifaximin improved quality of life, and performance on a simulated driving test in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin remains currently a second-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, due to the major cost difference between rifaximin and lactulose, and because of the possible emergence of resistant strains and drug interactions. Thus, they are most suitable for patients who cannot tolerate or are resistant to disaccharides.

Opioid selection and safety in cirrhosis — when opioids are required, "prophylactic medications should be considered proactively to prevent constipation and encephalopathy (e.g., lactulose)", and "codeine, morphine, and tramadol should generally be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". "Tramadol is often inappropriately selected for first-line use in patients with cirrhosis because of the perception that it is not an opioid", yet it "has variable pharmacokinetics across persons with cirrhosis… and has notably unpredictable side effects, including hypoglycemia". For transdermal fentanyl, "The patch comes in set doses with the lowest option of a 12-μg/h patch, which may be too high for patients with cirrhosis", and "cachexia is a relative contraindication to transdermal fentanyl", while "methadone should only be used in consultation with a specialist". "First-line opioids for patients with cirrhosis generally include low-dose hydromorphone (e.g., 1 mg p.o. or 0.4 mg i.v.) or oxycodone (e.g., 2.5 mg p.o.) with extended dosing intervals". Initiation should follow best practices: "Prescribing clinicians should adhere to best practices for risk assessment, setting patient expectations, and monitoring when starting opioids", "first-line treatment should be a 7-day supply of low-dose, short-acting opioids", and "Patients require close follow-up", with risk factors assessed such as "past opioid use disorder" and "concurrent benzodiazepine use" or other prescriptions in "prescription drug monitoring program data".

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^115Lekho]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — postoperative portal hypertension and medication safety in cirrhosis advises the following: Aggressively avoid exacerbations of portal hypertension and associated complications in the postoperative period. Appropriate measures include close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of volume excess or depletion, and Excess volume can increase the risk of variceal and other portal hypertensive bleeding. Due to disturbed metabolism and elimination, patients with cirrhosis are at especially high risk for medication-related complications; generally, use opiates at lower doses and with longer dosing intervals than in the general population, use only short-acting benzodiazepines, and Avoidance of constipation should be a priority in the management of these patients to minimize flares of hepatic encephalopathy in the postoperative period, noting that In patients who can take medications orally, rifaximin generally causes less bowel distention than nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose). Avoid medications that might be toxic in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Do not use NSAIDs because they can impair renal blood flow, patients with cirrhosis can be susceptible to acetaminophen toxicity at doses lower than those that may cause toxicity in the general population, and Do not prescribe combination opiate/acetaminophen pain relievers to take home after surgery because the patient may be unaware of the presence of acetaminophen in various over-the-counter products and unintentional acetaminophen overdose and hepatotoxicity can result.

Recommendation 27

We recommend that patients with suspected portal hypertension should be screened for gastro-oesophageal varices according to BSG guidelines. (Strong; Moderate)

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

HE can be the cause of significant life quality impairment in patients with advanced disease but is relatively unusual in PBC (and should not be mistaken for the much commoner cognitive impairment associated with fatigue). Where present, HE in PBC characteristically affects older patients. The first-line management is with lactulose (at a dose achieving 2–3 soft stools per day). Some patients may require regular enemas in addition to lactulose. In any patient with HE, it is important to rule out secondary causes such as constipation, dehydration, infection and upper GI bleeding. For patients with refractory encephalopathy, rifaximin is frequently used and is now NICE approved. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that improves HE, reduces hospital admission rates due to HE and the incidence of recurrent HE. It must be remembered that patients with HE cannot drive.

### Non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo / no intervention and lactulose versus lactitol for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^113AU47Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-absorbable disaccharides (lactulose and lactitol) are recommended as first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. The previous (second) version of this review included 10 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and eight RCTs evaluating lactulose versus lactitol for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The review found no evidence to either support or refute the use of the non-absorbable disaccharides and no differences between lactulose versus lactitol.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of i) non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and ii) lactulose versus lactitol in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

Search Methods

We carried out electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to 19 October 2015; manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings; checks of bibliographies; and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We presented the results of meta-analyses as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of the evidence using 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) and bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains. Our analyses included regression analyses of publication bias and other small study effects, Trial Sequential Analyses to detect type 1 and type 2 errors, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included 38 RCTs with a total of 1828 participants. Eight RCTs had a low risk of bias in the assessment of mortality. All trials had a high risk of bias in the assessment of the remaining outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis showed a beneficial effect of non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention on mortality when including all RCTs with extractable data (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.87; 1487 participants; 24 RCTs; I(2) = 0%; moderate quality evidence) and in the eight RCTs with a low risk of bias (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97; 705 participants). The Trial Sequential Analysis with the relative risk reduction (RRR) reduced to 30% confirmed the findings when including all RCTs, but not when including only RCTs with a low risk of bias or when we reduced the RRR to 22%. Compared with placebo/no intervention, the non-absorbable disaccharides were associated with beneficial effects on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.69; 1415 participants; 22 RCTs; I(2) = 32%; moderate quality evidence). Additional analyses showed that non-absorbable disaccharides can help to reduce serious adverse events associated with the underlying liver disease including liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and variceal bleeding (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.60; 1487 participants; 24 RCTs; I(2) = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We confirmed the results in Trial Sequential Analysis. Tests for subgroup differences showed no statistical differences between RCTs evaluating prevention, overt, or minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The evaluation of secondary outcomes showed a potential beneficial effect of the non-absorbable disaccharides on quality of life, but we were not able to include the data in an overall meta-analysis (very low quality evidence). Non-absorbable disaccharides were associated with non-serious (mainly gastrointestinal) adverse events (very low quality evidence). None of the RCTs comparing lactulose versus lactitol evaluated quality of life. The review found no differences between lactulose and lactitol for the remaining outcomes (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review includes a large number of RCTs evaluating the prevention or treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The analyses found evidence that non-absorbable disaccharides may be associated with a beneficial effect on clinically relevant outcomes compared with placebo/no intervention.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111J8Cru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rifaximin with or without lactulose

Most rifaximin studies assessed the additional benefit of rifaximin prophylaxis as an adjunct to lactulose therapy. Compared with placebo+lactulose, NNT values (95% CIs) for rifaximin+lactulose as secondary prophylaxis for OHE recurrence were calculated to be 3.28 (2.27–5.90)and 4.21 (2.93–7.46)(Fig. 2).

A phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the effectiveness of rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily versus placebo for the prevention of OHE recurrence over 6 months in 299 patients with cirrhosis who had experienced at least two OHE episodes in the previous 6 months but who were currently in remission. More than 90% of patients in both treatment arms additionally received lactulose therapy. The rate of OHE recurrence was 22.1% with rifaximin versus 45.9% with placebo. The hazard ratio for the time to a breakthrough OHE episode for rifaximin versus placebo was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.28–0.64; P < 0.001), reflecting a relative risk reduction of 58% with rifaximin versus placebo. The rate of HE-related hospital readmission was 13.6% with rifaximin versus 22.6% with placebo, and the hazard ratio for time to first HE-related hospitalization for rifaximin versus placebo was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.87; P = 0.01), representing a 50% relative reduction in risk. In a subanalysis of this trial (n = 219), conducted primarily to assess health-related quality of life, the rate of OHE recurrence was 25.7% with rifaximin versus 50.0% with placebo, and HE remission was maintained for 6 months in 74.3% of patients treated with rifaximin versus 50.0% of those treated with placebo.

### Lactulose (Generlac) [^115K2YUs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oral

Adult

The usual adult oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 mL, containing 20 g to 30 g of Generlac Solution) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.

Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of Generlac Solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal-systemic encephalopathy. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose of Generlac Solution may then be reduced to the recommended daily dose. Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours but may not begin before 48 hours or even later.

Continuous long-term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy. The dose of Generlac Solution for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose.

Pediatric

Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded. As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2.5 to 10 mL in divided doses. For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 mL. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, Generlac Solution should be discontinued.

Rectal

When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists, or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses, Generlac Solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. Cleansing enemas containing soapsuds or other alkaline agents should not be used.

Three hundred mL of Generlac Solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes. Generlac Solution enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours. If the enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly, it may be repeated immediately.

The goal of treatment is reversal of the coma stage in order that the patient may be able to take oral medication. Reversal of coma may take place within 2 hours of the first enema in some patients. Generlac Solution, given orally in the recommended doses, should be started before Generlac Solution by enema is stopped entirely.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^117KbvnK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is characterized by fibrosis leading to altered liver architecture, resulting in marked reduction in its function and in portal hypertension. Patients with cirrhosis are prone to serious complications, such as variceal gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma, and an increased mortality.

Normal human gut is inhabited by several microorganisms, in particular bacteria. The number of bacterial cells in the intestinal lumen of an individual is of the order of that of human cells in the body. These bacteria perform several important physiologic functions, such as digestion of complex carbohydrates leading to energy salvage, synthesis of essential substances such as vitamin K, and modulation of mucosal and systemic immune responses. With its strategic placement between the bowel and the systemic circulation, liver acts as a filter and removes any bacteria and their harmful products that may enter the blood from the gut; the loss of this function in patients with cirrhosis may play a role in the occurrence of complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, sepsis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Modulation of gut microbiota using antimicrobial agents and probiotic preparations has been shown to improve HE; this suggests that intestinal bacteria play a role in the causation of HE. Lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, is another drug used for the prevention and treatment of HE. It cannot be digested by human intestinal enzymes, and reaches the colon unchanged where it is degraded by bacteria. It is believed that the resultant acidic environment changes the composition of the gut microbiota, with a reduction in the bacteria that produce ammonia and an increase in those that trap and use ammonia for their metabolism, ameliorating HE. In fact, in studies using stool culture, lactulose administration has been shown to alter the abundance of certain gut bacteria. However, culture-based techniques have several limitations. In particular, a majority of bacterial species inhabiting the gut can either not be cultured or not be reliably distinguished from other related bacteria. Further, these techniques are only qualitative or, at best, semi-quantitative. Thus, there is a need to study the effect of lactulose on the composition of gut microbiota using better techniques.

### Artificial intelligence evaluation of stool quality guides management of hepatic encephalopathy using a smartphone app [^113bAFQy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lactulose-based hepatic encephalopathy treatment requires bowel movements/day titration, which is improved with Bristol stool scale (BSS) incorporation. Dieta app evaluates artificial intelligence (AI)-based BSS (AI-BSS) with stool images. Initially, controls (N = 13) and cirrhosis patients on lactulose/not on lactulose (n = 33) were trained on the app. They entered self-reported BSS (self-BSS) with AI-BSS communicated. Lactulose dose changes were tracked. A subset (n = 12) was retested with AI communication blocked. Most subjects were comfortable with the app. Self/AI-BSS and lactulose dose/AI-BSS correlation increased with app use. AI-BSS communications improved insight into self-BSS over time. Dieta app to gauge stool AI characteristics was acceptable and increased insight into lactulose dose and BSS in cirrhosis.

Gut microbiota in patients with liver cirrhosis before and after lactulose use

Paired stool specimens, before and after lactulose, were available for 21 patients (median age: 45 [29–64] years; male 13; Child-Pugh class A: 7, B: 13, C: 1). Median [range] number of high-quality reads in their specimens before and after lactulose were similar (465,630 [131,802–1,231,311] versus 446,762 [159,321–1,022,517]). On PCoA, the distributions of data points for specimens collected before or after lactulose overlapped. Data points for specimens collected before and after lactulose for individual subjects were located close to each other (Fig. 4a); the weighted UniFrac distances between paired specimens were smaller than those between individual pre-lactulose specimens (Fig. 4b). None of the indices of alpha diversity showed a significant change following lactulose (Fig. 4c).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^114PP9FU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In a similarly designed single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 126 patients with cirrhosis who were admitted to hospital with an index OHE event, having experienced at least one other OHE event in the previous 6 months, were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg or placebo for 6 months, in addition to lactulose therapy. In this trial, rate of HE recurrence was 44.4% with rifaximin versus 36.5% with placebo (P = not significant), and the mortality rate was 11.1% in both treatment groups.

When examining long-term use specifically, patients completing the trial by Bass and colleagues were eligible to enter a phase III, multicenter, open-label maintenance study, in which patients received open-label treatment with rifaximin-α 550 mg for 24 months. In total, 392 patients were treated with rifaximin ('all-rifaximin' group), including 252 patients who received de novo treatment ('new-rifaximin' group). As in the initial trial, ~90% of patients were additionally treated with lactulose. The rates of HE-related hospitalization were 0.21 and 0.23 events/person-year of exposure (PYE) for the all-rifaximin and new-rifaximin groups, respectively. In the original trial, the corresponding values were 0.30 events/PYE for rifaximin versus 0.72 events/PYE for placebo (P < 0.0001). A post-hoc analysis of this study was conducted for 321 patients who had been treated for mean duration of 1.5 years. Data were compared between patients who had been newly recruited, having not participated in the original trial ('rifaximin-newly recruited' group), with those who received rifaximin in the original randomized controlled trial ('rifaximin-RCT' group) and those who received placebo in the original trial ('placebo-RCT' group). The rates of OHE recurrence were 772.1, 687.2 and 652.1 events/1000 person-years for the rifaximin-newly recruited, rifaximin-RCT and placebo-RCT groups, respectively (P = not significant between groups), and the corresponding mortality rates were 170.5, 134.1 and 168.5 events/1000 patient years, respectively (P = not significant between groups).

In a primary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of OHE were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. Lactulose significantly reduced the rate of OHE occurrence versus no lactulose (11 vs. 28%; P = 0.02) and reduced the median length of stay for HE-related hospitalization, although not significantly. In a secondary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64) or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. The rate of OHE recurrence was 26.5% with lactulose, 34.4% with probiotics and 56.9% with no therapy (lactulose vs. probiotics, P = not significant; lactulose vs. no therapy, P = 0.001; and probiotics vs. no therapy, P = 0.02). The mortality rate was 19.1, 17.2 and 24.6% for the lactulose, probiotics and no therapy groups, respectively (P = not significant between groups). In a similar secondary prophylaxis study, patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. Lactulose was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the rate of OHE recurrence (19.6 vs. 46.8%; P = 0.001) but not in reducing the rate of hospitalization for non-HE events or mortality.

Lactulose alone

In a single-center, retrospective, chart review of 137 patients who received lactulose for a mean duration of 27 ± 6 months after their first HE event, it was found that 75% of the patients experienced HE recurrence after 9 ± 1 months. The rate of HE-related hospital readmission was 73%, and the mortality rate was 34%. Thirty-nine (28.5%) patients had HE recurrence associated with lactulose nonadherence, mostly resulting from gastrointestinal adverse effects.

Several large single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics and/or no therapy. Compared with no treatment or placebo, the calculated NNT values [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for lactulose as secondary prophylaxis for OHE recurrence were 3.28 (2.15–6.90)and 3.68 (2.33–8.75)(Fig. 2).

### Bristol stool scale as a determinant of hepatic encephalopathy management in patients with cirrhosis [^111XsCUy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bowel movement (BM) frequency is used to titrate lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, stool consistency using the Bristol stool scale (BSS, 0–7) is often ignored.

Methods

The study included pre-BSS and post-BSS cohorts. BSS was incorporated into decision-making after training in outpatients with cirrhosis. Two to 3 BMs/d and BSS 3–4 were considered normal, whereas the rest were considered high or low; concordance between the metrics was evaluated. Medication changes and 6-month admissions were compared between this group (post-BSS) and a comparable previous group (pre-BSS). Concordance and regression analyses for all-cause admissions and HE-related admissions were performed, and comparisons were made for HE-related medication stability. In the longitudinal analysis, an outpatient group seen twice was analyzed for BSS and BMs.

Results

In the post-BSS cohort, 112 patients were included with only 46% BSS and BMs concordance and modest BSS/BMs correlation (r = 0.27, P = 0.005). Compared with a pre-BSS cohort (N = 114), there was a lower 6-month total (4% vs 0.36%, P < 0.001) or HE-related admission (1% vs 0.12%, P = 0.002). Regression showed model for end-stage liver disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.10, P = 0.003) and pre-BSS/post-BSS (OR: 0.04, P < 0.001) for all-cause admissions and HE (OR: 3.59, P = 0.04) and preera/postera (OR: 0.16, P = 0.02) for HE-related admissions as significant. HE medication regimens were more stable post-BSS vs pre-BSS (32% vs 20%, P = 0.04), which was due to patients with BSS > BMs (P = 0.02). In the longitudinal analysis, 33 patients without medication changes or underlying clinical status changes were tested 36 ± 24 days apart. No changes in BSS (P = 0.73) or BMs (P = 0.19) were found.

Discussion

BSS is complementary and additive to BM frequency, can modulate the risk of readmissions and stabilize HE-related therapy changes in outpatients with cirrhosis, and could help personalize HE management.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^115Py8sa]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonabsorbable disaccharides not only remove nitrogen-containing substances from the gastrointestinal tract via their laxative effects but are also metabolized by the colonic microbiota to produce short-chain organic acids. These acids are thought to inhibit the growth of ammonia-producing bacteria and to convert ammonia to nonabsorbable ammonium, thereby further decreasing the ammonia load. Adherence to lactulose may be affected by its adverse effects, which can include severe diarrhea, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, bloating, flatulence, nausea and vomiting.

The most commonly used antibiotic, rifaximin-α 550 mg, is a locally acting oral antibiotic that is minimally absorbed in the gut to reduce the effects of intestinal flora, including ammonia-producing species. Rifaximin-α 550 mg is indicated for the reduction in recurrence of episodes of OHE in patients aged ≥ 18 years. C. difficile -associated diarrhea has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including rifaximin-α 550 mg.

Current guidelines recommend that an episode of OHE (whether spontaneous or precipitated) should be actively treated, and that secondary prophylaxis should be initiated after an episode to prevent recurrence. Lactulose is recommended as the first choice for treatment of episodic HE, and for the prevention of recurrent episodes of HE after the initial episode. Rifaximin is recommended as an effective add-on to lactulose for the prevention of OHE recurrence after the second episode. Intravenous LOLA and oral branched-chain amino acids can be used as alternative or additional agents to treat patients who are not responsive to conventional therapy. Prophylactic therapy should be continued, unless precipitating factors (e.g. infections and variceal bleeding) have been well controlled or liver function or nutritional status improved. However, a consolidated overview of current evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of HE treatment in the long-term setting is currently lacking. The aims of this systematic review were therefore to identify and assess published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE and to discuss the implications of this evidence for everyday clinical practice.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^112j4Wv3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gut microbiota may be altered in patients with cirrhosis, and may further change after administration of lactulose. We studied the composition of gut microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and assessed the effect on it of lactulose administration.

Methods

Stool specimens were collected from 35 patients with cirrhosis (male 26; median [range] age: 42 [29–65] years) and 18 healthy controls (male 14; 44.5 [24–67] years); 21 patients provided another specimen after lactulose administration for 55 [42–77] days. For each, a DNA library of V3 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA was subjected to paired-end Illumina sequencing. Inter-specimen relationship was studied using principal co-ordinate analysis. Abundances of various bacterial taxa, and indices of alpha and beta diversity were compared, between patients and controls, and between specimens collected before and after lactulose.

Results

Gut microbiota from cirrhosis patients and controls showed differential clustering, and microbiota from patients with cirrhosis had less marked alpha diversity. Abundances of dominant phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) were similar. However, patients with cirrhosis had lower abundances of five phyla, namely Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes, Elusimicrobia and Lentisphaerae, and differences in abundances of several families and genera than in controls. Lactulose administration did not lead to any change in alpha and beta diversities, species richness and abundances of various bacterial taxa in gut microbiota.

Conclusions

Gut microbiota in cirrhosis differ from healthy persons and do not change following lactulose administration. The latter suggests that the effect of lactulose on hepatic encephalopathy may not be related to alteration in gut microbiota.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^115L9Xru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review shows an increasing body of evidence for the use of rifaximin in addition to lactulose, and for lactulose therapy alone, in the long-term management of patients with HE. In line with the current guidelines, this evidence supports the use of lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of OHE events over the long term. In addition, one study has showed the effectiveness of lactulose as primary prophylaxis in the prevention of long-term OHE occurrence. Although there is very little direct head-to-head evidence of rifaximin versus lactulose over the long term, there is considerable evidence to support recommendations for the use of rifaximin as an add-on treatment to standard lactulose therapy in the secondary prophylaxis setting.

In terms of effectiveness, several long-term, open-label clinical trials and clinical practice studies have showed that, when added to lactulose therapy, rifaximin significantly reduces the recurrence of OHE events and rate of HE-related hospitalization, in comparison with lactulose therapy alone. An exception to this was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, carried out by Ali et al. in which rifaximin was found to be no better than placebo when combined with lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis against OHE recurrence. In discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancy in the findings of this trial, compared with those of the phase III trial by Bass et al. the authors point out that the study populations differed in terms of primary etiology of cirrhosis, geographical and dietary background. The authors therefore speculated that the gut flora–of the two study populations might have differed. Nevertheless, the majority of current evidence supports an enhanced therapeutic benefit in adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy for the prevention of OHE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115izFV7]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — prevention of infection-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) recommends the following measures with stated rationales: Stop proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) unless the patient has a clear and current indication; remove Foley catheters by limiting the use of urinary catheters to eliminate frequent nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs) and avoiding medications that can cause urinary retention, such as anticholinergics, in persons > 65 y old; use antibiotic prophylaxis for secondary spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; implement aspiration prevention measures including paracentesis for tense ascites, avoidance of sedating medications (benzodiazepines [including zolpidem] and opiates [including tramadol]), avoidance of vomiting and dehydration from lactulose overuse, and careful airway monitoring of patients with a GI bleed and/or hepatic encephalopathy (HE); limit length of hospital stay; and ensure vaccines are up to date, including COVID-19, HAV and HBV, influenza yearly, pneumococcus every 5 y when patient is > 65 y old, herpes zoster two doses separated by 2–6 m in adults > 50 y old, and tetanus–diphtheria–acellular pertussis every 10 y.

### Lactulose vs PEG for overt hepatic encephalopathy… [^112UTQWd]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance PEG led to more rapid HE resolution than standard therapy, suggesting that PEG may be superior to standard lactulose therapy in patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for acute HE. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT01283152. A total of 5 patients in the lactulose arm received rectal lactulose; 1 of these patients had improvement in HESA grade at 24 hours. The median time to HE resolution was 1 day in patients receiving PEG compared with 2 days in those receiving standard-of-care lactulose. The results of this study indicate that bowel cleansing with PEG, normally used for colonoscopy preparations, is a safe, rapid, and effective immediate treatment strategy for patients presenting with acute overt HE. When compared with lactulose, the current standard treatment for overt HE, objective measures of HE improved significantly faster in those receiving PEG.

By accelerating improvement in mentation, initial treatment with PEG has the potential to not only shorten hospitalizations but also permit health care professionals to concentrate on managing the precipitating factors and identifying other causes of metabolic encephalopathy that may be present. Although long studied, the exact mechanisms resulting in overt HE in patients with cirrhosis are not completely defined. 18–20 Disruption of the normal metabolism of ammonia is almost uniformly proposed as having pathophysiologic relevance. Numerous studies have indicated a central role for gastrointestinal bacteria, 3, 21 and their importance is strongly suggested by the parallel responses observed with antibiotics and bowel cleansing. PEG is not absorbed and, unlike lactulose, lacks the unabsorbed carbohydrate load that lowers stool pH and increases stool water losses. 23, 24 Furthermore, ammonia excretion in the stool is greater with PEG than with lactulose.

23 However, an interesting observation in our study was that the 24-hour difference in ammonia was greater in the lactulose group than in the PEG group. Since PEG treatment is commonly and widely used, simple to administer, and apparently safe in this population, we believe that the results of this study should be generalizable to most patients with acute HE. Certainly, the effects of PEG are transient, and follow-up therapy to prevent recurrence of HE in those with chronic symptoms is important. Also, further studies are needed to better understand whether the use of PEG could improve the quality of care and/or reduce important quality metrics such as length of hospital stay.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^113d6v2E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly further reduces the risk of OHE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization, compared with lactulose therapy alone, with a demonstrably low NNT to achieve these further benefits. There is also emerging evidence to indicate that a switch to rifaximin monotherapy may be appropriate for those for whom lactulose is ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, and/or when adherence to lactulose therapy is problematic, although this requires further research.

Discussion

HE complicating DC is associated with a 1-year mortality of ≥ 50%, and has a varied clinical presentation ranging from disorientation to coma. In 70%–80% of cases, a precipitating event such as surgery, infection, or GI hemorrhage precedes these changes.HE is a clinical diagnosis that can be difficult to establish definitively in the ICU given the abundance of alternative etiologies. Neurological changes can be mimicked by alternate conditions such as delirium which need to be considered prior to establishing a diagnosis of HE. Cerebral CT should be obtained to rule out other pathology such as subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage, stroke and edema. Electroencephalography changes are non-specific but useful to rule out seizures.

Ammonia levels do not correlate with clinical severity of HE; however, a normal ammonia level has a negative predictive value of 80%, suggesting an alternative cause of mental status changes. Blood samples should be drawn without tourniquet, placed on ice, and immediately sent to the laboratory. Monitoring ammonia levels as a response to therapy is not recommended. Ammonia levels are unlikely to normalize and often will remain elevated after resolution of an episode of HE. The response to therapy should be assessed on a clinical basis.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, has been shown to improve resolution of HE episodes and survival. The dose of lactulose should be titrated to achieve two to three bowel movements per day, being administered hourly until the first bowel movement. Enema formulations are available. L-ornithine l-aspartate can be considered when lactose intolerance exists and has been shown to have equivalent efficacy when compared with disaccharide therapy, but is not yet available in the USA. The addition of rifaximin should be considered when the clinical response to lactulose is poor. Rifaximin in combination with lactulose demonstrated greater efficacy than either alone in treating HE with a higher probability of resolution, shorter hospital length of stay, and improved survival. Rifaximin can also be given for primary prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy after gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that has been shown in small studies to be effective in the treatment of HE but requires further validation. Flumazenil therapy has been shown to improve encephalopathy but not impact mortality. Probiotics have not shown improvement when compared with placebo. The non-ureic nitrogen scavengers have promising early data but future studies are required.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^1174NLky]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In particular, we found that abundances of the bacterial groups which are involved in nitrogen metabolism and possess the capability to produce ammonia did not show any difference between the patients and controls. Such a comparison has not been reported previously. This finding suggests that even though the gut microbiota in patients with cirrhosis differs from that in healthy persons, this alteration may not impact the production of nitrogenous substances, which may play a role in causation of HE.

Lactulose is extensively used for the treatment of HE in several parts of the world. On reaching the colon, lactulose is broken down by colonic bacteria (primarily bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and streptococci) into lactic acid, acetic acid and other short-chain fatty acids. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the beneficial effects of lactulose in HE, including (i) its laxative action which reduces the contact time between luminal contents and the intestinal mucosa, reducing the absorption of ammonia; (ii) creation of an acidic environment in the colonic lumen, which traps ammonia by enhancing its conversion into polar and less-absorbable ammonium ions; and, (iii) change in the composition of colonic microbiota, with reduced density of bacteria that produce ammonia and an increased density of those that utilize ammonia for their metabolism.

Data on the effect of lactulose on gut microbiota are quite scanty and conflicting. In previous studies, lactulose was shown to facilitate the growth of acidophilic, urease-deficient bacteria, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, in the colon. Another study reported an increase in the number of anaerobic lactobacilli and a decrease in that of Bacteroides spp. after lactulose. However, in yet another study, no association was found between clinical improvement following lactulose and reduction in the number of ammonia-producing bacteria. However, all these studies were based on stool culture, a technique with several inherent limitations, such as the failure of a large majority of colonic bacteria to grow in vitro, and an inability to reliably distinguish between various bacterial groups or to provide a quantitative measure of the relative abundance of various species in a bacterial mixture.

### Lactulose solution USP 10 g / 15 mL… [^112HRkbt]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Lactulose is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and no enzyme capable of hydrolysis of this disaccharide is present in human gastrointestinal tissue. As a result, oral doses of lactulose solution reach the colon virtually unchanged. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid, and also to small amounts of formic and acetic acids, by the action of colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents. This in turn causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool. Since lactulose does not exert its effect until it reaches the colon, and since transit time through the colon may be slow, 24 to 48 hours may be required to produce the desired bowel movement. Lactulose solution given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours.

For the treatment of constipation. In patients with a history of chronic constipation, lactulose solution therapy increases the number of bowel movements per day and the number of days on which bowel movements occur. Since lactulose solution contains galactose, it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet. Since lactulose solution contains galactose and lactose, it should be used with caution in diabetics. In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician. Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose solution for more than six months should have serum electrolytes measured periodically. Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH.

Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose solution. The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement.

Nursing Assessment of Patients With Cirrhosis and GI Bleeding

Inpatient nursing care of patients with cirrhosis and GI bleeding includes vital signs monitoring, particularly supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate, insertion of a peripheral intravenous (IV) line, and monitoring of mental status, skin color and temperature, and stool characteristics, among others (Table 3). Some patients may require a nasogastric tube to administer medications, particularly lactulose, if swallowing mechanisms are not intact. It is important for the inpatient nurse to be aware of the degree of severity of esophageal varices and communicate with the physician to determine whether placement of a nasogastric tube is the safest option. The presence of esophageal and gastric varices can occasionally make a usually safe procedure quite dangerous. The risk of triggering the rupture of esophagogastric varices with the insertion of a nasogastric tube is difficult to appreciate and therefore unknown but likely small. It should not prevent from performing the procedure when indicated. Vigorous volume resuscitation may be associated with the development of ascites and recurrence of bleeding, and therefore should be avoided unless features of hypovolemia (and particularly hypovolemic shock) are present. Outpatient nursing care primarily involves education on how to identify bleeding early and ensuring compliance with methods to prevent bleeding (variceal band ligation or beta‐blockers) (Table 3).

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^115A42i5]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available published evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This article provides practical advice for the management of pregnant patients with gastrointestinal and liver disease based on the best available published evidence. The Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: To optimize gastrointestinal and liver disease before pregnancy, preconception and contraceptive care counseling by a multidisciplinary team should be encouraged for reproductive-aged persons who desire to become pregnant. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Procedures, medications, and other interventions to optimize maternal health should not be withheld solely because a patient is pregnant and should be individualized after an assessment of the risks and benefits. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Coordination of birth for a pregnant patient with complex inflammatory bowel disease, advanced cirrhosis, or a liver transplant should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, preferably in a tertiary care center. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may reduce progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition to standard diet and lifestyle measures, stepwise treatment consists of symptom control with vitamin B6 and doxylamine, hydration, and adequate nutrition; ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, and intravenous glucocorticoids may be required in moderate to severe cases. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Constipation in pregnant persons may result from hormonal, medication-related, and physiological changes. Treatment options include dietary fiber, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol-based laxatives. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Elective endoscopic procedures should be deferred until the postpartum period, whereas nonemergent but necessary procedures should ideally be performed in the second trimester. Pregnant patients with cirrhosis should undergo evaluation for, and treatment of, esophageal varices; upper endoscopy is suggested in the second trimester (if not performed within 1 year before conception) to guide consideration of nonselective β-blocker therapy or endoscopic variceal ligation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, clinical remission before conception, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum period is essential for improving outcomes of pregnancy. Biologic agents should be continued throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period; use of methotrexate, thalidomide, and ozanimod must be stopped at least 6 months before conception. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography during pregnancy may be performed for urgent indications, such as choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and some cases of gallstone pancreatitis. Ideally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed during the second trimester, but if deferring the procedure may be detrimental to the health of the patient and fetus, a multidisciplinary team should be convened to decide on the advisability of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Cholecystectomy is safe during pregnancy; a laparoscopic approach is the standard of care regardless of trimester, but ideally in the second trimester. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is based on a serum bile acid level > 10 μmol/L in the setting of pruritus, typically during the second or third trimester. Treatment should be offered with oral ursodeoxycholic acid in a total daily dose of 10–15 mg/kg. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Management of liver diseases unique to pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy requires planning for delivery and timely evaluation for possible liver transplantation. Daily aspirin prophylaxis for patients at risk for pre-eclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome is advised beginning at week 12 of gestation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, serum hepatitis B virus DNA and liver biochemical test levels should be ordered. Patients not on treatment but with a serum hepatitis B virus DNA level > 200,000 IU/mL during the third trimester of pregnancy should be considered for treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients on immunosuppressive therapy for chronic liver diseases or after liver transplantation, therapy should be continued at the lowest effective dose during pregnancy. Mycophenolate mofetil should not be administered during pregnancy.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^117NPNnQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of HE — Pharmacology is the key

At the heart of the treatment of HE, is the identification and treatment of a precipitating cause/s. In some cases, correction of this derangement alone may reverse HE. Beyond this, the nonabsorbable disaccharide, lactulose, remains the cornerstone of HE treatment. It is theorized that lactulose works to mitigate and reverse HE through its prebiotic effects, promoting beneficial gut flora, acidifying the gut lumen, and thus inhibiting ammoniagenic bacteria and promoting the growth of lactobacilli, which produces less ammonia. Acidification also prevents the absorption of ammonia within the colon, and in conjunction with its laxative effects, increases the expulsion of ammonia within the stool. Lactulose is generally considered the first‐line medication for the treatment of OHE as well as maintenance in those patients at risk for recurrence. As a part of its four‐pronged approach in the treatment of OHE, the AASLD has recommended the initiation of lactulose 25 mL every 1–2 h until two soft bowel movements occur, with titration thereafter to maintain two to three bowel movements per day. However, close titration of lactulose is crucial, as overuse can lead to complications, such as aspiration, dehydration, hypernatremia, perianal skin irritation, and hypokalemia, which can contribute to potential precipitation of HE. One of the benefits of lactulose in the encephalopathic patient is its ability to be administered both in oral and rectal formulations. This route of administration is usually determined by the clinician depending on the sensorium of the patients. Practically, the titration of lactulose, which is usually nursing‐driven, can become challenging in hospitalized patients. To help improve this, order sets have been built into the electronic medical record by many hospitals. Continued lactulose use after an episode of OHE has resolved has been shown to prevent subsequent recurrence.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^117Ti1Vu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Studies have also assessed the effectiveness of different rifaximin treatment regimens when used in addition to lactulose therapy. No significant differences were observed between patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg once-daily versus twice daily, or between patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily versus rifaximin 400 mg, three times daily; although rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily was shown to be more cost-effective than the three times daily regimen.

Direct head-to-head evidence of the long-term effectiveness of rifaximin versus lactulose is scarce. In a single-center, retrospective chart review, 145 patients diagnosed with HE received at least 6 months of treatment with lactulose before receiving at least 6 months of treatment with rifaximin (400 mg, three times daily), and outcomes were compared for the last 6 months of lactulose treatment versus the first 6 months of rifaximin treatment. The number of hospitalizations per patient was significantly lower with rifaximin versus lactulose (0.5 vs. 1.6; P < 0.001), as was the number of days of hospitalization per patient (2.5 vs. 7.3; P < 0.001) and number of weeks of hospitalization per patient (0.4 vs. 1.8; P < 0.001). Rifaximin was also compared with lactulose in a single-center, prospective study, designed to investigate for how long patients with MHE should be treated. Patients with cirrhosis with MHE were randomized to receive primary prophylaxis treatment with either rifaximin (400 mg, three times daily) or lactulose for 3 months, and then followed up for a further 6 months. After 9 months, the rate of MHE recurrence was 47.6% for rifaximin versus 42.1% for lactulose (P = not significant), and the rate of OHE occurrence was 7.1% for rifaximin versus 7.9% with lactulose (P = not significant).

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^117PMsMf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — nutrition management in cirrhosis and liver disease states that patients with cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis should be assessed for malnutrition because it adversely affects outcomes including mortality and transplant-related outcomes. Among stable outpatients with cirrhosis, counseling should be done to eat small frequent meals, a night-time snack between 7 PM and 10 PM, and 2 or more cups of coffee daily. In selected patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, vitamin E 800 IU/d should be provided. Among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, nutritional supplementation preferably by enteral route should be implemented in those with poor oral intake of daily requirements of proteins and/or calories. Protein intake should not be restricted including patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. A vegetable source of protein seems to be better tolerated than an animal source of protein in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Branched chain amino acids augment the efficiency of lactulose and rifaximin therapy in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

### Polyethylene glycol versus lactulose in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JqjUR]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

In conclusion, compared with the standard of care lactulose, a single dose of PEG significantly improved the 24 hours HESA Score and reduced the number of days for HE resolution. Since PEG is safe, widely used and easy to administer, the use of PEG should be considered in the treatment of HE, however further studies are required to validate these result and better understand its effect on encephalopathy-related quality of life.

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^116VZBsx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding). Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding) are important, given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis (eg increased odds of short-term mortality). Hepatic encephalopathy can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy (eg rifaximin plus lactulose) in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^113pHwBu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the similarly designed single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Ali et al. the incidence of AEs was low and similar in patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg (n = 63) or placebo (n = 63) for 6 months, in addition to lactulose therapy. Deaths occurred in 11.1% of patients in both treatment groups.

In the 24-month, open-label maintenance study that followed the trial by Bass and colleagues, a total 392 patients were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg ('all-rifaximin' group), including 252 patients who received de novo treatment (82 patients who received placebo in the original trial and 170 newly recruited patients; 'new-rifaximin' group). Approximately 90% of the patients in the all-rifaximin group additionally received treatment with lactulose. Safety/tolerability results were compared with those for patients who received rifaximin and placebo in the original phase III trial ['historical-rifaximin' (n = 140) and 'historical-placebo' (n = 159) groups, respectively]. The overall rates of AEs/PYE were lower in the all-rifaximin (0.71) and new-rifaximin (0.69) groups than in the historical-rifaximin (2.24) and historical-placebo (2.76) groups, as were the rates of serious AEs/PYE and discontinuation owing to AEs (rate/PTE). The rate of death/PYE was 0.15 in the all-rifaximin group compared with 0.24 in the historical-placebo group. The rate of C. difficile infection remained stable with long-term rifaximin treatment. When comparing patients who received rifaximin in combination with lactulose (n = 352) with those who received rifaximin alone (n = 40), the incidence of gastrointestinal-related AEs was significantly higher in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group (69.6 vs. 47.5%; P < 0.001), including the incidences of nausea and abdominal pain.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) management in critically ill cirrhosis — if no obvious alternative cause is immediately apparent, empiric therapy with lactulose should be started, with a nasogastric tube used if needed and oral lactulose held in ileus; in those with Grade 3 or 4 HE, a lactulose enema (300 mL lactulose in 700 mL water for a total of 1 L) may be considered, and regardless of route the goal is improved mental status with careful electrolyte monitoring; in patients without acute kidney injury (AKI) who are critically ill, treatment includes lactulose (orally or rectally) or polyethylene glycol if at risk of ileus/abdominal distention, the role of rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose/polyethylene glycol warrants further investigation in ACLF, and the role of rifaximin and i.v. albumin in the acute setting remains unclear; polyethylene glycol has been studied with success compared with lactulose and maybe an alternative, especially to decrease the risk of ileus/abdominal compartment syndrome in the ICU setting; ammonia scavengers such as L-ornithine L-aspartate and ornithine phenylacetate are not available in the United States and are undergoing further trials; medications with short half-lives (e.g., propofol, dexmedetomidine) should be used for sedation and pain control in patients with cirrhosis who require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Prevention of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) after an episode — guideline statements: Lactulose is recommended for prevention of recurrent episodes of HE after the initial episode (GRADE II-1, A, 1); rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose is recommended for prevention of recurrent episodes of HE after the second episode (GRADE I, A, 1); and routine prophylactic therapy (lactulose or rifaximin) is not recommended for the prevention of post-TIPS HE (GRADE III, B, 1). Notably, there are no randomized, placebo-controlled trials of lactulose for maintenance of remission of OHE.

Therapy for episodes of OHE — In addition to the other elements of the four-pronged approach to treatment of HE, specific drug treatment is part of the management; most drugs have not been tested by rigorous randomized, controlled studies and are utilized based on circumstantial observations, and in the hospital, a nasogastric tube can be used to administer oral therapies in patients who are unable to swallow or have an aspiration risk. Nonabsorbable disaccharides — Lactulose is generally used as initial treatment for OHE, lack of effect of lactulose should prompt a clinical search for unrecognized precipitating factors and competing causes for the brain impairment, in addition, most recent trials on lactulose have been open label in nature, cost considerations alone add to the argument in support of lactulose, and in some centers, lactitol is preferred to lactulose, based on small meta-analyses of even smaller trials.

Covert and overt hepatic encephalopathy therapy evidence — The majority of studies have been for less than 6 months and do not reflect the overall course of the condition, and trials span the gamut from small open-label trials to larger, randomized, controlled studies using treatments varying from probiotics, lactulose, and rifaximin. It was shown, in an open-label study, that lactulose can prevent development of the first episode of OHE, but the study needs to be replicated in a larger study in a blinded fashion before firm recommendations can be made. Studies using lactulose and rifaximin have shown improvement in quality of life and driving simulator performance, while probiotics have also been used but remain difficult to recommend as therapeutic options at this time due to open-label designs, varying organisms, and different outcomes.

### Heretical thoughts into hepatic encephalopathy [^1117tTR9]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical progress in the development of new diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy has lagged behind the vast knowledge that has been generated from basic studies. In this article, we critically assess matters that should be revisited, such as definition, classification, diagnosis and grading of hepatic encephalopathy, which are difficult to apply reproducibly using the current criteria. Many lines of investigation have confirmed that hepatic encephalopathy is irreversible in many patients and suggest the need for further studies focussing on mechanisms of neuronal injury and death, to guide future drug development for these patients. The clinical evidence behind using lactulose for all severities of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently considered the standard of care, is poor and placebo-controlled trials for hepatic encephalopathy should be considered ethically sound. This expert opinion identifies current challenges in hepatic encephalopathy and highlights areas which require further debate and investigation in order to help advance the field both scientifically and clinically.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111426bB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the 6-month phase III trial that compared rifaximin-α 550 mg with placebo for the prevention of OHE recurrence in patients in HE remission, more than 90% of whom were additionally treated with lactulose, the overall incidence of AEs was the same in both groups, and there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of the most commonly reported AEs and serious AEs. In the 24-month open-label maintenance study that followed this trial, the incidences of total AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower than those observed in the rifaximin and placebo arms of the original 6-month trial. In addition, long-term retrospective studies have showed a low incidence of AEs when rifaximin is added to lactulose therapy in clinical practice. As with nearly all antibacterial agents, C. difficile -associated diarrhea has been reported with rifaximin treatment. However, this has not emerged as a major safety concern following long-term treatment in clinical trials, and in clinical practice studies.

HE is associated with a substantial economic burden, primarily because of the direct costs of hospitalization and rehospitalization following recurrence, and secondarily because of the indirect costs associated with outpatient care, disability, lost productivity and the wider negative effect on the lives of patients' caregivers. As previously discussed, current evidence for the long-term treatment of HE with rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose therapy demonstrates that it not only significantly decreases OHE recurrence, in comparison with lactulose therapy alone, but also significantly reduces the rate of HE-associated hospitalization and length of hospital stay. There is therefore a substantial body of evidence showing that the addition of rifaximin to standard lactulose therapy results in significant reductions in healthcare resource utilization over the long term.

A limitation of this systematic review was that, following a thorough assessment of the available data, meta-analysis of outcome measures was found to be unfeasible and inappropriate, because of the heterogeneity of the designs, treatment settings and patient populations of the studies that were identified. NNT analysis was also limited by the low number of studies that could be assessed in this way.

### Nursing care of patients with cirrhosis: the liverHope nursing project [^114yhXgi]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nursing Assessment of Patients With Cirrhosis and HE

Nursing care of patients hospitalized with HE includes evaluation of mental status, prevention of aspiration pneumonia, assessment of potential triggers of HE (particularly bacterial infections and GI bleeding), nutritional support, prevention of skin breakdown, and bowel cleansing. Proper administration of medications to control HE (including those that reduce ammonia buildup in the body) is key for these patients. Parameters should be identified by the physician for the number of stools a patient should have per day. Extremely accurate intake and outputs should be recorded for these patients, as it is a sensitive balancing act to maintain adequate hydration while we are deliberately causing frequent, and often very loose stools with medications. A physician may require a patient to have 3‐4 large, semiformed bowel movements per day. The inpatient nurse should recognize that this is both a limit and a requirement for the patient. If the patient's HE is still significant after the required number of bowel movements, the physician should be notified. Patients with HE should be reoriented to time, place, and person frequently. They should be encouraged to stay awake during the day and remain active so they can sleep at night. If they are impulsive, unable to safely call for help, or are picking at their lines, it is important for nursing staff to recognize the need for an individual assignment. This is when a personal care assistant sits in the room with the patient at all times to redirect them and to keep them safe. In countries or hospitals where this type of assistant is not available, one caregiver can be instructed to help in this situation. Accurate calorie counts and collaboration with dieticians is crucial to keep these patients free from malnutrition; constant reminders and assistance with eating may be required. Twice‐per‐day skin checks on pressure points should be completed to ensure that no wounds or pressure injuries are forming. For semicomatose or comatose patients, prevention of skin breakdown should include frequent repositioning and prophylactic skin barriers. These patients will likely have fragile skin due to nutritional deficiencies and muscle wasting with bone prominences; the inpatient nurse should use skin care products that are gentle, always prep the skin for tape/adhesive, and assess for wounds such as skin tears and treat appropriately. For outpatients, the main aspects of nursing care are to evaluate possible existence of covert HE and educate patients with previous HE and their respective caregivers on prevention of recurrence and early identification of HE (Table 4).

Hepatic encephalopathy

Other possible etiologies of global neurologic decline should be investigated (e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, uremia, medications, delirium tremens, hypoactive delirium, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage). Elevated blood ammonia level (found in over 90% of cases) corroborates the clinical diagnosis, but correlation with the actual disease severity is poor. It should also be noted that monitoring blood ammonia levels is inferior to clinical assessment, and it is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Benzodiazepines should be avoided and replaced with haloperidol when chemical restraint is indicated.

The classic protein-restricted diet does not find support in the current literature because most patients do not tolerate high-food/calorie intake. Furthermore, malnutrition is a much more significant concern. Despite ongoing debate, branched amino acid supplementation may also be beneficial. Other adjuncts, such as cathartics and oral antibiotics, are recommended in an attempt to decrease the intestinal production of ammonia due to bacterial overgrowth.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable sugar that causes osmotic diarrhea, has been traditionally used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It acidifies the colon and promotes the conversion of ammonia to ammonium, which is not reabsorbed. Lactulose dosing should be titrated to two to three bowel movements per day. Known side effects of this therapy include electrolyte imbalances, nausea, and bloating.

Rifaximin, a semisynthetic drug derivative of rifampin, was originally employed as a second-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. In 2012, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials stated that rifaximin had similar effectiveness compared to lactulose, with fewer side effects. A more recent, larger meta-analysis has also further supported its use, although the dominant limitation remains its high cost when compared to lactulose.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Euvolemia and electrolyte homeostasis should be maintained under strict clinical and laboratory monitoring. Acute kidney injury in the absence of hemodynamic instability, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or parenchymal renal disease suggests the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Additional diagnostic criteria include no improvement in renal function after volume expansion with albumin and diuretic withdrawal. Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome requires the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, noradrenalin, or midodrine) and albumin infusion. Improved renal function has been demonstrated with medical treatment, but a mortality benefit is only ultimately achieved with liver transplantation. TIPS placement and renal and hepatic replacement therapies can be indicated as bridging strategies.

Hepatic encephalopathy economic and cost considerations — the burden and cost-effectiveness: The patients with HE hospitalized in the United States in 2003 generated charges of approximately US$ 1 billion, and resource utilization is increasing with longer lengths of stay, more complex and expensive hospital efforts, and a reported in-patient mortality of 15%. Regarding pharmacotherapy, until the costs of other medications fall, lactulose continues to be the least expensive, most cost-effective treatment.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111W6ngN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, the NNT measure was designed to quantify treatment benefit directly in terms of the number of patients who would need to be treated before benefit is observed, thereby providing a means of expressing absolute, as opposed to relative, risk in a clinically meaningful way–. Although the number of studies eligible for inclusion in the current NNT analyses was limited, the results showed that, in terms of long-term secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of OHE recurrence, approximately four patients would need to be treated with lactulose before clinical benefit is observed, compared with no treatment or placebo. This must be considered within the clinical context showing a very high rate of OHE recurrence with no prophylaxis or with poor adherence to lactulose therapy. Importantly, to show the add-on benefit of rifaximin to lactulose, the NNT is approximately four patients to prevent the recurrence of OHE. The relatively low NNT value for adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy provides further support for the clinical benefit of these treatments for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term. Only one study compared rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin+lactulose, and NNT analysis showed that approximately seven patients would need to be treated with rifaximin monotherapy before clinical benefit is observed (in comparison with rifaximin+lactulose). However, the results of this single study should be viewed with caution, not only because the 95% CI was very wide but also because the study design was such that patients who received rifaximin monotherapy may have had less severe HE than those who received combination therapy, which may have affected their likelihood of long-term remission.

### Cirrhosis: diagnosis and management [^117JDhKB]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that early cirrhosis may be reversible. Only one in three people with cirrhosis knows they have it. Most patients with cirrhosis remain asymptomatic until the onset of decompensation. When clinical signs, symptoms, or abnormal liver function tests are discovered, further evaluation should be pursued promptly. The most common causes of cirrhosis are viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Initial workup includes viral hepatitis serologies, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and abdominal ultrasonography as well as complete blood count, liver function tests, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, if not already ordered. Additional testing is based on demographics and risk factors. Common serum and ultrasound-based screening tests to assess fibrosis include the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index score, Fibrosis 4 score, FibroTest/FibroSure, nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score, standard ultrasonography, and transient elastography. Generally, noninvasive tests are most useful in identifying patients with no to minimal fibrosis or advanced fibrosis. Chronic liver disease management includes directed counseling, laboratory testing, and ultrasound monitoring. Treatment goals are preventing cirrhosis, decompensation, and death. Varices are monitored with endoscopy and often require prophylaxis with nonselective beta blockers. Ascites treatment includes diuresis, salt restriction, and antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, when indicated. Hepatic encephalopathy is managed with lifestyle and nutritional modifications and, as needed, with lactulose and rifaximin. Hepatocellular carcinoma screening includes ultrasound screening every six months for patients with cirrhosis.

### Dietary interventions in liver cirrhosis [^114cPCMg]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is associated with significant nutritional risks that often result in serious hepatic complications and poor survival rates. Diet is an important but underutilized aspect in the treatment modality of cirrhosis. Therefore, the aims of this review are to ascertain nutritional risks associated with its pathophysiology and to summarize existing evidence that support dietary recommendations for managing this patient population. Alterations in substrate utilization for energy production is a main feature of liver cirrhosis, resulting in increased catabolism of protein stores and a predisposition toward protein-energy malnutrition, even in the early stages of the disease. The body of evidence suggests that a high energy and protein (> 1.2g/kg body weight/d) diet consumed frequently and late in the evening is effective in improving nutritional status of these patients and has been associated with improved hospitalization and mortality rates. The use of branched-chain amino acid supplementation shows promise in reducing cirrhosis-related complications but are currently limited by adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. Furthermore exploration of dietary manipulation of branched-chain amino acid warrants further examination. Evidence is also accumulating that protein intake should not be restricted in patients with hepatic encephalopathy with earlier studies of protein restriction neglecting to account for the relative increase in fermentable fiber which would reduce the absorption of ammonia into the portal system in a way similar to supplementation with lactulose. Finally, a major finding of this review is the need to improve the quality and quantity of dietary intervention studies for patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly with the use of partial or whole dietary sources. In conclusion, dietary management of cirrhosis is not a one-size fits all approach but should be implemented earlier on in the treatment algorithm to improve the clinical prognosis of cirrhosis.

Zinc supplementation in cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy — In chronic hepatitis C, polaprezinc given for 3 years at 150 mg bid was associated with improvement of AST and ALT. Zinc deficiency has been associated with PSE, and severe deficiency has been reported to cause mental disturbances and encephalopathy; in 100 patients with minimal HE, zinc deficiency predicted overt HE and mortality. In a meta-analysis including 4 trials with 247 cirrhotic patients, zinc plus lactulose improved number connection tests versus lactulose alone, and a previous meta-analysis of 4 trials concluded oral zinc improved this psychometric test but did not decrease PSE. If used, zinc supplementation at a dose of ≤ 50 mg elemental zinc orally per day should be taken with a meal to decrease nausea and copper deficiency.

### Nonabsorbable disaccharides for hepatic encephalopathy [^113mTcan]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose or lactitol) are considered the treatment of choice for hepatic encephalopathy.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of nonabsorbable disaccharides for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified through The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (March 2003), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003/03), EMBASE (1980 to 2003/03), manual searches of bibliographies and journals, authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing lactulose or lactitol versus no intervention, placebo, or antibiotics and trials comparing lactulose versus lactitol for hepatic encephalopathy.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome measures included no improvement of hepatic encephalopathy and all-cause mortality. Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) based on a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality and form of hepatic encephalopathy.

Main Results

Thirty trials assessed nonabsorbable disaccharides versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotics or assessed lactulose versus lactitol. We could not extract data from all trials. Compared with placebo or no intervention, nonabsorbable disaccharides had no statistically significant effect on mortality (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.68, four trials), but appeared to reduce the risk of no improvement of hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84, six trials). However, this result may reflect bias due to low methodological quality of the majority of included trials. Trials of high methodological quality found no significant effect of nonabsorbable disaccharides on the risk of no improvement (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.04, two trials). We found no statistically significant difference between lactulose and lactitol on mortality (two trials) or risk of no improvement (four trials). However, our meta-analyses were underpowered to establish whether these treatments have comparable effect. Nonabsorbable disaccharides appeared to be inferior to antibiotics on reducing the risk of no improvement (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.50, 10 trials).

Reviewers' Conclusions

This systematic review questions the beneficial effects of nonabsorbable disaccharides and highlights that there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support this treatment. We found that antibiotics appeared to be superior to nonabsorbable disaccharides in improving hepatic encephalopathy, but it is unclear whether this difference in treatment effect is clinically important to patients. Nonabsorbable disaccharides should not serve as comparator in randomised trials on hepatic encephalopathy.
