## Question

Is cannabis helpful or harmful for hypomania?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cannabis is helpful or harmful for hypomania, and what the evidence and clinical guidance imply for management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and scope to ensure we are speaking precisely about hypomania and its relationship to bipolar spectrum disorders. Then, I should review direct epidemiologic and longitudinal evidence linking cannabis use to the onset or worsening of hypomania. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility to assess biological coherence. After that, I should consider conflicting data, including self-medication and confounding by polysubstance use. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and translate this into practical, guideline-aligned clinical recommendations with attention to special populations and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I don't jump to conclusions. Hypomania refers to a distinct period of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased energy/activity and characteristic symptoms that are observable by others, lasts at least 4 days, is not severe enough to cause marked functional impairment or require hospitalization, and is not due to substances or medical illness; importantly, it is on the bipolar spectrum and shares pathophysiology with mania, including dysregulation of reward circuits and dopaminergic signaling, which will matter when I consider THC effects later [^1155ePLf].

> Now, I will examine direct longitudinal evidence on cannabis and hypomania, but wait, let me verify the quality and directionality. Prospective cohort data from the ALSPAC birth cohort showed that adolescent cannabis use at least 2–3 times weekly predicted later hypomania in early adulthood with an adjusted odds ratio around 2.2 and a dose–response pattern, independent of depression and psychotic symptoms, which argues against reverse causality in that specific adolescent context [^115txdFG] [^116BKXY5]. A meta-analysis of prospective studies estimated roughly a threefold increased risk of new-onset manic symptoms with cannabis exposure, reinforcing a consistent association across populations and designs, though heterogeneity exists and confounding must be considered [^114bsn9X] [^112wc3kJ].

> Hold on, I should verify temporality and confounding in other cohorts because sequence matters for causal inference. A Finnish birth cohort found a crude association between adolescent cannabis use and later bipolar disorder, but the association became non-significant after adjusting for other adolescent substance use, suggesting confounding and a lack of an independent causal effect in that specific analysis, which tempers overinterpretation of unadjusted associations [^115YnehC] [^112N7qWh]. Let me also check for bidirectionality and polysubstance issues; Mendelian randomization and triangulation studies generally find stronger causal signals for cannabis and psychosis than for bipolar disorder per se, highlighting the complexity of isolating effects on affective disorders amid comorbidity and self-medication dynamics [^111qZ8Tk] [^111iCMr4].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility to see if the association makes biological sense. THC acutely increases dopamine release in striatal and cortical regions, a mesolimbic effect that aligns with hyperdopaminergic models of mania/hypomania, and this dopaminergic surge can compound normative adolescent increases in dopamine signaling, plausibly lowering the threshold for hypomanic symptoms during a developmentally sensitive window [^1155ePLf] [^116g8TmA]. But wait, what if CBD offsets this? Experimental and clinical data do not show consistent mitigation of THC-induced psychiatric symptoms by CBD in acute settings, and although CBD lacks psychotogenic effects, that does not translate into proven antimanic benefit in bipolar disorder at this time [^1153G5Sh] [^114PL692].

> I need to ensure I weigh outcomes data in people with established bipolar spectrum disorders, not just incident cases. Observational and longitudinal clinical cohorts consistently associate cannabis use with worse course: more time in affective episodes, rapid cycling, and greater severity of manic/hypomanic symptoms, including evidence that continued cannabis use tracks with poorer symptomatic and functional outcomes after a first manic hospitalization, arguing against therapeutic benefit in this population [^112wc3kJ] [^117Y8af2]. Temporal sequencing studies also show cannabis use frequently precedes or co-occurs with mania/hypomania, further supporting a risk-enhancing relationship rather than simple self-medication in many cases [^1134RssW].

> Let me consider conflicting or seemingly contradictory signals, because I should double-check for potential exceptions. Some surveys report that people with bipolar disorder use cannabis to self-medicate sleep or mood, and a minority report perceived benefits, yet these are observational, subject to recall and selection bias, and are not corroborated by controlled efficacy trials for bipolar spectrum indications; in contrast, multiple prospective and experimental datasets show harm signals outweighing any perceived benefits [^1176NTWH] [^113Km77N]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were robust randomized trials supporting cannabinoids for bipolar depression, but I should correct that: there are no FDA-approved psychiatric indications for cannabinoids, and small, uncontrolled reports of CBD in mania have not shown benefit, reinforcing that therapeutic claims remain unsubstantiated for bipolar spectrum conditions [^113Km77N] [^114ZEZ6H].

> I will now examine dose, potency, and age-related vulnerability, because these modifiers often change risk. Higher THC potency and heavier use are consistently linked to greater psychiatric risks, including psychosis and mania, and adolescent exposure appears particularly harmful due to neurodevelopmental sensitivity of reward and prefrontal circuits, which strengthens the case for avoidance in youth and early adulthood [^117RnwXs] [^115EgZwm]. Let me reconsider whether any safe "low-dose" window exists for hypomania prevention; I cannot identify a validated, reproducible low-dose threshold below which hypomania risk is reliably mitigated, so any use should be framed as risk-adding rather than protective in vulnerable individuals [^notfound].

> Next, I should review clinical guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with best-practice recommendations. Major guidelines advise concurrent treatment of substance use disorders, including cannabis use disorder, in people with bipolar disorder, and recommend tapering or discontinuing substances that may worsen mood symptoms during acute management of mania/hypomania, which operationalizes the risk signal into care pathways [^112sPDUz] [^112C96uQ]. I should confirm whether any guideline endorses cannabinoids for bipolar spectrum indications; I find no such endorsement, and expert reviews emphasize insufficient evidence and potential harm in psychiatric populations, reinforcing a precautionary stance [^113Km77N].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear answer. Overall, cannabis use is harmful for hypomania: it increases the risk of developing hypomanic symptoms in adolescents and worsens the course and severity of hypomanic/manic symptoms in people with bipolar spectrum disorders, with converging evidence from prospective cohorts, meta-analyses, and mechanistic studies outweighing anecdotal reports of benefit or uncontrolled observations [^115txdFG] [^114bsn9X] [^112wc3kJ]. But wait, I should qualify this: while the balance of evidence supports harm, some confounded or null findings exist, and no high-quality randomized trials have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids for hypomania, so the certainty is strong for risk but low for benefit [^115YnehC] [^113Km77N].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical clinical recommendations. For patients with current or past hypomania, or those at risk (e.g., bipolar family history, prior antidepressant-induced activation), I recommend avoiding cannabis, screening for cannabis use disorder, and offering evidence-informed treatment for CUD when present; pharmacotherapies remain limited and largely experimental, so psychosocial interventions and harm-reduction counseling are key, and any cannabinoid-based medicine should not be used off-label for hypomania outside a research setting [^112sPDUz] [^115gDT27]. For adolescents and young adults, I should emphasize prevention and early intervention given heightened vulnerability, and for all patients, I should monitor mood and sleep closely if cannabis use continues, as sleep disruption and circadian misalignment can precipitate hypomanic episodes [^115EgZwm] [^1176NTWH].

Cannabis is **harmful for hypomania** because it increases the risk of hypomanic symptoms and worsens the course of bipolar spectrum disorders. Prospective data show adolescent cannabis use predicts later hypomania with a **dose–response relationship** (OR ≈ 2.2 for frequent use) [^115txdFG], and cannabis use is linked to more severe mania, rapid cycling, and earlier age of onset [^112wc3kJ] [^117XUdVG]. THC acutely increases dopamine and can trigger hypomania, especially in vulnerable individuals [^1155ePLf] [^116g8TmA]. There is **no reliable evidence** that cannabis prevents or treats hypomania, and clinical guidance recommends avoiding cannabis in bipolar spectrum disorders [^113Km77N] [^112C96uQ].

---

## Evidence linking cannabis use to hypomania

### Epidemiological and longitudinal studies

- **ALSPAC cohort**: Adolescent cannabis use (≥ 2–3 times/week) independently predicted hypomania at age 22–23 (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.49–3.28) with a dose–response pattern; the association was not mediated by depression or psychotic symptoms [^115txdFG] [^116BKXY5].

- **Meta-analysis**: Cannabis use is associated with a ~3-fold increased risk of new-onset manic symptoms (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.80–4.90) [^114bsn9X] [^112wc3kJ].

- **General population**: Baseline cannabis use increased risk of subsequent manic symptoms independent of psychotic symptoms, supporting a direct association [^112NFzCi].

---

### Clinical studies and case reports

Clinical studies and case reports show that **cannabis use is associated with more severe manic symptoms, rapid cycling, and earlier age of onset** in bipolar disorder [^112wc3kJ] [^117XUdVG]. Case reports also describe **cannabis-triggered hypomania**, including episodes linked to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^111LPRz8].

---

## Biological mechanisms underlying cannabis-induced hypomania

THC increases mesolimbic dopamine, a pathway implicated in mania, and may **precipitate hypomania** in vulnerable individuals [^1155ePLf] [^116g8TmA]. Cannabis can disrupt circadian rhythms, which are already unstable in bipolar disorder, thereby **increasing hypomania risk** [^1176NTWH]. Adolescent exposure may alter neurodevelopment and increase susceptibility to mood dysregulation, including **hypomania** [^1155ePLf] [^115EgZwm].

---

## Potential benefits of cannabis use in hypomania

There is **no robust evidence** that cannabis prevents or treats hypomania; any reported benefits are anecdotal or based on low-quality data. Limited data suggest CBD may have antipsychotic or mood-stabilizing properties, but there is **insufficient evidence** to support its use for hypomania [^113Km77N] [^114ZEZ6H].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines advise **avoiding cannabis** in bipolar spectrum disorders due to risks of worsening mood symptoms and destabilization [^112C96uQ] [^115NQsGV]. Clinicians should routinely assess cannabis use and provide counseling on its risks in bipolar spectrum disorders [^notfound].

---

## Individual patient factors influencing cannabis effects on hypomania

- **Age**: Adolescents and young adults are more vulnerable to cannabis-related mood effects [^115EgZwm].

- **Genetics**: Family history of bipolar disorder or psychosis increases risk [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, ADHD, and substance use disorders may amplify adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Cannabis composition**: High-THC/low-CBD products carry greater risk [^117RnwXs].

## References

### Cannabis use and earlier onset of psychosis: a systematic meta-analysis… [^111sRhUv]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Evidence already shows that cannabis exposure is associated with a decline in cognitive performance in young people without psychosis18 and a loss of cortical thickness in early schizophrenia. 19, 20 Other research suggests the presence of a gene × environment interaction involving cannabis and a functional polymorphism in the enzyme catechol O -methyltransferase so that cannabis users with the Val/Val catechol O -methyltransferase genotype are at greater risk for developing psychosis21 and have a significantly younger age at onset than people with Met/Met or Val/Met alleles.
22. We also examined demographic factors, methodological variations, and indicators of study quality to assess the possibility of a confounding effect arising from the proportion of cannabis users among substance-using groups.

A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia, including the following: that cannabis use is a causal factor for schizophrenia; that cannabis use precipitates psychosis in vulnerable people; that cannabis use exacerbates symptoms of schizophrenia; and. The finding raises the important questions of whether cannabis and other substances can trigger psychosis by direct neurotoxic effects, by alterations in dopamine activity, or by other changes in neurotransmission and the extent to which any adverse effects on the brain are reversible. 45, 46 These results confirm the need for further neurobiological research to find the mechanisms by which cannabis use triggers or brings forward psychotic illness. The results of this study provide strong evidence that reducing cannabis use could delay or even prevent some cases of psychosis.

Reducing the use of cannabis could be one of the few ways of altering the outcome of the illness because earlier onset of schizophrenia is associated with a worse prognosis and because other factors associated with age at onset, such as family history and sex, cannot be changed. 47 Building on several decades of research, this finding is an important breakthrough in our understanding of the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis. It raises the question of whether those substance users would still have gone on to develop psychosis a few years later. However, even if the onset of psychosis were inevitable, an extra 2 or 3 years of psychosis-free functioning could allow many patients to achieve the important developmental milestones of late adolescence and early adulthood that could lower the long-term disability arising from psychotic disorders.

The results of this study confirm the need for a renewed public health warning about the potential for cannabis use to bring on psychotic illness.

Treatment of comorbid conditions

ADHD. Stimulants may also be used for comorbid ADHD in stable/euthymic youth taking optimal doses of anti‐manic medications. Adjunctive mixed amphetamine salts (level 3) 611 and methylphenidate (level 3) 612 have both been shown to be effective in addressing attention symptoms and have been well tolerated overall within the RCTs completed to date, theoretical and epidemiological data regarding risks of induction of mood elevation notwithstanding. 613 Although open trials suggest potential benefits of atomoxetine (level 4), 614, 615 the possibility of inducing mania or hypomania remains, 616 suggesting the need for RCTs before clinical recommendations can be made.

Substance use. Comorbid substance use should be treated concurrently to mood symptoms, with inpatient hospital or community residential treatment employed as clinically indicated. A small study suggests that lithium may be effective for reducing substance use in this population (level 3), 617 and FFT should also be considered (Section 2). Positive trials of N ‐acetylcysteine for cannabis use disorders among adolescents, 618 smoking, 619 and bipolar depression among adults 281 suggest that N ‐acetylcysteine may benefit adolescents with comorbid bipolar and SUDs; however, studies examining this hypothesis have not yet been completed (level 4).

7.3 Management of bipolar disorder in older age

7.3.1 Presentation and course

Because of the aging population in Canada and many countries around the world, knowledge of pertinent issues related to the management of older adults is becoming increasingly important. Approximately 6% of geriatric psychiatry outpatients and 10% of inpatients have BD, 620 and proportionally this population is one of the highest users of psychiatric and physical health services. 621 Approximately 25% of the patients with BD in the USA in 2005 were over the age of 60 years, 622 and by 2030 > 50% of patients with BD are expected to be aged > 60 years. 623

The lifetime prevalence of late‐life BD is about 1%‐2% with a 1‐year prevalence of 0.1%‐0.7% in the general population. About 90%‐95% of older adults with bipolar disorder have their initial episode prior to age 50 years, although there is a minority who will have a later onset. 624, 625 Late onset is often related to neurological or physical comorbidity, 626 and may carry a negative prognosis, 627 although this is not a consistent finding. 628

### Sequencing of substance use and affective morbidity in 166 first-episode bipolar I disorder patients [^1134RssW]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Since bipolar disorder (BPD) patients have high rates of comorbid substance abuse, and the temporal relationships involved are unclear, we evaluated the sequencing of specific substance use and affective morbidity.

Methods

Prospective follow-up (4.7 years) of 166 first-episode DSM-IV type I BPD patients with reliable, standardized assessments provided data for longitudinal analysis of temporal distribution of alcohol and cannabis use versus manic or depressive episodes or symptoms, using generalized estimating equation regression modeling.

Results

By quarters, cannabis use selectively and strongly preceded and coincided with mania/hypomania, and alcohol use preceded or coincided with depression, whereas substance use was unassociated with mood states in preceding quarters.

Conclusions

These preliminary findings suggest potentially predictive temporal associations, in which the abuse of cannabis or alcohol anticipated or corresponded with, but did not follow, affective morbidity, including selective association of cannabis with mania and alcohol with depression.

6. Cannabis and bipolar disorder

Regular cannabis use is associated to about a 3-fold risk (OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.8–4.9) of developing a manic episode, with some evidence of dose–response relationship between frequency of use and risk for mania. Furthermore, continued cannabis use and CUDs increases the severity of manic and psychotic symptoms and facilitates a rapid-cycling course of bipolar disorder.

5.5.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Many agents recommended for management of acute manic or depressive episodes have prophylactic efficacy. Generally, medications that have been found to be effective in the acute phase should be continued during the maintenance phase. However, there are exceptions to this: the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy has not been examined systematically in large double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials; hence, long‐term antidepressant use is not recommended, especially in light of the concerns about potential risk of manic/hypomanic switch and mood instability. However, in the subgroups of patients who have responded to combination treatment and are stable, preliminary evidence suggests that withdrawal of antidepressants may contribute to destabilization. 366

Clinical trials have shown that many atypical antipsychotics are effective in preventing relapse of mood episodes; with many agents, this efficacy is related to prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. However, many of these trials have been conducted in patients with an index manic episode and, given that the polarity of an index episode predicts the polarity of relapse, depressive relapse rates in placebo groups in such studies have been low‐ compromising the statistical power to test the efficacy of these agents in prevention of depressive relapses. Thus, the efficacy of many of these agents in preventing depressive relapses remains unknown.

For patients who are currently not receiving or responding to pharmacological treatment, a careful history including details of clinical course, response (or lack thereof) to previously used medications, and family history should be collected. Other variables to be considered include psychiatric comorbidity (including substance use), the predominant illness polarity, and the polarity of the most recent episode.

Ongoing clinical monitoring, including medication blood levels as appropriate, is also a crucial part of maintenance treatment that should be used to support enhanced medication adherence, detection of early symptoms of recurrence, and monitoring of side effects (see Section 8).

Regarding specific circumstances for cannabis use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (education and counseling), CCSMH 2020 guidelines recommend to educate patients on the risk of cannabis-induced impairment, especially if the patient is cannabis-naïve or titrating to a new dose. Advise starting with a dose as low as possible and gradually increasing over time if needed.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^116CnE2M]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

The HCL-32 was used as a measure of hypomania but this will not always equate with a clinical diagnosis of hypomania. Nevertheless, we used a well-recognized cut-off score for hypomania, amplified by measures of duration and impact on functioning. This is likely to have improved the capacity of the HCL to identify clinical levels of hypomania. If they persist and cause dysfunction hypomanic symptoms are known to be continuous with and to have strong predictive values for diagnostic bipolar disorders. Finally, there was a high rate of attrition within the sample, but we carefully weighted our analysis according to predictors of drop-out.

Experiences of physical and sexual abuse were reported by the mother rather than child, potentially leading to an under-reporting of these factors. Under-reporting likely leads to "nondifferential misclassification", ie, an under-reporting in both groups, which may exert a downward bias on estimated associations between abuse and outcomes. Data on childhood maltreatment between age 7 and 17 (when cannabis use data were collected) was not available and this may have impacted on our final model. Nevertheless, we still found a significant indirect association between abuse and hypomania via cannabis use suggesting this finding is relatively robust.

It is conceivable that hypomania symptoms may have been secondary to continuing use of substances such as cannabis and stimulants between assessment at age 17 and 22–23 years, though we do not know the extent to which use continued over this period. The HCL-32 requires people to consider a period in their life when they were feeling high while not using drugs or alcohol. This caveat in the questions in the HCL reduces the risk that hypomanic symptoms were closely linked to periods when a young person was using cannabis, stimulants, or alcohol.

### Mixed States in bipolar II disorder: should full hypomania always be required? [^111uTM69]. Psychiatry Research (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to test whether the definition of depressive mixed states (DMX) in bipolar II disorder should require satisfaction of full criteria for hypomania or if only a few hypomanic symptoms should be required. Consecutive outpatients with bipolar II major depressive episode (MDE) (n = 260) were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Presence of hypomanic symptoms during MDE was systematically assessed, and symptoms were graded by rating scale. The following three definitions of DMX were compared: (1) MDE plus full criteria for hypomania, (2) MDE plus three or more hypomanic symptoms (DMX3), and (3) MDE plus one or two hypomanic symptoms (DMX1–2). DMX definitions were compared on variables typically associated with bipolar disorders (young age of onset, many recurrences, atypical features of depression, and bipolar family history). The distributions of hypomanic symptom scores, age, and age of onset were studied by Kernel density estimation curves and by histograms. Bimodality would support distinct disorders, whereas lack of bimodality would support continuity among the different DMX definitions. The frequency of DMX+full hypomania was 12.3%, that of DMX3 was 46.9%, and that of of DMX1–2 was 38.8%. Comparisons among the groups on bipolar validators found that most differences were not significant. Kernel density estimation curves and histograms did not show bimodality, and had near normal distribution shapes. The findings do not support a categorical definition of bipolar II DMX like that of DSM-IV for bipolar I mixed state but are consistent with a dimensional definition of bipolar II DMX. The high frequency of DMX in bipolar II MDE supports the need for controlled studies to test the effects of antidepressants on depressive mixed state (as clinical observations suggest possible negative effects).

### Atypical antipsychotic-induced mania: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rwLuc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The possibility of atypical antipsychotics (AA) to induce manic symptoms has been raised by several articles. The objective of this study was to describe whether exposure to AA may induce mania in mood disorders.

Methods

We performed a systematic review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. The systematic search encompassed all relevant studies published until April 4th, 2022. A meta-analysis testing whether treatment emergent mania (TEM) is more frequent with the use of AA compared with placebo was performed.

Results

A total of 52 studies were included in the systematic review. We found 24 case reports or case series describing 40 manic/hypomanic episodes allegedly induced by AA. Twenty-one placebo-controlled trials were included in a meta-analysis including 4823 individuals treated with AA and 3252 individuals receiving placebo. Our meta-analysis showed that the use of AA protects against the development of TEM (OR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.52–0.89], p = 0.005).

Limitations

AA-induced mania/hypomania was not the primary outcome in any of the observational or interventional studies. TEM was not homogeneously defined across studies. In most case reports it was not possible to establish causality between the use of AA and the development of manic symptoms.

Conclusions

TEM is more frequent with placebo than with AA, which suggests that AA exposure does not represent a relevant risk for TEM. Mania/hypomania induced by an AA seems to be rare events, since anecdotal evidence from case reports and case series were not observed in observational prospective and interventional studies.

### Association of cannabis legalization with prevalence of schizophrenia… [^113Vrv4D]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Nearly 40 years of evidence from longitudinal epidemiologic studies has shown that cannabis use, particularly heavy use of high-potency cannabis products by adolescents, is associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia, 1 with clear dose effects. 2 Although a causal relationship is still debated, 3 these associations have caused concerns that there would be a marked increase in the prevalence of schizophrenia after the legalization and subsequent commercialization of high-potency cannabis products. This finding adds further support for mounting evidence on the association between cannabis use and increased risk for psychosis, and it shows that this association is most robust among young adults who are developmentally vulnerable to both the neurologic effects of cannabis and developing psychosis.

The second finding of this study is that the PARF for CUD associated with psychosis NOS, but not schizophrenia, accelerated further with the legalization of cannabis for medical but not recreational purposes. These mixed findings should not make us doubt the association between cannabis use and psychosis; rather, they highlight the methodological challenges of linking the biological causality of a complex psychiatric illness, such as schizophrenia, with a cannabis policy change. Second, establishing the timing of both cannabis initiation and psychosis onset is difficult, and medical records often have incomplete information, particularly on age at onset of heavy cannabis use. The time course of developing schizophrenia after cannabis exposure is also quite variable, with evidence that cannabis exposure can precede onset of psychosis by up to 7 years.

7 Interestingly, Myran et al4 show no change in the prelegalization trend of increasing PARF over time for schizophrenia but show that the PARF of CUD for psychosis NOS did accelerate after medical cannabis liberalization. This finding suggests that psychosis NOS, possibly indicative of early stages of schizophrenia, may be a more appropriate outcome for studies of shorter postlegalization durations. In fact, studies of immediate consequences of cannabis use have indicated that legalization can lead to adverse outcomes; for example, studies have shown increased tetrahydrocannabinol in results of toxicologic tests from injured drivers at trauma centers after legalization. 8 Similarly, hospital emergency department visits for cannabis-related issues involving.

The link between cannabis use and psychosis is considerably stronger for those using more potent products2; even these data may not include the variety of THC products on the market today in localities with thriving commercial markets. Here, Myran et al4 focus specifically on individuals with CUD rather than examining all cannabis use, potentially allowing them to detect associations with schizophrenia among the individuals who are most likely to experience adverse mental health outcomes.

### Psilocybin use in bipolar disorder: a comprehensive review [^116ve5oE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and persistent mental disorder characterized by recurrent mood episodes, with BD depression accounting for most of the illness burden. Although the mainstay treatment of BD consists of pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics, a large proportion of patients with BD depression do not respond to adequate trials of medications. In addition, these medications can be associated with multiple, often significant adverse effects, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic agents that are acceptable, effective and safe for patients.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive narrative review on the use of psilocybin in BD, with a focus on clinical outcomes.

Results

Two small clinical trials show that psilocybin combined with psychotherapy was safe and effective for the treatment of BDII depression with large treatment effects. No serious adverse events, including treatment-emergent mania/hypomania or increased suicidality, were reported in both trials. However, other studies have raised concerns about the safety of psilocybin in BD patients, including the development or worsening of manic symptoms, sleep disruptions and anxiety. Overall, the majority of BD patients believe that psilocybin could benefit their mental health problems, but their experiences varied depending on several contextual factors, such as polysubstance use, psilocybin dose, solo versus social experiences and pre-psilocybin sleep deprivation.

Conclusion

Despite its promising potential, the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in the treatment of BD depression remain unclear, and future research is essential to clarify its therapeutic value in BD.

### Is early exposure to cannabis associated with bipolar disorder? Results from a Finnish birth cohort study [^1121fEUZ]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder which frequently first presents in early adulthood, and is associated with significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in mood control functions, and acute tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) ingestion has been demonstrated to alter mood in several clinical trials. Thus, it is plausible that perturbations of the endocannabinoid system caused by cannabis use might contribute to the onset of bipolar disorder. However, the few existing prospective longitudinal studies examining the association between cannabis use and the onset of bipolar disorder have had mixed findings. Five such studies have utilized an adult sample and four examined the association with adolescent cannabis use. Moreover, the only meta‐analysis published thus far on this subject included only two studies, further underscoring the paucity of the evidence base.

Studying the impact of cannabis exposure in adolescence in relation to bipolar disorder is of paramount importance, as adolescence is a time‐period when the brain is most vulnerable and the risk of future mental disorders arising from cannabis use is greatest at this developmental phase. Of the four prospective longitudinal studies focusing upon adolescent cannabis use and onset of bipolar disorder‐related outcomes, three reported a significant positive association and one small study reported a negative finding. Those studies have been conducted with small, highly selective samples or they have utilized symptom scales as proxy measures for bipolar disorder‐related outcomes. Furthermore, follow‐up times have been modest, ranging from 1 year to 8.3 years. In addition to this, although polysubstance use is common in adolescence and thus presents as a potential source of confounding, only one of these studies adjusted for other substance use. Lastly, only one study analyzing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) has utilized a birth cohort‐based sample.

### Defining the bipolar spectrum and treating bipolar II disorder [^113egv8i]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of bipolar II disorder may be complicated by the lack of a universal definition of the bipolar spectrum and by the limited number of studies focusing on bipolar II disorder pharmacotherapy. The appropriate first-line treatment for bipolar II disorder is still being studied, but according to the limited research, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and atypical antipsychotics have been safe and effective in the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar II depression and/or hypomania or mania. A consensus should be reached on the definition of the bipolar spectrum, and further research is needed to determine the best first-line treatment for bipolar II disorder.

### Cannabis and psychosis: are we any closer to understanding the relationship? [^117FRLQ7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

The second hypothesis suggests individuals who are predisposed to schizophrenia are drawn to cannabis to mitigate the early signs of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Although plausible, it should be stressed that several studies show how this is not the main reason these individuals consistently give as their motivation to use cannabis. Pleasure and recreation are the main reasons given by patients. Although these reasons are clearly subjective and based on individual perception, they are important to understand particularly in the clinical setting as they provide an insight to the patients' motivation for using cannabis even if this use is detrimental to their mental health.

An interesting and promising avenue of research is the potential that cannabis or rather the role a group of compounds found in cannabis might offer in treating schizophrenia. Cannabidiols have been shown to provide therapeutic value in the treatment of schizophrenia with a relatively low risk of adverse effects. This might add credibility to the second hypothesis as individuals could be benefiting from using cannabis that contains these compounds. Mitigating factors here, however, include the emerging evidence that the composition of cannabis in recent years has been changing. These changes revolve around the ratios of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiols (CBD), some of the more prominent compounds in cannabis. Higher potency strains are higher in THC and lower in CBD.

Cannabis use disorder

About 20% of patients with BD have cannabis use disorder at some point in their life. 675 Cannabis use disorder is associated with younger age, manic/mixed episode polarity, presence of psychotic features, and comorbid nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, and other SUDs. 703 Cannabis use is also associated with more time in affective episodes and rapid cycling. 704

There is limited research into treatment options for this frequent SUD. Lithium and/or divalproex have level 3 evidence. 617, 682, 685, 686, 687 Quetiapine failed to provide any benefit in terms of mood and anxiety symptoms in a small subsample of highly comorbid patients with BD. generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and cannabis use disorder 701 (level 3 negative). The effect of quetiapine on specific cannabis use‐related outcomes was not reported.

Stimulants: cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine use disorders

Citicoline adjunctive therapy had a positive outcome in two RCTs in patients with BD with comorbid cocaine use disorder, although the benefits of citicoline decreased over time in the more recent study (level 2). 705, 706

Lithium or divalproex, either alone or in combination, were proven useful in small studies addressing cocaine use disorder 682, 685, 686, 687, 707, 708 (level 4). Quetiapine in monotherapy or in combination with the ongoing treatment shows evidence of efficacy for cocaine, amphetamine and methamphetamine use disorder 709, 710, 711 (level 3). Risperidone has been studied alone and as an add‐on agent for cocaine and for methamphetamine use disorders with level 3 evidence for efficacy. 711, 712

Bupropion has anecdotal reports favouring efficacy in cocaine use disorders (level 4). 713 Citicoline improved depressive symptoms in patients with methamphetamine use disorder and bipolar depression. 714

Lamotrigine has been studied in a 10‐week RCT of lamotrigine vs placebo added to ongoing medication. While results were negative for the a priori outcome variable (positive urine drug screens), they were positive on the secondary outcome of the amount of dollars spent per week on cocaine purchases (level 2 negative). 715

### Cannabis and schizophrenia [^116UX84Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a mental illness causing disordered beliefs, ideas and sensations. Many people with schizophrenia smoke cannabis, and it is unclear why a large proportion do so and if the effects are harmful or beneficial. It is also unclear what the best method is to allow people with schizophrenia to alter their cannabis intake.

Objectives

To assess the effects of specific psychological treatments for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia. To assess the effects of antipsychotics for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia. To assess the effects of cannabinoids (cannabis related chemical compounds derived from cannabis or manufactured) for symptom reduction in people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, 12 August 2013, which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PUBMED and PsycINFO. We searched all references of articles selected for inclusion for further relevant trials. We contacted the first author of included studies for unpublished trials or data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials involving cannabinoids and schizophrenia/schizophrenia-like illnesses, which assessed:1) treatments to reduce cannabis use in people with schizophrenia;2) the effects of cannabinoids on people with schizophrenia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected citations, selected papers and then re-inspected the studies if there were discrepancies, and extracted data. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We excluded data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified eight randomised trials, involving 530 participants, which met our selection criteria. For the cannabis reduction studies no one treatment showed superiority for reduction in cannabis use. Overall, data were poorly reported for many outcomes of interest. Our main outcomes of interest were medium-term data for cannabis use, global state, mental state, global functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment. 1. Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapies (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus treatment as usualResults from one small study showed people receiving adjunct psychological therapies specifically about cannabis and psychosis were no more likely to reduce their intake than those receiving treatment as usual (n = 54, 1 RCT, MD -0.10, 95% CI -2.44 to 2.24, moderate quality evidence). Results for other main outcomes at medium term were also equivocal. No difference in mental state measured on the PANSS positive were observed between groups (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD -0.30 95% CI -2.55 to 1.95, moderate quality evidence). Nor for the outcome of general functioning measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (n = 49, 1 RCT, MD 0.90 95% CI -1.15 to 2.95, moderate quality evidence). No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest 2. Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapy (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus adjunct non-specific psychoeducation One study compared specific psychological therapy aimed at cannabis reduction with general psychological therapy. At three-month follow-up, the use of cannabis in the previous four weeks was similar between treatment groups (n = 47, 1 RCT, RR 1.04 95% CI 0.62 to 1.74, moderate quality evidence). Again, at a medium-term follow-up, the average mental state scores from the Brief Pscychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded were similar between groups (n = 47, 1 RCT, MD 3.60 95% CI - 5.61 to 12.81, moderate quality evidence). No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest: global state, general functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment. 3. Reduction in cannabis use: antipsychotic versus antipsychotic In a small trial comparing effectiveness of olanzapine versus risperidone for cannabis reduction, there was no difference between groups at medium-term follow-up (n = 16, 1 RCT, RR 1.80 95% CI 0.52 to 6.22, moderate quality evidence). The number of participants leaving the study early at medium term was also similar (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.50 95% CI 0.19 to 1.29, moderate quality evidence). Mental state data were reported, however they were reported within the short term and no difference was observed. No data were reported for global state, general functioning, and satisfaction with treatment. With regards to adverse effects data, no study reported medium-term data. Short-term data were presented but overall, no real differences between treatment groups were observed for adverse effects. 4. Cannabinoid as treatment: cannabidiol versus amisulprideAgain, no data were reported for any of the main outcomes of interest at medium term. There were short-term data reported for mental state using the BPRS and PANSS, no overall differences in mental state were observed between treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Results are limited and inconclusive due to the small number and size of randomised controlled trials available and quality of data reporting within these trials. More research is needed to a) explore the effects of adjunct psychological therapy that is specifically about cannabis and psychosis as currently there is no evidence for any novel intervention being better than standard treatment, for those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia b) decide the most effective drug treatment in treating those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia, and c) assess the effectiveness of cannabidiol in treating schizophrenia. Currently evidence is insufficient to show cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cannabis use: umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112B1myc]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The main strength of this work is that we pool evidence from different sources of evidence and deliberately consider convergence of results from different study designs. Also, this umbrella review is the first to pool observational and interventional studies on the effects of cannabinoids on humans.

Our results should be interpreted with caution. Firstly, the evidence from observational studies has ecological validity with regards to the type of cannabis available in the legal or illegal market on a large scale. However, tetrahydrocannabinol content and other cannabinoids on which no meta-analytical evidence was included can vary considerably among legal and illegally sold products. At the individual level, this variation can mean the difference between harmful or neutral or beneficial effects. Moreover, evidence from more than a decade ago, might not be representative of the cannabis that can be purchased nowadays illegally and legally, which is rich in tetrahydrocannabinol. This means that findings of this work might be underestimating harmful effects of cannabis. Also, the clinical effect of tetrahydrocannabinol on GABA and glutamate signalling via partial agonism on CB1 receptors depends on the concentration and distribution of CB1 receptors in the brain of each individual. As such, not all individuals will experience the same effects of cannabis on their mental health and cognition. Nonetheless, a crossover trial of 64 volunteers found that short term detrimental effects of 10 mg of inhaled tetrahydrocannabinol on psychological measures and cognition was not influenced by the co-administration of up to 30 mg of cannabidiol, potentially mitigating potential concerns with a role of tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol ratio as a confounder of findings of this work. However, this trial was limited by a very short follow-up (90 min) and high loss to follow-up (28%). Furthermore, cannabidiol products that contain either no tetrahydrocannabinol, or subclinical amounts, are unlikely to result in psychological or cognitive impairment. Similarly, cannabis use disorder seems to have similar rates of people who use recreationally versus medically. Secondly, another reason to be cautious is that umbrella reviews neglect evidence from individual cohort studies or randomised controlled trials that have not been previously pooled in meta-analyses. However, individual studies need replication, are frequently exploratory, and need to be pooled in systematic reviews (and ideally meta-analyses) so that a comprehensive understanding of a given association or intervention can be appraised. Hence, any evidence that was not included in this umbrella review, even if potentially relevant, could be exploratory or preliminary. Thirdly, confounding factors could drive associations in observational evidence. However, we have applied stringent criteria, as confirmed by downgrading convincing evidence to non-significant on the association between cannabis and pregnancy outcomes. The quantitative criteria we applied to grade evidence from observational evidence accounted for selection and publication bias, excess of significance driven by small studies with larger effect sizes than the largest study in the meta-analysis, or marginal statistical significance driven by large sample sizes. Also, we have discussed findings from observational evidence in the context of converging evidence from different sources of evidence. For instance, observational studies might be affected by confounding factors, whereas randomised controlled trials might not be representative of the real-world population and affected by selection bias instead. We believe that converging evidence from these two study designs strengthens the ecological and methodological credibility of our findings. Fourthly, excess of significance bias testing might have been underpowered in meta-analyses with few studies, which could arguably apply to all meta-analyses included in this umbrella review, yet, a specific threshold of number of studies to set adequate power of excess of significance bias has not been established. Fifthly, we could have included meta-analyses based on their quality instead of the number of studies. However, that would have introduced a selection bias, leaving out a large portion of evidence. Sixthly, to harmonise effect sizes, we calculated the equivalent odds ratio as a measure of strength of the association. Yet, the harmonisation comes at the cost of losing information on time-to-event analyses and of course any association should be considered more in depth considering the frequency of each outcome, and the follow-up duration and time to event occurrence in each of the included studies. Additionally, the number of cases over the overall population of included studies does not reflect the prevalence of outcomes of interest. For instance, the global prevalence of preterm birth is 11.3%versus 9.9% reported in this work and varies across regions and countries' income levels. The global prevalence of small for gestational age is 27%versus 9.1% reported here, with large variations across regions. The prevalence of testicular cancer is 0.04% versus 29.5% reported in the included meta-analysis of case-control studies. Lastly, and most importantly, the results of this work aim to inform future guidelines. These guidelines should account for additional aspects such as cost-effectiveness considerations, clinical relevancies (eg, numbers needed to treat for benefit), long term effects of cannabinoids on which evidence is lacking, and stakeholders, including patients and family members perspectives.

### The potential of cannabidiol treatment for cannabis users with recent-onset psychosis [^1128miZ2]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

A major factor associated with poor prognostic outcome after a first psychotic break is cannabis misuse, which is prevalent in schizophrenia and particularly common in individuals with recent-onset psychosis. Behavioral interventions aimed at reducing cannabis use have been unsuccessful in this population. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid found in cannabis, although at low concentrations in modern-day strains. CBD has a broad pharmacological profile, but contrary to ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD does not activate CB1 or CB2 receptors and has at most subtle subjective effects. Growing evidence indicates that CBD acts as an antipsychotic and anxiolytic, and several reports suggest neuroprotective effects. Moreover, CBD attenuates THC's detrimental effects, both acutely and chronically, including psychotogenic, anxiogenic, and deleterious cognitive effects. This suggests that CBD may improve the disease trajectory of individuals with early psychosis and comorbid cannabis misuse in particular-a population with currently poor prognostic outcome and no specialized effective intervention.

### Psychiatric symptoms caused by cannabis constituents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115XzMN3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Results

Of 517 studies screened, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis of the acute administration of THC in healthy individuals (figure 1). Four studies on CBD's effect on THC were identified, which was insufficient for a meta-analysis; therefore, only a systematic review was done. Table 1 provides summary details of the studies included, with further details provided in the appendix (p 8). 331 healthy controls received both THC and placebo conditions (see table 1 for summary of placebos used). Regarding study quality, 13 of 15 studies had scores of 7 or more on the Newcastle Ottawa Scale, indicating low risk of bias. Two studies had scores of 6, implying moderate risk of bias. The most common limitation was a non-representative sample (appendix p 10). Studies were confirmed to be independent for 13 of the studies, included. For two studies, we were unable to contact the authors. As the study descriptions do not indicate sample overlap, we included them in the main analysis. However, in case there was overlap, we repeated the main analysis excluding the smaller study. This analysis demonstrated that the main findings were essentially the same (appendix p 20).

Total symptoms were assessed in nine studies with ten samples (two independent samples included from D'Souza et al), involving 196 participants. THC significantly increased total symptom severity compared with placebo, with a large effect size (SMC 1.10 [95% CI 0.92–1.28], p < 0.0001; figure 2). The result remained significant in all iterations of the leave-one-out analysis (SMC ranged from 1.03 [95% CI 0.92–1.36] to 1.15 [0.95–1.35]; appendix p 21).

### Balancing risks and benefits of cannabis use: umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^114PL692]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids, of which Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are the most clinically relevant. Tetrahydrocannabinol is a partial agonist at CB1 and binds CB2 receptors. CB1 is widely expressed by central and peripheral neurones but also by immune cells and other type of cells in the brain and in the periphery, and when it binds with tetrahydrocannabinol, a so-called high is induced, which is responsible for potential misuse. CB2 receptors are also expressed by neurons, but less than CB1, and are most abundantly expressed in immune cells. Cannabidiol, however, does not produce the high and thus does not carry the same potential for substance misuse. Furthermore, cannabidiol does not seem to promote psychosis inducing effects. Cannabis use can evolve into cannabis use disorder, broadly defined as an inability to quit cannabis use, continuous use despite harmful consequences (eg, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome), or functional impairment.

Bipolar disorder (BD) maintenance monotherapy selection — medications with evidence of effectiveness for the acute episode, a breadth of effectiveness that includes prevention of both mania and depression, and a low side effect burden should be viewed as preferred or first line treatments. When providers consider monotherapies for maintenance treatment for individuals with BD 1, agents with evidence for prevention of both manic and depressive episodes should be preferred; for others with BD 2 (and without a history or risk of severe hypomanic episodes associated with adverse consequences), effectiveness for prevention of mania may not be salient.

Switch to mania with antidepressants in bipolar depression — risk evidence: The guideline notes risks "of inducing a switch from depression into mania", and the evidence review identified "one SR and network meta-analysis, by Taylor et al. (2014), that included an evaluation of switches in individuals with bipolar depression". That review "identified three clinical trials" including SSRIs versus placebo and tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo, with populations that "included unspecified BD or a mix of BD 1 and BD 2", while the SGA combination study "had BD 1 only". Definitions of switching varied and "might have included switches into hypomania", and "very low-quality evidence suggested that switch rates did not differ from rates for placebo for either SSRIs (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.48–2.34) or TCAs (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 0.48–13.8)". The meta-analysis "did not report on any subtype-specific analyses", and its findings were "consistent with those observed in an RCT of individuals with BD 2".

### Co-morbid cannabis use disorder and chronotype are associated with mood symptom onset in people with bipolar disorder [^113eUWz6]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The results presented here add new evidence on the interrelationship between CUD, BD and circadian rhythms, however this study has several limitations. Although, participant data were clearly defined and comprehensively validated through clinical interviews and reviews, our analyses did not include current depression and mania symptom data. Importantly, we have previously reported that chronotype also predicts current depressive and mania symptoms in this cohort; thus, future analyses may investigate potential interactions between CUD and chronotype on current mood symptoms. It is also critical to note that there was no limiting eligibility criteria for mood state for this study, as such while many participants were euthymic, some presented with depression and mania/hypomania that could have impacted their memory. This recall bias may affect the participants' ability to accurately recall number of mood episodes, which may have led to an overestimation or underestimation of significance in the relationships among episode density, chronotype and CUD. Additionally, our dataset only included information on current cannabis abuse or dependence diagnoses but did not include whether participants engage in regular cannabis use that does not reach the threshold of a cannabis abuse or dependence diagnosis. This distinction is important to make for future studies considering many people with BD report regular cannabis for symptom management. In other populations, regular cannabis use has been shown to reduce symptom severity, in a dose-dependent manner, such that lighter use improves symptoms whereas heavy cannabis use worsens symptoms. Thus, future studies evaluating the effects of cannabis use frequency on mood symptoms could yield important insight into manageable cannabis use practices in a population where cannabis use is highly prevalent. Multiple testing, unequal sample sizes and smaller sample sizes may have affected the statistical power of our analyses, particularly in the cannabis use relative to mania onset groups. Additionally, the significant association between earlier age of mania onset in participants and initiating cannabis use before mania onset could also indicate that some people with BD initiate cannabis use to self-medicate prodromal symptoms before full illness onset. As described previously, there is strong supporting evidence of a shared underlying predisposition for BD and CUD. However, future studies monitoring the emergence of cannabis use and subclinical symptoms in adolescents and young adults at-risk for developing BD could further disentangle these two models of BD and cannabis use.

Background

Many people with schizophrenia smoke cannabis, and it is unclear why a large proportion do so and if the effects are harmful or beneficial. It is also unclear what the best method is to allow people with schizophrenia to alter their cannabis intake.

Objectives

To assess the effects of specific psychological treatments for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia. To assess the effects of antipsychotics for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia. To assess the effects of cannabinoids (cannabis-related chemical compounds derived from cannabis or manufactured) for symptom reduction in people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (August 2013) and all references of articles selected for further relevant trials. We contacted the first author of included studies for unpublished trials or data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials involving cannabinoids and schizophrenia/schizophrenia-like illnesses, which assessed: (1) treatments to reduce cannabis use in people with schizophrenia and (2) the effects of cannabinoids on people with schizophrenia.

Conclusions

Results are limited and inconclusive due to the small number and size of randomized controlled trials available and quality of data reporting within these trials. Currently, there is no evidence to demonstrate that one type of adjunct psychological therapy or one type of drug therapy is more effective than another. There is also insufficient evidence to show that cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^111b9oZJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

A related question concerns the mechanisms by which cannabis use may lead to manic symptoms. Cannabis use may be an independent risk factor, or a mediating factor linking earlier risk exposures (eg, childhood abuse) or characteristics of the individual (eg, sex) to the expression of bipolar symptoms. Whilst epidemiological research has begun to substantiate a mediating role for cannabis use in linking childhood trauma with adult psychosis, there has been virtually no investigation of parallel mechanisms in relation to bipolar disorder. One large cross-sectional study of adults has suggested an additive effect of childhood abuse and cannabis use on the clinical expression of bipolar disorder.

In summary, prospective studies examining the association between cannabis use and hypomanic or manic symptomatology are few, and are focused on adult samples. Psychotic symptoms are frequently not controlled for, a serious limitation given significant evidence connecting cannabis and psychosis. Prospective studies examining this connection in the peak period of cannabis use and onset of hypomania are scarce, even though this is when potential interventions might be most effective.

Our main aim was to test the hypothesis that adolescent cannabis use is prospectively associated with hypomania in young adulthood. We used path analytical methods to test several potential pathways simultaneously. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (a) Is cannabis use independently associated with hypomania in early adulthood following adjustment for gender, early environmental risk factors, other drug use, and depression and psychotic symptoms at age 18 years? (b) Do males and females follow different pathways to hypomania depending on cannabis use? (c) Is exposure to childhood family adversity or abuse (physical, sexual) associated with hypomania via increased likelihood of cannabis use?

### Cannabis and neuropsychiatry, 1: benefits and risks [^112ykPeJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Cannabis is popularly believed to be a relatively benign substance. Cannabis is also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions, psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content. It is important for medical professionals and the lay public to understand the limitations of the efficacy data and the seriousness of the risks associated with cannabis use in medical and recreational contexts.

### Cannabis use and expression of mania in the general population [^112NFzCi]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis use is common in patients with bipolar disorder, however little is known about cannabis as a risk factor for mania. In order to investigate the association between exposure to cannabis and subsequent development of manic symptoms whilst controlling for psychotic symptoms, a longitudinal population-based study was carried out.

Methods

4815 individuals aged 18 to 64 years were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at baseline, 1 year follow up and 3 year follow up, including assessment of substance use, manic symptoms and psychotic symptoms.

Results

Use of cannabis at baseline increased the risk for manic symptoms during follow-up (adjusted OR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.54, 4.75), adjusted for age, sex, educational level, ethnicity, single marital status, neuroticism, use of other drugs, use of alcohol, depressive symptoms and manic symptoms at baseline. The association between cannabis use and mania was independent of the prevalence and the incidence of psychotic symptoms. There was no evidence for reverse causality, as manic symptoms at baseline did not predict the onset of cannabis use during follow-up (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.03, 3.49).

Limitations

As 3 years is a relative short period of follow-up, long-term effects of cannabis use on mania outcomes could not be detected.

Conclusion

The results suggest that cannabis use may affect population expression of manic symptoms (and subsequent risk to develop bipolar disorder [Regeer, E.J. Krabbendam, L. R, DE Graaf, Ten Have, M. Nolen, W. A. Van Os, J., 2006. A prospective study of the transition rates of subthreshold (hypo)mania and depression in the general population. Psychol Med, 1–9.]). These findings may not be due to the emergence of psychotic symptoms or the effects of self-medication.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder — initial treatment steps while awaiting specialty intake — lists three actions for PCMs. The guidance introduces that "During this waiting period, PCMs can do a few things to begin the initial treatment". First, "Taper and discontinue medications or substances that might be contributing to symptoms and impairments", and for mania or hypomania, "this step can include nearly all addictive drugs used nonmedically (does not include medications being used in the treatment of SUDs),… (in particular, caffeinated workout supplements or supplements containing St. John's Wort), and prescribed medications (including SSRIs, SNRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, atypical antidepressants, and stimulants)". Second, "Aim treatment interventions toward improving sleep, which can include teaching the individual about basic sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, and judicious use of starting sleep medications". Third, "If the individual was previously seen by a mental health professional, consider consulting the professional (with the individual's permission) and restarting previously effective medications".

### Cannabidiol was ineffective for manic episode of bipolar affective disorder [^114ZEZ6H]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

The pharmacological profile of cannabidiol (CBD) has several characteristics in common with drugs known to benefit bipolar affective disorder (BAD), leading to the hypothesis that CBD may have therapeutic properties in BAD. Therefore, the aim of the present report was to directly investigate for the first time the efficacy and safety of CBD in two patients with BAD. Both patients met DSM IV criteria for bipolar I disorder experiencing a manic episode without comorbid conditions. This was an inpatient study, and the efficacy, tolerability and side effects were assessed. Both patients received placebo for the initial 5 days and CBD from the 6th to 30th day (initial oral dose of 600 mg reaching 1200 mg/ day). From the 6th to the 20th day, the first patient (a 34-year-old woman) received adjunctive olanzapine (oral dose of 10–15 mg). On day 31, CBD treatment was discontinued and replaced by placebo for 5 days. The first patient showed symptoms improvement while on olanzapine plus CBD, but showed no additional improvement during CBD monotherapy. The second patient (a 36-year-old woman) had no symptoms improvement with any dose of CBD during the trial. Both patients tolerated CBD very well and no side-effects were reported. These preliminary data suggest that CBD may not be effective for the manic episode of BAD.

### Positive and negative effects of cannabis and cannabinoids on health [^1126oWwj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cannabis is the most popular illicit drug in the Western world. Repeated cannabis use has been associated with short- and long-term side effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, cognitive alterations, psychosis, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. However, casual relations between cannabis use and these adverse effects are missing. On the other hand, recent research proposed promising therapeutic potential of cannabinoid-based drugs for a wide range of medical conditions, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. The current article presents a contemporary review on the adverse effects, safety, and the therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoid-based drugs. Given the growing popularity in the use of cannabinoid-based drugs for both recreational and medical purposes and their potential harmful effects, there is a need for further investigation in this field.

### Cannabis use disorder and subsequent risk of unipolar depression and bipolar disorder… [^111iCMr4]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Is cannabis use disorder associated with an increased risk of psychotic and nonpsychotic unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. Findings In this cohort study of 6 651 765 individuals in Demark, cannabis use disorder was associated with an increased risk of both psychotic and nonpsychotic unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. Mendelian randomization studies, which use genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships, suggest a causal effect of cannabis use on schizophrenia13 but not on bipolar disorder14 or major depressive disorder, although this may be due to lack of statistical power. 15, 16 The accumulating epidemiologic evidence, which supports an association between cannabis use and psychosis, 17, 18 includes dose-response relationships19 and a positive association between cannabis potency and risk of psychosis.

20 When taking the increased use and potency of cannabis into consideration, an increased incidence of schizophrenia may be expected. Our findings lend support to the notion that cannabis use may represent an independent factor associated with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. The risk of psychiatric disorders appears to be higher for schizophrenia18, 22 than for affective disorders38 and higher for psychotic bipolar disorder than for nonpsychotic bipolar disorder, potentially pointing to a primarily psychotogenic effect of cannabis. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, acts on cannabinoid receptors and is suggested to increase the risk of psychosis by altering striatal dopaminergic function39, 40 or by disrupting normal endocannabinoid modulation of cortical development and function.

41, 42 In addition to its links with psychosis, the dopaminergic system is intricately linked with neurocognitive processes relevant for affective disorders, such as reward processing. 43–45 However, a coherent model for how cannabis may influence the development of affective disorders is lacking. The results of this cohort study suggest that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic and nonpsychotic bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. These findings have implications regarding the legalization and control of cannabis use. Importantly, there appears to be a need for improved knowledge on the dose-dependent effects of cannabis use on brain, cognition, and behavior; identification of risk factors for transition from cannabis use to psychiatric disorders; and the effects of cannabis cessation on long-term psychiatric risk.

### Associations of cannabis use, tobacco use, and incident anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qZ8Tk]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

MR is one such method, which uses genetic variation as an instrumental variable for an exposure to estimate causal effects that are more robust to reverse causality and confounding bias (Davies, Holmes, & Smith). Reviews of MR studies investigating substance use and mental health suggest evidence to support a bi-directional, increasing relationship between smoking and depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Treur, Munafò, Logtenberg, Wiers, & Verweij). Evidence regarding cannabis use and mental health is less conclusive, which may relate to historical lack of frequency instruments (Hines, Treur, Jones, Sallis, & Munafò; Treur et al.). However, MR is 'far from a silver bullet' (Wootton, Jones, & Sallis,) with limitations to be addressed through more advanced methods (e.g. multivariable MR), additional sensitivity tests (e.g. residual population stratification), and incorporation into planned triangulation frameworks (Hammerton & Munafò,), including triangulation with carefully planned longitudinal cohort analyses (Hammerton & Munafò; Treur et al.). Widespread adoption of DAGs when selecting secondary data sources may yield insights as to whether research questions are feasibly explored within datasets (VanderWeele et al.). Alongside the need for well-controlled longitudinal studies, more evidence using alternative study designs is required as meta-analyses of the same study design may amplify inherent biases.

### Risks and benefits of cannabis and cannabinoids in psychiatry [^113Km77N]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The United States is in the midst of rapidly changing laws regarding cannabis. The increasing availability of cannabis for recreational and medical use requires that mental health clinicians be knowledgeable about evidence to be considered when counseling both patients and colleagues. In this review, the authors outline the evidence from randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials for therapeutic use of cannabinoids for specific medical conditions and the potential side effects associated with acute and chronic cannabis use.

Methods

Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted for articles published through July 2021 reporting on "cannabis" or "cannabinoids" or "medicinal cannabis". Additional articles were identified from the reference lists of published reviews. Articles that did not contain the terms "clinical trial" or "therapy" in the title or abstract were not reviewed. A total of 4,431 articles were screened, and 841 articles that met criteria for inclusion were reviewed by two or more authors.

Results

There are currently no psychiatric indications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cannabinoids, and there is limited evidence supporting the therapeutic use of cannabinoids for treatment of psychiatric disorders. To date, evidence supporting cannabinoid prescription beyond the FDA indications is strongest for the management of pain and spasticity.

Conclusions

As cannabinoids become more available, the need for an evidence base adequately evaluating their safety and efficacy is increasingly important. There is considerable evidence that cannabinoids have a potential for harm in vulnerable populations such as adolescents and those with psychotic disorders. The current evidence base is insufficient to support the prescription of cannabinoids for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

### Using mendelian randomization analysis to better understand the relationship between mental health and substance use: a systematic review [^1125e9Mi]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological evidence

Causal inference can be attempted by looking at the temporal nature of relationships. For smoking, there is extensive longitudinal evidence that depression (Audrain-McGovern, Leventhal, & Strong; Mathew, Hogarth, Leventhal, Cook, & Hitsman,) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (van Amsterdam, van der Velde, Schulte, & van den Brink,) are associated with increased odds of smoking initiation and persistence. In the other direction – from smoking to mental health – a systematic review study including 26 studies with a follow-up of between seven weeks and nine years concluded that smoking cessation is followed by reduced depression, anxiety, and stress (Taylor et al.). Smoking has also been associated with poorer cognitive performance, which improved after cessation (Vermeulen et al.).

For alcohol, a review of 37 longitudinal studies found that (symptoms of) mental disorders in childhood predict an increased odds of alcohol dependence later on in life (Groenman, Janssen, & Oosterlaan). In the other direction, alcohol dependence and heavy drinking predicted subsequent increases in depressive symptoms, but for heavy drinking, this association did not persist after adjustment for confounders (Li et al.). A systematic review of alcohol interventions reported that alcohol reduction led to a lower prevalence of psychiatric episodes, and improvement of anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-confidence, and mental quality of life (Charlet & Heinz).

For cannabis use, the few available studies are smaller and the evidence is mixed. A 10-year prospective cohort study in 1395 adolescents found that symptoms of mental disorders (depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorder) increase the odds of cannabis initiation and cannabis use disorder (Wittchen et al.). There was no indication that cannabis causes elevated anxiety symptoms (Twomey,), but substantial evidence to support that it increases the risk of manic symptoms (Gibbs et al.) and psychosis (Gage, Hickman, & Zammit). Another study found evidence that cannabis can be beneficial for post-traumatic stress disorder but is associated with short-term cognitive deficits (Walsh et al.).

### Risks and benefits of psilocybin use in people with bipolar disorder: an international web-based survey on experiences of' magic mushroom' consumption [^115aKv3v]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

The hallucinogenic compound psilocybin could have potential for treating depressive symptoms in BD, yet little empirical evidence exists regarding its impacts for this population. Quantitative findings from this survey highlight the existence of adverse side-effects of psilocybin use in approximately a third of this population, suggesting that a cautious approach to this novel treatment is required. However, this should be balanced with quantitative and qualitative findings suggesting that people with BD perceived wide-ranging benefits of psilocybin use.

Negative or unwanted impacts of psilocybin use were most commonly new or increasing manic symptoms, sleep difficulties and anxiety. Sleep disturbances are of particular concern for people with BD, given accumulating prospective evidence demonstrating their association with the recurrence of mood episodes, particularly mania, but also extending to hypomania and depression. In addition, anxiety is a common prodrome for both depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes in patients with BD I and II. As mentioned earlier, it may be expected that individuals with BD I are more vulnerable to adverse effects of psilocybin use; however, in the present sample people with BD I and BD II were equally as likely to report the experience of any adverse or unwanted outcome overall. Although by definition only people with a diagnosis of BD I have experienced mania, it is not unheard of for an individual with diagnosed BD II to go on to experience a manic episode – indeed, there is a documented example of this occurring when an individual with BD II consumed psilocybin. In the absence of more conclusive evidence regarding differential risk profiles, we suggest a cautious approach remains warranted for both subgroups. It is important to qualify these reports with an acknowledgement that serious adverse events (i.e. use of emergency medical services) were exceedingly rare in this survey. Published case reports of adverse events associated with psilocybin use in BD may be weighted towards such rare instances. In addition, as impaired decision making (such as problematic substance use) is a core feature of mania, it is possible that some adverse events may have occurred due to fluctuations in BD symptoms that led to psilocybin use, but that the psilocybin use itself was not the true cause.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^113w8fF6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite these limitations, we show adolescent cannabis use is an independent risk factor for future hypomania, and the nature of the associations found is suggestive of a causal link, though the gold standard for inferring causality of course remains intervention. The study also identifies cannabis use as a candidate mechanism for explaining how childhood abuse may lead to hypomania in adulthood. This is important in the context of the push in many jurisdictions to legalize or decriminalize cannabis. Consistent with the stage specific model of mental disorders linking intervention to stage of illness, our findings suggest frequent cannabis use is likely to be a suitable target for interventions that may allay the risk of young people developing bipolar disorder.

### Viloxazine hydrochloride (Qelbree) [^115kcnoV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

Noradrenergic drugs, such as Qelbree, may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with Qelbree, screen patients to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a personal or family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.4 Somnolence and Fatigue

Qelbree can cause somnolence and fatigue. In the short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with ADHD, somnolence (including lethargy and sedation) was reported in 16% of Qelbree-treated patients compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. Fatigue was reported in 6% of Qelbree-treated patients, compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In adults, somnolence was reported in 6% of Qelbree-treated patients versus 2% in placebo-treated patients. Fatigue was reported in 12% of Qelbree-treated patients versus 3% of placebo-treated patients.

Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery until they know how they will be affected by Qelbree.

### The relationship between cannabis use and cognition in people with bipolar disorder: a systematic scoping review [^111uGXWv]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) and cannabis use are highly comorbid and are each associated with cognitive impairment. Given the prevalence of cannabis use in people with BD, it is important to understand whether the two interact to impact cognitive function. We performed a systematic scoping review to determine what is currently known in this field. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO for studies on the relationship between cannabis use and cognition in people with BD or relevant animal models. Six observational human studies and no animal studies met inclusion criteria. Two studies found cannabis use in BD was associated with better performance in some cognitive domains, while three studies found no association. One study found cannabis use in BD was associated with worse overall cognition. Overall, most identified studies suggest cannabis use is not associated with significant cognitive impairment in BD; however, the scope of knowledge in this field is limited, and more systematic studies are clearly required. Future studies should focus on longitudinal and experimental trials, and well-controlled observational studies with rigorous quantification of the onset, frequency, quantity, duration, and type of cannabis use, as well as BD illness features.

### Attenuated reward activations associated with cannabis use in anxious / depressed individuals [^116Tq85b]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

To continue to inform causal relationships, studies are needed to examine the extent to which striatal activations recover in anxious and depressed patients following cannabis cessation. Previous studies using behavioral activationor escitalopramto treat depression have both reported a recovery of striatal activation following treatment. Therefore, it is hypothesized that treatments targeting cannabis use in these individuals might also be effective in normalizing or adjusting their reward activations to the level of noncannabis using peers. Nonetheless, incorporating treatment for cannabis use in these populations would likely be beneficial regardless of the potential impact on neurobiology.

As this study probed subcortical reward circuitry, future studies should examine cortical reward circuitry including the ventromedial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and insular cortices. And although the correlation matrix showed the striatal regions largely coactivated during wins or losses, network-based analyses are needed to better elucidate cannabis-related disruptions to the reward circuitry in these populations. In terms of the interrogated sample, this study examined relatively heavy cannabis use, therefore, it is unknown if modest use might have similar detrimental (or possibly therapeutic) effects on reward processing in populations with mood and anxiety disorders. Hence, future studies are needed to examine these groups of individuals with nuanced cannabis use, including a control group of cannabis users without elevated mood/anxiety symptoms. There was also a higher prevalence of other substance use disorders in the Mood/Anxiety+CB, therefore, chronicity of other drug use might have influenced these results. Lastly, participants were drawn from a convenient sample of treatment-seeking individuals. Studies designed to specifically examine mood/anxiety and cannabis use disorders in individuals without other substance use disorders are therefore needed to corroborate the findings reported here.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^1176e6M1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — behavioral activation and mania/hypomania in youth — may involve medication-induced behavioral activation that is more common in younger children than in adolescents and may occur early in SSRI treatment, with dose increases, or with concomitant administration of drugs that inhibit SSRI metabolism; because activation is associated with higher antidepressant plasma levels, slow up-titration and close monitoring (particularly in younger children) is warranted; there have been rare (< 2%) reports of mania/hypomania that can be difficult to distinguish from activation; behavioral activation/agitation may be more likely early in treatment (first month) or with dose increases, may improve quickly after SSRI dose decrease or discontinuation, whereas mania may persist or require more active pharmacological intervention.

### Cannabis use and risk of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes: a systematic review [^115vqAA5]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether cannabis can cause psychotic or affective symptoms that persist beyond transient intoxication is unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence pertaining to cannabis use and occurrence of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Knowledge, ISI Proceedings, ZETOC, BIOSIS, LILACS, and MEDCARIB from their inception to September, 2006, searched reference lists of studies selected for inclusion, and contacted experts. Studies were included if longitudinal and population based. 35 studies from 4804 references were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were done independently and in duplicate.

Findings

There was an increased risk of any psychotic outcome in individuals who had ever used cannabis (pooled adjusted odds ratio = 1.41, 95% CI 1.20–1.65). Findings were consistent with a dose-response effect, with greater risk in people who used cannabis most frequently (2.09, 1.54–2.84). Results of analyses restricted to studies of more clinically relevant psychotic disorders were similar. Depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety outcomes were examined separately. Findings for these outcomes were less consistent, and fewer attempts were made to address non-causal explanations, than for psychosis. A substantial confounding effect was present for both psychotic and affective outcomes.

Interpretation

The evidence is consistent with the view that cannabis increases risk of psychotic outcomes independently of confounding and transient intoxication effects, although evidence for affective outcomes is less strong. The uncertainty about whether cannabis causes psychosis is unlikely to be resolved by further longitudinal studies such as those reviewed here. However, we conclude that there is now sufficient evidence to warn young people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness later in life.

### Duration of untreated illness in first-treatment bipolar I disorder in relation to clinical outcome and cannabis use [^112YD92a]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

There is little knowledge about the role of the duration of untreated bipolar (DUB) illness in first-treatment bipolar disorder I (BD I), its association with symptoms at start of first treatment, and development over the first year, and limited knowledge about factors that influence the length of DUB. Substance use has shown to delay identification of primary psychiatric disorders, and while cannabis use is common in BD the role of cannabis in relationship to DUB is unclear. The aim of the present study is to examine the associations between DUB and key clinical outcomes at baseline in BD I, and at one year follow-up, and to evaluate the influence of cannabis use. Patients with first-treatment BD I (N = 62) completed comprehensive clinical evaluations, which included both DUB and the number of previous episodes. There were no significant associations between DUB and key clinical outcomes. Longer duration from first manic episode to treatment was associated with risk of starting excessive cannabis use after onset of the bipolar disorder. The main finding is the lack of significant associations between features of previous illness episodes and clinical outcomes. Long duration of untreated mania seems to increase the risk for later cannabis use.

### Mapping the exposome of mental health: exposome-wide association study of mental health outcomes among UK biobank participants [^115X4zjz]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although cannabis use was not among the top exposures, it was consistently identified across major psychiatric diagnoses and symptom dimensions. A substantial body of evidence suggests cannabis use is both a risk factor and a comorbid condition that worsens outcomes among individuals with psychiatric disorders. For instance, cannabis contributes to the development of psychotic disorders (Di Forti et al; Pries et al.) and is often used by individuals with psychosis (Khokhar, Dwiel, Henricks, Doucette & Green). Similarly, a recent study has shown that cannabis use is bidirectionally associated with both anxiety and depression (Radhakrishnan et al.). Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Gobbi et al. found that cannabis use during adolescence moderately increases the risk of developing depression in young adulthood, whereas the evidence linking cannabis use to anxiety remains less conclusive. In bipolar manic disorders, cannabis use increases the risk of relapse and intensifies manic episodes (Gibbs et al.). It is important to note that the odds ratios for the associations between cannabis use and mental health outcomes in our study were relatively lower than those reported in the literature (Jefsen, Erlangsen, Nordentoft, & Hjorthøj). This may be partially attributable to characteristics of the UKB cohort, particularly the older age group of participants, who are past the stage when cannabis is typically most harmful. Additionally, cannabis potency during the recruitment period (2006–2010) was lower compared to more recent strains with higher THC concentrations, potentially contributing to the lower magnitude of observed associations (Freeman et al; Potter, Hammond, Tuffnell, Walker & Di Forti).

### Treatment effects in randomized and nonrandomized studies of pharmacological interventions: a meta-analysis [^112JhSQF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Figure 2.
Agreement of Summary Effect Size Estimates Obtained From Randomized and Nonrandomized Studies for 346 Clinical Questions

Each circle shows the summary odds ratio (OR) obtained from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs; vertical axis) and nonrandomized studies (NRSs; horizonal axis) for 1 clinical question. An OR less than 1 indicates a beneficial effect. The solid orange line indicates perfect agreement (exact same summary OR obtained from randomized and nonrandomized studies) and the dashed orange lines indicate substantial disagreement (OR obtained from randomized studies is at most one-half of the OR obtained from nonrandomized studies, or vice versa). Results for alternative cutoff values for substantial disagreement are provided in eTable 2 in Supplement 1. Circles in the upper left quadrant show meta-analyses where NRS evidence indicates a beneficial effect (summary OR < 1) and RCT evidence a detrimental effect (summary OR > 1), and circles in the bottom right quadrant show meta-analyses where NRS evidence indicates a detrimental effect (summary OR > 1) and RCT evidence a beneficial effect (summary OR < 1). Circles in the upper right quadrant show meta-analyses where both NRS and RCT evidence indicate a detrimental effect; circles above the solid orange line indicate a larger detrimental effect size in RCTs and circles below the solid orange line indicate a larger detrimental effect size in NRSs. Circles in the bottom left quadrant show meta-analyses where both NRS and RCT evidence indicate a beneficial effect; circles above the solid orange line indicate a larger beneficial effect size in NRS and circles below the solid orange line indicate a larger beneficial effect size in RCTs.

RCTs and NRSs led to different statistical conclusions about the therapeutic benefit of pharmacological interventions in 130 meta-analyses (37.6%) and 216 (62.4%) reached the same statistical conclusion, based on comparing 95% CIs around the OR from either study type with a null effect (Figure 3). In 69 meta-analyses (19.9%), NRSs showed a favorable effect while evidence obtained from RCTs was inconclusive and in 33 meta-analyses (9.5%), RCTs showed a favorable effect while the NRS evidence was inconclusive. Contradictory treatment effects were observed in 4 meta-analyses (1.2%).

### Is early exposure to cannabis associated with bipolar disorder? Results from a Finnish birth cohort study [^116BRmK9]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

The previously published prospective longitudinal studies on adolescent cannabis use and bipolar disorder have been heterogeneous in terms of outcome measures, sample sizes and characteristics, lengths of follow‐up and substance use‐related covariates controlled for (Supporting information, Table S2). To the best of our knowledge, there are no prospective longitudinal community studies that have examined the association between adolescent cannabis use and bipolar disorder‐related outcomes with register‐based data on bipolar disorder diagnoses made in clinical practice. In two studies, small high‐risk samples were utilized: a sample comprised of 211 probands of individuals with Type 1 bipolar disorder and a clinical at‐risk sample of 52 individuals. These studies used DSM‐IV diagnoses as their primary outcome measure. However, neither controlled for other substance use. The two general‐population‐based studies had sample sizes of 3370 and 543, and the former controlled for both hazardous alcohol use and other drug use in the final multivariable model. Hypomania symptoms assessed by the 32‐item version of the Hypomania Checklist (HCL‐32) and mania symptoms assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) were used for the main outcome measures. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 1 year to 8 years raising concerns regarding reverse causality. Also, studies in adult populations have utilized either the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) or Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) cohorts, each with a follow‐up time of only 3 years and both lacking information concerning early‐onset exposure. This underscores the limitations of the evidence base concerning a possible independent association between cannabis use and onset of bipolar disorder.

### The psychiatric consequences of cannabinoids [^113h5ewV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

With rising rates of cannabis use in the general population and an increasing number of US states legalizing both recreational and medical cannabis use, it is important to be informed about the adverse consequences of cannabinoids. This Commentary provides an overview of the psychiatric effects of plant-based and synthetic cannabinoids, differentiating acute effects from effects associated with persistent use. Cannabinoids produce multiphasic and dose-dependent effects on anxiety, mood, and perception, in addition to impairing cognition and psychomotor function. Generally, in healthy individuals, the acute negative psychiatric effects of cannabinoids are rated as milder in severity compared with those in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. With chronic exposure to cannabinoids, the probability of developing tolerance and dependence can increase. A problematic pattern of cannabis use can lead to clinically significant impairment and distress. Cessation of cannabis use in individuals who are tolerant and dependent can lead to a withdrawal syndrome. Studies report long-term cannabis exposure has been linked to psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, psychotic and mood disorders. Limitations to the existing evidence notwithstanding, the plausibility of a causal relationship between cannabinoid exposure and persistent negative psychiatric outcomes, and the potential for long-term brain changes by regular exposure, especially for adolescents, are sufficient to warrant discussions with clinicians and the public. Implications for clinicians who certify, prescribe, or care for patients receiving cannabinoids are discussed, and a case is made for further research to better understand the impact of legalization on public mental health.

### Understanding the link between cannabinoids and psychosis [^1142iB8x]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The changing legal landscape surrounding cannabis is likely a contributing factor to the increasing rates of cannabis use worldwide. Accordingly, consequences of cannabis use translate into sizeable public health implications. While the medicinal purposes of cannabis are often sensationalized, information regarding its harmful effects is largely confined to the scientific community. Therefore, educational campaigns informing the public about the links between cannabinoids and psychosis are urgently needed.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and the onset of a manic episode [^111LPRz8]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a rare, recently described, clinically diagnosed condition that is characterised by a chronic history of cannabis use, cyclic nausea and vomiting, symptomatic relief with hot water bathing, and resolution with cessation of use. We present a case of this syndrome concurrent in a patient with bipolar mania. We suggest that a 3-week period of vomiting in the context of this syndrome contributed to the precipitation of a manic episode by lowering mood stabiliser serum levels, and that this syndrome will have significant consequences for the patient's mental health.

Call to action — We recommend (Fig. 2): further support for collaboration between research centres with the clinical research and data analytic expertise required to facilitate a feedback loop of refinement of clinical protocol optimisation; further studies of dose-response relationships and alternative treatment protocols (e.g., group administration, short-acting doses, micro-dosing, dismantling of psychotherapeutic components); further development of standardised monitoring systems to track the incidence and prevalence of adverse events related to psilocybin use in a clinical context; investment in carefully collected phenotypic data in patients undergoing psychedelic therapy to identify predictors of therapeutic response and adverse outcomes, including transition to mania, psychosis, or HPPD; further economic modelling, cost-benefit analyses, and studies of clinical implementation; and consultation with payers, regulators, clinician, and other key implementation stakeholders to define barriers and roadmaps towards reimbursement benchmarks.

### Cannabis use and first manic episode [^1153SDDM]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis is the most commonly abused drug among patients with bipolar disorder. Available data has shown that the risk of psychotic disorders increases with the frequency and intensity of cannabis abuse. The present purpose was to review relevant studies to investigate whether cannabis use can be linked to the onset of mania in bipolar disorder.

Methods

Articles published between 1972 and December 2013 were searched on Medline and PsychInfo using the following keywords: first manic episode, or onset mania, or bipolar disorder and cannabis. Relevant papers cited in the references of selected articles were further considered for inclusion into the review.

Results

Lifetime use of cannabis among bipolar patients appears to be around 70% and approximately 30% of patients with a bipolar disorder present a comorbidity of cannabis abuse or dependence. Cannabis use is associated with younger age at onset of first mania and with more frequent depressive or manic episodes, although the evidence is somewhat inconsistent. Likewise cannabis consumption is related to poorer outcome and an increased risk of rapid cycling or mixed episodes. In contrast, neuro-cognitive functioning seems to be positively affected in patients with psychiatric comorbidity. While cannabis use often precedes first manic episodes, the causal direction remains to be determined.

Limitations

Variations in definition of cannabis use/dependence. Lack of controlled studies limiting definite conclusions about a putative causal relationship between cannabis and onset of mania.

Conclusions

Further investigations are needed to clarify the relationships between cannabis use and first manic episode.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^115HhgSZ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Assessments

Study participants were invited to complete a comprehensive postal questionnaire when they were 22–23 years old. This assessment includes the Hypomania Checklist Questionnaire (HCL-32), a self-report measure of lifetime experience of manic symptoms. Respondents are asked to consider a time when they were in a "high or hyper" condition and endorse statements about their emotions, thoughts, and behavior during this time. There are 32 symptom statements. While the HCL-32 was developed as a screening instrument for people with bipolar disorder type II in people with recurrent depressive disorders, it is also a valid and sensitive tool for young, nonclinical populations. In line with previous work, we constructed a variable to represent lifetime history of hypomania. Those with a symptom score of 14 or more (out of 32) were classed as having hypomania if they also reported at least one incident of "negative consequences" or of "negative plus positive consequences", as a result of hypomanic symptoms; and that mood changes caused a reaction (either neutral, negative, or negative and positive) in close others; and that symptoms lasted for a duration of "2–3 days" or more. This was chosen because the DSM 4-day threshold excludes many individuals with bipolar disorder IIand fits the ICD-10 requirement for hypomania to have lasted for a "few days".

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis use disorder [^115gDT27]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (a problematic pattern of cannabis use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress). This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in May 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal and/or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who are likely to be dependent.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were: 1) abstinence at the end of treatment; 2) intensity of withdrawal including craving; 3) nature, incidence and frequency of adverse events (AE) and 4) severe AE (SAE); 5) withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects and whether the planned medication regimen was modified in response to adverse effects; 6) completion of scheduled treatment. Important outcomes were: 1) cannabis use at the end of treatment; 2) number of participants engaged in further treatment; 3) economic outcomes.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias in results included in meta-analyses using the risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effect meta-analysis where possible. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we reported results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 37 RCTs (3201 participants). Most were undertaken in the USA (29), Australia (4), Israel (2), Canada (1) and the United Kingdom (1), mainly recruiting adults (mean age 22–41 years), with four studies only including young people (mean age 17–21 years). In 32 studies, most of the participants were male (56–92%). Five studies targeted participants with comorbidities (depression (2), bipolar disorder (1), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1)). Eleven studies received study medicines from the manufacturing company and none were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Thirty-six studies compared active medications and placebo; one study compared four active medications. Medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the potential for synthesis.

Synthesis Of Results

Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.52; 4 studies, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.88; 2 studies, 270 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may be no more likely with cannabidiol (RR 2.23, 95% CI 0.54 to 9.32; 1 study, 68 participants; low-certainty evidence) or with anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.92; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence), when compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain. AE and SAE. There was probably little to no difference in the likelihood of AEs in participants treated with THC preparations (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 5 studies, 507 participants), cannabidiol (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 2 studies, 57 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.07; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.11; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.13; 4 studies, 331 participants) or oxytocin (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.47; 1 study, 16 participants) (both low-certainty evidence), compared with placebo. SAE may be no more likely with THC preparations (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.9; 7 studies, 584 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.33; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 4.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 99.48; 2 studies, 298 participants), compared with placebo (all low-certainty evidence). Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was more likely with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.86; 5 studies, 257 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. There may be little to no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations (RR 1.77, 95%CI 0.4 to 7.85; 5 studies, 507 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.03 to 12.53; 2 studies, 418 participants) compared with placebo (both low-certainty evidence). We found that completion of treatment was probably not more likely with cannabidiol (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 92 participants), anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.03; 6 studies, 407 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.23; 2 studies, 418 participants), or PF-04457845 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with THC (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.32; 7 studies, 582 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all the clinically-important pharmacotherapies investigated and, for half of their outcomes, the quality of the evidence was low (44%) or very low (11%). Given the limited evidence of efficacy, those pharmacotherapies should still be considered experimental for treating cannabis use disorder. The greater withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects seen with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may limit their therapeutic value.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cannabis use: umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115EgZwm]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To systematically assess credibility and certainty of associations between cannabis, cannabinoids, and cannabis based medicines and human health, from observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Design

Umbrella review.

Data Sources

PubMed, PsychInfo, Embase, up to 9 February 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies and RCTs that have reported on the efficacy and safety of cannabis, cannabinoids, or cannabis based medicines were included. Credibility was graded according to convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or not significant (observational evidence), and by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) (RCTs). Quality was assessed with AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2). Sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results

101 meta-analyses were included (observational = 50, RCTs = 51) (AMSTAR 2 high 33, moderate 31, low 32, or critically low 5). From RCTs supported by high to moderate certainty, cannabis based medicines increased adverse events related to the central nervous system (equivalent odds ratio 2.84 (95% confidence interval 2.16 to 3.73)), psychological effects (3.07 (1.79 to 5.26)), and vision (3.00 (1.79 to 5.03)) in people with mixed conditions (GRADE = high), improved nausea/vomit, pain, spasticity, but increased psychiatric, gastrointestinal adverse events, and somnolence among others (GRADE = moderate). Cannabidiol improved 50% reduction of seizures (0.59 (0.38 to 0.92)) and seizure events (0.59 (0.36 to 0.96)) (GRADE = high), but increased pneumonia, gastrointestinal adverse events, and somnolence (GRADE = moderate). For chronic pain, cannabis based medicines or cannabinoids reduced pain by 30% (0.59 (0.37 to 0.93), GRADE = high), across different conditions (n = 7), but increased psychological distress. For epilepsy, cannabidiol increased risk of diarrhoea (2.25 (1.33 to 3.81)), had no effect on sleep disruption (GRADE = high), reduced seizures across different populations and measures (n = 7), improved global impression (n = 2), quality of life, and increased risk of somnolence (GRADE = moderate). In the general population, cannabis worsened positive psychotic symptoms (5.21 (3.36 to 8.01)) and total psychiatric symptoms (7.49 (5.31 to 10.42)) (GRADE = high), negative psychotic symptoms, and cognition (n = 11) (GRADE = moderate). In healthy people, cannabinoids improved pain threshold (0.74 (0.59 to 0.91)), unpleasantness (0.60 (0.41 to 0.88)) (GRADE = high). For inflammatory bowel disease, cannabinoids improved quality of life (0.34 (0.22 to 0.53) (GRADE = high). For multiple sclerosis, cannabinoids improved spasticity, pain, but increased risk of dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, somnolence (GRADE = moderate). For cancer, cannabinoids improved sleep disruption, but had gastrointestinal adverse events (n = 2) (GRADE = moderate). Cannabis based medicines, cannabis, and cannabinoids resulted in poor tolerability across various conditions (GRADE = moderate). Evidence was convincing from observational studies (main and sensitivity analyses) in pregnant women, small for gestational age (1.61 (1.41 to 1.83)), low birth weight (1.43 (1.27 to 1.62)); in drivers, car crash (1.27 (1.21 to 1.34)); and in the general population, psychosis (1.71 (1.47 to 2.00)). Harmful effects were noted for additional neonatal outcomes, outcomes related to car crash, outcomes in the general population including psychotic symptoms, suicide attempt, depression, and mania, and impaired cognition in healthy cannabis users (all suggestive to highly suggestive).

Conclusions

Convincing or converging evidence supports avoidance of cannabis during adolescence and early adulthood, in people prone to or with mental health disorders, in pregnancy and before and while driving. Cannabidiol is effective in people with epilepsy. Cannabis based medicines are effective in people with multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, inflammatory bowel disease, and in palliative medicine but not without adverse events.

### Psychedelic use and bipolar disorder-an investigation of recreational use and its impact on mental health [^112F6kwj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychedelic substances such as psilocybin have recently gained attention for their potential therapeutic benefits in treating depression and other mental health problems. However, individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) have been excluded from most clinical trials due to concerns about manic switches or psychosis. This study aimed to systematically examine the effects of recreational psychedelic use in individuals with BD. Using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method, we assessed mood symptoms, substance use, and other mental health-related variables in the month before and three months following participants' most recent psychedelic experience. Results showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and cannabis use, an increase in the number of days without mental health symptoms, and an increase in the number of days with hallucinogen use. Importantly, no significant changes in (hypo)manic, psychotic, or anxiety symptoms were observed. These findings suggest that psychedelics may hold potential as a safe and effective treatment for BD, though further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^117C8ns8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis use in young people is common and associated with psychiatric disorders. However, the prospective link between cannabis use and bipolar disorder symptoms has rarely been investigated. The study hypothesis was that adolescent cannabis use is associated with hypomania in early adulthood via several potential etiological pathways.

Methods

Data were used from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK birth cohort study. The prospective link between cannabis use at age 17 and hypomania at age 22–23 years was tested using regression analysis, adjusted for gender, early environmental risk factors, alcohol and drug use, and depression and psychotic symptoms at age 18 years. Path analysis examined direct and indirect effects of the link and whether gender, childhood family adversity, or childhood abuse are associated with hypomania via an increased risk of cannabis use.

Results

Data were available on 3370 participants. Cannabis use at least 2–3 times weekly was associated with later hypomania (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.49–3.28) after adjustment. There was a dose-response relationship (any use vs weekly). Cannabis use mediated the association of both childhood sexual abuse and hypomania, and male gender and hypomania. The cannabis use-hypomania link was not mediated by depression or psychotic symptoms.

Conclusions

Adolescent cannabis use may be an independent risk factor for future hypomania, and the nature of the association suggests a potential causal link. Cannabis use mediates the link between childhood abuse and future hypomania. As such it might be a useful target for indicated prevention of hypomania.

### Can we make cannabis safer? [^117RnwXs]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use and related problems are on the rise globally alongside an increase in the potency of cannabis sold on both black and legal markets. Additionally, there has been a shift towards abandoning prohibition for a less punitive and more permissive legal stance on cannabis, such as decriminalisation and legalisation. It is therefore crucial that we explore new and innovative ways to reduce harm. Research has found cannabis with high concentrations of its main active ingredient, δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), to be more harmful (in terms of causing the main risks associated with cannabis use, such as addiction, psychosis, and cognitive impairment) than cannabis with lower concentrations of THC. By contrast, cannabidiol, which is a non-intoxicating and potentially therapeutic component of cannabis, has been found to reduce the negative effects of cannabis use. Here, we briefly review findings from studies investigating various types of cannabis and discuss how future research can help to better understand and reduce the risks of cannabis use.

### Discontinuing cannabis use: symptomatic and functional outcomes in people with an established psychotic disorder [^112Y8s9k]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

For people with psychotic disorders, the negative outcomes associated with continuing cannabis use would suggest that discontinuing such use may be beneficial for their symptomatic and functional recovery. However, existing evidence that discontinuation is associated with better clinical outcomes is inconsistent and it remains unclear whether discontinuing use is associated with improvements in outcomes for people with an established psychotic disorder. In this 3–5-year longitudinal study we examined baseline and follow-up symptomatic and functional profiles of 371 people with an established psychotic disorder, comparing those who continued to use cannabis with those who discontinued use after baseline assessment. At follow-up, one third (33.3%) of baseline cannabis users had discontinued use. Discontinuation was associated with significantly lower odds of past-year hallucinations and a mean improvement in level of functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale) compared to a decline in functioning in continuing users. No significant differences in severity of negative symptoms were observed. With few longitudinal studies examining symptomatic and functional outcomes for people with established psychotic disorders who continue to use cannabis compared to those who discontinue use, our findings that discontinuing cannabis was associated with significant clinical improvements fill gaps in the evidence-base.

### Convergence of cannabis and psychosis on the dopamine system… [^116g8TmA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Increased dopamine functioning in the SN/VTA may be associated with the risk of psychosis in people with cannabis use disorder. Importance Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear. as suspiciousness, delusions, and altered perception3–5 and negative symptoms, including blunted affect and amotivation. 6 Higher levels of cannabis use are consistently associated with an increased risk of psychosis; this dose-response relationship supports a causal influence. 6 Individuals with psychosis who use cannabis report an earlier illness. onset compared with those who do not. 7 However, the mechanism through which cannabis may contribute to psychotic symptoms remains unclear and much debated, 8 especially as cannabis use is neither sufficient nor necessary to cause persistent psychotic disorders.

9 One possibility is that cannabis affects the same final common pathway of dopaminergic excess in psychosis. 10, 11 Importantly, given its association with psychotic relapses in patients with schizophrenia, 12 its effect on dopamine may be dose dependent and sustained when use is continued. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia states that striatal hyperdopaminergia underlies the positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. 13 The effect of cannabis use on the dopaminergic system is less well known. Following THC administration, dopamine is released in striatal and cortical brain areas, 14, 15 an effect similar to dopamine levels reported in psychosis and schizophrenia. 16 In contrast, positron emission tomography studies in people with cannabis use have found reduced dopamine synthesis capacity17 and release in the striatum. 18 Therefore, no consistent dopamine availability changes have been demonstrated in cannabis users to date.

The reported differences in short-term vs persistent effects of cannabis use on dopamine further complicate the mechanistic link connecting cannabis, dopamine, and schizophrenia. In this cohort study, results suggest that people with CUD have a higher neuromelanin-MRI signal in brain areas associated with the expression of psychosis. This might explain how cannabis affects psychotic symptoms. The presence of numerically higher signal in certain voxels in FES despite their treatment status and numerically lower signal in certain voxels in CUD highlights the need for further examination of SN/VTA neuromelanin-MRI. Larger longitudinal studies can help us understand how cannabis use changes the dopamine system in psychosis over time.

### Cannabis use and mania symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114bsn9X]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Whilst cannabis use appears to be a causal risk factor for the development of schizophrenia-related psychosis, associations with mania remain relatively unknown. This review aimed to examine the impact of cannabis use on the incidence of manic symptoms and on their occurrence in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the scientific literature using the PRISMA guidelines. PsychINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched for prospective studies.

Results

Six articles met inclusion criteria. These sampled 2391 individuals who had experienced mania symptoms. The mean length of follow up was 3.9 years. Studies support an association between cannabis use and the exacerbation of manic symptoms in those with previously diagnosed bipolar disorder. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of two studies suggests that cannabis use is associated with an approximately 3-fold (Odds Ratio: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.80–4.90) increased risk for the new onset of manic symptoms.

Limitations

We were only able to identify a small number of studies of variable quality, thus our conclusions remain preliminary.

Conclusions

Our findings whilst tentative, suggest that cannabis use may worsen the occurrence of manic symptoms in those diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and may also act as a causal risk factor in the incidence of manic symptoms. This underscores the importance of discouraging cannabis use among youth and those with bipolar disorder to help prevent chronic psychiatric morbidity. More high quality prospective studies are required to fully elucidate how cannabis use may contribute to the development of mania over time.

### Pain management in people with severe mental illness: an agenda for progress [^115ymKnw]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Severe mental illness exclusion criteria listed in randomized controlled trials included in the most recent Cochrane review of psychological therapies for chronic pain.

Pharmacological management of pain in SMI is complicated by the potential for harmful side effects and interactions with psychotropic medications and the underlying mental health condition. Antidepressants, including serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are effective for pain management in the absence of depressionand of course may improve comorbid depression; however, unopposed antidepressants may destabilise mood in bipolar disorder. Collaborative pharmacological and psychological care for comorbid pain and major depression is promising, but scarce.

The potential benefits and harms of other analgesics need careful consideration for people with SMI, as in the general population. In particular, people with major depression and bipolar disorder (but not schizophrenia) are more likely than age- and sex-matched controls without mental illness to receive long-term opioids and experience adverse effects. Research is needed to determine whether these findings persist after reduced opioid prescribing in many countries. Cannabis and cannabinoids are increasingly discussed for pain despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and increased risk of relapse and rehospitalization among people with psychosis. Guidelines advise against antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, benzodiazepines, and ketamine for chronic primary pain, but when used for psychiatric comorbidities, they may help comorbid pain. Recent advances in drugs targeting sleep disturbance, and transcranial magnetic stimulationmay prove fruitful for comorbid pain and SMI. There is a particular evidence gap for analgesics in people with bipolar disorder and psychosis, and research is thus needed. Medication optimisation for pain and SMI must occur alongside an interdisciplinary approach.

### Heavy cannabis use, dependence and the brain: a clinical perspective [^111xdBA1]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidities

US surveys estimate substantial comorbidity of CUDs with mood (39.6%), anxiety (30.5%) and personality (35.9%) disorders 92. Most evidence points towards a bidirectional relationship, where CUD increases the odds and symptom severity of other psychiatric disorders and vice versa 93. For example, there is substantial evidence that cannabis use negatively impacts the development of manic symptoms in bipolar disorder (e.g. 27) and CUD is associated with higher risks for comorbid depression (e.g. 94). In turn, depression may increase CUD risk 25. Self‐medication may play an important role in explaining these relationships. Although the therapeutic effects of cannabis remain to be confirmed, reduction of anxiety or post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)‐related sleep problems are commonly reported motives of use 30, 95. However, cannabis intoxication may also trigger anxiety attacks, especially at higher doses 14, 28, and increase the risk for an anxiety disorder 28, 29.

Although evidence is mixed 96, 97, earlier onset and heavier patterns of use may increase risks for comorbid psychiatric disorders. For example, adolescent‐onset relative to adult‐onset cannabis users had an increased risk of developing depression in mid‐life 26. Early onset has also been associated with an increased likelihood of attempting suicide (e.g. 98).

The relationship between cannabis and psychosis and schizophrenia is among the most investigated topics in the cannabis literature 31, 32, 33. Intoxication studies show a time‐bound, dose‐dependent effect of cannabis on positive psychotic symptoms (e.g. paranoia, delusions and fragmented thinking) (e.g. 99). THC is responsible for these transient effects, which CBD may attenuate (e.g. 100). Studies investigating negative psychotic symptoms are scarce, but there are indications of THC‐induced blunted affect, psychomotor problems, and emotional withdrawal (e.g. 101). For individuals with schizophrenia, cannabis use can aggravate symptoms (e.g. 102). Age of onset, heavy use and using high‐potency cannabis increases the risk for psychosis and schizophrenia 33. However, more longitudinal studies are needed to establish causality and exclude the possibility of other explanations, such as shared (genetic) risk factors or self‐medication of premorbid symptoms.

### Effects of Co-occurring cannabis use disorders on the course of bipolar disorder after a first hospitalization for mania… [^117Y8af2]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Symptomatic recovery and recurrence of both conditions and percentage of follow-up time with affective and cannabis use disorder symptoms. Results The cannabis first group exhibited better recovery than the other groups, although when adjusted for potential mediator variables these results did not persist. Cannabis use was associated with more time in affective episodes and with rapid cycling. Most cannabis use disorders remitted immediately after hospitalization, followed by rapid rates of recurrence. The methods used for this study have been previously published13 and so will be described relatively briefly, focusing on aspects relevant to the present analysis.

To extend the testing of the first prediction and test the second prediction — that cannabis use disorders would be associated with mania rather than depression — analysis of covariance models were used to compare groups on the percentage of weeks during follow-up spent in recovery, with full affective syndromes, and with subsyndromal symptoms. Tukey Honest Significant Difference post hoc procedures or least squares means protected t tests were used to further examine planned pairwise comparisons in these models. Figure 1 illustrates survival curves for recovery from bipolar disorder. Consistent with the first prediction, these curves differed significantly: the cannabis first group showed higher rates of and more rapid recovery than did the other 2 groups, which did not differ.

This association arose more strongly from the bipolar first group than from the cannabis first group. In addition, the percentage of time in remission was inversely associated with the percentage of weeks with cannabis abuse symptoms, owing primarily to the association in the cannabis first group rather than the bipolar first group. Therefore, it is likely that these same complex relationships exist in the present sample. Nonetheless, the associations observed in this study provide no support to the notion that cannabis use improves affective symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. 14, 15 Instead, the converse — that cannabis use worsens the course of illness — is more strongly supported, at least in the bipolar first group.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^114RrmNa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a lifelong condition characterized by recurrent hypomanic and depressive episodes with a lifetime prevalence of at least 0.4% among adults. It causes a level of functional impairment and disability comparable to bipolar I disorder (BDI). Despite treatment, patients with BDII are typically symptomatic most of the time, primarily experiencing protracted and difficult-to-treat periods of depression. Bipolar disorder has high mortality, as 30% of affected individuals attempt and 5% to 15% commit suicide. Historically, BDII was viewed as the lesser of the bipolar disorders due to the absence of florid mania. However, recent studies document that functional impact and risk of suicide are similar in BDI and BDII.

Treatment options are limited for patients with BDII depression. Until recently, treatment guidelines did not distinguish between BDI and BDII. The recent Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and International Society for Bipolar Disorders 2018 guidelines for management of bipolar disorder devoted a separate discussion to BDII. The primary conclusion was that the extant literature is inadequate to make evidence-based recommendations for patients with BDII. This is largely because most randomized trials of pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression do not include patients with BDII in sufficient number to independently test efficacy. In general, antidepressant medications have not demonstrated reliable benefit for this population, with ongoing debate as to whether their potential harms outweigh benefits in BDII. There is compelling need for novel agents in BDII depression for patients who have insufficiently benefited with or not tolerated existing therapies.

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid derived from psilocybin mushrooms. When ingested, it creates a mind-altering effect mediated in part through its action as a 5HT2a receptor agonist. Psilocybin appears to increase associative learning, cognitive flexibility, and neuroplasticity. Several recent studies suggest that this agent has therapeutic properties in patients with major depressive disorder. The largest study compared 1-mg, 10-mg, and 25-mg dosages of psilocybin accompanied by psychological support in 233 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. The higher doses showed a marked antidepressant effect with evidence of durability at 3 months following the single exposure to psilocybin. These trials were not without adverse effects, with headache, nausea, fatigue, and insomnia being the most common.

### Psychiatric symptoms caused by cannabis constituents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VQzdJ]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, inclusion criteria were double-blind studies that included healthy participants; reported symptom changes in response to acute administration of intravenous, oral, or inhaled THC or CBD; contained either a placebo condition (for the effects of THC or CBD alone) or concurrent administration of THC plus CBD or placebo CBD (for the moderation of THC effects by CBD); used a within-person, crossover design; reported total, positive, or negative symptoms using BPRS or PANSS; and presented data allowing the calculation of the standardised mean difference and deviation between the THC and placebo condition.

Exclusion criteria were studies not involving a control condition, using an active control, or administering concurrent medication (besides CBD for the systematic review of CBD plus THC); studies with absence of measures in either the THC or control condition; studies not written in English; studies not reporting original data; studies only providing p or t values, change measurements, or effect sizes; studies with two or fewer participants in each group; and studies involving concurrent administration of other pharmacological compounds.

To ensure comparable and reliable outcome measures, we focused on studies that used standardised, well validated rating scales of psychotic, negative and general psychiatric symptoms (the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]). These tools are designed to measure change in symptoms across psychopathological symptom domains relevant to schizophrenia, including positive (psychotic-like) symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder, as well as negative symptoms such as blunted affect, anhedonia and amotivation, and general psychopathology, including depressive, cognitive, and anxiety symptoms. Additional searches were made for other well validated scales (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, and Community Assessment of Psychic Experience), details of which can be found in the (appendix p 2). These searches were not in the original protocol and were done at the request of reviewers.

### Keep off the grass? Cannabis, cognition and addiction [^112nuaud]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2016). Medium credibility.

In an increasing number of states and countries, cannabis now stands poised to join alcohol and tobacco as a legal drug. Quantifying the relative adverse and beneficial effects of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids should therefore be prioritized. Whereas newspaper headlines have focused on links between cannabis and psychosis, less attention has been paid to the much more common problem of cannabis addiction. Certain cognitive changes have also been attributed to cannabis use, although their causality and longevity are fiercely debated. Identifying why some individuals are more vulnerable than others to the adverse effects of cannabis is now of paramount importance to public health. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about such vulnerability factors, the variations in types of cannabis, and the relationship between these and cognition and addiction.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^113DB6F6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis is one of the most commonly used illegal substances of abuse in western countries. Problematic use in the general population is as high as 9.5% in the United States, while 2.6% of the UK population report having been cannabis dependent in the last year. Its use is particularly common in young people. A recent study reported that 31% of young people have used cannabis 3 or more times by age 18 years. Cannabis use is linked to multiple harms, including cardiovascular disease, motor vehicle accidents, and mental health problems. Younger people are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of cannabis use. In adolescents, it is linked to future expression of psychotic symptoms. Though apparent, the association with depression and anxiety is weaker. The prospective association between cannabis use and manic symptoms or bipolar disorder diagnosis is under-investigated, though converging evidence indicates its possible importance. First, there are high rates of co-occurrence of substance misuse and bipolar disorders, (cannabis is the most frequently used drug in bipolar disorder). Second, cannabis use in bipolar disorder is known to be associated with worse treatment complianceand more hospitalizations. Third there is a cross-sectional link between substance misuse and adolescent-onset bipolar disorder. Finally bipolar disorder in adulthood may itself be associated with increasing cannabis use.

Despite these multiple associations, only prospective studies can adequately establish whether cannabis use may be causally linked to manic symptoms or bipolar disorder. In a systematic literature review covering adults over 18 years of age, we identified 6 prospective studies examining this question. We concluded that cannabis use worsens manic symptoms in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder, and might also contribute to the genesis of manic-type symptoms in those with no pre-existing bipolar disorder. In one particularl relevant study, Tijssen et alexamined the 8-year longitudinal impact of substance misuse in 705 adolescents aged 14–17 years. This sampling reduced the risks of reverse causality, given that most bipolar disorder occurs after this, with a peak incidence at age 21 years. Cannabis use led to a 4-fold increase in the odds of subthreshold manic symptoms, though adjustment for psychotic symptoms was not possible. Thus, the direction and specificity of the association remains unclear (ie, it is plausible that observed links were attributable to co-morbid psychotic symptoms).

### Baseline characteristics and outcomes in patients with first episode or multiple episodes of acute mania [^115S7dcQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous studies have reported differential responses to therapeutic interventions depending on the patient's history with bipolar disorder, which highlights the importance of understanding the longitudinal nature of the disorder. The goal of the present analyses was to describe and compare the baseline characteristics, response to treatment, and medication patterns in adult patients experiencing a first episode versus multiple episodes of mania.

Method

The European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM) study was a 2-year prospective, observational study to evaluate outcomes in patients experiencing a DSM-IV- or ICD-10-diagnosed manic or mixed episode. The study was conducted from December 2002 to June 2004.

Results

Among 3,115 patients, 256 (8.2%) enrolled with a first manic or mixed episode. Relative to multiple-episode patients, first-episode patients were younger and had a lower body mass index (BMI), a higher incidence of past or current cannabis abuse, significantly higher baseline Young Mania Rating Scale total and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) mania scores, and lower CGI-BP depression and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (5-item version) total scores. At the 12-week endpoint, rates of recovery and remission were greater for first-episode patients, and times to recovery and remission were shorter.

Conclusions

Limitations of the study were that entry of patients into this study with an acute manic or mixed episode was determined by clinical interview but not confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview. That information on the course of illness prior to entry into the study was obtained retrospectively. First-episode patients presented with different baseline illness characteristics and achieved recovery and remission more rapidly than multiple-episode patients.

### Risks and benefits of psilocybin use in people with bipolar disorder: an international web-based survey on experiences of' magic mushroom' consumption [^1138qZx6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Current procedures for psilocybin clinical trials may need to be modified to account for risks specific to populations with BD. For example, after a session of psilocybin, participants are typically transported home by a family member or caregiver. Given the not-infrequent experience of symptom escalation reported by participants in the present survey, a BD psilocybin trial would benefit from assertive follow-up with participants/a nominated contact at a minimum. Some individuals with BD may require monitoring within the facility (with availability of appropriate pharmacological treatments to ensure adequate sleep takes place following a session). Other risk mitigation strategies include careful screening for prodromal hypomanic symptoms before psilocybin administration and monitoring for adherence to prescription medication. The emerging study of methods to integrate challenging psychedelic experiences also has relevance to the design of clinical trials in this population, given the number of individuals reporting increases in anxiety, depressive symptoms and psychosis-like experiences. Attention to psychological state prior to administration ('set') and interpersonal/physical characteristics of the administration environment ('setting') may help minimise the experience of distressing reactions to psychedelics. More research on potential risk factors is required to appropriately tailor risk management procedures in BD clinical trials: the present survey was not able to rule out the influence of alternative precipitating factors for adverse events, including polysubstance use, preexisting subthreshold mood elevation and set/setting. The likelihood of adverse events in a more carefully controlled clinical setting may differ from those reported in non-prescribed/recreational use.

### Are adolescents more vulnerable to the harmful effects of cannabis than adults? A placebo-controlled study in human males [^1157kCUJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

These results are in line with our first hypothesis that adolescents would be less sensitive to physiological, intoxication and anxiogenic effects compared with adults. These findings accord with the preclinical evidence that shows reduced anxiogenic, aversive and locomotor effects in adolescent rodents. Further, while our second hypothesis predicted a greater degree of psychotomimetic effects following cannabis in the adolescents compared with the adults, we instead found the opposite: cognitive disorganization was especially elevated in adults compared with adolescents after cannabis. This unexpected finding is however in agreement with our first hypothesis of lesser intoxication effects in adolescents, perhaps suggesting a common mechanism by which adolescents are resilient to the acute negative effects of cannabis. It may also reflect an awareness in adults of the greater cognitive impairments they were experiencing, rather than amplified psychotic-like effects of cannabis per se. We also found that cannabis increased anhedonia symptoms in adults but not in adolescents; interestingly however, on placebo the adolescents had (non-significantly) higher levels of anhedonia than the adults.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114qsvH8]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder diagnosis — validated instruments for suspected hypomania/mania in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with antidepressants: The Work Group categorized this as Reviewed, New-added and reported very low confidence; across studies, diagnostic accuracy evidence ranged from low to very low, including use of HCL-32, MDQ, and HCL-13, with the largest cohort (n = 1,487), and all studies relied on DSM-IV criteria with two studies unclear about independent interpretation of the reference test. The Work Group determined that benefits of using a validated instrument in this setting outweighed the potential harms, which were small, and noted that patient values and preferences favored appropriate diagnosis and related treatment; the Work Group made a recommendation for individuals with MDD on antidepressants when there is suspicion for mania/hypomania.

Effects on Mental Health

Disruptions of the cannabinergic system may have important implications for a number of neurobehavioral processes. There is evidence of an association between cannabis use and both acute and chronic mental illness and psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and an amotivational state. However, given the variation in the disease process, as well as inconsistent cannabis dosing and composition, the full nature of the associations remains to be clarified.

In studies of cannabis use and bipolar disorder, it appears that cannabis use may exacerbate or trigger manic symptoms among individuals previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Gibbs et al. found a 3-fold increase in risk for onset of manic symptoms after cannabis use. However, there does not seem to be evidence that cannabis use is a risk factor for developing bipolar disorder. Mixed findings are found when examining the relationship between cannabis use and depression and anxiety. There is some evidence that cannabis use and cannabis withdrawal may result in acute depressed mood. Similarly, studies suggest that cannabis may increase acute anxiety. The picture of chronic anxiety and depression and cannabis use is more complicated, in part because frequent cannabis users have both a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, and individuals with anxiety have high rates of cannabis use. The fact that individuals who initiate cannabis use in adolescence may develop depression and anxiety that persists after cessation may also influence this relationship. Furthermore, interpreting causality is complicated by the fact that a low concentration of THC may have anxiolytic effects, whereas higher concentrations produce anxiogenic effects, and the evidence that CBD may mitigate the effects of THC in animal models of anxiety.

A significant portion of the literature dedicated to cannabis use and mental health focuses on the relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia and psychosis. A number of studies suggest that acute cannabis exposure may induce temporary psychosis. Additionally, chronic cannabis use may trigger psychosis and schizophrenia in individuals with a predisposition or genetic susceptibility to mental illness. This appears to occur in a dose-dependent manner, such that heavy cannabis use, longer duration, greater potency, and early onset of use may be more closely aligned with disease trajectory, often significantly advancing the first psychotic episode and development of schizophrenia. Additionally, lifetime cannabis use has been associated with higher schizotypy scores, and cannabis may exacerbate pre-existing symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia. Furthermore, individuals with psychosis may be more vulnerable to brain volume loss, which has been suggested as a result of cannabis exposure.

### Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study [^114UohoD]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analyses

We used Stata, release 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) for data analysis and expressed associations as odds ratios from logistic regression models.

All analyses were a priori adjusted for age at baseline (in years), sex (0 = female, 1 = male), socioeconomic status (lower, middle, upper, other, as assessed at baseline), use of other drugs at baseline and T2, childhood trauma (that is, trauma before the age of 14 as assessed at baseline), and urban/rural environment. The variable use of other drugs included psychostimulants, sedatives, opiates, cocaine, phencyclidine, and psychedelic drugs and refers to CIDI rated use of five times or more (lifetime or interval use at baseline and T2 respectively) of any of these drugs, as assessed with the L section of the M-CIDI. Childhood trauma refers to experience of any traumatic experience during childhood as assessed with the N section of the M-CIDI at baseline and was dichotomously defined as present or absent. Fisher and colleagues have shown that self report questionnaires constitute a valid method of assessing childhood trauma in individuals presenting with psychotic features. Urban/rural environment was assessed at baseline by retrieving data on place of residence from the population registry offices of the city and the 29 counties of Munich and was defined as either living in the city of Munich (10 559 people per km 2) or in the rural surroundings (1432 people per km 2) at baseline.

To examine whether associations between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms were independent of other psychiatric diagnoses at baseline, we additionally adjusted analyses for any psychiatric diagnosis other than psychosis at baseline. We used a dichotomous variable of any psychiatric diagnosis (present versus absent), summarising main psychiatric diagnoses other than psychosis at baseline (such as major depressive disorder, hypomania, dysthymic disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, conversion disorder, somatisation disorder, eating disorders).

We carried out sensitivity analyses to investigate whether attrition occurred at random and to assess potential bias introduced by missing data. This was done by multiple imputation of missing values with the ICE routine in Stata 11.1. This method imputes several alternative versions of the complete dataset from the available data.

### The endocannabinoid system as a putative target for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses [^1127Q3fX]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While many advocacy and patient-oriented groups have argued for the use of whole cannabis as a therapeutic approach, there are several key issues that should be addressed. First, cannabis is a complex plant with varying chemical compositions across different strains or chemovars, most of which have largely unknown biological actions. More so, the interactions that could occur through the co-exposure to these molecules represent an unknown that makes the medical community generally wary of this approach. Typical medications come in standardized dosing and formulations for consistency across time and patients, and currently this is virtually impossible to do with cannabis. Second, approximately 19% of individuals who use cannabis develop a cannabis use disorder (CUD) (Hasin,) and therefore this risk must be factored into any therapeutic approach when considering the benefit v. the potential harms. To date, the few studies that have looked at therapeutic effect of cannabis itself have not found robust outcomes associated with cannabis, and as such the overwhelming view is that the potential harms associated with cannabis itself may likely outweigh its potential to provide therapeutic benefit. Third, chronic use of cannabis is known to be associated with alteration of components of the eCB system (Ceccarini et al.). This indicates that there is potential for excess use of cannabis to compromise normative eCB function, which in turn could ultimately make a disease process worse if the pathology of that disease already involves dysfunction of the eCB system. Fourth, cannabis use exhibits clear relationships with either the development or worsening of psychiatric conditions (De Aquino et al.), particularly schizophrenia and possibly depression (Sideli, Quigley, La Cascia, & Murray). While the nature of these relationships is still not entirely clear (Hill,), these risks contribute to the potential harms of utilizing cannabis itself as a therapeutic approach. Thus, the notion that cannabis will become a therapeutic tool that is accepted by the broad medical community seems highly unlikely given the adverse effects and risks for harm described above. Contrastingly, there is a wide-spread recognition that there is a biological basis by which cannabis benefits many individuals, which has led to the perspective that there may be differential ways to target the eCB system independent of cannabis, which could still harness the therapeutic potential of the eCB system, without the potential risks and harms associated with cannabis itself. As such, the aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date discussion of pharmacological approaches targeting the eCB system and the current state of knowledge of how these approaches are being tested for certain psychiatric conditions, with a focus on substance use disorders, trauma related disorders, and autism.

### Is early exposure to cannabis associated with bipolar disorder? Results from a Finnish birth cohort study [^115YnehC]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, the association between exposure to cannabis at age 15/16 years and subsequent onset of bipolar disorder was not significant after adjusting for other substance use. Future studies need to consider other substance use when evaluating the association of cannabis use with bipolar disorder. More prospective studies with multiple time‐points of cannabis use assessment, adequate sample sizes and lengths of follow‐up are required to inform whether the association of early exposure to cannabis and bipolar disorder is independent, as well as to eliminate the possibility of reverse causality.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^115txdFG]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Cannabis use in young people is common and associated with psychiatric disorders. However, the prospective link between cannabis use and bipolar disorder symptoms has rarely been investigated. The study hypothesis was that adolescent cannabis use is associated with hypomania in early adulthood via several potential etiological pathways.

Methods

Data were used from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK birth cohort study. The prospective link between cannabis use at age 17 and hypomania at age 22–23 years was tested using regression analysis, adjusted for gender, early environmental risk factors, alcohol and drug use, and depression and psychotic symptoms at age 18 years. Path analysis examined direct and indirect effects of the link and whether gender, childhood family adversity, or childhood abuse are associated with hypomania via an increased risk of cannabis use.

Results

Data were available on 3370 participants. Cannabis use at least 2–3 times weekly was associated with later hypomania (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.49–3.28) after adjustment. There was a dose–response relationship (any use vs weekly). Cannabis use mediated the association of both childhood sexual abuse and hypomania, and male gender and hypomania. The cannabis use-hypomania link was not mediated by depression or psychotic symptoms.

Conclusions

Adolescent cannabis use may be an independent risk factor for future hypomania, and the nature of the association suggests a potential causal link. Cannabis use mediates the link between childhood abuse and future hypomania. As such it might be a useful target for indicated prevention of hypomania.

### Association between cannabis use and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: an individual participant data meta-analysis on 3053 individuals [^111uHwUw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Considering previous knowledge along with the current findings on positive and excitement dimensions, raising public health awareness on the harmful effects of cannabis is appropriate. Indeed, a high severity of these symptoms tends to disrupt the therapeutic alliance and puts individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who are using cannabis especially at-risk for the discontinuation of their treatment and poor clinical outcomes. However, the lower severity of negative symptoms for cannabis-users cannot be ignored. The presented results support both the self-medication and toxicity hypotheses of cannabis use, with differential effects on positive and negative symptoms. More longitudinal designs are needed to fully understand the role of cannabis use on symptom dimensions. In addition, the composition of cannabis needs to be acknowledged as its two main components, THC and CBD, were shown to have differential impacts on healthy individuals, THC inducing both positive and negative symptoms. A recent review highlighted the need for trials to investigate this issue among patients with schizophrenia, as the few available trials are insufficient to bring evidence for an effect of THC or CBD on the global symptomatology in this population mainly due to the high heterogeneity between trials (e.g. in dose, length of treatment). The presented findings reflect the complexity of the interaction between cannabis use and the symptomatology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and allowed to disentangle its association with multiple symptom dimensions. Its opposite association regarding negative and positive symptoms provides interesting perspectives for future longitudinal designs and clinical trials.

### Is early exposure to cannabis associated with bipolar disorder? Results from a Finnish birth cohort study [^112N7qWh]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this birth cohort study, we report a crude association between adolescent cannabis use and subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. This association remained significant after adjusting for sex, family structure, parental psychiatric disorders and baseline adolescent emotional and behavioral problems. However, further adjustments for frequent alcohol intoxications, daily smoking and other illicit drug use attenuated association to statistically non‐significant. Early cannabis use was thus not found to be associated with onset of bipolar disorder after extensive confounder control including adolescent substance use other than cannabis. However, while an independent association between cannabis use and bipolar disorder was not seen due to confounding by other substance use, the data still suggest early cannabis exposure to be an adverse clinical marker for onset of bipolar disorder. Moreover, participants in this cohort who smoked cannabis before age 16 years have been shown to be at increased risk of other adverse mental health outcomes, including psychosis and self‐harm. Therefore, reducing cannabis use in adolescents is an important public health priority.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence [^115uxYYU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit drug in the world. Demand for treatment of cannabis use disorders is increasing. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or supportive care for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to 4 March 2014), MEDLINE (to week 3 February 2014), EMBASE (to 3 March 2014) and PsycINFO (to week 4 February 2014). We also searched reference lists of articles, electronic sources of ongoing trials and conference proceedings, and contacted selected researchers active in the area.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving the use of medications to reduce the symptoms and signs of cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in participants diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. All review authors confirmed the inclusion decisions and the overall process.

Main Results

We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 958 participants. For 10 studies the average age was 33 years; two studies targeted young people; and age data were not available for two studies. Approximately 80% of study participants were male. The studies were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. Three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications included preparations containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (two studies), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (two studies), mixed action antidepressants (three studies), anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (three studies), an atypical antidepressant (two studies), an anxiolytic (one study), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (one study) and a glutamatergic modulator (one study). One study examined more than one medication. Diversity in the medications and the outcomes reported limited the extent that analysis was possible. Insufficient data were available to assess the utility of most of the medications to promote cannabis abstinence at the end of treatment. There was moderate quality evidence that completion of treatment was more likely with preparations containing THC compared to placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55; 2 studies, 207 participants, P = 0.006). There was some evidence that treatment with preparations containing THC was associated with reduced cannabis withdrawal symptoms and craving, but this latter outcome could not be quantified. For mixed action antidepressants compared with placebo (2 studies, 179 participants) there was very low quality evidence on the likelihood of abstinence from cannabis at the end of follow-up (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.41), and moderate quality evidence on the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21). For this same outcome there was very low quality evidence for the effects of SSRI antidepressants (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.53; 2 studies, 122 participants), anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.46; 2 studies, 75 participants), and the atypical antidepressant, bupropion (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; 2 studies, 92 participants). Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant) and N-acetylcysteine (glutamatergic modulator) was insufficient for quantitative estimates of their effectiveness, but these medications may be worth further investigation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many of the outcomes the quality was downgraded due to small sample sizes, inconsistency and risk of attrition bias. The quantitative analyses that were possible, combined with general findings of the studies reviewed, indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, atypical antidepressants (bupropion), anxiolytics (buspirone) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (atomoxetine) are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Preparations containing THC are of potential value but, given the limited evidence, this application of THC preparations should be considered still experimental. Further studies should compare different preparations of THC, dose and duration of treatment, adjunct medications and therapies. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin and the glutamatergic modulator N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

### Co-morbid cannabis use disorder and chronotype are associated with mood symptom onset in people with bipolar disorder [^1176NTWH]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder defined by recurrent mood shifts between depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes that contribute to poor psychosocial and health outcomes. In addition to mood episodes, people with BD are at a higher risk for co-morbid health outcomes which may further worsen their quality of life. Substance use disorders (SUD) are amongst the most prominent co-occurring conditions that present in people with BD. In fact, compared to other serious mental illnesses, BD has amongst the highest comorbidity of SUD. The high prevalence of co-morbid BD and SUD could indicate an underlying cause that contributes to an increased susceptibility towards developing both conditions. Circadian rhythm disturbances may increase susceptibility towards a co-morbid substance use disorder. Circadian rhythm disruptions are a hallmark feature of BD that have also been implicated as a contributing factor towards substance abuse(;). Notably, circadian rhythms disruptions in people with BD can worsen sleep and mood symptoms and adversely affect clinical course and treatment, including substance use outcomes. In particular, evening chronotype (i.e. a tendency to sleep and wake later and proxy for circadian phase delay) has been associated with a higher risk of BD as well as substance use and relapse.

Amongst other forms of substance use, cannabis use is one of the most prevalent in people with BD, with up to 70% reporting a lifetime history of regular cannabis use and up to 20% with a comorbid cannabis use disorder (CUD) diagnosis. Cannabis is also commonly used for its reputed sleep-promoting properties(;). In fact, 70% of people with BD reported using cannabis specifically to address sleep disturbances in one study. However, the effects of cannabis on circadian regulation of sleep remain unclear; thus, there remain concerns that cannabis may interact with the compromised circadian system in BD and further exacerbate symptoms. Notably, cannabis use has been associated with a significantly younger age of schizophrenia onset and age of onset at first psychosis treatment. Cannabis use has been associated with worse mania and psychosis symptoms, an earlier age of BD onset, and overall worse BD illness progression. As such, cannabis use has been identified as a potential risk factor for the development of BD and the worsening of BD symptoms.

### Assessing rates and predictors of cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms across observational, experimental and medical research [^11198Gaf]. Nature: Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Cannabis, one of the most widely used psychoactive substances worldwide, can give rise to acute cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms (CAPS). While distinct study designs have been used to examine CAPS, an overarching synthesis of the existing findings has not yet been carried forward. To that end, we quantitatively pooled the evidence on rates and predictors of CAPS (k = 162 studies, n = 210,283 cannabis-exposed individuals) as studied in (1) observational research, (2) experimental tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) studies, and (3) medicinal cannabis research. We found that rates of CAPS varied substantially across the study designs, given the high rates reported by observational and experimental research (19% and 21%, respectively) but not medicinal cannabis studies (2%). CAPS was predicted by THC administration (for example, single dose, Cohen's d = 0.7), mental health liabilities (for example, bipolar disorder, d = 0.8), dopamine activity (d = 0.4), younger age (d = −0.2), and female gender (d = −0.09). Neither candidate genes (for example, COMT, AKT1) nor other demographic variables (for example, education) predicted CAPS in meta-analytical models. The results reinforce the need to more closely monitor adverse cannabis-related outcomes in vulnerable individuals as these individuals may benefit most from harm-reduction efforts.

### Safety and toxicology of cannabinoids [^113imNHZ]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are more than 60 systematic reviews and meta-analyses discussing the safety, toxicology, potency, and therapeutic potential of exogenous cannabinoids. However, the general consensus of these reports is largely mixed and inconclusive. The uncertainty surrounding safety and efficacy of exogenous cannabinoids is not a product of the lack of research, but rather a product of the extreme variability in study methodology and quality. This review provides a summary of the current research on the safety and efficacy of exogenous cannabinoids, including a brief description of the chemical constituents of cannabis and how it interacts with the endocannabinoid system; a summary of what is known about the acute and long-term effects of cannabis; and a discussion of the therapeutic potential. Conclusions on safety and efficacy will then be compared with the current social and political climate in order to highlight the need for policy changes and general guidelines.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence [^115Kqzpe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs involving 1755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years); three studies targeted young people (mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. One study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the extent of analysis. Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations than with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence). For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in the likelihood of abstinence at end of treatment compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was qualitative evidence of reduced intensity of withdrawal symptoms with THC preparations compared to placebo. For other pharmacotherapies, this outcome was either not examined, or no significant differences was reported. Adverse effects were no more likely with THC preparations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence). For SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in adverse effects compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations, SSRIs antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the likelihood of treatment completion with THC preparations, SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence) or with N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers appeared to reduce the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant), oxytocin (neuropeptide) and atomoxetine was insufficient for estimates of effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or very low. Findings indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone and atomoxetine are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, THC preparations should be considered still experimental, with some positive effects on withdrawal symptoms and craving. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin, oxytocin, and N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

### Psychiatric symptoms caused by cannabis constituents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1153G5Sh]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Background

Approximately 188 million people use cannabis yearly worldwide, and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states, Canada, and Uruguay for recreational use. The potential for increased cannabis use highlights the need to better understand its risks, including the acute induction of psychotic and other psychiatric symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effect of the cannabis constituent Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone and in combination with cannabidiol (CBD) compared with placebo on psychiatric symptoms in healthy people.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published in English between database inception and May 21, 2019, with a within-person, crossover design. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting symptoms using psychiatric scales (the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) following the acute administration of intravenous, oral, or nasal THC, CBD, and placebo in healthy participants, and presenting data that allowed calculation of standardised mean change (SMC) scores for positive (including delusions and hallucinations), negative (such as blunted affect and amotivation), and general (including depression and anxiety) symptoms. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to assess the main outcomes of the effect sizes for total, positive, and negative PANSS and BPRS scores measured in healthy participants following THC administration versus placebo. Because the number of studies to do a meta-analysis on CBD's moderating effects was insufficient, this outcome was only systematically reviewed. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136674.

Findings

15 eligible studies involving the acute administration of THC and four studies on CBD plus THC administration were identified. Compared with placebo, THC significantly increased total symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in nine studies, with ten independent samples, involving 196 participants: SMC 1.10 [95% CI 0.92–1.28], p < 0.0001); positive symptom severity (assessed in 14 studies, with 15 independent samples, involving 324 participants: SMC 0.91 [95% CI 0.68–1.14], p < 0.0001); and negative symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in 12 studies, with 13 independent samples, involving 267 participants: SMC 0.78 [95% CI 0.59–0.97], p < 0.0001). In the systematic review, of the four studies evaluating CBD's effects on THC-induced symptoms, only one identified a significant reduction in symptoms.

Interpretation

A single THC administration induces psychotic, negative, and other psychiatric symptoms with large effect sizes. There is no consistent evidence that CBD induces symptoms or moderates the effects of THC. These findings highlight the potential risks associated with the use of cannabis and other cannabinoids that contain THC for recreational or therapeutic purposes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115qfMSD]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bipolar disorder, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using a validated instrument, such as the Hypomania Checklist or the Mood Disorder Questionnaire, for suspected mania/hypomania in patients with major depressive disorder being treated with antidepressants.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^116dTodi]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder (BD) guideline — evidence eligibility and grading criteria state that for all key questions (KQs) except KQs 1 and 2, a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an independent control group was required, and crossover trials were excluded unless first-phase data were reported separately. KQ 1 and KQ 2 also allowed observational diagnostic designs comparing assessment methods for screening/diagnosis of BD and for identifying first episodes of mania or hypomania in patients treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD). Minimum sample size criteria required at least 20 patients (10 per study group for treatment studies, 20 total patients for diagnostic or prognostic studies), and small studies were downgraded for precision by one level when a single study had < 200 patients per arm; when newer Cochrane reviews had already accounted for small sample size in risk-of-bias estimation, those data were not downgraded a second time. Population criteria required that studies enroll at least 85% adults (age 18 years and older) meeting BD-related DSM-5 diagnoses, with mixed-population studies needing at least 85% with the relevant condition, and studies had to report at least one outcome of interest.

### Psychiatric symptoms caused by cannabis constituents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LsHqQ]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Approximately 188 million people use cannabis yearly worldwide, and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states, Canada, and Uruguay for recreational use. The potential for increased cannabis use highlights the need to better understand its risks, including the acute induction of psychotic and other psychiatric symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effect of the cannabis constituent Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone and in combination with cannabidiol (CBD) compared with placebo on psychiatric symptoms in healthy people.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published in English between database inception and May 21, 2019, with a within-person, crossover design. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting symptoms using psychiatric scales (the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) following the acute administration of intravenous, oral, or nasal THC, CBD, and placebo in healthy participants, and presenting data that allowed calculation of standardised mean change (SMC) scores for positive (including delusions and hallucinations), negative (such as blunted affect and amotivation), and general (including depression and anxiety) symptoms. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to assess the main outcomes of the effect sizes for total, positive, and negative PANSS and BPRS scores measured in healthy participants following THC administration versus placebo. Because the number of studies to do a meta-analysis on CBD's moderating effects was insufficient, this outcome was only systematically reviewed. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136674.

Findings

15 eligible studies involving the acute administration of THC and four studies on CBD plus THC administration were identified. Compared with placebo, THC significantly increased total symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in nine studies, with ten independent samples, involving 196 participants: SMC 1.10 [95% CI 0.92–1.28], p < 0.0001); positive symptom severity (assessed in 14 studies, with 15 independent samples, involving 324 participants: SMC 0.91 [95% CI 0.68–1.14], p < 0.0001); and negative symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in 12 studies, with 13 independent samples, involving 267 participants: SMC 0.78 [95% CI 0.59–0.97], p < 0.0001). In the systematic review, of the four studies evaluating CBD's effects on THC-induced symptoms, only one identified a significant reduction in symptoms.

Interpretation

A single THC administration induces psychotic, negative, and other psychiatric symptoms with large effect sizes. There is no consistent evidence that CBD induces symptoms or moderates the effects of THC. These findings highlight the potential risks associated with the use of cannabis and other cannabinoids that contain THC for recreational or therapeutic purposes.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^1155ePLf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

The precise neurochemical mechanism by which cannabis might lead to hypomania is unclear, reflecting the incomplete knowledge of the biology of bipolar disorders in general. However, current evidence provides tentative insights. Neurobiological studies indicate the brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use during adolescence. It has the potential to adjust reward system sensitivityand can interfere with mechanisms related to establishing axonal connections during development. A recent systematic review of the literature highlights that converging evidence from imaging as well as pharmacological studies indicates a state of hyperdopaminergia in mania. Cannabis causes signaling changes in the meso-limbic system, resulting in dopaminergic hyperactivity, and some cannabinoid receptors are known to reduce the uptake of dopamine thereby potentiating its actions. Increased reward circuitry activity demonstrated by reduced differences in activation of dopaminergic brain areas (eg, nucleus accumbens) during anticipation and receipt of rewards has been demonstrated in manic patients; this differentiates them from patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Finally dopaminergic signaling is known to increase as part of normal brain maturation during the adolescent period. Cannabis use may compound this, leading to an increased propensity to experience hypomanic symptomatology.

Strengths and Limitations

This study had several strengths. The prospective assessments and sampling adolescents at age 17 years reduces the risk of reverse causality. The path analysis also controls for all associations between correlated items, enabling an examination of simultaneous pathways and determining the specificity of associations.

There are also study limitations. Our conclusions regarding the link between cannabis use and hypomania must remain cautious. The HCL-32 asks about a lifetime history of hypomania symptoms, and so in some cases the experience assessed at age 22–23 years may have preceded cannabis use. However, as the peak incidence of hypomania/mania appears to be bi-modal with the first peak between age 21 and 23 years and the second at around age 35 years, a majority of participants are likely to have first experienced hypomania after the age of cannabis use assessment. There may also be pre-existing psychopathology that could link to cannabis use and hypomanic symptoms that we did not account for.

### Sex-specific susceptibility to psychotic-like States provoked by prenatal THC exposure: reversal by pregnenolone [^116PM14M]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sociocultural attitudes towards cannabis legalization contribute to the common misconception that it is a relatively safe drug and its use during pregnancy poses no risk to the fetus. However, longitudinal studies demonstrate that maternal cannabis exposure results in adverse outcomes in the offspring, with a heightened risk for developing psychopathology. One of the most reported psychiatric outcomes is the proneness to psychotic-like experiences during childhood. How exposure to cannabis during gestation increases psychosis susceptibility in children and adolescents remains elusive. Preclinical research has indicated that in utero exposure to the major psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), deranges brain developmental trajectories towards vulnerable psychotic-like endophenotypes later in life. Here, we present how prenatal THC exposure (PCE) deregulates mesolimbic dopamine development predisposing the offspring to schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes, exclusively when exposed to environmental challenges, such as stress or THC. Detrimental effects of PCE are sex-specific because female offspring do not display psychotic-like outcomes upon exposure to these challenges. Moreover, we present how pregnenolone, a neurosteroid that showed beneficial properties on the effects elicited by cannabis intoxication, normalizes mesolimbic dopamine function and rescues psychotic-like phenotypes. We, therefore, suggest this neurosteroid as a safe "disease-modifying" aid to prevent the onset of psychoses in vulnerable individuals. Our findings corroborate clinical evidence and highlight the relevance of early diagnostic screening and preventative strategies for young individuals at risk for mental diseases, such as male PCE offspring.

### Assessing rates and predictors of cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms across observational, experimental and medical research [^115kDv23]. Nature: Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that cannabis can induce acute psychotic symptoms in individuals using cannabis for recreational or medicinal purposes. Some individuals appear to be particularly sensitive to the adverse acute effects of cannabis, notably young individuals with pre-existing mental health problems and individuals exposed to high levels of THC. Future studies should therefore monitor more closely adverse cannabis-related outcomes in vulnerable individuals as these individuals may benefit most from harm-reduction efforts.

### Cannabinoids in bipolar affective disorder: a review and discussion of their therapeutic potential [^1118fqFm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder is often poorly controlled by prescribed drugs. Cannabis use is common in patients with this disorder and anecdotal reports suggest that some patients take it to alleviate symptoms of both mania and depression. We undertook a literature review of cannabis use by patients with bipolar disorder and of the neuropharmacological properties of cannabinoids suggesting possible therapeutic effects in this condition. No systematic studies of cannabinoids in bipolar disorder were found to exist, although some patients claim that cannabis relieves symptoms of mania and/or depression. The cannabinoids Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) may exert sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic and anticonvulsant effects. Pure synthetic cannabinoids, such as dronabinol and nabilone and specific plant extracts containing THC, CBD, or a mixture of the two in known concentrations, are available and can be delivered sublingually. Controlled trials of these cannabinoids as adjunctive medication in bipolar disorder are now indicated.

### Cannabis use and hypomania in young people: a prospective analysis [^116BKXY5]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main Findings

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test the prospective association between adolescent cannabis use and hypomania in early adulthood, while controlling for a range of environmental risk factors, other substance use, and associated psychopathologies. Our analysis indicated 3 pathways whereby cannabis use is associated with subsequent hypomania.

First, adolescent cannabis use is independently associated with hypomania in early adulthood. This effect was independent of other key risk factors (or markers) for hypomania, including other drugs use, hazardous alcohol use, psychotic symptoms, and depression in late adolescence. This finding is consistent with population data in adults suggesting the association between cannabis use and manic symptomatology is independent of psychotic symptoms. The current study extends this previous work by demonstrating a prospective association in adolescents in which the cause (cannabis) is most likely to have preceded its effect (hypomania). The logistic regression analysis implied a dose–response relationship in that the odds ratios for frequent use was greater than for any use. Though we are tentative in our conclusions because of the observational nature of the data, our control for numerous confounders, the prospective association, and the dose–response findings are consistent with a causal role for cannabis use in the emergence of hypomania in young people.

Second, male sex is significantly indirectly associated with hypomania through an increased likelihood of cannabis use. Harmful use of cannabis is more frequent in men than women, and this study shows its use in men may be much more important in the pathway to hypomania.

Finally, childhood physical or sexual abuse is indirectly associated with hypomania through an increased likelihood of cannabis use. Both childhood abusive experiences and cannabis use in adolescence and adulthood have been shown to be connected to the expression of bipolar disorder psychopathology and to markers of its severity. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that childhood trauma and cannabis use are also linked, with some studies indicating a prospective association independent of markers of deprivation or family dysfunction. The prospective analysis presented here is the first to show that cannabis use in adolescence may be part of the mechanism whereby childhood abuse can lead to bipolar disorder psychopathology. It appears that cannabis use seems to be one response of an individual to traumatic childhood experiences that can lead to harmful psychopathology in young adulthood. Our results align with those of Aas et alin highlighting the importance of both cannabis use and childhood trauma in bipolar disorder symptomatology.

### Is early exposure to cannabis associated with bipolar disorder? Results from a Finnish birth cohort study [^114r7MnK]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

The northern Finland birth cohort (NFBC) 1986 is a prospective general population‐based study where rich phenotypical data are linked to national health‐care and medication registers for clinician‐rated ICD‐10 diagnoses for bipolar disorder. The study includes detailed information on socio‐demographic factors, mental health problems and adolescent substance use. This enables the examination of association between adolescent cannabis use and bipolar disorder in a robust analytical framework accounting for potential confounding factors.

The aim of our study was to examine the association between cannabis exposure prior to age 15/16 years and the onset of bipolar disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing a register‐based clinical bipolar disorder diagnosis as an outcome measure. This methodological approach ensures minimal attrition, thus enhancing the generalizability of the results. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is also the largest study in terms of sample size and only the second one to utilize a birth cohort‐based sample with prospective data. In addition, the 18‐year follow‐up in our study is more than twofold longer than any previous study conducted thus far covering the age range where diagnosis of bipolar disorder is most likely.

### Indications of a dose-response relationship between cannabis use and age at onset in bipolar disorder [^117XUdVG]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cannabis use seems to play a causal role in the development of psychotic disorders. Recent evidence suggests that it may also precipitate onset in bipolar disorder. We here investigate if there is a dose-response relationship between cannabis use and age at onset in bipolar disorder, and whether there are interactions between cannabis use and illness characteristics (presenting polarity and presence of psychosis). Consecutively recruited patients with a DSM-IV, SCID verified diagnosis of bipolar I, II or NOS disorder (n = 324) participated. Two-way ANCOVAS were used to investigate the effect of levels of cannabis use (< 10 times during one month lifetime, > 10 times during one month lifetime or a cannabis use disorder) on age at onset, including interaction effects with illness characteristics, while controlling for possible confounders. There was a significant association indicating a dose-response relationship between cannabis use and age at onset, which remained statistically significant after controlling for possible confounders (gender, bipolar subtype, family history of severe mental illness and alcohol or other substance use disorders). There were no interaction effects between cannabis use and presenting polarity or presence of psychosis. Doses of cannabis used may affect the age at onset of bipolar disorder.

### Recent cannabis use affects the association between baseline immune markers and long-term outcomes in psychosis [^115bUs1p]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The early prominence of the interaction effect between IL1-RA and cannabis use on psychotic episode risk may reflect a diminishing predictive power of certain baseline characteristics as the illness progresses, with cannabis use patterns, inflammatory status, and other psychotic relapse risk factors likely changing over time. In contrast, it is unclear why baseline sgp130 in cannabis users seems more predictive of long- than short-term outcomes. However, IL-6 signaling is complex and can be both pro- and anti-inflammatory depending on context. Furthermore, while sgp130 has been shown to specifically attenuate IL-6 trans-signaling, reflecting an anti-inflammatory effect, sgp130 may also influence classical IL-6 signaling depending on molar excess of soluble IL-6 receptor sIL-6R. Though speculative, high baseline sgp130 may confer short-term anti-inflammatory effects but could also reflect sustained IL-6 signaling which could be maladaptive and non-beneficial in the long-term. Notably, similar nonlinear associations have been reported in patients with acute coronary syndromes, where sgp130 may reflect a shift from compensatory to detrimental gp130-mediated signaling in the presence of high levels.
