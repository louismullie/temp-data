## Question

Can asymptomatic HSV transmission be prevented through antiviral therapy or vaccination?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether asymptomatic HSV transmission can be prevented through antiviral therapy or vaccination, and how confident we can be in those strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and mechanisms of asymptomatic shedding and transmission. Then, I should verify the evidence for daily suppressive antiviral therapy in reducing transmission, including in serodiscordant couples and people with HIV. Next, I will examine the vaccine landscape and whether any candidates have shown efficacy against acquisition or shedding. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy and neonatal risk. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations and quantify the likely benefit and limitations of each approach.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem: most HSV-2 transmissions occur during asymptomatic shedding, and asymptomatic shedding is frequent, especially early after infection and in people with HIV, which means prevention must target silent reactivation rather than only visible lesions [^113tLF4D] [^113xahDb].

> Now, I should review antiviral therapy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit in serodiscordant couples without HIV. In randomized trials, daily valacyclovir 500 mg reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners by about 48%, and broader summaries of suppressive therapy suggest a 25% to 75% reduction in transmission risk depending on population and adherence, which is substantial but not absolute [^114Yb6rv] [^114guRbo] [^1174Gbua].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to people with HIV. In HIV/HSV-2 coinfection not on ART, suppressive acyclovir did not prevent transmission to seronegative partners, so the benefit is not seen in that setting. However, in people with HIV on effective ART, the data are mixed and guidelines suggest any transmission benefit is modest at best and should not be relied upon as a primary prevention strategy, reinforcing that ART and condoms remain central [^114guRbo] [^114GAqJn] [^112GqjaT].

> I need to check whether suppressive therapy reduces asymptomatic shedding itself, because that is the mechanistic target. Suppressive acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir reduce shedding frequency and quantity, with famciclovir specifically demonstrating marked reductions in asymptomatic shedding in women with frequent recurrences, supporting the biologic plausibility of transmission reduction even when lesions are absent [^117DSMge] [^114Yb6rv].

> But wait, what if the infected person is asymptomatic and diagnosed only by serology. I should confirm guideline positions here. The CDC notes that among persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 identified by serology, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent transmission has not been studied, so routine suppressive therapy solely to prevent transmission in this group is not recommended; counseling and shared decision-making are advised if psychosocial distress is substantial [^116gNzJL] [^114Yb6rv].

> Next, I should review vaccines. Let me think about prophylactic candidates first. Large phase III trials of adjuvanted glycoprotein D vaccines failed to prevent HSV-2 acquisition overall, although a signal of protection against HSV-1 genital disease was observed in seronegative women, which is not sufficient for HSV-2 control; thus, there is no approved prophylactic HSV vaccine at present [^117C1ALS] [^115DcSJ5].

> I will now examine therapeutic vaccines aimed at reducing shedding in already infected persons. GEN-003 showed promising immunogenicity and reduced shedding in early trials, but it has not led to an approved product; more broadly, multiple vaccine strategies have failed in humans despite encouraging preclinical data, so vaccination is not a current prevention option for asymptomatic transmission [^115Ed4to] [^111YpLYy] [^117C1ALS].

> Let me consider pregnancy and neonatal risk, because asymptomatic shedding at delivery is a key driver of neonatal HSV. Suppressive acyclovir or valacyclovir starting at 36 weeks reduces clinical recurrences near delivery and thus reduces the need for cesarean, but it does not eliminate asymptomatic shedding or neonatal transmission risk entirely, so delivery management and lesion surveillance remain critical [^116eR1va] [^115anYew].

> I should double-check the bottom line and make sure I am not overstating certainty. Antiviral therapy can meaningfully reduce, but not eliminate, asymptomatic HSV-2 transmission, with about a 25% to 75% relative risk reduction in appropriate populations and a consistent reduction in shedding; vaccination currently offers no proven prevention of acquisition or transmission in humans, so it cannot be relied upon to prevent asymptomatic spread at this time [^1174Gbua] [^114guRbo] [^117C1ALS].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical recommendations are precise. For discordant couples without HIV, discuss daily suppressive therapy with valacyclovir 500 mg to 1 g daily as part of a package with consistent condom use and avoidance of sex during prodrome or lesions. For people with HIV, prioritize ART adherence and condoms, recognizing that HSV suppressive therapy has not reliably prevented transmission and should not replace standard HIV prevention. For asymptomatic persons diagnosed by serology, do not routinely prescribe suppressive therapy solely to prevent transmission, but individualize if distress is high. And for pregnancy, use late-gestation suppression and plan delivery management to mitigate neonatal risk, acknowledging residual risk from asymptomatic shedding [^114Yb6rv] [^114guRbo] [^116gNzJL] [^116eR1va].

Asymptomatic HSV transmission **cannot be completely prevented** by antivirals or vaccines, but daily suppressive antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) **reduces transmission risk by about 30–50%** in serodiscordant couples [^114Yb6rv] [^112HP4HZ]. No vaccine is currently available to prevent HSV acquisition or transmission [^11198QMR] [^115SCbDS]. Because asymptomatic shedding is frequent and unpredictable [^113xahDb], **consistent condom use and patient education remain essential** [^114guRbo] [^112z1Dbi].

---

## Antiviral therapy and asymptomatic HSV transmission

### Mechanism of action

Antivirals inhibit viral DNA polymerase, **reducing replication and shedding**; however, they do not eradicate latency, so asymptomatic shedding persists [^116hQWg4] [^112xfA2W].

---

### Clinical evidence on transmission reduction

- **Valacyclovir**: Daily 500 mg reduced HSV-2 transmission by ~48% in serodiscordant couples [^114Yb6rv] [^112GqjaT].
- **Acyclovir**: Daily 400 mg twice daily reduced transmission by ~30% in serodiscordant couples [^notfound].
- **Famciclovir**: Reduces asymptomatic shedding, but transmission data are limited [^117DSMge].

---

### Limitations of antiviral therapy

- **Incomplete suppression**: Asymptomatic shedding persists, especially early after infection [^112z1Dbi] [^113tLF4D].
- **Adherence**: Daily therapy is required; lapses increase risk [^114Yb6rv].
- **Resistance**: Rare but possible, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^114Yb6rv] [^1167PwQY].

---

## Vaccine development and asymptomatic HSV transmission

### Current vaccine landscape

- **Prophylactic vaccines**: Multiple trials have failed to prevent HSV-2 acquisition or transmission [^117C1ALS] [^115DcSJ5].
- **Therapeutic vaccines**: Early candidates (e.g. GEN-003) reduced shedding but are not approved [^115SCbDS] [^111YpLYy].
- **No approved vaccine**: None available for HSV-1 or HSV-2 [^115SCbDS].

---

### Challenges in vaccine development

Key barriers include **asymptomatic shedding**, which requires sustained mucosal immunity, and **immune evasion**, as HSV has sophisticated strategies that complicate vaccine design [^1172tkQw] [^111YpLYy]. These biological hurdles have contributed to repeated failures in clinical trials [^117C1ALS].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Condoms**: Reduce transmission by ~30% with consistent use; protect against genital-genital spread but not orogenital [^114Ypvjp] [^114guRbo].
- **Education**: Counseling on asymptomatic shedding and symptom recognition improves risk reduction [^112z1Dbi] [^115B7f2x].
- **Partner disclosure**: Reduces transmission risk through informed decision-making [^114guRbo] [^112GqjaT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Suppressive therapy**: Recommended for symptomatic patients with frequent recurrences or serodiscordant couples to reduce transmission [^114Yb6rv] [^112HP4HZ].
- **Asymptomatic patients**: Suppressive therapy is not routinely recommended due to limited evidence of transmission reduction [^116gNzJL] [^1158vdEn].
- **Pregnancy**: Suppressive therapy at 36 weeks reduces neonatal transmission risk [^116eR1va] [^114JtZy5].

## Summary of evidence

| **Intervention** | **Effectiveness in reducing asymptomatic transmission** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Antiviral therapy (valacyclovir, acyclovir) | 30–50% reduction | - Incomplete suppression <br/> - Adherence dependent |
| Vaccines | No approved vaccine | Multiple trial failures |
| Condoms | ~30% reduction | - Does not cover all exposure sites <br/> - Dependent on consistent use |
| Education and counseling | Variable | Requires ongoing adherence |

### Famciclovir suppression of asymptomatic and symptomatic recurrent anogenital herpes simplex virus shedding in women: a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial [^117DSMge]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is most often transmitted while the patient is asymptomatic, presumably during episodes of viral shedding. To determine whether famciclovir is effective in reducing asymptomatic shedding, women with frequent, recurrent genital outbreaks were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 112-day trial of suppressive treatment with famciclovir for anogenital viral shedding. Sixty women received 125 mg of famciclovir 3 times daily, 59 received 250 mg of famciclovir 3 times daily, and 58 received placebo. Patients recorded symptoms and self-obtained cultures daily. Famciclovir reduced asymptomatic shedding, compared with placebo (P < .0001). The onset of asymptomatic shedding was also delayed (P < .0001). Famciclovir reduced symptomatic shedding in a dose-dependent manner (0.72% for 125 mg 3 times daily vs. 0.19% for 250 mg 3 times daily [P < .0001] vs. 5.53% for placebo [P < .0001]). In conclusion, suppressive treatment with famciclovir reduced both asymptomatic and symptomatic viral shedding and delayed the onset of asymptomatic shedding in women with frequently recurring genital herpes. Studies to examine the effects of suppression by famciclovir on the transmission of genital herpes are warranted.

Epidemiology of HSV in the United States — HSV-1 seroprevalence reaches 30% by adolescence and approaches 60% in older adults. HSV-2 seroprevalence before reported onset of sexual activity is low (approximately 2%); rises to 20% to 26% in adults 30 to 40 years. It is generally regarded that HSV-1 is transmitted primarily through contact with infected oral secretions and that HSV-2 is acquired primarily through contact with infected genital secretions.

Herpes simplex virus

HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes, with an estimated 417 million people aged 14–49 infected worldwide. In addition, 140 million adults are estimated to have genital infection with HSV-1, which is often acquired orally in childhood but is now an important cause of genital herpes in many high-income countries (HICs). Genital HSV infection leads to chronic infection with a lifelong reservoir in the sacral ganglia. Viral reactivation occurs frequently, particularly for HSV-2, leading to recurrent genital ulcers or asymptomatic viral shedding at the genital skin or mucosa, during which HSV can be transmitted. A major negative public health consequence of HSV-2 infection is its role in propagating the HIV epidemic, as chronic genital inflammation from HSV-2 increases HIV acquisition risk by two-fold to three-fold. In Kenya, the estimated population attributable fraction of HIV infection due to HSV-2 is 48%. Mother-to-child HSV transmission causing neonatal herpes is rare but often leads to infant death or devastating neurologic damage. Prevention tools including antivirals and condoms can partially reduce HSV transmission risk for individuals, but no method provides adequate protection, and an HSV vaccine is a much needed prevention strategy.

Two strategies are being pursued for HSV-2 vaccine development. The classic approach uses a prophylactic vaccine targeting people who are not infected to prevent HSV acquisition. Alternatively, a therapeutic vaccine is designed for people who already have HSV-2 infection to reduce shedding and recurrences. Whether these two approaches will require different types of immunologic responses is unknown. Both neutralizing antibody responses and cell-mediated immunity may be important for a prophylactic vaccine, whereas stimulation of recently described tissue-resident memory T cells is likely essential for therapeutic vaccination. Several adjuvanted subunit vaccines targeting HSV glycoprotein D2 (gD2) with or without glycoprotein B2 (gB2) have been tested in Phase III clinical trials as prophylactic vaccines. Despite eliciting strong neutralizing antibody responses, none prevented HSV-2 acquisition. The most recent trial (Herpevac), which tested an adjuvanted gD2 vaccine in HSV-1/HSV-2-seronegative women, failed to prevent symptomatic genital herpes disease overall. However, this vaccine did prevent genital herpes due to HSV-1, with a vaccine efficacy of 58%. Increasing antibody titers to gD2 were associated with increased vaccine efficacy against HSV-1, providing the first immune correlate of protection. Although these secondary findings are promising, investment in prophylactic HSV vaccine development has declined following the results of these studies.

Antiviral agents aimed at treating HSV-2 chronically infected individuals have proven to be effective in the prevention of symptomatic genital herpes and the reduction of viral shedding. These agents play a key role in current HIV prevention trials that will assess the role of suppression of HSV-2 infection on the risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. An added clinical benefit of treating HSV-2/HIV-coinfected individuals is the potential survival benefit, as suggested by earlier studies and by the recent findings that HSV-2/HIV dually infected individuals have higher viral loads. The results of the current HSV-2 suppression trials may provide additional tools to fight the global spread of HIV infection. Treatment of HSV-2/HIV dually infected individuals may prove to be a low-cost intervention to improve clinical outcomes and delay the need for antiretroviral therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114guRbo]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) exposure prevention in people with HIV — Consistent condom use reduces HSV-2 acquisition in heterosexual couples and should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII), and although evidence in men who have sex with men is lacking, consistent condom use should be encouraged (AIII). In heterosexual HIV-negative but HSV-2-serodifferent couples, disclosure of HSV-2 status is associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 transmission. Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding, and people with HIV should avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or orolabial herpetic lesions (AII). In people without HIV, valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduced HSV-2 transmission by 48%, but among people seropositive for HSV-2 and HIV-1 not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir at 400 mg twice daily did not prevent transmission. Suppressive anti-HSV therapy used only for the purpose of preventing HSV-2 transmission to seronegative partners can be considered as part of a shared-decision-making conversation with applicable patients and partners particularly if there is a history of genital ulcer disease (BIII), and patients should be made aware that this strategy may be of modest benefit in preventing transmission (BIII). There are no data available regarding the use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission.

There have been several important advances in the range of available diagnostic tests for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in recent years; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is emerging in routine clinical use and the potential role of type specific serological tests is currently under debate. Several large trials of prophylactic vaccines, subsequently proved to be ineffective, have expanded knowledge of the transmission and epidemiology of HSV infection. This article discusses optimal application of recent research evidence to clinical care, structured around the key issues for patients and their partners. These include acquisition and transmission of genital HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, the natural history of genital herpes, and the role of partner notification.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is estimated to infect 417 million people globally, with 19.2 million new infections annually. Almost all infected individuals develop recurrences, either recurrent lesions or even more often recurrent shedding in the absence of lesions. Asymptomatic shedding occurs frequently, > 10% of days and is believed to be the major cause of transmission. – Further, neonatal HSV infections produce a serious disease with high rates of morbidity and even mortality despite current antiviral therapies. Genital HSV infections are also recognized to increase the acquisition of HIV and result in increased shedding of HIV.

Available antiviral therapies are somewhat effective in the treatment of recurrent HSV disease; shortening lesion duration and decreasing viral shedding but are only effective during the time of drug administration. Therefore, there has been great interest in developing therapeutic vaccines designed to decrease lesion rates as well as shedding rates. The evaluation of immunotherapy for recurrent herpesvirus infection dates back to at least the 1930s. However, the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy was not demonstrated conclusively until 1988, when Stanberry et al.were able to show, using the guinea pig model of genital herpes, that a vaccine could indeed reduce the number of genital herpes recurrences. This preclinical model was later extended to show the effects of immunization on recurrent shedding. Most recently, this preclinical work was supported by several clinical trials, of a bivalent HSV-2 vaccine provided with a potent adjuvant. In these trials, vaccination reduced recurrent lesions or recurrent shedding rates by ~ 50%.

### Postnatal exposure to herpes simplex virus: to treat or not to treat? [^115HRHG4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection carries significant morbidity and mortality. In contrast to perinatal exposure, there are no clear guidelines for the management of postnatal HSV exposure. This review focuses on the risk of HSV infection following postnatal exposure and suggests an approach to management. While many infants are protected by transplacentally transferred maternal anti-HSV antibodies, infants of seronegative mothers with significant postnatal HSV exposure may be at risk of severe disease. Individual risk assessment, appropriate investigations, and empiric acyclovir treatment should be considered in postnatally exposed newborns, even if asymptomatic. In all cases, close clinical follow-up is indicated, as well as education of families on the symptoms of neonatal HSV disease. Finally, measures to reduce the risk of postnatal HSV infection should be considered, such as discouraging individuals, particularly those with a history of recurrent cold sores, from kissing newborns.

### Global and regional estimates of the contribution of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection to HIV incidence: a population attributable fraction analysis using published epidemiological data [^111r8qV9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Trials of daily suppressive antiviral therapy against HSV-2 did not show a reduction in HIV acquisition; however, it has been speculated that the antivirals evaluated did not sufficiently reduce the HSV-associated influx of immune cell targets for HIV for there to be an effect on HIV acquisition. Antivirals do not fully suppress viral shedding, leading to immune cell persistence, and bioavailability of, and adherence to, aciclovir in the suppressive therapy trials were also cited as potential issues. New, more effective interventions could hold more promise for translating an effect on HSV-2 infection or shedding and disease into gains for the reduction of HIV incidence.

The landscape for HIV prevention and treatment has transformed in the past decade, with expanded availability of HIV prevention interventions such as antiretroviral treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and voluntary medical male circumcision. However, no intervention used alone is likely to be sufficient to achieve global goals to end the HIV epidemic, especially given challenges in uptake and adherence. Hence, combination measures are needed. A potential indirect effect of interventions against HSV-2 on HIV incidence will need to be evaluated in the context of existing HIV prevention interventions and for new interventions against HSV-2, particularly HSV-2 vaccines. Our estimates suggest that HSV-2 prevention measures could be an important additional tool in the fight against HIV.

### Genital herpes: a review [^11152iNU]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus infection is a recurrent, lifelong disease with no cure. The strongest predictor for infection is a person's number of lifetime sex partners. The natural history includes first-episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment of latency in the dorsal root ganglion, and subsequent reactivation. Most infections are transmitted via asymptomatic viral shedding. Classic outbreaks consist of a skin prodrome and possible constitutional symptoms such as headache, fever, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. As the infection progresses, papules, vesicles on an erythematous base, and erosions appear over hours to days. These lesions usually crust, re-epithelialize, and heal without scarring. First-episode infections are more extensive: primary lesions last two to six weeks versus approximately one week for lesions in recurrent disease. Atypical manifestations are common. Infected persons experience a median of four recurrences per year after their first episode, but rates vary greatly. Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 recurs six times more frequently than type 1. Viral culture is preferred over polymerase chain reaction testing for diagnosis. Serologic testing can be useful in persons with a questionable history. Effective oral antiviral medications are available for initial, episodic, and suppressive therapy but are not a cure. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as L-lysine, zinc, and some herbal preparations may offer some benefit. Counseling patients about the risk of transmission is crucial and helps prevent the spread of disease and neonatal complications.

### Calculating the contribution of herpes simplex virus type 2 epidemics to increasing HIV incidence: treatment implications [^115arfiL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted pathogen worldwide. There is considerable biological and epidemiological evidence that HSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection and may also increase the risk of transmitting HIV. Here, we use a mathematical model to predict the effect of a high-prevalence HSV-2 epidemic on HIV incidence. Our results show that HSV-2 epidemics can more than double the peak HIV incidence; that the biological heterogeneity in susceptibility and transmission induced by an HSV-2 epidemic causes HIV incidence to rise, fall, and then rise again; and that HSV-2 epidemics concentrate HIV epidemics, creating a "core group" of HIV transmitters. Our modeling results imply that findings from HSV-2 intervention trials aimed at reduction of HIV incidence will be variable and that positive findings will be obtained only from trials in communities in which HIV incidence is steeply rising.

### Generating protective immunity against genital herpes [^112oajco]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is an incurable, chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Not only does genital herpes cause painful, recurrent symptoms, it is also a significant risk factor for the acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections such as HIV-1. Antiviral drugs are used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, but they cannot stop viral shedding and transmission. Thus, developing a vaccine that can prevent or clear infection will be crucial in limiting the spread of disease. In this review we outline recent studies that improve our understanding of host responses against HSV infection, discuss past clinical vaccine trials, and highlight new strategies for vaccine design against genital herpes.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tLF4D]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are two global health problems. In 2015, 36·7 million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS globally. In 2012, an estimated 417 million people aged 15–49 years had HSV-2 infection.70% of HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa, which also has the highest HSV-2 prevalence.HSV-2 causes genital herpes, which, when symptomatic, is characterised by periodic recurrences of painful genital ulcers. Although genital herpes is asymptomatic or unrecognised in about 80–90% of individuals, asymptomatic viral reactivation and shedding are common. Thus, although individuals with HSV-2 are most infectious when they are symptomatic, most transmissions are thought to occur when the source partner is asymptomatic. Genital HSV-2 infection can considerably affect relationships through feelings of shame and stigma and concerns about risk of transmission.

HIV and HSV-2 are both lifelong sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are associated with similar risk factors (eg, age, sex, partner change rate, condom use, male circumcision). Additionally, evidence exists of direct and reciprocal biological interactions between HIV and HSV-2. Active HSV-2 infection, regardless of symptoms, involves high concentrations of activated CD4-positive T cells, which are target cells for HIV, in the genital area and can lead to breaks in the mucosal layer through which HIV can enter. Because genital ulceration and viral shedding occur most frequently in the first year of HSV-2 infection, the increase in HIV susceptibility might be highest for incident HSV-2 infections. Co-infection with HIV increases HSV-2 genital shedding and transmissibility, while HSV-2 infection correlates with increased HIV viraemia and transmissibility.

### Modeling human HSV infection via a vascularized immune-competent skin-on-chip platform [^112TBzKs]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) cause life-long oral and genital recurrent disease and affect > 3.7 billion people worldwide. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause neonatal herpes, resulting in high mortality and long-term neurological impairment, while genital HSV-2 infection is also a leading risk factor for increased HIV acquisition and transmission –. Standard acyclovir antiviral suppressive therapy that limits HSV disease severity and shortens outbreak duration does not reduce HIV risk and faces increasing drug resistance –. Candidate vaccines that show promise in murine models have failed in human clinical trials, thus demanding alternative platforms for understanding HSV pathogenesis in the human system.

Deciphering in vivo multifaceted and collaborative host responses to HSV infection in humans remains challenging, despite our great efforts and the invaluable insights gained from sequential skin biopsies obtained from HSV-2 infected individuals –. Access to HSV-2-affected human skin requires skillful clinicians and dedicated medical spaces, and is clinically restrained in size, number, location, and timing. Further, the self-reported nature of an outbreak makes it difficult to capture early events of virologic and immunologic importance (< 48 h), which are critical in determining disease outcomes. As such, the early kinetics of the immune response and mechanisms of defense are poorly defined in human HSV infection, contributing to knowledge gaps in human immune protection against viral infection.

### Guidance on management of asymptomatic neonates born to women with active genital herpes lesions [^117GVbR8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the neonate is uncommon, but genital herpes infections in adults are very common. Thus, although treating an infant with neonatal herpes is a relatively rare occurrence, managing infants potentially exposed to HSV at the time of delivery occurs more frequently. The risk of transmitting HSV to an infant during delivery is determined in part by the mother's previous immunity to HSV. Women with primary genital HSV infections who are shedding HSV at delivery are 10 to 30 times more likely to transmit the virus to their newborn infants than are women with recurrent HSV infection who are shedding virus at delivery. With the availability of commercial serological tests that reliably can distinguish type-specific HSV antibodies, it is now possible to determine the type of maternal infection and, thus, further refine management of infants delivered to women who have active genital HSV lesions. The management algorithm presented herein uses both serological and virological studies to determine the risk of HSV transmission to the neonate who is delivered to a mother with active herpetic genital lesions and tailors management accordingly. The algorithm does not address the approach to asymptomatic neonates delivered to women with a history of genital herpes but no active lesions at delivery.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — disease prevention: Prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to prevent primary HSV infection is not recommended (AIII). In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in persons without HIV, but HSV-2 seronegative persons with HIV on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF containing ART regimens, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in persons with HIV infection. The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV has not been evaluated, and no vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision (MMC) decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners; however, MMC to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII).

Introduction

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2), and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of herpes simplex virus from mother to neonate? What are the effects of antiviral treatment in people with a first episode of genital herpes? What are the effects of interventions to reduce the impact of recurrence? What are the effects of treatments in people with genital herpes and HIV? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antivirals, caesarean delivery, condoms, oral acyclovir, psychotherapy, recombinant glycoprotein vaccines, serological screening, and counselling.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117KfR14]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by 2 related viruses, herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2). Infection is lifelong; currently, there is no cure for HSV infection. Antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons. Transmission of HSV from a pregnant person to their infant can occur, most commonly during delivery; when genital lesions or prodromal symptoms are present, cesarean delivery can reduce the risk of transmission. Neonatal herpes infection is uncommon yet can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To reaffirm its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update on targeted key questions to systematically evaluate the evidence on accuracy, benefits, and harms of routine serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons.

Population

Adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits for population-based screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. (D recommendation).

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115f5YQi]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I² = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I² statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

### Estimated global and regional incidence and prevalence of herpes simplex virus infections and genital ulcer disease in 2020: mathematical modelling analyses [^112QBWgP]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

The force of infection was assumed to be constant across age, but it was applied only to those still susceptible to infection, thereby allowing the incidence rate to decrease effectively with age. The model was calibrated to account for the maximum proportion of the population that can be infected, in addition to the force of infection. This ensured that prevalence saturates below 100% where indicated by the prevalence data. The scarcity of prevalence data for older age groups precluded the use of more complex models to account directly for a diminishing risk of infection at older ages.

The model was designed to provide estimates only for those aged under 50 years, as this age group is the focus of WHO programmes for sexual transmission of infection and reproductive health outcomes, and to align HSV estimates with WHO estimates for other STIs. Prevalence estimates were additionally calculated in a secondary exploratory analysis for those aged above 50 years. However, these estimates were based on simplifying assumptions due to very limited prevalence data for those aged above 50 years. No incidence estimates could be generated, and no uncertainty bounds were incorporated for these prevalence estimates due to the simplifying assumptions in generating them.

In conclusion, HSV infections are widely prevalent in all global regions, leading to a significant burden of GUD with repercussions on psychosocial, sexual, and reproductive health, neonatal transmission, and HIV transmission. However, hardly any specific programmes for HSV prevention and control exist, even in resource-rich countries, partly due to the lack of tools to address such highly prevalent, often asymptomatic, and incurable infections on a population level. Available prevention modalities, including condoms and antiviral therapy, are insufficient to control infection transmission and have, at best, had a modest population impact in reducing incidence rates. There is a need for HSV prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines as a strategic approach to control transmission and to curb the disease and economic burdens of these infections.

### Does maternal HSV-2 coinfection increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV? A systematic review [^117QgXx3]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) decreases mortality in HIV-infected persons, and decreases the risk of horizontal, vertical or mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT). Guidelines from the WHO recommend cART for all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 count or clinical status. Treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women is critical for reducing MTCT, but resource constraints limit access to cART. Until all HIV-infected persons can sustainably access cART, additional measures to decrease MTCT are needed.

Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) is a common coinfection in HIV-positive individuals (prevalence 60%–95%)associated with increased risks of HIV acquisitionand transmission, even in HSV-asymptomatic individuals. Analogously, several reports suggest that HSV-2 is associated with increased MTCT, but results have been inconsistent.

To clarify this issue, and inform future MTCT reduction efforts, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature on this topic. Our primary objective was to quantify the impact of maternal HSV-2 coinfection on the risk of MTCT. Secondary objectives were to assess associations between maternal HSV-2 status and maternal HIV viral load (VL), maternal HIV shedding, infant CD4 count percentage and infant HIV VL.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111KDthH]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) clinical manifestations — Orolabial herpes is the most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection, with oral lesions evolving from papule to vesicle, ulcer, and crust; in untreated persons, the course of illness is 5 to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year. The majority of individuals with HSV-2 seropositivity have clinically silent infection, and genital herpes is typically caused by HSV-2, though HSV-2 can also cause orolabial herpes; genital HSV-1 is clinically indistinguishable from HSV-2 but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often. Typical genital mucosal or skin lesions evolve through papule, vesicle, ulcer, and crust, and viral shedding on mucosal surfaces occurs frequently and can result in transmission. HSV shedding occurs more frequently in people with HIV with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm³ than in those without HIV or with higher CD4 counts.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115anYew]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pregnancy — delivery planning, suppressive therapy, and neonatal transmission emphasizes that the rate of neonatal HSV transmission is highest with primary HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection during late pregnancy, and cesarean delivery is recommended for pregnant women with a genital herpes prodrome or visible HSV genital lesions at the onset of labor (AII). For pregnant women with past genital herpes, suppressive therapy with either valacyclovir or acyclovir is recommended starting at 36 weeks gestation (AI), and for primary outbreaks in the third trimester, continuing antiviral therapy until delivery may be considered. All of these interventions are likely to be similarly effective in people with HIV as in those without. Suppressive therapy for pregnant women who are seropositive for HSV-2 but without history of genital lesions is not recommended (BIII). Postnatal transmission can occur rarely, and to prevent postnatal transmission, pregnant women with herpetic lesions on any part of the body should take special precautions with handwashing prior to handling the neonate.

### 20 years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing WHO priorities for research in HSV-2 / HIV interactions, HSV-2 control and mathematical modelling [^111sH8ym]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Unaddressed priorities and research gaps

The majority of unaddressed WHO priorities involved HSV-2 control measures (n = 4). Unaddressed priorities from 2001 were identified across the three priority areas. These included the monitoring of the clinical/cost-effectiveness of aciclovir in GUD syndromic management, trials of episodic therapy measuring the effect on HIV acquisition or transmission, evaluation of counselling strategies and the development of locally administered vaccines. Although there were studies assessing the clinical effectiveness of aciclovir in the syndromic approach to GUD, none of these included cost-effectiveness as an outcome. This outcome measure would have been useful supporting evidence for developing GUD syndromic management in LMICs, where the use of aciclovir is much less frequent than in HICs. The impact of HSV-2 control measures on HIV indicators was frequently cited; however, this was always in the context of suppressive therapy, rather than episodic therapy. This may have been due to the more complex study design that would be required to investigate the effect of episodic therapy on HSV-2 shedding over multiple HSV-2 episodes.

The last two unaddressed priorities were the exploration of the differences in HIV genital shedding during primary clinical HSV-2 episodes, subclinical recurrences and in-between recurrences and the modelling of the risk of antiviral resistance. Antiviral resistance may not have been deemed a priority in LMIC during the studied time period because even by 2010 numerous African countries were yet to incorporate aciclovir into their GUD syndromic management algorithm, despite its patent expiring in the late 1990s. It is therefore unlikely that researchers could justify the study of aciclovir resistance when the drug was rarely used due to relative unavailability. Indeed, aciclovir resistance testing is not even available in many HICs. No studies were identified to address counselling strategies which may be owing to the high number of hours and skilled personnel required for the intervention.

### Current thinking on genital herpes [^1172tkQw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Genital herpes has a high global prevalence and burden of disease. This manuscript highlights recent advances in our understanding of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.

Recent Findings

Studies demonstrate a changing epidemiological landscape with an increasing proportion of genital herpes cases associated with HSV type 1. There is also growing evidence that the majority of infected individuals exhibit frequent, brief shedding episodes that are most often asymptomatic, which likely contribute to high HSV transmission rates. Given this finding as well as readily available serological assays, some have proposed that routine HSV screening be performed; however, this remains controversial and is not currently recommended. Host immune responses, particularly local CD4 and CD8 T cell activity, are crucial for HSV control and clearance following initial infection, during latency and after reactivation. Prior HSV immunity may also afford partial protection against HSV reinfection and disease. Although HSV vaccine trials have been disappointing to date and existing antiviral medications are limited, novel prophylactic and therapeutic modalities are currently in development.

Summary

Although much remains unknown about genital herpes, improved knowledge of HSV epidemiology, pathogenesis and host immunity may help guide new strategies for disease prevention and control.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116QuZuS]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Secondary prevention — adolescents and young adults with HIV and recurrent genital HSV: Adolescents and young adults with HIV who suffer severe, frequent, and/or troubling recurrent genital HSV infection will benefit from anti-HSV suppression therapy (strong; moderate). Placebo-controlled trials in adults with HIV who are receiving ART demonstrated that antiviral drugs for recurrent HSV disease reduced symptomatic recurrences by 60% to 75%, and chronic suppressive therapy also reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners without HIV by 25% to 75%; this is an option for patients with frequent, severe, or troubling HSV recurrences.

### Population-level effect of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV in sub-saharan Africa [^113tiHam]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

The general population scenarios show what could theoretically be achieved and underline the importance of HSV-2 in HIV transmission, but long-term treatment of large proportions of the population is unlikely to be feasible.

The impact of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence and prevalence of HIV in the model is directly dependent on the assumed strength of the relationship between HSV-2 and HIV. The effects of treatment were dependent on assumptions about the level of the co-factor effect and the relative importance of co-factors between ulcers. Suppressive therapy might also reduce any between-ulcer co-factor effect, although this was not modelled, so the reductions in the effects of therapy in these alternative scenarios may have been overestimated.

Specific assumptions about the action and mechanism of the interventions on HSV-2 were informed by the literature wherever possible but, as many of these interventions are not yet well quantified or are hypothetical, a plausible range of values was explored for uncertain parameters. Even with these ranges, it is possible that our assumptions may have been over-optimistic in terms of some parameters such as the high parameter value for symptom recognition for episodic therapy. We assumed the same symptom recognition rate for both sexes, although it tends to be higher among men than women.50 We may therefore have underestimated the impact of episodic therapy in men and overestimated it in women. However, these effects will tend to cancel out in the results we presented on both sexes for episodic therapy.

We have presented the hypothetical reductions in HIV incidence and prevalence that could be achieved through HSV-2 interventions in certain scenarios. The real-world impact of scaled-up HSV-2 interventions would be tempered by logistical delivery constraints, such as the feasibility of funding and carrying out large-scale interventions in the general public, or of locating clients of FSW and persuading them of the utility of daily suppressive therapy for HSV-2, and by interactions with other HIV prevention and treatment programmes. Both episodic and suppressive therapies have limited potential as realistic HIV interventions. To achieve the high coverage and long duration effects on HSV-2 that are required to have an important impact on the incidence of HIV, an effective vaccine against HSV-2 is needed.

### Managing patients with genital herpes and their sexual partners [^115B7f2x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the growing size and significance of the genital herpes epidemic. Recent developments in the wide-scale availability of type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) sero-logic assays have meant that many previously undiagnosed mild, atypical, and subclinical infections may now be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without the use of Western blots. The value of such diagnostics is controversial. However, the importance of HSV with its facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition, the availability of various preventative strategies for limiting vertical HSV transmission, and the growing evidence that condoms, some educational and counseling interventions, and antiviral therapies may limit sexual transmission, have challenged many of the arguments against wider testing of the population.

### Treatment of sexually transmitted infections for HIV prevention: end of the road or new beginning? [^117T1rFD]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Observational and biological data provide compelling evidence of the importance of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in HIV transmission, but only one of nine intervention trials has shown an effect. This article reviews the observational studies, critically examines the nine randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of STI treatment interventions on HIV incidence, and discusses implications for HIV prevention policy, programs and future research. The role of other vaginal infections is also briefly considered. In aggregate, the evidence strongly supports the concept that STI treatment prevents HIV infection. However, issues in trial design and conduct, including HIV epidemic phase, STI prevalence, intervention in comparison groups, and power have affected five of the six trials of treatment of curable STIs. In the three herpes intervention trials, antivirals for HSV suppression were insufficiently potent to alleviate persistent genital inflammation in HIV-negative HSV2-positive persons, and the reduction in HIV levels in HIV-positive persons was insufficient to reduce HIV transmission. It is time for a new phase of exploration of how, when, and in whom to include STI control as a key component of HIV prevention, driven by basic research to elucidate the mechanisms by which STIs and vaginal infections facilitate HIV transmission. From a policy perspective, treatment of curable STIs is an essential part of primary healthcare and is a cheap, simple, and effective intervention when appropriately targeted and delivered. It should be promoted as an essential component of HIV control programs in communities in which the burden of STIs is substantial.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) transmission and perinatal risk in the context of HIV — key quantitative patterns and modifiers are described: In women without HIV, genital HSV-2 shedding detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is frequent at 19% of days, and oral and genital HSV shedding is more common near the first episode and in patients with HIV, reaching 30% of days in HSV-seropositive individuals not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Either HSV type can be transmitted by oral-oral, oral-genital, and genital-genital contact. During delivery, the transmission risk is approximately 1% in pregnant women with remote primary HSV infection but rises to 30% to 50% for infants of women with recent infection; maternal HSV antibody status before delivery appears to reduce the probability of transmission and the severity of neonatal infection. Transmission risk is increased by genital shedding at delivery, a fetal scalp monitor electrode, and prolonged rupture of membranes > 6 hours, and many mothers of neonates with active HSV disease lack a history of prior genital HSV infection or lesions because maternal infection is frequently asymptomatic. Among HSV-seropositive pregnant women at delivery, HSV-2 is detected by PCR in 23% to 31% with HIV versus 9% to 12% without HIV, with shedding greatest when the CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count is low and/or the patient is not receiving ART; there is no evidence that in utero fetal HSV infection occurs more frequently in pregnant women with HIV than in those without HIV. In the general population, neonatal HSV occurs at 1 case per 2,000 to 10,000 deliveries. In adults, genital HSV-2 co-infection is associated with higher HIV RNA titers and increased risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners, and three studies suggest that maternal HSV-2 co-infection increases intrapartum HIV transmission.

### The potential epidemiological impact of a genital herpes vaccine for women [^11582JGa]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In two phase III vaccine trials immunisation of women previously uninfected by herpes simplex virus provided protection against genital herpes disease. In deciding policy, an evaluation of the epidemiological impact of the partial protection provided by the vaccine should be considered.

Methods

A sex and sexual activity stratified deterministic differential and partial differential equation model of the natural history of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and the impact of vaccination is developed and analysed. To explore the role of vaccination, the pattern of viral shedding and the transmission of infection during sexual acts within sexual partnerships are described.

Results

Using literature derived estimates of parameter values and assuming efficacy in only 40% of women the impact of the vaccine depends on assumptions made about its action. The vaccine has a limited impact if it only prevents disease but a more substantial impact if it reduces asymptomatic viral shedding, which it could do indirectly by preventing infection or directly by modifying the biology of the infection. Concern over the implications of a vaccine that prevents disease but has no impact on viral shedding was addressed in a worst case scenario. Here there is a modest increase in the incidence of infection in both men and women but an increase in disease prevalence in men alone, since the virus directly protects some women from disease.

Conclusions

Results suggest that a herpes vaccine should be used universally and that a vaccine that only protects HSV-1-/2- women can paradoxically have a significant epidemiological impact, the scale of which depends upon changes in patterns of viral shedding.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 in asymptomatic persons… [^111aq7VV]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Positive HSV cultures were obtained on at least one occasion in 38 of the 53 persons. In 36 of these 38 persons, the virus was isolated on days in which there were no apparent genital lesions. Collectively, HSV was isolated in the absence of genital lesions on 3 percent of the total days. In nine patients for whom all cultures were negative, six had HSV DNA detected by polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The overall rate of HSV detection in persons without a history of clinical infection was 83 percent. Among the comparison group of 90 persons who had a history of genital HSV, daily viral cultures were obtained. Positive results were obtained on 6. 4 percent of all days tested, but in 36 percent of the cases, the participants had no apparent genital lesions. The overall rate of subclinical viral shedding was 2. 7 percent. This was almost identical to the first cohort, who had initially reported not having a history of genital herpes.

The authors conclude from this study that a significant degree of asymptomatic shedding of HSV occurs among persons with this infection. Included are men in whom physicians have traditionally dismissed the notion of this occurring. The prior assumption has been that asymptomatic shedding occurred only in women who shed the virus from the cervix or vaginal mucosa. In addition, it is clear that patient counseling and education about HSV-2 allows most patients to recognize the typical lesions of HSV. Because most persons with HSV-2 infection are asymptomatic, episodic or chronic administration of oral antiviral therapy is not required. However, it is important to educate and counsel patients about the risk of HSV transmission to sexual partners. editor's note: This study presents two key points for practicing physicians. First, patient education about HSV infection is effective if done properly.

Second, the risk of transmission, even in the absence of symptoms, should be explained to patients. The larger question that now remains is the role of antiviral therapy, which has historically been used only in patients with frequent outbreaks, with the intent of decreasing symptoms and viral transmission. This study makes me further question the efficacy of limiting this therapy to patients with frequent symptomatic recurrences. — j. t. k.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115Eei4R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Serologic testing and counseling in people with HIV — type-specific serum and point-of-care immunoglobulin G (IgG) serologic assays can be used to diagnose HSV-2 in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 can be considered for people with HIV with specific risk histories; early infection can yield false negative results, so repeat testing 12 weeks following suspected exposure is warranted; false positive HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.0), and in such situations confirmatory testing with a second serologic test using a different antigen is recommended; serologic screening for HSV-1 is not useful due to high prevalence, and HSV-1 or HSV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) is not useful because IgM testing is not type-specific; a diagnosis of genital herpes should be accompanied by counseling that discusses risk of transmission to sex partners.

Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs among persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even those with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. Certain persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of decreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners.

### Antiviral agents for the prevention of the sexual transmission of herpes simplex in discordant couples [^115eiBfe]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to summarize recent developments in our understanding of the modifiable behavioural and biological factors contributing to the transmission of genital herpes simplex infection, and the limited data on the use of antiviral agents for reducing transmission risk in serodiscordant couples.

Recent Findings

With the developing herpes simplex virus epidemic, the significance of biological and behavioural factors for the acquisition and transmission of genital herpes infection are increasingly recognized as important. Studies looking at the modification of behavioural factors indicate that knowledge of disease status, disease recognition and the promotion of condoms appears to modify transmission risk. However, these effects are disputed and their value is likely to be limited. In the absence of effective prophylactic vaccines, the reduction of clinical and subclinal herpes simplex virus shedding with the use of antiviral agents is an attractive option. A large study recently reported on the value of once daily valaciclovir for the prevention of transmission of genital herpes infection in serodiscordant couples. The study showed that continuous suppressive therapy not only controls symptomatic disease in the source partner, but reduces the likelihood of disease in the susceptible partner by between 48 and 75%. These findings will have a major impact on clinical practice. Questions remain, however, on whether these results can be extended to non-heterosexual populations and to drugs other then valaciclovir.

### Immunology in the clinic review series; focus on host responses: T cell responses to herpes simplex viruses [^114NvKNA]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes virus infections are chronic and co-exist with acquired immune responses that generally prevent severe damage to the host, while allowing periodic shedding of virus and maintenance of its transmission in the community. Herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2) are typical in this regard and are representative of the viral subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which has a tropism for neuronal and epithelial cells. This review will emphasize recent progress in decoding the physiologically important CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses to HSV in humans. The expanding data set is discussed in the context of the search for an effective HSV vaccine as therapy for existing infections and to prevent new infections.

### Targeting virological core groups: a new paradigm for controlling herpes simplex virus type 2 epidemics [^113ArGSp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Classic modeling of sexually transmitted diseases has focused on modeling behavioral heterogeneity and designing epidemic control strategies targeted at behavioral core groups.

Methods

We analyzed a new mathematical model of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) epidemics that includes virological core groups (i.e., groups of individuals with high rates of viral reactivation) and suggest a new paradigm for epidemic control. We used our model, in conjunction with virological data, to determine the potential role of virological core groups in contributing to transmission and the effect that daily antiviral therapy (DAT) could have on reducing transmission if virological core groups were targeted.

Results

We estimated that a virological core group (11% of infected individuals) can cause a disproportionately large percentage (44%) of new infections and that a median of only 6.4 person-years of DAT would be necessary to prevent 1 HSV-2 infection. We determined that relatively few individuals would need to receive DAT to substantially reduce the incidence of HSV-2 infection.

Conclusion

Identifying and targeting individuals in the virological core group could be an effective and practical public health strategy for reducing transmission. Treating individuals who are high-frequency viral shedders should be evaluated as a strategy for reducing HSV-2 transmission.

### Diagnosis and management of genital herpes: key questions and review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115NZFPM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Characteristics of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections in Germany: results of a 2-year prospective nationwide surveillance study [^116Ys6GU]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

HSV-1 was detected in the majority of infections. This is in contrast to high maternal and neonatal HSV-2 infection rates in other parts of the world. These results indicate regional differences in the epidemiology of neonatal HSV infections. In Germany, it appears that awareness of maternal genital HSV infections is high, and that prenatal care may have improved over time, while postnatal HSV exposure may be more common. However, vertical transmission may have been underestimated in this study since transmission occurring in the birth canal is also possible in the absence of active genital HSV lesions.HSV shedding around birth can also occur with asymptomatic reactivation and only be estimated adequately, if direct virus monitoring is performed in particular on the basis of previously reported episodes of genital HSV.

Our study adds evidence to the possibility of postnatal HSV exposure. Neonates are at risk of acquiring HSV infections from family members or others with skin or mucous membrane infections. More research is needed to evaluate strategies of empirical antiviral therapy of exposed infants, including those with no or mild symptoms. Based on the available evidence, families should receive comprehensive counselling, and preventive measures, especially avoidance of contact with herpetic blisters, should be liberally implemented.

We found seven infants with serious adverse outcomes. Our findings that infants with skin/mucous membrane infection commonly had good outcome at discharge, but that many infants with disseminated disease had sequelae, warrant further confirmatory investigations. However, we suggest that parents of infants presenting with no or only mild symptoms and who are on antiviral treatment may be reassured.

In summary, neonatal HSV infections are rare in Germany. The vast majority of infections are skin/mucous membrane infections with a mild clinical course and very good outcome. Nevertheless, HSV infections can be extremely severe in individual cases and cause permanent severe impairment. Horizontal infection within the family may be a possible transmission route. Neonatal HSV infection is for both mothers and infants, as well as family members, an interdisciplinary diagnosis. Inclusion of specific maternal and infant virological data is a prerequisite for urgently needed multi-national studies to increase our knowledge on recognition and prevention of neonatal HSV infections.

Female Condoms. We found no systematic review or RCTs on the effects of female condoms to prevent sexual transmission. HSV-2 Glycoprotein-D-adjuvant Vaccine in HSV-1 and HSV-2-seronegative Women. Limited evidence from one RCT comparing recombinant HSV-2 glycoprotein-D-adjuvant vaccine versus placebo showed protection of the vaccine against new genital herpes infection in women who had been seronegative for HSV-1 and HSV-2 at baseline. HSV-2 Glycoprotein-D-adjuvant Vaccine in Men and HSV-1-seropositive Women. Limited evidence from one RCT comparing recombinant HSV-2 glycoprotein-D-adjuvant vaccine versus placebo showed no protection of the vaccine against new genital herpes infection in women who had been seropositive for HSV-1 at baseline or in men. Male Condom Use to Prevent Transmission from Infected Women to Noninfected Men.

Limited evidence from one prospective cohort study suggests that male condom use may provide no protection from transmission of HSV-2 to noninfected men from their infected female partners. Other Forms of Vaccination. We found no good evidence on other forms of vaccination. Serologic Screening and Counseling in Late Pregnancy. We found no systematic review or RCTs on the effects of interventions to prevent maternal infection in late pregnancy. UNLIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Recombinant Glycoprotein Vaccine. One RCT found no significant difference between recombinant glycoprotein vaccine and placebo in the prevention of HSV-2 infection. UNKNOWN EFFECTIVENESS Psychotherapy to Reduce Recurrence. One systematic review found insufficient evidence on the effects of psychotherapy on genital herpes recurrence.

1 However, it should be noted that although antibody levels prove the existence of present or past infections, they do not differentiate between possible manifestations of HSV-2 infections. Thus, the figures have to be treated with caution when applied to genital herpes only. Etiology/Risk Factors HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause a first episode of genital infection, but HSV-2 is more likely to cause recurrent disease. 3 Most people with HSV-2 infection have only mild symptoms and remain unaware that they have genital herpes. However, these people can pass on the infection to sexual partners and newborns. 4, 5.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevention in people with HIV — condom effectiveness and per‑act risk estimates: A larger trial demonstrated a 26% reduction in HSV-2 genital infection with condom use, and a pooled analysis of 6 studies found condom use reduced HSV-2 acquisition by 30%, with the risk increasing steadily with each unprotected sex act; per sexual act odds were 3.6% when condoms were never used, 2.7% when sometimes used, and 0% when always used. Individuals with HIV should use latex condoms consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse, should specifically avoid sexual contact when herpetic lesions are evident, and condoms will not protect against orogenital transmission and infection transmitted prior to penetration.

### Genital herpes: rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals. Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and use of condoms. A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a flulike syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing. Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — exposure prevention and transmission reduction: Persons with HIV who are HSV-2 seronegative should consider partner testing using HSV type-specific serology before initiating sexual activity because disclosure in heterosexual HIV-negative, HSV-2-discordant couples was associated with reduced risk of transmission of HSV-2 (BIII), and consistent use of latex condoms reduced HSV-2 acquisition and should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding, and persons with HIV should specifically avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or oral labial herpetic lesions (AII). In HSV-2 seropositive persons with symptomatic genital herpes but not HIV, suppressive antiviral therapy such as valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible heterosexual partners by 48%, but in HIV-1/HSV-2-seropositive persons not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir 400 mg twice daily did not prevent HSV-2 transmission to HSV-2 seronegative partners; suppressive anti-HSV therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners is not recommended for persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection who are not on ART (AII), and there are no data available regarding use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111qAqmy]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Genital herpes is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the United States, occurring in almost 1 in 6 persons aged 14 to 49 years. Infection is caused by 2 subtypes of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), HSV-1 and HSV-2. Antiviral medications may provide symptomatic relief from outbreaks but do not cure HSV infection. Neonatal herpes infection, while uncommon, can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the 2005 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for genital herpes.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and harms of serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic persons, including those who are pregnant, as well as the effectiveness and harms of preventive medications and behavioral counseling interventions to reduce future symptomatic episodes and transmission to others.

Findings

Based on the natural history of HSV infection, its epidemiology, and the available evidence on the accuracy of serologic screening tests, the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweigh the benefits of serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant. (D recommendation).

### Herpes simplex virus type 2: epidemiology and management options in developing countries [^1116m8Ti]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) is highly prevalent worldwide and an increasingly important cause of genital ulcer disease (GUD). Continued HSV2 transmission is facilitated by the large number of undiagnosed cases, the frequency of atypical disease and the occurrence of asymptomatic shedding. The lack of easy, affordable diagnostic methods and specific antiviral treatment in countries with low and middle income is of great concern, given the ability of GUD to enhance HIV transmission and acquisition. With rising HSV2 prevalence contributing to an increase in the proportion of GUD attributed to genital herpes in high-HIV prevalence settings, a safe and effective HSV vaccine is urgently needed. Meanwhile, multifaceted interventions are required to improve recognition of genital herpes, to prevent its spread and also to prevent its potential to promote HIV transmission in developing countries.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — diagnosis and serologic testing: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosing mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV, with PCR the most sensitive method; HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2, and recurrences are more frequent with HSV-2 than HSV-1. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used to diagnose HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered, but false positive enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.5), for which confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of transmission risk to sex partners, and screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^116eR1va]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Routine HSV-2 serologic screening of pregnant women is not recommended. Women without known genital herpes should be counseled to abstain from vaginal intercourse during the third trimester with partners known to have or suspected of having genital herpes. In addition, to prevent HSV-1 genital herpes, pregnant women without known orolabial herpes should be advised to abstain from receptive oral sex during the third trimester with partners known to have or suspected to have orolabial herpes. Type-specific serologic tests can be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV infection and for guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital herpes during pregnancy. For example, such testing might be offered to a woman with no history of genital herpes whose sex partner has HSV infection. Many fetuses are exposed to acyclovir each year, and the medication is believed to be safe for use during all trimesters of pregnancy. A case-control study reported an increased risk for the rare neonatal outcome of gastroschisis among women who used antiviral medications between the month before conception and the third month of pregnancy. Acyclovir is also believed to be safe during breastfeeding. Although data regarding prenatal exposure to valacyclovir and famciclovir are limited, data from animal trials indicate that these drugs also pose a low risk among pregnant women. Acyclovir can be administered orally to pregnant women with first-episode genital herpes or recurrent herpes and should be administered IV to pregnant women with severe HSV (see Genital Herpes, Hepatitis). Suppressive acyclovir treatment starting at 36 weeks' gestation reduces the frequency of cesarean delivery among women who have recurrent genital herpes by diminishing the frequency of recurrences at term. However, such treatment might not protect against transmission to neonates in all cases. No data support use of antiviral therapy among asymptomatic HSV-seropositive women without a history of genital herpes. In addition, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy among sex partners with a history of genital herpes to decrease the risk for HSV transmission to a pregnant woman has not been studied. Additional information on the clinical management of genital herpes in pregnancy is available through existing guidelines.

Recommended Regimen for Suppression of Recurrent Genital Herpes Among Pregnant Women*
Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day
or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day
* Treatment recommended starting at 36 weeks' gestation.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jQPzy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Our qualitative assessment of selective reporting of crude and adjusted estimates based on significance found some evidence of publication bias. However, publication bias was not significant from either funnel plots or our meta-regression comparing reported crude estimates with crude estimates derived from available data. We did not find any evidence in our meta-regression that study quality influenced the association between HSV-2 and HIV, except where the definition of HSV-2 negative was not reported, which was associated with a significantly increased risk of HIV acquisition due to HSV-2.

Understanding the effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV risk is essential for several reasons. From a clinical perspective, knowledge of this association informs the advice and information given to individuals diagnosed with genital herpes, who might be at increased risk of acquiring HIV. Much, if not most, of HSV-associated HIV transmission is thought to occur outside symptomatic episodes, including among individuals who harbour HSV-2 infection but have never had symptoms of genital herpes. Thus, from a population perspective, understanding the interaction between HSV-2 and HIV is also important for informing public health interventions for the control of both infections, because an intervention targeting HSV-2 might have additional, indirect benefits on HIV.

Current prevention and treatment options for HSV-2 infection are imperfect and limited by the often asymptomatic presentation of HSV-2 infection. However, development of new interventions is underway. Multipurpose prevention technologies (eg, microbicides) that target both HIV and HSV-2 infection hold promise, but developments have been hampered by low compliance and acceptability among women. The best option is likely to be an effective vaccine against HSV-2 infection. Efforts to develop an HSV-2 vaccine are underway.HSV-2 infection is a common infection globally, but has a particularly high incidence in specific settings where HIV is endemic, such as sub-Saharan Africa, and among higher-risk groups, who are important in concentrated HIV epidemics. Therefore, addressing the interactions between HSV-2 and HIV could produce substantial health and economic gains. This meta-analysis is an important step towards clearer quantification of the potential magnitude of that benefit.

### Genital herpes [^112xfA2W]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Genital herpes is the main cause of genital ulcers worldwide; the prevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infections in the general population ranges from 10% to 60%. Most genital herpes is caused by HSV-2, although HSV-1 accounts for about half of new cases in developed countries. The risk of HIV acquisition is three times higher in people with HSV-2. Neonatal herpes is an uncommon but serious complication of genital herpes. Most genital HSV-2 infections are unrecognised and undiagnosed; infected individuals, even with mild symptoms, shed HSV, and can infect sexual partners. Since clinical diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, virological and type-specific serological tests should be used routinely. Oral antiviral drugs for HSV infections are safe and effective and can be used both to treat episodes and to prevent recurrences. Antiviral treatment of the infected partners and condom use reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HSV-2.

PRECAUTIONS

Dosage adjustment is recommended when administering acyclovir to patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Caution should also be exercised when administering acyclovir to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic agents since this may increase the risk of renal dysfunction and/or the risk of reversible central nervous system symptoms such as those that have been reported in patients treated with intravenous acyclovir. Adequate hydration should be maintained.

Information for Patients

Patients are instructed to consult with their physician if they experience severe or troublesome adverse reactions, they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant, they intend to breastfeed while taking orally administered acyclovir, or they have any other questions.

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Herpes Zoster

There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

Genital Herpes Infections

Patients should be informed that acyclovir is not a cure for genital herpes. There are no data evaluating whether acyclovir will prevent transmission of infection to others. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes can also be transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

Chickenpox

Chickenpox in otherwise healthy children is usually a self-limited disease of mild to moderate severity. Adolescents and adults tend to have more severe disease. Treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the typical chickenpox rash in the controlled studies, and there is no information regarding the effects of treatment begun later in the disease course.

### Estimating the public health impact of the effect of herpes simplex virus suppressive therapy on plasma HIV-1 viral load [^117DPqYs]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Trials of herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppressive therapy among HSV-2/HIV-1-infected individuals have reported an impact on plasma HIV-1 viral loads (PVLs). Our aim was to estimate the population-level impact of suppressive therapy on female-to-male HIV-1 sexual transmission.

Design and Methods

By comparing prerandomization and postrandomization individual-level PVL data from the first two HSV suppressive therapy randomized controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated the effect of treatment on duration of asymptomatic infection and number of HIV-1 transmission events for each trial.

Results

Assuming that a reduction in PVL is accompanied by an increased duration of HIV-1 asymptomatic infection, 4–6 years of HSV suppressive therapy produce a 1-year increase in the duration of this stage. To avert one HIV-1 transmission requires 8.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.9–14.9] and 11.4 (95% CI, 7.8–27.5) women to be treated from halfway through their HIV-1 asymptomatic period, using results from Burkina Faso and South African trials, respectively. Regardless of the timing of treatment initiation, 51.6 (95% CI, 30.4–137.0) and 66.5 (95% CI, 36.7–222.6) treatment-years are required to avert one HIV-1 infection. Distributions of set-point PVL values from sub-Saharan African populations suggest that unintended adverse consequences of therapy at the population level (i.e. increased HIV-1 transmission due to increased duration of infection) are unlikely to occur in these settings.

Conclusion

HSV suppressive therapy may avert relatively few HIV-1 transmission events per person-year of treatment. Its use as a prevention intervention may be limited; however, further research into its effect on rate of CD4 cell count decline and the impact of higher dosing schedules is warranted.

### Genital herpes complicating pregnancy [^112m6zVK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 22% of pregnant women are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2, and 2% of women will acquire HSV during pregnancy. Remarkably, up to 90% of these women are undiagnosed because they are asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms attributed to other vulvovaginal disorders. Diagnosis of genital herpes relies on laboratory confirmation with culture or polymerase chain reaction assay of genital lesions and type-specific glycoprotein G-based serologic testing. Neonatal herpes is the most severe complication of genital HSV infection and is caused by contact with infected genital secretions at the time of labor. Maternal acquisition of HSV in the third trimester of pregnancy carries the highest risk of neonatal transmission. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal herpes, little change in the incidence or serious sequelae from this infection has occurred. As such, prevention of the initial neonatal infection is critically important. Obstetricians are in a unique position to prevent vertical HSV transmission by identifying women with genital lesions at the time of labor for cesarean delivery, prescribing antiviral suppressive therapy as appropriate, and avoiding unnecessary invasive intrapartum procedures in women with genital herpes. Enhanced prevention strategies include identification of women at risk for HSV acquisition during pregnancy by testing women and possibly their partners for HSV antibodies and providing counseling to prevent transmission to women in late pregnancy.

BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

HSV-2 control measures

A total of 58 studies were identified to address HSV-2 control measures, the most common study location being sub-Saharan Africa (n = 24, 41%). The most frequently studied topic area was the use of antiviral therapy (n = 27, 47%), followed by condom use (n = 12, 21%), vaccine trials (n = 10, 17%), microbicide use (n = 6, 10%) and male circumcision (n = 3, < 1%). They encompassed a range of study designs including randomised control trials (n = 26, 45%), literature reviews (n = 13, 22%), laboratory studies (n = 10, 17%), systematic reviews with meta-analyses (n = 5, 9%) and cohort or cross-sectional studies (n = 3, < 1%).

Suppressive therapy

Six articles including a multiregion randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) among HSV-2-seropositive MSM and women in sub-Saharan Africa and South America found that suppressive therapy (400 mg twice daily aciclovir) reduced HSV-2 shedding and transmission rates. For example, Fuchs et al reported a 63% reduction in the frequency of genital ulcers with detectable HSV-2 and a 47% reduction in the rate of GUD recurrence overall. Analogous results were seen among male and female participants living with HIV.RCTs based in South and West Africa reported evidence to suggest that suppressive aciclovir may also be efficacious in reducing HIV shedding and disease progression. However, the results of further East African trials disputed this by showing no significant difference in genital and plasma HIV RNA between the control and intervention (suppressive aciclovir) armsand that suppressive aciclovir had no impact on the incidence/acquisition of HIV in HSV-2-seropositive women.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: findings from a randomized trial [^115Ed4to]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

(.)

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common sexually transmitted pathogen that often causes recurrent genital lesions. Transmission occurs largely from asymptomatic genital tract virus shedding, making this a key target for a therapeutic HSV vaccine. The management of genital herpes currently includes episodic or daily suppressive therapy with nucleoside analogues, which abrogates most recurrences but only partly reduces viral shedding and transmission.

GEN-003 contains a transmembrane deletion mutant of glycoprotein D (gD2ΔTMR), a primary target antigen for neutralizing antibody and T cells, combined with a large fragment of infected cell protein 4 (ICP4.2), an HSV-2 T-cell antigen prioritized through human T-cell screens. This antigen was selected by comparing T-cell responses of HSV-2–seropositive but asymptomatic and HSV-2–exposed seronegative individuals to individuals with recurrent disease, using high-throughput HSV-2 proteomic screens. GEN-003 is a combination of these 2 proteins with a novel adjuvant, Matrix-M2™. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GEN-003 elicits antibody and T-cell responses in mice and is protective in a guinea pig model of recurrent HSV-2 infection.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase 1/2 study of GEN-003 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and effect on viral shedding of this candidate immunotherapy (clinical trials registration NCT01667341).

Asymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, if needed) should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection.
For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with combination testing if needed) without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

HSV-1 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection.
Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences.
For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. Suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.

For persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection (see Genital Herpes During Pregnancy).

Management of Sex Partners

The sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

Special Considerations

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112z1Dbi]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Counseling

Counseling of persons with genital herpes and their sex partners is crucial for management. The goals of counseling include helping patients cope with the infection and preventing sexual and perinatal transmission. Although initial counseling can be provided at the first visit, patients often benefit from learning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute illness subsides. Multiple resources, including Internet sites and printed materials, are available to assist patients, their partners, and clinicians who provide counseling (and).

Although the psychological effect of a serologic diagnosis of HSV-2 infection in a person with asymptomatic or unrecognized genital herpes appears minimal and transient, certain persons with HSV infection might express anxiety concerning genital herpes that does not reflect the actual clinical severity of their disease; the psychological effect of HSV infection can be substantial. Common concerns about genital herpes include the severity of initial clinical manifestations, recurrent episodes, sexual relationships and transmission to sex partners, and ability to bear healthy children.

Symptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should discuss the following:

The natural history of the disease, with emphasis on the potential for recurrent episodes, asymptomatic viral shedding, and the attendant risks for sexual transmission of HSV to occur during asymptomatic periods (asymptomatic viral shedding is most frequent during the first 12 months after acquiring HSV-2).
The effectiveness of daily suppressive antiviral therapy for preventing symptomatic recurrent episodes of genital herpes for persons experiencing a first episode or recurrent genital herpes.
The effectiveness of daily use of valacyclovir in reducing risk for transmission of HSV-2 among persons without HIV and use of episodic therapy to shorten the duration of recurrent episodes.
The importance of informing current sex partners about genital herpes and informing future partners before initiating a sexual relationship.

### New treatments for genital herpes [^1167PwQY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that has been widely investigated from both an epidemiological and a diagnostic viewpoint. Better knowledge of the disease has pointed to the important role of asymptomatic herpes simplex virus type 2 shedding as a major culprit for the spread of the virus in the world, the latest statistics showing that the incidence of genital herpes is constantly increasing. The reference compound for the treatment and prophylaxis of genital herpes is acyclovir. Recently, two drugs with better oral bioavailability, valaciclovir, the oral prodrug of acyclovir, and famciclovir, the oral prodrug of penciclovir, have been made available. Nevertheless, there is a need to develop additional approaches, to extend the therapeutic possibilities and to face the problem of emerging resistant viruses, mostly in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, efforts have been made in different directions including the exploration of new targets for antiviral chemotherapy, the use of immunomodulators and the development of specific vaccines.

Research needs and gaps — USPSTF priorities for asymptomatic genital herpes focus on improving screening and interventions, including studies assessing screening test accuracy and predictive value in primary care settings in the US that include asymptomatic persons, and high-quality studies that provide consistent evidence about the effectiveness of behavioral counseling interventions and preventive medication interventions (eg, antiviral medications), or both to improve genital herpes outcomes in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons who screen positive for HSV; additional priorities include research to better clarify emerging associations of HSV infection with intermediate pregnancy outcomes (such as preterm labor and prolonged rupture of membranes) and potentially related neonatal morbidity and mortality, and continuing research to develop a cure for genital HSV infection and an effective vaccine to prevent genital HSV infection.

### Clinics in dermatology: herpes simplex virus (update on dermatologic aspects of sexually transmitted disease and human immunodeficiency virus) [^117MDGu7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of anogenital ulceration worldwide. There are two distinct viruses: HSV-1 associated with oro-labial cold sores and genital infection, and HSV-2 associated with genital infection. Infection is lifelong, and typically presents with painful anogenital ulceration which may recur after periods of latency. Asymptomatic shedding is common and may lead to transmission to sexual partners. Antiviral suppression with aciclovir, valaciclovir or famciclovir is useful to treat initial painful episodes, or troublesome recurrent infection. Suppressive antiviral therapy, condoms, selective abstinence and disclosure to sexual partners have all been demonstrated to reduce the risk of transmission.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppression in people with HIV — chronic suppressive therapy reduces HSV-2 transmission to susceptible HSV-discordant partners without HIV by 25% to 75% and can reduce HSV shedding in HIV/HSV coinfection. All HSV-active antivirals are equally effective in reducing transmission, but twice-daily dosing may be superior to a larger once-daily dose. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) also reduces the frequency of asymptomatic HSV shedding, and when administered to prevent clinical recurrences, suppressive therapy may thus limit spread to sexual partners.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1178v3Qb]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) serologic screening for genital herpes infection — For asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, do not routinely screen for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (Grade: D). This applies to routine screening of adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection; "asymptomatic" refers to persons without known past or current history of genital herpes and includes persons who may have unrecognized infection, and persons who are known to have genital herpes and are between outbreak occurrences are not considered to be asymptomatic for this recommendation. The recommendation does not apply to persons who present to clinicians requesting testing due to a history, signs, or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes or persons with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive disorders, and it is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. Rationale notes that routine serologic screening is limited by the low predictive value of the widely available serologic screening tests and the expected high rate of false-positive results likely to occur with routine screening of asymptomatic persons in the US; antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons but in asymptomatic persons with serologic evidence of HSV, the rationale for antiviral treatment is unclear. Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI); infection is lifelong with currently no cure for HSV infection, and neonatal herpes infection is uncommon but can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

An increased understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission of HSV infections and the development of sensitive type-specific diagnostic tests have helped develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral drug regimens. Effective medications have been available for quite some time, but the most optimal regimens are still under investigation. Advances in the treatment of atypical presentations of HSV infection (such as the use of cidofovir gel for the treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV) are promising. Newer treatments, such as resiquimod, actually may alter the course of HSV infection, reducing the severity and frequency of recurrences.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113xahDb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) transmission and shedding in children and HIV are characterized by frequent asymptomatic shedding and multiple contact routes. Young children generally acquire HSV-1 from the oral secretions of caretakers or playmates, and infection most often results from exposure to HSV shed asymptomatically in saliva. Salivary shedding detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in adults who are HSV-1-seropositive is frequent (9% to 30% of days). Genital shedding of HSV-2 by women who do not have HIV, as detected by PCR, is frequent (19% of days). Either HSV type can be transmitted by oral-oral, oral-genital, and genital-genital contact. Oral and genital HSV shedding is more common near the first episode and in patients with HIV (30% of days in individuals who are HSV seropositive and not on antiretroviral therapy [ART]), and shedding of oral HSV persists longer in young children.

### Therapy of other viral infections: herpes to hepatitis [^113FuNuw]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Over the past several years, there has been an increase in knowledge pertaining to the diagnosis and management strategies for the herpes family (Types 1–8), the pox viruses, mumps, measles, rubella, and parvovirus B19 as well as the viral etiologies of hepatitis. Various antiviral treatments, such as nucleoside analogs and interferon therapy, have been available to reduce the signs and symptoms of these common viral infections. This article summarizes the preferred treatment strategies to be employed for each of the viruses for reducing severity, duration, recurrences (notably in the herpes family), transmission rates, as well as preventive alternatives. The majority of the therapeutic options attenuate the course of disease. Treatment decisions are driven by knowledge of the natural history and often are tailored to incorporate clinical circumstances for individual patients. Promotion of community awareness and the development of vaccines should be emphasized in the battle against these common viruses, particularly the herpes simplex viruses, the pox viruses, and hepatitis B.

Genital Herpes Management

Antiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic patients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for use of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection are to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences and improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent transmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the natural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal transmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also integral to clinical management.

Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug is discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three FDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit for genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has enhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for less frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high oral bioavailability. Topical therapy with antiviral drugs offers minimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.

First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes

Newly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged clinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic involvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have mild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or prolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, all patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive antiviral therapy.

Recommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes*
Acyclovir † 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days
or
Famciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days
or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days
* Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.
† Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of the frequency of dosing.

Biological strategies for interrupting transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 should be directed at reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1. Potential antiretroviral interventions include reducing the likelihood of transmission of HIV-1 by reducing HIV-1 load in the blood and genital tract of HIV-1 — infected person, prophylaxis after high-risk exposure, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for very high risk populations. Antiviral treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, the most common cause of genital ulcers, should be evaluated as a strategy for HIV-1 infection prevention by reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1, on the basis of biological and epidemiological data indicating that HSV-2 facilitates transmission and acquisition of HIV-1. The rationale for antiretroviral and HSV-2-specific interventions and studies to test these strategies are described.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease prevention strategies in people with HIV — Prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to prevent primary HSV infection is not recommended (AIII). In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in people without HIV, but HSV-2 seronegative people with HIV on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF-containing ART, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in people with HIV. The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV have not been evaluated, and no vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners; however, medical male circumcision to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII).

BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

HSV-2/HIV interactions

There was a relative lack of studies assessing the effect of HSV-2 on HIV shedding that included HIV transmission as an outcome measure. While in the past years, this paucity would have shaped future priority setting, addressing this research gap with the current knowledge of U = U (HIV undetectable = untransmittable) would be unethical. This exemplifies the importance of reviewing research priorities in dynamic research fields where new knowledge can significantly alter the landscape.

HSV-2 control measures

Further research on HSV-2 control measures involving young adults, particularly women, as an increased HSV-2 prevalence rate was noted in this age stratum.
Further assessment of microbicide candidates as many of them showed promising initial results. Further focus to be placed on evaluating the microbicide effect in terms of preventing HSV-2 infection in HSV-2 discordant couples.
Although few studies reported encouraging results for either HSV-2 vaccination type in laboratory-based studies in developed countries, no research of this nature was identified based in developing countries. Therefore, further HSV-2 vaccine research is needed in LMICs. The public health gains of a successful vaccine, given the high rates of acquisition in adolescence (e.g. in Africa), could be substantial.

HSV-2 mathematical modelling

Further research modelling the impact of HSV-2 vaccination on HSV-2 and HIV indicators which better reflects disease burden
Further studies to model the cost-effectiveness of proposed interventions to better inform future programmes

### Antiviral therapy for HSV… [^1152LrNZ]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

1 A woman who experiences a primary episode of genital HSV during the third trimester and who has not completed seroconversion by the onset of labor has a 33 percent chance of transmitting the virus to her infant. 2 In contrast, a woman experiencing a secondary reactivation of HSV during the intrapartum period has approximately a 3 percent chance of transmitting the virus to her infant. 2 Of known infected infants, only 30 percent have mothers who had symptomatic HSV or a sexual partner with clinical infection. 3 Many neonatal infections occur because of asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus, usually after a primary episode of HSV infection.
3. 5 Transmission occurs from an HSV-2-positive partner and is often traced to asymptomatic shedding of virus. Symptomatic and asymptomatic primary genital HSV infections are associated with preterm labor and low-birth-weight infants.

6, 7 Because of the high prevalence of HSV among adults, physicians should be aware of the risk of a primary HSV infection in a pregnant woman and its potential consequences to the fetus. Infants often do not have skin lesions. By the time diagnosis is made, many infants have severe disease and have developed complications. When diagnosis is delayed, mortality is high despite antiviral therapy. There is virtually no mortality among infants with disease limited to the skin, eyes and mouth, but mortality increases to 15 percent among infants with encephalitis and 57 percent among infants with disseminated disease, even with antiviral therapy. All infants suspected to have or who are diagnosed with an HSV infection should be treated with parenteral antiviral therapy. The duration of disease before antiviral therapy is initiated is significantly correlated with morbidity and mortality.

Currently, suggested therapy is acyclovir 60 mg per kg per day in three divided doses intravenously for 14 days for disease limited to skin, eyes and mucous membranes, and 21 days for central nervous system or disseminated disease. 1, 19. 1 Empiric acyclovir may be instituted in infants born to mothers with suspected primary HSV infection because the risk of infection in the infant is 33 to 50 percent. 1 Any exposed infant with clinical signs of HSV should be cultured, CSF should be sent for PCR analysis, and the infant should be immediately started on intravenous acyclovir therapy.

For pregnant persons with a clinical history suggestive of HSV without laboratory confirmation, HSV screening may be helpful, and repeat serologic testing may be indicated. In symptomatic pregnant persons, antiviral therapy may be indicated; cesarean delivery is recommended for pregnant persons with active genital lesions or prodromal symptoms. The CDC does not recommend routine serologic screening for HSV-2 in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This review employed a content analysis methodology to describe the progress made in meeting the 2001 WHO research priorities for HSV-2/HIV interactions, HSV-2 control and mathematical modelling.

Successfully addressed WHO HSV-2 priorities

The published research over the past 20 years in the areas of HSV-2/HIV interactions, HSV-2 control measures and mathematical modelling has certainly reflected the WHO research priorities set in 2001, with most of the identified studies addressing at least one of the documented priorities. The greatest number of the included studies were related to the interaction between HSV-2 and HIV; this was expected since the prospect of harnessing this relationship to reduce the burden of HIV has been a key driver of HSV-2 research over this period.

All but one of the seven priorities for HSV-2 and HIV interactions were addressed in the literature. A considerable amount of research attention was given to the effect of HSV-2 therapeutics on HIV shedding and viral load. However, many of these studies extrapolated a positive link between HSV-2 therapeutics and reduced HIV shedding and/or viral load to inferring a link between HSV-2 therapeutics and reduced HIV transmission. Only two studies explored the effect of HSV-2 therapeutics on both HIV shedding and sexual transmission. The studies found that although aciclovir reduced HIV genital shedding in coinfected people, it did not result in a corresponding reduction in the rate of forward transmission. This highlights both the importance of avoiding this overinterpretation and the need for more studies to extend their outcome measures to include HIV sexual transmission.

A total of 52 studies on HSV-2 control measures were published within the selected time frame, and they addressed 6 of the 10 research priorities that were outlined at the WHO priority meeting. Most of the identified studies revealed that, currently, the two best-established and recommended prevention methods for HSV-2 infection are behavioural intervention and HSV-2 antiviral treatment.

A relatively small number (n = 20) of mathematical modelling studies were published in the studied time frame; however, they did address three out of four of the 2001 research priorities. Although HSV-2 was found to have had a substantial bearing on the HIV epidemic and multiple authors emphasising the need for a vaccine, very few studies were based on a potential HSV-2 vaccine.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: findings from a randomized trial [^115KykNm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

GEN-003 elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses. Antibody titers directed against gD2ΔTMR and ICP4.2 increased after each dose and peaked with the 30-µg dose. Titers of neutralizing antibody were the highest in participants who received the 100-µg dose. By contrast, T-cell responses, measured by gamma interferon ELISPOT, were maximal after the first dose and appeared to be inversely related to antigen dose. A similar effect was identified in preclinical studies of immunogenicity in mice. Chronic infections may present high or chronic loads of antigen to the immune system, which can lead to T cells becoming anergized, becoming exhausted, or entering apoptosis after additional stimulation by vaccination. Additional analyses are underway to explore the correlate of activity.

Viral shedding was used as the main efficacy outcome because it is an objective measure of mucosal HSV replication, its measurement has been previously used to demonstrate differences in efficacy between doses of antiviral therapies, and it is the primary mode for transmission. Consequently, for dose selection of a therapeutic agent, shedding rates are most efficient and quantitative. There are inherent limitations of comparing results from across trials, owing to differences in study design, patient populations, exclusion/inclusion criteria, and end points measured. In the current study, the proportion of positive results among swab specimens from the 30-µg group after the last dose (6.4%) is similar to that observed in a study with valacyclovir (500 mg daily; 4%–6%).

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113y9zd2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

We report that the pooled adjusted risk of HIV acquisition after incident HSV-2 infection is almost five times the risk without HSV-2 infection and almost twice the risk associated with exposure to prevalent HSV-2 infection. These findings provide a strong indication for a biological effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV, because the frequency and severity of genital ulceration, viral shedding, and associated inflammation in the genital tract are highest in new HSV-2 infections and tend to decrease with time after infection. The association was higher among general populations than among higher-risk populations. Study-level adjustment for confounders was often incomplete, but did not meaningfully affect the association when comparing crude and adjusted pooled estimates. Heterogeneity across study estimates was moderate. We extended previous reviews through detailed assessment of heterogeneity using meta-regression and sub-pooling and through extensive assessment of potential biases. We found limited evidence of publication bias.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our results provide evidence in support of a direct effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition, which is strengthened by our finding of significantly higher HIV risk associated with incident HSV-2 infection than with prevalent HSV-2 infection. At the population level, new interventions targeting HSV-2, such as new vaccines or microbicides, could have an additional indirect benefit on HIV as a consequence of the interactions between HIV and HSV-2. Such synergies could greatly enhance the effect of combination prevention for HIV infection, particularly in settings with high HIV prevalence. The magnitude of this public health benefit now needs to be carefully estimated for different settings by use of mathematical models informed by the most recent evidence of the associations between HSV and HIV.

Development of multipurpose prevention products that could protect against multiple STIs (eg, topical microbicides and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis) would provide exciting opportunities to simultaneously reduce the burden of disease of more than one infection. Quantifying the effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition has important public health implications, particularly in high-prevalence settings where co-infection is common, because prevention of HSV-2 infection (with single-purpose or multipurpose prevention tools) might indirectly prevent HIV infection. Although trials of use of daily suppressive antiviral therapy against HSV-2 have not shown reduced risk of HIV acquisition or transmission, perhaps because agents were not used at sufficient doses or for sufficient duration, new vaccines against HSV-2 that are currently under developmentcould hold more promise for HIV prevention.

BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Given the possible involvement of HSV-2 in enhancing HIV transmission/acquisition, researchers proceeded to investigate the impact of HSV-2 control measures on HIV indicators through clinical trials. Of these, eight studies found long-term HSV-2 suppressive therapy in coinfected individuals to be associated with reduced plasma and/or genital HIV levels, while five studies reported no significant reduction in HIV shedding with the use of suppressive therapy. Only one of these studies assessed both shedding and subsequent sexual transmission in HIV-discordant couples, and although it reported HSV-2 suppressive therapy to reduce HIV shedding, there was no evident effect on transmission. Conversely, two studies assessed the effect of HSV-2 antiviral therapy on the risk of HIV acquisition in HSV-2-seronegative individuals. Both studies found aciclovir to have no significant effect on HIV acquisition. The only study assessing the impact of a potential HSV-2 vaccine on HIV indicators estimated that a vaccine against HSV-2 could have a substantial effect on HIV incidence in LMIC.

Population attributable fraction (PAF) of HSV-2 to HIV (the percentage of HIV cases attributable to HSV-2 infection) was reported in a total of six studies. They all estimated that a substantial proportion of HIV cases were attributable to HSV-2 with PAFs varying from 22% to 70% in different geographical populations.

Effect of HIV infection on HSV-2 indicators

A singe study of HIV serodiscordant couples with at least one HSV-2-seropositive partner reported HSV-2 incidence to be 2.5 times higher in partners living with HIV compared with HIV-negative people. Other studies found that tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine-based daily pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) was associated with reduced HSV-2 incidence (as well as reduced HIV incidence), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduced HSV-2 shedding (as well as HIV shedding). Compared with HIV-seronegative people, people living with HIV were found to suffer more frequent and more severe HSV-2 recurrences.

Table 1 displays the extent of the research progress according to the associated research priorities set in the 2001 WHO HSV-2 workshop.

Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent recurrences. Persons receiving such therapy often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less frequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Quality of life is improved for many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment. Providers should discuss with patients on an annual basis whether they want to continue suppressive therapy because frequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time for many persons. However, neither treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events and development of HSV antiviral resistance related to long-term antiviral use are uncommon.

Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2 transmission for discordant heterosexual couples in which a partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection. Such couples should be encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic genital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used by those who have multiple partners. HSV-2 seropositive persons without a history of symptomatic genital herpes have a 50% decreased risk for genital shedding, compared with those with symptomatic genital herpes. No data are available regarding efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing HSV-2 transmission among discordant couples in which a partner has a history of asymptomatic HSV-2 infection identified by a positive HSV-2 serologic test. Among HSV-2 seropositive persons without HIV infection, oral TDF/FTC and intravaginal tenofovir are ineffective at reducing the risk for HSV-2 shedding or recurrences.

Famciclovir 250 mg orally 2 times/day
* Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other valacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent recurrences (i.e. ≥ 10 episodes/year).

Famciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of viral shedding. Ease of administration and cost also are key considerations for prolonged treatment.

Preventing recurrence — suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir is effective in preventing recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions and is preferred for patients with severe or frequent recurrences or who want to minimize recurrences (AI). Suppressive therapy for HSV may be continued indefinitely, without regard to improved CD4 count, with the need for continued therapy addressed on an annual basis, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII). Persons starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm³ have an increased risk of HSV-2 shedding and genital ulcer disease (GUD) in the first 6 months on ART; suppressive acyclovir decreases the risk of GUD nearly 60%, and may be recommended for persons with CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm3 starting ART (BI). In persons with HIV not on ART, suppressive anti-HSV therapy decreases HIV RNA levels in plasma, anal, and genital secretions and lowers risk of HIV progression; however, antiviral regimens for herpes do not decrease risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners and should not be used in place of ART to delay HIV progression. In persons on ART, suppressive HSV antivirals do not delay HIV progression, improve CD4 recovery, or decrease markers of systemic inflammation and are not useful for these ends (AI).
