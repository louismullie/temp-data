## Question

A 40-year-old African American female with a past obstetrical history of para 5, gravida 4 with vaginal birth 4 weeks ago presents with the chief complaint of shortness of breath. On examination, the patient has an elevated jugular venous pressure, an S3, respiratory crackles, and bilateral pedal edema. Chest X-ray shows bronchial cuffing, fluid in the fissure, and a pleural effusion. Her ejection fraction is 38% on echocardiogram. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely diagnosis?
A. Hypertrophy
B. Infarction
C. Pericarditis
D. Ventricular dilatation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which characteristic best fits the most likely diagnosis in a 40-year-old African American woman with new heart failure 4 weeks postpartum, reduced ejection fraction, and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis given the timing and phenotype. Then, I should verify the key echocardiographic feature that defines that entity. Next, I will examine the distractors (hypertrophy, infarction, pericarditis) and check whether they are expected or excluded by the data. Finally, I will align the answer with guideline-based diagnostic criteria and choose the best option with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. New-onset heart failure in the peripartum period with reduced ejection fraction strongly suggests peripartum cardiomyopathy, which is defined by the development of LV dysfunction in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum, after excluding other causes of cardiomyopathy, and it commonly presents with dyspnea, edema, and pulmonary congestion on chest imaging [^1117xmNV] [^1127s7zU].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic role of ventricular size. I initially thought LV enlargement was mandatory for PPCM, but hold on, I should correct that. The AHA scientific statement notes that while echocardiography should assess the degree of dilation, LV enlargement is not required for diagnosis; however, when present, it is characteristic and carries prognostic significance, with larger end-diastolic dimensions associated with less likelihood of recovery and worse outcomes, which makes ventricular dilatation a hallmark feature even if not universal [^113rw4mz] [^111HWqTK].

> Next, I should review the provided data to see what fits. The echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 38%, which meets the systolic dysfunction criterion for PPCM, and the clinical picture of elevated JVP, S3, crackles, and edema with pulmonary congestion is consistent with heart failure physiology; while the exact LV dimension isn't specified, the question asks for the characteristic feature among the choices, and in PPCM, ventricular dilatation is a defining structural phenotype that tracks with severity and recovery likelihood [^113rw4mz] [^111HWqTK].

> I will now examine the distractors. Hypertrophy would imply increased wall thickness and mass, which is not the typical remodeling pattern in PPCM; instead, PPCM features chamber enlargement with reduced function, so hypertrophy is not the characteristic finding here, even though secondary remodeling can occur in chronic disease [^1117xmNV]. Infarction would require ischemic etiology and usually regional wall motion abnormalities; there is no mention of ischemia or infarct pattern, and PPCM is a nonischemic cardiomyopathy, so infarction is not the best fit for the described phenotype. Pericarditis would present differently, often with chest pain, friction rub, and effusion without global ventricular dysfunction; the clinical and echocardiographic picture here is of systolic heart failure rather than pericardial inflammation, making pericarditis unlikely.

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. In PPCM, adverse remodeling leads to LV dilation and systolic dysfunction, and the degree of dilation correlates with worse recovery and higher event rates; this aligns with the observation that more severe LV enlargement portends lower likelihood of normalization of function and worse outcomes, reinforcing that ventricular dilatation is a characteristic and prognostically meaningful feature in this entity [^111HWqTK] [^113rw4mz].

> I should double-check that my choice aligns with guideline framing. The AHA guidance emphasizes assessing LV dysfunction and dilation in suspected PPCM, and contemporary reviews of dilated cardiomyopathy phenotypes consistently describe ventricular dilation with reduced function as the core structural signature, which supports selecting ventricular dilatation as the most characteristic feature among the options provided [^113rw4mz] [^115JSDer].

> Conclusion: Given the peripartum timing, reduced EF, and heart failure phenotype, the most likely diagnosis is peripartum cardiomyopathy, and its characteristic structural feature is ventricular dilatation, which is both diagnostically relevant and prognostically important even though not absolutely required for diagnosis [^1117xmNV] [^113rw4mz].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **peripartum cardiomyopathy** [^1117xmNV], characterized by **ventricular dilatation** with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure symptoms in the postpartum period [^113rw4mz]. The correct answer is **D. Ventricular dilatation**.

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

- **Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM)**: This is a dilated cardiomyopathy presenting with heart failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum, with LV dysfunction and often LV dilation [^1117xmNV] [^113rw4mz]. The patient's timing, symptoms, and reduced EF are classic for PPCM [^1117xmNV].

- **Hypertrophy**: LV hypertrophy is not the primary feature of PPCM; it is more typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or chronic pressure overload, not PPCM [^notfound].

- **Infarction**: There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction here; PPCM is nonischemic and infarction would show regional wall motion abnormalities and ischemic changes [^notfound].

- **Pericarditis**: Pericarditis would present with chest pain, friction rub, and pericardial effusion; this patient has heart failure with LV dysfunction, not pericarditis [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of ventricular dilatation in PPCM

In PPCM, **ventricular dilatation** results from myocardial injury and adverse remodeling, with increased wall stress, chamber enlargement, and systolic dysfunction [^115JSDer]. This remodeling is a hallmark of PPCM and guides both diagnosis and prognosis [^113rw4mz].

---

## Clinical implications of ventricular dilatation

Ventricular dilatation in PPCM is associated with:

- **Worse clinical outcomes**: Larger LV size predicts lower likelihood of recovery and higher risk of chronic heart failure [^111HWqTK].

- **Increased arrhythmic risk**: LV dilatation adds risk for ventricular arrhythmias beyond EF alone [^117VyTYm].

- **Guideline-directed therapy**: Standard heart failure therapy is indicated, with consideration of ICD/CRT if EF remains low or symptoms persist [^113HtxLo].

---

## Conclusion

The characteristic feature of the most likely diagnosis (**peripartum cardiomyopathy**) is **ventricular dilatation** with reduced ejection fraction, making option D correct.

### Impact of chamber dilatation on the prognostic value of left ventricular geometry in hypertension [^117QTwTF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In initially untreated patients with essential hypertension, LV chamber dilatation identified a high‐risk subphenotype of eccentric and concentric LVH. Based on this and other 13, 14, 27, 30 studies conducted in diverse populations and settings, such 4‐tiered categorization of LVH is emerging as a valuable operational approach, a potential alternative to LVM, to refine cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with hypertension. Although further studies are needed in this area, these data raise the possibility that patients with LV chamber dilatation associated with LVH are candidates for a more aggressive strategy to control their cardiovascular risk. Notably, from a statistical standpoint, such classification is not superior to LVM taken as a continuous variable, most likely because LVM is roughly sensitive to chamber dilatation by including LV internal diameter in its computation. 31

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115hJxk6]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definition of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) — dilated cardiomyopathy refers to heterogeneous myocardial disorders characterized by ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance in the absence of hypertension, valvular, congenital, or ischemic heart disease. In clinical practice, the pathogenesis of heart failure is often placed into ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and the term nonischemic cardiomyopathy has been interchangeably used with DCM, but this approach fails to recognize nonischemic cardiomyopathies caused by volume or pressure overload that are not conventionally accepted under the definition of DCM. In general practice and clinical trials, ischemic cardiomyopathy is defined as cardiomyopathy caused by ischemic heart disease, and current use of this terminology implies ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial contractility caused by ischemia or infarction.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116oEi4E]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of dilated cardiomyopathy — dilated cardiomyopathy is an important cause of heart failure with a common phenotype of ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance, and its pathogenesis varies significantly across metabolic, endocrine, autoimmune, rheumatologic, infiltrative, genetic, infectious, and cardiotoxin causes. Demographics and treatment also vary significantly according to the cause. Treatment should be individualized and should target the underlying cause, in addition to the standard systolic heart failure therapies. In certain cases, with elimination of the cause and the appropriate treatment, reversal of myocardial remodeling and recovery of cardiac dysfunction can occur. Future studies targeting specific cardiomyopathies will be critical for detection and treatment of specific cardiomyopathies.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: causes, mechanisms, and current and future treatment approaches [^115JSDer]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is conventionally defined as the presence of left ventricular or biventricular dilatation or systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions (eg, primary valve disease) or significant coronary artery disease sufficient to cause ventricular remodelling. This definition has been recognised as overly restrictive, as left ventricular hypokinesis without dilation could be the initial presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy. The causes of dilated cardiomyopathy comprise genetic (primary dilated cardiomyopathy) or acquired factors (secondary dilated cardiomyopathy). Acquired factors include infections, toxins, cancer treatment, endocrinopathies, pregnancy, tachyarrhythmias, and immune-mediated diseases. 5–15% of patients with acquired dilated cardiomyopathy harbour a likely pathogenic or pathogenic gene variant (ie, gene mutation). Therefore, the diagnostic tests and therapeutic approach should always consider both genetic and acquired factors. This Seminar will focus on the current multidimensional diagnostic and therapeutic approach and discuss the underlying pathophysiology that could drive future treatments aiming to repair or replace the existing gene mutation, or target the specific inflammatory, metabolic, or pro-fibrotic drivers of genetic or acquired dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Left ventricular dilatation increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced systolic function [^113GnbBv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Increased LV dilatation and LVEF were associated with an increased risk of appropriate ICD shocks in subjects with severe LV dysfunction, but LV mass was not. LV dilatation can easily assessed during routine clinical practice and may provide a useful clinical tool for risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in heart failure patients.

### Ultrasound of acquired posterior fossa abnormalities in the newborn [^111GHq6X]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Ventricular dilatation

Ventricular dilatation can occur as a sequela of GMH-IVH or intracranial infection. It is due to obstruction by a clot or subependymal scarring at the level of the foramen of Monro, aqueduct, fourth ventricle exit foramina, or cerebellar arachnoid spaces. Scanning through the MF visualizes the ventricular system and locates the site of obstruction. A dilated aqueduct — in some with to and fro motion on Doppler exam — and/or fourth ventricle can be visualized by ultrasound (Fig. 8). When both the inflow and outflow of the fourth ventricle are obstructed, this can lead to a severely dilated trapped fourth ventricle, with brainstem compression. This requires a specific therapeutic approach.

LV Dilatation

LV dilatation is often the result of multiple pathological changes that occur during the adverse myocardial remodeling process in progressive heart failure. Acute ventricular dilatation in an animal model has been shown to decrease the ventricular effective refractory period and increase the dispersion of refractoriness, thus increasing the risk of reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. During chronic LV dilatation and failure, ion channel changes lead to action potential prolongation caused by changes in K⁺, Ca²⁺, and Na⁺ currents as well as alterations in the distribution and expression of connexin40 and connexin43. A recent report from the OREGON-Sudden Unexpected Death Study (SUDS) study by Narayan et alshowed that severe LV dilation is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in subjects in the community with an EF < 35%. In the current cohort of heart failure patients, LV dilatation was associated with defibrillator shocks even after adjustment for LVEF. LV dilatation may be an additional risk factor to consider in heart failure patients with reduced LVEF when risk-stratifying patients for sudden death. Furthermore, LV dilatation can be easily assessed on a transthoracic echocardiogram at the time of EF measurement.

We do acknowledge that an HR of 1.22 for LVEDD to predict increased risk of ICD shock may be difficult to use this parameter in clinical settings; however, it should be kept in mind that LVEDD remained a significant predictor in all the multivariable analyses. In addition, serial increases in LVEDD were associated with an increased risk of ICD shocks and freedom from death/transplant/VAD. While LVEDD was associated with both outcomes, we would suggest that further study of LV dilation is worthwhile to understand its ability to predict outcomes in heart failure.

LV Mass

Increased LV mass has been associated with adverse outcomes in diverse patient groups, such as those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease, and is shown to increase the risk of sudden death.–In several animal models, heart failure and LV hypertrophy has been associated with decreased K currents (I to, I ks), altered connexin43 expression, and an increased QT interval.–However, increased LV mass is not uniformly related to increased ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. The current data from GRADE suggest that an increase in LV mass was not associated with increased ICD shocks.

### Effects of an early resuscitation protocol on sepsis mortality in Zambia… [^114XkSz1]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

bA severity score and mortality estimation tool. cMeasured above the clavicle with the patient positioned at 45°. For example, because most patients in the trial had depleted volume levels, the median jugular venous pressure was around 2 cm H2O below the clavicle or −2 cm H2O. However, each of these studies4-6 had important limitations. In particular, both RCTs4, 6 included patients with nonspecific markers of tissue hypoperfusion rather than only patients with sepsis and overt hypotension, for whom the benefit of early intravenous fluid bolus and vasopressor administration may be greatest. If the arterial oxygen saturation decreased by 3%, the respiratory rate increased by 5 breaths per minute, or JVP reached 3 cm or greater above the sternal angle, fluid infusion was discontinued.

The sepsis protocol limited intravenous fluid administration to a total of 4 L, including any fluid given in the ED prior to enrollment. If mean arterial pressure remained less than 65 mm Hg after completion of the initial 2-L fluid bolus, a dopamine infusion was initiated via a peripheral intravenous line starting at 10 μg/kg/min and titrated to reach a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater. The sepsis protocol recommended blood transfusion for patients with a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g/dL or with severe pallor. Among the remaining 65 patients in the sepsis protocol group, intravenous fluids were discontinued prior to a total volume of 4 L due to an increase in respiratory rate or a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation, JVP of 3 cm or greater, blood transfusion through an intravenous line, and other reasons.

It is possible that JVP did not serve as a reliable surrogate measure of central venous pressure16 or that central venous pressure itself was an inaccurate indicator of developing volume overload. 17 The fact that more than 30% of patients treated with the sepsis protocol developed worsening respiratory function but less than 10% developed JVP elevation suggests that JVP cannot be safely used as an end point for fluid administration in this context.

### Two-dimensional ultrasound measurements vs. magnetic resonance imaging-derived ventricular volume of preterm infants with germinal matrix intraventricular haemorrhage [^115Qbxqd]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Very-low-birth-weight (< 1,500 g) infants are at increased risk of developing a germinal matrix intraventricular haemorrhage, which occurs in 20–25% of cases. Approximately 35% of the infants who have a germinal matrix intraventricular haemorrhage develop post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. In severe cases of post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, there is an increased risk of raised intracranial pressure and subsequent brain damage, and an intervention such as a lumbar puncture, the placement of a subcutaneous reservoir or a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt might be required.

To diagnose and monitor post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation and to assess whether intervention is required, two-dimensional (2-D) cranial US is used. The most important measurements are the ventricular index, anterior horn width and thalamo-occipital distance. These measurements aid in managing post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, i.e. in determining when to perform lumbar punctures, whether to insert a ventricular reservoir, how often and how much cerebrospinal fluid to withdraw and whether to insert a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Another important prognostic imaging marker is the ventricular volume. This, however, cannot be measured using 2-D cranial US. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally considered to be the most accurate way to determine the ventricular volume in neonates. Not all premature babies undergo MR scanning. When they do, it is usually performed once or twice during the neonatal period and at most centers the MRI is performed around term-equivalent age.

Although MRI provides high-resolution and anatomical detail, MRI has limitations. It can be challenging to maintain physiological stability during an MRI examination. Moreover, there are potential risks for infants during transfer to the MR unit, sedation might be required, and the examination is time-consuming and often costly. Also, MRI cannot be easily repeated for monitoring and follow-up. Two-dimensional cranial US is routinely used on the neonatal intensive care unit to diagnose and assess the progression of post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Therefore, it would be advantageous if US could also be used for ventricular volume assessment.

The purpose of the study was to assess whether the ventricular volume can be determined accurately using US, to pave the way for a US-derived measurement of ventricular volume. The rationale is that the ventricular volume might be more directly linked to intracranial pressure, which in turn is considered to be the actual cause of additional damage to the surrounding white matter.

### Post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation in preterm infants: maximal ventricular dilatation and timing of intervention predict neurodevelopment [^116VSkzk]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the impact of maximal ventricular dilatation and age at first neurosurgical intervention on neurodevelopmental impairment among preterm newborns with post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD).

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 105 surviving newborns ≤ 34 weeks' gestation between 2012–2020 with PHVD. We studied the association of maximal ventricular dilatation to significant impairment at 18-months corrected-age in the overall cohort and of ventricular dilatation and timing of first neurosurgical intervention to impairment in the 51 newborns who underwent a neurosurgical intervention.

Results

Forty-nine of 105 (47%) had significant impairment. Maximal anterior horn width (AHW) but not ventricular index was associated with significant impairment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07, 95%CI 1.18–3.65 for AHW quintiles) after adjusting for site, GA, intraventricular hemorrhage grade, and neurosurgical intervention. In the 51 (49%) newborns that underwent neurosurgical intervention, the first neurosurgical intervention occurred at median 23 days of life (IQR 17,40). Only age > 23 days at first intervention was associated with significant impairment after adjusting for AHW and GA (aOR 6.32, 95%CI 1.13–35.29).

Conclusion

Increasing maximal ventricular dilatation and later age at first neurosurgical intervention were associated with significant impairment in preterm PHVD survivors. Intervening promptly upon progression of severe PHVD may mitigate later impairment.

Impact

The combined impact of maximal ventricular dilatation and timing of intervention in post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) is not well-established. Greater maximal anterior horn width but not ventricular index was associated with significant impairment. In those receiving a neurosurgical intervention, later age at first intervention was associated with significant impairment. Intervening promptly upon progression of severe PHVD may mitigate later impairment.

Conclusion

Assessment of LV size could potentially add value to EF in risk prediction for SCD. Further investigation directed toward better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of LV dilatation and evaluating its utility as a clinical risk marker, may pave the way for incorporation of this measurement into risk‐stratification algorithms for sudden death.

Doming refers to "Leaflets adopting an architectural dome shape during forward flow". Ventricular and septal morphology terms include D-shaped — "Shape of RV chamber in cross-section view associated with RV pressure overload" — and dumbbell appearance — "Colloquial term associated with Atrial septal thickening that spares the fossa ovalis". Motion and echotexture terms include dyssynchronous ("Incoordinated movement"), echogenic/hyperechoic ("Reflecting ultrasound waves well"), and echolucent/hypoechoic ("Describing structures that poorly reflect ultrasound waves. Also referred to as echo-free"). Tissue characterization also includes fibrotic appearance — "Abnormally hyperechoic areas within a structure or strands within a fluid collection".

### Left ventricular dilatation increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced systolic function [^111MCTbh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Effect of LV Dilatation on Arrhythmias and Survival

Subjects who received an ICD shock or reached the combined end point of death/transplant/VAD placement had increased LVESD and LVEDD values than those who did not (ICD shock: LVESD 5.7 versus 5.3 cm, P < 0.0001; LVEDD 6.6 versus 6.3 cm, P < 0.0001; death/transplant/VAD: LVESD 5.7 versus 5.3 cm, P < 0.0001; LVEDD 6.6 versus 6.2 cm, P < 0.0001). Subjects with severe LV dilatation were younger (59.4 versus 63.7 years, P < 0.0001), had wider QRS durations (146.9 versus 133.4 ms, P < 0.0001), and were less likely to have ischemic cardiomyopathy (62.1% versus 75.2%, P < 0.0001) compared with subjects without severe dilatation (Tables 2 and 4). Furthermore, subjects with severe LV dilatation had decreased LVEF compared with those without severe dilatation (17.8% versus 21.8%, P < 0.0001).

### Left ventricular dilatation increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced systolic function [^117VyTYm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias; however, LV ejection fraction has a low sensitivity to predict ventricular arrhythmias. LV dilatation and mass may be useful to further risk-stratify for ventricular arrhythmias.

Methods and Results

Patients from the Genetic Risk of Assessment of Defibrillator Events (GRADE) study (N = 930), a study of heart failure subjects with defibrillators, were assessed for appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock and death, heart transplant, or ventricular assist device placement by LV diameter and mass. LV mass was divided into normal, mild, moderate, and severe classifications. Severe LV end-diastolic diameter had worse shock-free survival than normal and mild LV end-diastolic diameter (P = 0.0002 and 0.0063, respectively; 2-year shock free, severe 74%, moderate 80%, mild 91%, normal 88%; 4-year shock free, severe 62%, moderate 69%, mild 72%, normal 81%) and freedom from death, transplant, or ventricular assist device compared with normal and moderate LV end-diastolic diameter (P < 0.0001 and 0.0441, respectively; 2-year survival: severe 78%, moderate 85%, mild 82%, normal 89%; 4-year survival: severe 55%, moderate 64%, mild 63%, normal 74%). Severe LV mass had worse shock-free survival than normal and mild LV mass (P = 0.0370 and 0.0280, respectively; 2-year shock free: severe 80%, moderate 81%, mild 91%, normal 87%; 4-year shock free: severe 68%, moderate 73%, mild 76%, normal 76%) but no association with death, transplant, or ventricular assist device (P = 0.1319). In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted for LV ejection fraction, LV end-diastolic diameter was associated with appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks (hazard ratio 1.22, P = 0.020). LV end-diastolic diameter was associated with time to death, transplant, or ventricular assist device (hazard ratio 1.29, P = 0.0009).

Conclusions

LV dilatation may complement ejection fraction to predict ventricular arrhythmias.

### Left ventricular dilatation increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced systolic function [^115HkPfX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias are common in heart failure patients, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been shown to decrease mortality related to sudden death. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) is the predominant measure used to risk-stratify patients.–However, using the single measure of LVEF ignores other variables that may add predictive value, such as LV dimensions. Clearly, identification of risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias is important given that ICD placement is associated with some degree of risk, from both the initial placement and associated long-term risks, such as device malfunction or infection.

LV dilatation reflects adverse ventricular remodeling and may be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The goal of the current analysis was to determine the ability of LV dilatation to predict the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in a cohort of heart failure patients with severely depressed EF from the Genetic Risk Assessment of Defibrillator Events (GRADE) study. Given that patients with decompensated or more advanced heart failure may have a greater risk of sudden death, LV dilatation may complement LVEF to risk-stratify patients' risk of ventricular arrhythmias. We sought to use measures easily obtained with echocardiography, namely LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and LV mass (LV mass), to stratify patients' risk of ventricular arrhythmias.

### Left ventricular dilatation increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced systolic function [^112nZqVY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Shock-free survival was associated with LV dilatation (Figure 3A, P = 0.0002). Shock-free survival in the cohort with severe LV dilatation was worse compared with mild LV dilation (P = 0.0063) and normal LV dimensions (P = 0.0002); however, those with severe or moderate LV dilation did not differ (P = 0.16) (2-year shock-free survival for severe LV dilation 74%, moderate 80%, mild 91%, and normal 88%; 4-year shock-free survival, severe LV dilation 62%, moderate 69%, mild 72%, and normal 81%). This was confirmed using Cox proportional hazards modeling (P = 0.0004). For every 1-cm increase in the degree of LV dilation, there was an associated 33% increase in the hazard for the risk of ICD shock (95% CI 14% to 56%) as shown in Table 5. In addition, LV dilatation was associated with death/transplant/VAD (Figure 3B, P = 0.0002). Subjects with severe LV dilation had a lower freedom from death/transplant/VAD compared with those with normal and moderate LV dimensions (P < 0.0001 and 0.0441), but survival did not differ from severe to mild (P = 0.1246) (2-year survival: severe LV dilatation 78%, moderate 85%, mild 82%, normal 89%; 4-year survival: severe LV dilatation 55%, moderate 64%, mild 63%, normal 74%). These patterns were confirmed with Cox proportional hazards modeling (P < 0.0001, HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.61).

### Impact of left ventricular dilatation on biventricular function and deformation in diabetes mellitus with reduced ejection fraction: a CMR feature tracking study [^115futrK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications of left ventricular dilatation in DM patients

A population-based study of 45,700 volunteers confirmed the incremental prognostic value of LVGCS beyond established imaging markers in HF and myocardial infarction. Similarly, Aleong et al. demonstrated that in patients with reduced systolic function, enlargement of LVEDD serves as an independent predictor of ventricular arrhythmias, providing complementary prognostic value to LVEF. In our cohort, LV dilatation in DMrEF patients was associated with impaired LV strains and RVGCS, and it was independently associated with reduced LVGCS. In the context of diabetes mellitus, factors such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, excessive oxidative stress, and impaired intracellular calcium handling contribute to the progressive damage of cardiomyocytes. In response to this damage, compensatory dilatation of the LV occurs, which increases wall stress. Meanwhile, overactivation of the neuroendocrine system not only directly promotes myocardial fibrosis and cellular hypertrophy but also disrupts the collagen network responsible for maintaining cardiac structure, thereby exacerbating ventricular chamber enlargement and geometric alterations, and ultimately perpetuating a vicious cycle. These findings support the hypothesis that LV dilatation is not merely a compensatory response, but may also actively drive further deterioration in myocardial function.

From a clinical perspective, LV dilatation represents an important determinant of patient morbidity and long-term prognosis. Its presence provides incremental prognostic information beyond LVEF and traditional risk factors, underlining the need for its routine assessment in clinical practice. CMR, particularly feature tracking, offers high reproducibility and sensitivity in quantifying myocardial strain and ventricular volumes, making it an ideal tool for detecting early subclinical myocardial impairment and characterizing adverse remodeling in diabetic patients. The present study highlights the importance of follow-up assessment of LV dilatation and biventricular strain by CMR in DM patients with reduced LVEF, which might facilitate risk stratification. A variety of therapies have been demonstrated to target the maladaptive processes that are central to the manifestation of adverse remodeling, with the capacity to slow or reverse ventricular dilatation and ventricular dysfunction. Early identification of LV dilatation and timely initiation of treatment are crucial for DM patients with reduced LVEF.

### A 38-year-old woman with worsening dyspnea after giving birth… [^111pGeL8]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Zhan Y, Norman AV, Kawabori M. A 38-Year-Old Woman With Worsening Dyspnea After Giving Birth. JAMA Cardiol. 2020; 5: 609–610. doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2019.5731 Transthoracic echocardiography of the aortic root revealed abnormal echogenic signal in the aortic sinus separate from the 3 leaflets and corresponding commissures. A 38-year-old woman without a significant medical history presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, she had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities.

A non–electrocardiogram -gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts. She had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL. Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation, and a mildly dilated aortic root. The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and her white blood cell count was within normal limits.

### Systolic left ventricular function according to left ventricular concentricity and dilatation in hypertensive patients: the losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension study [^113MifEw]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH, high left ventricular mass (LVM)] is traditionally classified as concentric or eccentric based on left ventricular relative wall thickness. We evaluated left ventricular systolic function in a new four-group LVH classification based on left ventricular dilatation [high left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) index and concentricity (LVM/EDV)] in hypertensive patients.

Methods and Results

Nine hundred thirty-nine participants in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) echocardiography substudy had measurable LVM at enrolment. Patients with LVH (LVM/body surface area ≥ 116g/m in men and ≥ 96g/m in women) were divided into four groups; 'eccentric nondilated' (normal LVM/EDV and EDV), 'eccentric dilated' (increased EDV, normal LVM/EDV), 'concentric nondilated' (increased LVM/EDV with normal EDV), and 'concentric dilated' (increased LVM/EDV and EDV) and compared to patients with normal LVM. At baseline, 12% had eccentric nondilated, 20% eccentric dilated, 29% concentric nondilated, and 14% concentric dilated LVH, with normal LVM in 25%. Compared with the concentric nondilated LVH group, those with concentric dilated LVH had significantly lower pulse pressure/stroke index and ejection fraction; higher LVM index, stroke volume, cardiac output, left ventricular midwall shortening, left atrial volume and isovolumic relaxation time; and more had segmental wall motion abnormalities (all P < 0.05). Similar differences existed between patients with eccentric dilated and those with eccentric nondilated LVH (all P < 0.05). Compared with patients with normal LVM, the eccentric nondilated had higher LV stroke volume, pulse pressure/stroke index, Cornell voltage product and SBP, and lower heart rate and fewer were African-American (all P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The new four-group classification of LVH identifies dilated subgroups with reduced left ventricular function among patients currently classified with eccentric or concentric LVH.

### Mitochondrial CaMKII causes adverse metabolic reprogramming and dilated cardiomyopathy [^114Miyxe]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The core components of adverse cardiac remodeling are myocardial hypertrophy and dilation. However, the biological connections between hypertrophy and dilation are uncertain. One paradigm is that myocardial hypertrophy is a compensatory reaction to pathological stress, but sustained and excessive hypertrophy can progress to chamber dilation over time. Although the interrelationship between hypertrophy and dilation is not completely understood, dilation may be favored by myocyte death interposed upon hypertrophied myocardium that eventually impairs myocardial ability to sustain elevated ventricular wall stress. However, the rate of progression to left ventricular dilation in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy detectable by sonographic imaging is low, suggesting that the processes of hypertrophy and dilation are not tightly coupled, nor necessarily driven by the same biological mechanisms. Our findings regarding mtCaMKII cardiomyopathy indicate that myocardial dilation can arise as a sustained response to myocardial energy deprivation in the absence of myocardial hypertrophy, or death. The cardiac dilation in mtCaMKII hearts is potentially reversible, because it does not involve increases in myocardial death, or fibrosis, and can be rescued by replacement of CKmito. Furthermore, [Ca²⁺]ᵢ homeostasis can be repaired in ventricular myocytes isolated from mtCaMKII hearts by addition of ATP. Thus, it is possible that CKmito replacement, or mitochondrial CaMKII inhibition could prevent or reverse some acquired forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, a life-threatening disease phenotype that has been largely considered irreversible.

### Left ventricular dilatation increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced systolic function [^115jtcpr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Assessment of LV Dimensions

LV dimensions were obtained from echocardiograms that were available on 930 patients at the time of enrollment or within 6 months before enrollment. Echocardiograms included 2-dimensional, Doppler, and M-mode modalities. The following measurements were independently performed at each center according to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelinesin the parasternal long axis: LVEDD, LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), interventricular septal thickness, and posterior wall thickness. LVEF was calculated from LV diastolic and systolic dimensions. Patients were classified according to the degree of LV dilatation by using the sex-based LVEDD as specified by the ASE guidelines into not severe dilation (no, mild, or moderate dilation) or severe dilatation as shown in Table 1. LV mass was calculated as follows: LV mass = 0.8×{1.04[LVIDd+PWTd+SWTd]³ −(LVIDd)³}+0.6 g where LVIDd was the LV internal diameter at end diastole, PWTd is the posterior wall thickness at end diastole, and SWTd is the septal wall thickness at end diastole. Patients were classified into the degree of LV mass according to the ASE guidelines into normal, mild, moderate, and severely abnormal (Table 1).

Table 1

Determination of Ventricular Arrhythmias

Ventricular arrhythmias were identified at the time of clinical events and by routine device interrogations performed throughout the study period. ICD shocks were adjudicated as either appropriate or inappropriate by an electrophysiologist at the initial center and then reviewed independently by 2 cardiologists at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A third electrophysiologist was employed for dispute resolution. There was no standardization to ICD programming for treatment of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and, therefore, the threshold for ICD shocks and antitachycardia pacing (ATP) varied among patients. For the present analysis, only appropriate ICD shocks for ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF) were recorded and used as an end point, while ATP was not used as an end point for this analysis.

Proposed strict echocardiographic parameters included EF < 45% or fractional shortening < 30% and increased LV end-diastolic dimension > 2.7 cm/m², and although evidence of systolic dysfunction is necessary for generally accepted PPCM diagnosis, LV enlargement is not required.

### Classification of left ventricular size: diameter or volume with contrast echocardiography? [^114ydfMe]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Classification of LV size

Measures of LV size were categorised as normal, mild, moderate or severely dilated according to ASE defined cut-off values for LV diameter, LV indexed diameter, LV volume and LV indexed volume. When each measure was compared with LVEDVi, there was only limited agreement in classification of LV size (table 4 and figures 1 A–C). Of 320 patients with a severely dilated LVEDVi, only 95 (30%) were similarly classified by LVIDD, with 86 patients (27%) measuring in the normal range (figure 2). LVIDD index agreement was poorer, with only 43 patients (13%) classified as being severely dilated, and 173 (54%) measuring in the normal range.

Table 4
Classification of LV dilation by different measures of LV size

Figure 1
Classification of left ventricular (LV) size by (A) LV internal diameter in diastole (LVIDD) according to LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), (B) LVIDD index (LVIDDi) according to LVEDVi and (C) LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) according to LVEDVi.

Figure 2
Classification of patients with severely dilated left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) by LV internal diameter in diastole (LVIDD).

Assessing LVEDV, the classification agreement remained modest (κ = 0.462). However, non-indexed volumes demonstrated an increased tendency to diagnose LV dilation with respect to indexed volumes: of 485 patients classified with a severely dilated LV volume, 76 (16%) had an indexed volume in the normal range.

When LV size was defined more simply as normal or dilated by the same criteria, there was similarly poor agreement in classification (table 5). Of 692 patients with a dilated indexed LV volume, 346 (50%) had an LV diameter in the normal range, and 502 (73%) had a normal indexed LV diameter. Agreement remained limited between indexed and non-indexed LV volumes (κ = 0.580), again due to an increased likelihood of being classified as dilated by non-indexed volumes. Of 1022 patients with a dilated (non-indexed) LV volume, 377 (37%) had an indexed volume in the normal range.

### Clinical diagnosis, imaging, and genetics of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy / dysplasia: JACC state-of-the-art review [^1132B9VD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is an inherited cardiomyopathy that can lead to sudden cardiac death and heart failure. Our understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical expressivity is continuously evolving. The diagnosis of ARVC/D remains particularly challenging due to the absence of specific unique diagnostic criteria, its variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. Advances in genetics have enlarged the clinical spectrum of the disease, highlighting possible phenotypes that overlap with arrhythmogenic dilated cardiomyopathy and channelopathies. The principal challenges for ARVC/D diagnosis include the following: earlier detection of the disease, particularly in cases of focal right ventricular involvement; differential diagnosis from other arrhythmogenic diseases affecting the right ventricle; and the development of new objective electrocardiographic and imaging criteria for diagnosis. This review provides an update on the diagnosis of ARVC/D, focusing on the contribution of emerging imaging techniques, such as echocardiogram/magnetic resonance imaging strain measurements or computed tomography scanning, new electrocardiographic parameters, and high-throughput sequencing.

### Clinical diagnosis of left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction in the age of technology [^1126V4TA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnostic process has become increasingly dependent on instrumental and laboratory investigation.

Aim

To evaluate the accuracy of symptoms and signs in identifying left ventricular (LV) dilatation and/or systolic dysfunction.

Methods

A group of 100 patients in stable clinical condition and scheduled for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was prospectively examined by two cardiologists, who were unaware of the individual patient's condition. Patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination.

Results

Several symptoms and signs were associated with LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction at univariate analysis. Using multiple logistic regression, a mitral systolic murmur, a laterally displaced LV impulse, orthopnoea and hepatomegaly were all independent predictors of LV dilatation (end-diastolic volume ≥ 110 ml/m²) (p < 0.0001) and LV dysfunction (ejection fraction < 45%) (p < 0.0001). The combination of the above variables correctly identified 79% of patients with LV dilatation (sensitivity 51%, specificity 92%), and 82% of patients with LV dysfunction (sensitivity 68%, specificity 90%). Considering LV dilatation and dysfunction, 77% of patients were correctly identified after history alone (kappa = 0.13), 84% after LV impulse examination (kappa = 0.55) and 86% after cardiac auscultation (kappa = 0.58).

Conclusion

Symptoms and signs predict LV dilatation and/or dysfunction with fair sensitivity and excellent specificity.

Fig. 6
Grade 4 intraventricular haemorrhage/periventricular haemorrhagic infarction. Coronal images acquired with a medium-frequency (3–10 mHz) curved probe at the level of: (a) the foramina of Monro, (b) the lateral ventricular trigones, and (c) the lateral ventricular occipital horns demonstrate a "fan-shaped" area of increased echogenicity in the left frontoparietal periventricular white matter (dashed lines) consistent with periventricular haemorrhagic infarction. Note the expansile haematoma within the left lateral ventricle (solid arrows) and diffuse thickening and increased echogenicity of the ependyma of the lateral and third ventricles (white arrowheads) secondary to prior IVH

The sonographic characteristics of IVH evolve over time. Typically, haematoma is hypo- or iso-echoic in the hyperacute phase (within 4 h of haemorrhage onset), echogenic in the acute phase (4 h to 3 days), and centrally hypoechoic and retractile in the subacute phase (3 days to 4 weeks). After 4 weeks, the haematoma liquefies and further decreases in volume. There may be associated intraventricular debris/septations, and ventricular dilatation (PHH).

PHH typically occurs days to weeks after IVH, most commonly after grade 3 IVH. It can either be communicating (due to impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption) or non-communicating (due to an obstructing clot or fibrin debris). In the case of non-communicating hydrocephalus, the pattern of ventricular dilatation depends on the level of obstruction. Uni- or bilateral obstruction of the foramen/foramina of Monro results in uni- or bilateral lateral ventricular dilatation. Aqueductal obstruction results in bilateral lateral and 3rd ventricular dilatation (Fig. 7). Obstruction of the 4th ventricular outflow tracts (e.g. the foramina of Luschka or Magendie) results in bilateral lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricular dilatation. 4th ventricular entrapment can also occur due to combined aqueductal and 4th ventricular outlet obstruction.

### Left ventricular diameter and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death [^1173R2Fp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Left ventricular (LV) diameter is routinely measured on the echocardiogram but has not been jointly evaluated with the ejection fraction (EF) for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Methods and Results

From a large ongoing community‐based study of SCD (The Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study; population ≈1 million), SCD cases were compared with geographic controls. LVEF and LV diameter, measured using the LV internal dimension in diastole (categorized as normal, mild, moderate, or severe dilatation using American Society of Echocardiography definitions) were assessed from echocardiograms prior but unrelated to the SCD event. Cases (n = 418; 69.5 ± 13.8 years), compared with controls (n = 329; 67.7 ± 11.9 years), more commonly had severe LV dysfunction (EF ≤ 35%; 30.5% versus 18.8%; P < 0.01) and larger LV diameter (52.2 ± 10.5 mm versus 49.7 ± 7.9 mm; P < 0.01). Moderate or severe LV dilatation (16.3% versus 8.2%; P = 0.001) and severe LV dilatation (8.1% versus 2.1%; P < 0.001) were significantly more frequent in cases. In multivariable analysis, severe LV dilatation was an independent predictor of SCD (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.03 to 5.9]; P = 0.04). In addition, subjects with both EF ≤ 35% and severe LV dilatation had higher odds for SCD compared with those with low EF only (odds ratio 3.8 [95% CI 1.5 to 10.2] for both versus 1.7 [95% CI 1.2 to 2.5] for low EF only), suggesting that severe LV dilatation additively increased SCD risk.

Conclusion

LV diameter may contribute to risk stratification for SCD independent of the LVEF. This readily available echocardiographic measure warrants further prospective evaluation.

### The diagnosis and evaluation of dilated cardiomyopathy [^112wcP7j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is best understood as the final common response of myocardium to diverse genetic and environmental insults. A rigorous work-up can exclude alternative causes of left ventricular (LV) dilation and dysfunction, identify etiologies that may respond to specific treatments, and guide family screening. A significant proportion of DCM cases have an underlying genetic or inflammatory basis. Measurement of LV size and ejection fraction remain central to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment, but other aspects of cardiac remodeling inform prognosis and carry therapeutic implications. Assessment of myocardial fibrosis predicts both risk of sudden cardiac death and likelihood of LV functional recovery, and has significant potential to guide patient selection for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Detailed mitral valve assessment is likely to assume increasing importance with the emergence of percutaneous interventions for functional mitral regurgitation. Detection of pre-clinical DCM could substantially reduce morbidity and mortality by allowing early instigation of cardioprotective therapy.

### Left ventricular dilatation and subclinical renal damage in primary hypertension [^114T3Pm6]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

A new classification of left ventricular geometry based on left ventricular dilatation and concentricity has recently been developed. This classification identifies subgroups differing with regard to systemic haemodynamics, left ventricular function and cardiovascular prognosis. We investigated the relationship between the new classification of left ventricular geometry and subclinical renal damage, namely urine albumin excretion and early intrarenal vascular changes in primary hypertensive patients.

Methods

A total of 449 untreated hypertensive patients were studied. Four different patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy (eccentric nondilated, eccentric dilated, concentric nondilated and concentric dilated hypertrophy) were identified by echocardiography. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Early intrarenal vascular changes, expressed as the renal volume to resistive index ratio, were evaluated by ultrasound and Doppler scan.

Results

Patients with concentric dilated left ventricular hypertrophy had higher albumin excretion rates (P = 0.0258) and prevalence of microalbuminuria (P < 0.0001) and lower renal volume to resistive index ratio than patients with concentric nondilated hypertrophy (P = 0.0093). Patients with eccentric dilated hypertrophy showed a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria than patients with eccentric nondilated hypertrophy (P < 0.0001). Moreover, patients with chamber dilatation showed a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria (P = 0.0002) and lower renal volume to resistive index ratio (P = 0.0107) than patients without chamber dilatation. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, left ventricular chamber dilatation was an independent predictor of subclinical renal damage.

Conclusion

Left ventricular dilatation is associated with subclinical renal damage in hypertension. These findings extend previous reports and provide a pathophysiological rationale for the observed unfavourable prognosis in patients with left ventricular dilatation.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — recovery of left ventricular (LV) function — shows that recovery (ejection fraction [EF] ≥ 50%) has been reported in 45% to 78% of US women, most commonly within the first 6 months after diagnosis. Ventricular dilatation with an initial LV end-diastolic dimension > 5.6 cm is associated with less recovery, while predictors of recovery include higher initial EF, gestational hypertension, breastfeeding, postpartum diagnosis, lack of troponin elevation, lower BNP, absence of LV thrombus, and nonblack ethnicity. In a small series of 7 women, contractile reserve was associated with recovery, and withdrawal of heart failure therapy did not appear linked to clinical deterioration over 29 months of follow-up.

Affected infants commonly show left ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, endocardial fibroelastosis, or a dilated and hypertrophic left ventricle with trabeculations consistent with left ventricular noncompaction; some succumb to heart failure, sudden death, or sepsis attributable to leukocyte dysfunction, and tafazzin encodes an acyltransferase leading to cardiolipin abnormalities.

Left ventricular dilation in CA — initial chamber volume assessment should be performed using TTE, and among CA with suspected pathologic dilation, CMR should be performed to confirm dilation and to characterize structure and function; the magnitude of LV and LA dilation in CA cannot be used in isolation to differentiate EICR from pathology and integration of clinical history, myocardial function, and additional diagnostic testing are generally required; endurance-trained CA with corollary EICR may demonstrate mild reductions in LV ejection fraction (45–50%) with preserved resting stroke volume; low normal to mildly reduced (45–55%) LV ejection fractions in asymptomatic CA with LV dilation are common and can be considered physiologic when accompanied by normal indices of diastolic function and concomitant dilation of the RV and both atria; assessment of LA size in the context of LV dilation or hypertrophy is of limited value for differentiating heart disease from EICR because LA enlargement is extremely common among healthy CA.

### Impact of left ventricular dilatation on biventricular function and deformation in diabetes mellitus with reduced ejection fraction: a CMR feature tracking study [^115yGjZg]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Left ventricular (LV) dilatation has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, the relationship between LV dilatation and biventricular myocardial dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and reduced LVEF unclear.

Methods

From September 2017 to March 2025, 265 clinically diagnosed patients with DM who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scanning in our hospital were included. According to LVEF and LV dilatation status, these patients were divided into three groups: 122 DM with preserved LVEF (DMpEF) group, 51 DM with reduced LVEF and no LV dilatation (DMrEF-NLVD) group, and 92 DM with dilated cardiomyopathy (DMrEF-DCM) group. Biventricular strain parameters, including left/right ventricular global radial strain (LV-/RVGRS), left/right ventricular global circumferential strain (LV-/RVGCS), and left/right ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-/RVGLS) were evaluated and compared among the three groups. Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the independent effect of LV dilatation on biventricular strains in DM patients with reduced LVEF.

Results

Significant differences were observed in both left and right ventricular strain parameters among the three groups. For left ventricular function, LV global strains progressively declined from the DMpEF group to the DMrEF-NLVD group and further to the DMrEF-DCM group (all p < 0.001). For right ventricular function, RV global strains were significantly more impaired in the DMrEF-DCM group and the DMrEF-NLVD group compared with the DMpEF group (all p < 0.05). The DMrEF-DCM group had decreased RVGCS (− 6.18 ± 3.52 vs. − 8.89 ± 4.15, p < 0.001) compared with the DMrEF-NLVD group. In DM patients with reduced LVEF, multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that LV dilatation was independently associated with reduced LVGCS (β = 0.176, p = 0.009).

Conclusions

In DM patients with reduced LVEF, LV dilatation was associated with biventricular dysfunction and deformation injury. LV dilatation was found to be independently associated with impaired LVGCS, the further decrease of LVGCS in DM patients with reduced LVEF.

### The chromatin regulator ankrd11 controls cardiac neural crest cell-mediated outflow tract remodeling and heart function [^111Em9mJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that Ankd11, a chromatin regulator and a causative gene for KBG syndrome, is a critical regulator of cardiac neural crest cell biology during embryonic heart development. Ablation of Ankrd11 in the murine neural crest leads to dysregulation of CNCC organization and intracellular signaling, leading to aberrant OFT development and heart function.

We show that conditional knockout of Ankrd11 in the neural crest leads to a failure of AP septation by CNCCs, creating a cardiac defect termed persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) and an associated VSD. We also observed ventricular dilation without changes in wall thickness and decreased ventricular contractility. Ventricular dilation occurring without changes in wall thickness is indicative of eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, a compensatory mechanism to the dysfunctional ejection of blood from the ventricles, and consequent volume overload –. Ventricular dilation is associated with PTA in patients and animal models –. This can be observed as early as the fetal period due to truncal valve insufficiency, which causes volume overload through blood leakage from the truncal artery into the ventricles. Since we also observed truncal valve dysplasia in Ankrd11 ncko hearts, this may indicate impaired valve function. Notably, our results also show greater right ventricle dilation compared to the left ventricle. We postulate that this may be caused by the right ventricular origin of the truncal artery, which may force the right ventricle to be disproportionately impacted by the volume overload from a regurgitant truncal valve. Therefore, our results suggest that the ventricular dilation in Ankrd11 ncko embryos is a compensatory mechanism at least in part due to PTA.

### Association of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with subsequent change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume: the Dallas heart study [^115fBN4P]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the conventional paradigm of the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy, a thick-walled left ventricle (LV) ultimately transitions to a dilated cardiomyopathy. There are scant data in humans demonstrating whether this transition occurs commonly without an interval myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results

Participants (n = 1282) from the Dallas Heart Study underwent serial cardiac magnetic resonance ≈7 years apart. Those with interval cardiovascular events and a dilated LV (increased LV end-diastolic volume [EDV] indexed to body surface area) at baseline were excluded. Multivariable linear regression models tested the association of concentric hypertrophy (increased LV mass and LV mass/volume 0.67) with change in LVEDV. The study cohort had a median age of 44 years, 57% women, 43% black, and 11% (n = 142) baseline concentric hypertrophy. The change in LVEDV in those with versus without concentric hypertrophy was 1 mL (-9 to 12) versus -2 mL (-11 to 7), respectively, P < 0.01. In multivariable linear regression models, concentric hypertrophy was associated with larger follow-up LVEDV (P ≤ 0.01). The progression to a dilated LV was uncommon (2%, n = 25).

Conclusions

In the absence of interval myocardial infarction, concentric hypertrophy was associated with a small, but significantly greater, increase in LVEDV after 7-year follow-up. However, the degree of LV enlargement was minimal, and few participants developed a dilated LV. These data suggest that if concentric hypertrophy does progress to a dilated cardiomyopathy, such a transition would occur over a much longer timeframe (eg, decades) and perhaps less common than previously thought.

### Assessment of right heart dilatation with magnetic resonance imaging and multidetector computed tomography angiography: spectrum of disease findings [^111A6Wyw]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Right heart chamber enlargement can be caused by a diverse and heterogeneous group of conditions with highly varied clinical symptoms and signs. An appreciation of the pathophysiology, causes, and imaging features of right heart enlargement is paramount in recognizing and potentially ameliorating the development of right heart dysfunction or adverse cardiac events. Chest x-ray and transthoracic echocardiography have traditionally been, and still are, the mainstay in initial evaluation of right heart dilatation; however, recent advances in both multidetector computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging now permit a comprehensive assessment of the causes and consequences of right heart dilatation.

### Right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram independently predicts mortality in pulmonary embolism [^11561Kuu]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram in acute pulmonary embolism and to distinguish if this feature predicts mortality independently of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index, an established admission severity score.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients admitted with pulmonary embolism confirmed by CT pulmonary angiogram to three teaching hospitals in East Scotland between January 2005 and July 2007. Two radiologists judged presence of right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram independently. The outcome of interest was 30 day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare this outcome in patients with right ventricular dilation compared to those without right ventricular dilation, adjusting for Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score.

Results

There were 585 patients included and 30.4% had right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram. Patients with right ventricular dilation had increased 30 day mortality rates compared to patients without right ventricular dilation (12.4% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.006). Survival analysis showed that a significantly greater proportion of deaths in the right ventricular dilation group occurred within the first 48h after admission compared to the group without right ventricular dilation (45.5% deaths vs. 9.1%; p = 0.016). On multivariable analysis, adjusting for Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score, right ventricular dilation was independently associated with increased 30 day mortality (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.54–5.75; p = 0.001).

Conclusion

Right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram is an independent predictor of 30 day mortality in acute pulmonary embolism.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^116Xbdi8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation — evaluation of right heart chambers states that the right ventricle is usually dilated in the presence of hemodynamically significant tricuspid regurgitation. The interventricular septum position produces a D-shaped left ventricle predominantly in diastole, consistent with a right ventricular volume overload pattern, whereas when tricuspid regurgitation is due to pulmonary hypertension, septal flattening is present throughout the cardiac cycle, reflecting diastolic and systolic overload of the right ventricle (a right ventricular pressure overload pattern).

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — diagnostic strategies with strong level of consensus state that timely diagnosis of PPCM should occur to prevent delay of treatment and potential related complications (Level of Evidence C). Criteria for the diagnosis of PPCM should include a history confirming the onset of HF began in the last months of pregnancy or the months after delivery, the presence of LV dysfunction, and the exclusion of other reasons for cardiomyopathy (Level of Evidence B). Cardiac imaging should be performed to assess the presence and extent of LV dysfunction, the degree of dilation, and the presence of an intracardiac thrombus at the presentation of PPCM (Level of Evidence B). PPCM patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, which should include cardiologists, high-risk obstetricians, and perinatologists, and also may include cardiac anesthesiologists, cardiac intensivists, and pediatricians (Level of Evidence C).

Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) diameter and RV wall thickness — at the level of the pulmonary valve insertion, diameter > 27 mm at end-diastole indicates RVOT dilatation, and subcostal RV wall thickness > 5 mm indicates right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and may suggest RV pressure overload in the absence of other pathologies.

### Left ventricular diameter and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death [^116LejSN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 747 subjects (418 cases and 329 controls) were studied. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics and the echocardiographic parameters of cases and controls. Cases were slightly older than controls (P = 0.06) with a greater proportion of black subjects (P ≤ 0.01). There was no significant difference in the mean body mass index, proportion of systemic hypertension, or use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. Cases were more likely to have LVEF ≤ 35% (P = 0.01) and more likely to have larger LV size compared with controls. The mean LVIDD (52.2 ± 10.5 versus 49.7 ± 7.9 mm; P < 0.01) and LVIDD adjusted for body surface area (26.6 ± 5.3 versus 25.4 ± 4.2 mm; P < 0.01) was significantly higher in cases. Mild, moderate, or severe LV dilatation was found significantly more often in cases compared with controls (Figure).

Table 1.
Demographic and Echocardiographic Characteristics of Cases and Controls

Figure 1.
Proportions of cases and controls with different categories of LV dilatation based on magnitude of dilatation. LV indicates left ventricular.

In univariate comparisons, black race, severe LV dysfunction, and LV dilatation were all significant predictors of SCD case status. The presence of either moderate or severe LV dilatation doubled the odds of SCD, whereas considering only severe LV dilatation quadrupled the odds. An EF of ≤ 35% also doubled the SCD odds. We also assessed the effect of LV dilatation within the group with EF ≤ 35%. The subgroup with low EF and normal or mildly dilated LV did not have significantly increased odds of SCD when compared with the rest of the population (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.3; P = 0.06). However, combinations of low EF with either moderate or severe LV dilatation (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 4.7; P < 0.01) or severe LV dilatation alone (OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.9 to 12.7; P < 0.01) were associated with progressively greater SCD odds (Table 2).

### Mitochondrial CaMKII causes adverse metabolic reprogramming and dilated cardiomyopathy [^113epnJC]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Mitochondrial CaMKII does not affect myocardial hypertrophy

In contrast to the dilated cardiomyopathy and near normal lifespan in mtCaMKII mice (Fig. 1l), myocardial CaMKII overexpression in the absence of subcellular targeting causes marked cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, increased myocardial cell death, cardiac fibrosis, heart failure, and premature death. The striking differences in the phenotypes of mtCaMKII, and mice with transgenic myocardial CaMKII overexpression lacking subcellular targeting appeared to confirm a specific role for mitochondrial CaMKII in dilated cardiomyopathy. However, while the Cox8a was effective in predominantly targeting CaMKII overexpression to myocardial mitochondria, we also detected small amounts of mtCaMKII in extramitochondrial compartments (Fig. 2a). To determine if extramitochondrial mtCaMKII contributed to cardiomyopathy in mtCaMKII mice, we crossed the mtCaMKII mice with mice expressing AC3-I, a CaMKII inhibitory peptide that is fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), and excluded from mitochondria (Fig. 2b). The double transgenic mice, combining mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII overexpression and extramitochondrial CaMKII inhibition, showed persistent left ventricular dysfunction (see left ventricular ejection fraction) and dilation (see left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic volumes), but loss of left ventricular hypertrophy (see heart weight/body weight), compared to the mtCaMKII mice (Fig. 2c). The partial improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction in the mtCaMKII x AC3-I interbred mice suggested that mitochondrial and extramitochondrial CaMKII each have the potential to decrease myocardial function, but the unchanged end-diastolic volumes indicate that mitochondrial CaMKII exclusively promotes dilated cardiomyopathy, and not myocardial hypertrophy. We next crossed the mtCaMKII mice with mtCaMKIIN mice. The coexpression of mtCaMKIIN reversed the dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype in the mtCaMKII mice (Fig. 2d), without reducing mtCaMKII expression (Fig. 2e, f), confirming that dilated cardiomyopathy is due to excessive mitochondrial CaMKII activity, and excluding the possibility that dilated cardiomyopathy is a non-specific consequence of mitochondrial-targeted transgenic protein overexpression. Considered together with previously published information, these data suggest that the dilated phenotype of the mtCaMKII heart is due to increased CaMKII activity in mitochondria, while myocardial hypertrophy and premature death are predominantly related to extramitochondrial actions of CaMKII.

- ▪
- Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur.
- ▪
- Thrombosis may occur. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity for those at risk for hyperviscosity. Subcutaneous Administration: Infusion site event, headache, fatigue, heart rate increased, pyrexia, abdominal pain upper, nausea, vomiting, asthma, blood pressure systolic increased, diarrhea, ear pain, aphthous stomatitis, migraine, oropharyngeal pain, and pain in extremity. MMN: Headache, chest discomfort, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, and pain in extremity. CIDP: Headache, pyrexia anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, illness, blood creatinine increased, dizziness, migraine, somnolence, tremor, nasal dryness, abdominal pain upper, vomiting, chills, nasopharyngitis, and pain in extremity. Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving GAMMAGARD LIQUID.

It is critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia that is temporally or causally related to hyperproteinemia with concomitant decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap. Treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity, and a predisposition to thromboembolic events.
4. 5. 4 Thrombosis Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID. Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors.

Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols, or monoc.

### Cardiovascular risk in relation to a new classification of hypertensive left ventricular geometric abnormalities [^113tTitM]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

In 2010, the Dallas Heart Study proposed an upgrade of the left ventricular geometric classification proposed in 1991, by using left ventricular mass combined with end diastolic volumes, and introducing the new categories of dilated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We adopted the new method to test the prognostic impact of the left ventricular geometric patterns from the new classification.

Methods

We evaluated baseline anthropometric, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters of 8848 hypertensive patients from the Campania Salute Network (53 ± 12 years, 56% male), free of prevalent cardiovascular disease, valve disease and with ejection fraction ≥ 50%. Cut points for left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (cm/m) were derived from our historical normal reference population. Composite cardiovascular end-points were cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke.

Results

Independent of confounders, eccentric dilated LVH, concentric nondilated LVH and concentric dilated LVH were associated with higher cardiovascular risk (hazard ratios between 2 and 9, all P < 0.01), mostly depending on the magnitude of LVM index. A volume load was present especially in dilated forms of LVH, the extent of which was important in the determination of harmful types of left ventricular geometry.

Conclusion

Consideration of left ventricular dilatation in the evaluation of risk related to hypertensive left ventricular geometry reveals the importance of the extent of the volume load coexisting with the typical hypertensive pressure overload. At a given normal ejection fraction, the balance between the two hemodynamic components influences the shape of left ventricular geometric adaptation, the amount of left ventricular mass and the impact on prognosis.

### Inverse shift in serum polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with adverse dilatation of the heart [^112wopae]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac dilatation is associated with impaired pump function, progression of heart failure and electrical instability. Risk of sudden death is associated with a low blood level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Objective

The hypothesis was, therefore, addressed that left ventricular dilatation as assessed by echocardiography is associated with a reduced serum polyunsaturated fatty acid level.

Methods

Fatty acids were determined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in serum of 308 patients with dilative heart failure unrelated to myocardial infarction (age 48 (SD12) years, NYHA class 2.2 (0.6), ejection fraction 31% (10%)).

Results

The extent of left ventricular dilatation as assessed by left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was associated with a reduction of both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (1.0% (0.5%) vs 1.3% (0.6%), p < 0.001) and the n-6 arachidonic acid (4.6% (1.8%) vs 5.2% (1.9%), p < 0.01) were reduced in patients with left ventricular dilatation (end-diastolic diameter, 68–90 mm, upper tertile vs 48–61 mm, lower tertile). By contrast, monounsaturated fatty acids were increased (the n-9 oleic acid 26.1% (4.8%) vs 23.9% (4.8%), p < 0.01). A low docosahexaenoic acid (0.01–0.9%, lower tertile vs 1.4–3.1%, upper tertile) was associated with greater left ventricular dilatation (end-diastolic diameter, 67 (8) vs 63 (7) mm, p < 0.001). The cut-off for the absence of severe dilatation (end-diastolic diameter > 70 mm) was set at > 1.24% docosahexaenoic acid. In our sample, the negative-predictive value for severe dilatation was 91% and sensitivity was 84%.

Conclusions

Docosahexaenoic acid provides a new sensitive biomarker for monitoring and detecting severe left ventricular dilatation in heart failure patients.

### Single ventricular torsional mechanics after fontan palliation and their impact on outcomes [^1164XRqQ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Impaired ventricular function, ventricular dilation, and RV morphology are established risk factors for poor clinical outcomes in patients with a Fontan circulation. This study reaffirmed these associations, but also demonstrated a higher prevalence of torsion abnormalities in the death/transplant group. Interestingly, younger age at CMR was associated with death/transplantation. This may be due to a combination of factors, including a referral bias for sicker children and the younger age of the RV group in this study. Multivariable analysis showed that the relationship between adverse outcomes and torsion was not independent of ventricular morphology when analyzed for the whole cohort. On stratified survival analysis, LVs with abnormal torsion and RVs, regardless of torsional pattern, had worse outcomes compared to LVs with normal torsion. This suggests that while ventricular dominance is a valuable predictor of outcomes, torsion may have additive value in risk stratifying Fontan patients with LV morphology.

Torsion abnormalities correlated with conventional ventricular measures such as ventricular volumes and EF. Similar associations have been shown in LVs in biventricular hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy; in particular, forfeiture of apical counterclockwise rotation. This is thought to result from the loss of oblique myofibril architecture, possibly due to dilation, leading to a closer resemblance to the transverse fibers of the basal portion of the LV. Perturbation from the normal gradual shift from basal clockwise rotation to apical counterclockwise rotation is reflected in lower torsional concordance and torsional gradient parameters estimated in this study. These findings suggest significant disruption of myofiber arrangement in Fontan hearts, even in those with LV morphology. Substantial but incomplete remodeling occurs after Fontan palliation, with increasing risk for ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, dilation, and dysfunction over time. Although, torsion is associated with the adverse outcome, its relationship to the outcome is not independent of ventricular dilation which remains the strongest predictor. Failure of the ventricular pump in the Fontan circulation is likely multifactorial including effects of AVVR, aortopulmonary collateral flow, myocardial scarring, electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony, and disruption of the normal torsional contraction pattern. Faster rate of ventricular dilation is associated with worse outcomes and future studies may focus on understanding the mechanisms that lead to progressive dilation and eventual dysfunction and poor clinical outcomes.

### Initial right ventricular dysfunction severity identifies severe peripartum cardiomyopathy phenotype with worse early and overall outcomes: a 24-year cohort study [^1127s7zU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, 1, 2 with an increasing incidence during the past 25 years from 1:4350 to 1:1000 live births. 1, 3 Characterized by the development of marked left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and heart failure (HF) during the final month of pregnancy or the first 5 postpartum months, PPCM is generally considered an idiopathic form of cardiomyopathy. Outcomes in PPCM are strikingly heterogeneous. As many as 37% to 62% of patients with PPCM with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% at diagnosis recover cardiac function within 1 year. 4, 5, 6 LV functional recovery in PPCM usually occurs within 6 months, but some cases of recovery occur up to 5 years later. 7, 8, 9 Those who do not recover can progress to advanced HF, requiring heart replacement therapy. PPCM accounts for 5% of all women who undergo cardiac transplantation and 8% who undergo mechanical circulatory support device implantation in the United States. 10, 11 Despite the potential for late adverse outcomes, prior PPCM studies have largely focused on in‐hospital outcomes 2, 12, 13 or those within the first year of diagnosis. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 Severe LV systolic dysfunction and LV dilatation have long been identified as major physiologic risk factors for adverse outcomes in PPCM. 4, 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Right ventricular (RV) systolic function at presentation was recently identified as a strong independent predictor of LV recovery and clinical events at 1 year. 15

Given the heterogeneity of PPCM outcomes, particularly with regard to time to event, we hypothesized that the severity of RV dysfunction (RVD) at diagnosis may identify a severe phenotype of PPCM. Therefore, we conducted a single‐center retrospective cohort study to determine whether RVD severity is differentially associated with adverse outcomes and time to adverse outcome. Understanding how RV and LV dysfunction may interact to affect adverse outcomes would help clinicians identify those most in need of aggressive initial medical management with earlier consideration of advanced therapies versus those who might benefit from longer‐term follow‐up.

### Disproportionate left ventricular enlargement in mitral valve prolapse: prevalence, predictors, and association with outcomes [^115nhXv6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of Less‐Than‐Severe

Patients with MVP and less‐than‐severe DMR represent a clinical challenge. It has been named "progressive" and deemed as not warranting surgical indications or treatment in either US or European guidelines, without mention of any exception. This "observational" management reflects a general concept that mild or moderate DMR is benign. This "uniformly benign" concept has been challenged by recent data. First, in a prospective cohort with DMR, we observed that moderate quantified DMR was associated with excess mortality and cardiovascular events. This observation was confirmed in a large routine‐practice cohort of isolated MVP. Thus, recent data on DMR outcome do not confirm the "uniformly benign" nature of less‐than‐severe DMR and thus warrant extending our focus beyond severe DMR by assessing markers of outcomes throughout the spectrum of MVP and DMR. For example, severe ventricular arrhythmias are associated with excess mortality independent of DMR severity, with consensus statements suggesting therapeutic interventions even in less‐than‐severe DMR. Similarly, excess LA enlargement, LA dysfunction, or neurohormonal activation, are important predictors of excess mortality, not confined to severe DMR but also affecting less‐than‐severe DMR. Similarly, the present study is the first to show that patients with disproportionate LV remodeling and less‐than‐severe DMR display excess mortality versus patients with similar DMR severity without disproportionate LV remodeling. This risk is observed even after adjustment for all possible confounders and in all subgroups, and even accounting for EF reduction logically associated with ES LV alterations. Of note, although disproportionate LV remodeling is associated with excess mortality in mild as well as moderate MR, it is clear that valve surgery should not be advocated in patients with mild MR and disproportionate LV remodeling because the basis for the cardiomyopathy/LV systolic dysfunction and dilatation in these patients is not volume overload and thus would not be expected to improve after mitral valve repair.

Thus, disproportionate LV remodeling, already a proven marker of poor outcomes in severe DMR, is now proven to be associated with worse outcomes throughout the spectrum of DMR severity. The crucial question is whether therapeutic interventions can be indicated based on such observations. In that regard, the fact that in the current study, early mitral surgery in patients with moderate DMR and disproportionate LV remodeling was associated with improved survival generates the hypothesis that such treatment may be beneficial and should be evaluated in appropriate randomized clinical trials. Patients with only mild DMR may alternatively be considered for therapies that are effective to induce reverse LV remodeling.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) medical therapy duration and follow-up — The duration of standard HF treatments should be indefinite when ventricular function fails to normalize, although medications are sometimes discontinued after 12 months of treatment despite this being very controversial and not supported by trial data, and close clinical follow-up with an annual assessment of LVEF should be performed for a minimum of several years after recovery, particularly if subsequent pregnancy is being considered.

Echocardiographic Information

Echocardiograms for both cases and controls were obtained from existing hospital records. Echocardiograms performed prior (but unrelated) to the SCD event were used; if > 1 echocardiogram was available, the test closest to the SCD event was used. The LVEF and LV internal dimension in diastole (LVIDD), in millimeters were obtained from the same echocardiogram. EF was calculated using Simpson's method, and the LVIDD was obtained using the standard M mode. LV size index was calculated as the LVIDD normalized for body surface area. Severe LV dysfunction was defined as EF ≤ 35%. The American Society of Echocardiography criteria were used to categorize subjects based on LVIDD. These criteria classify the LV size as normal (men: 42 to 59 mm; women: 39 to 53 mm), mildly dilated (men: 60 to 63 mm; women: 54 to 57 mm), moderately dilated (men: 64 to 68 mm; women: 58 to 61 mm), or severely dilated (men: ≥ 69 mm; women: ≥ 62 mm).

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were compared using t tests, and categorical variables were compared using chi‐square tests. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for association of SCD with LV dilatation and severe LV dysfunction. In addition, dummy variables were created for combination of severe LV dysfunction with different categories of LV size. Odds of SCD associated with these combinations (compared with the rest of the population) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to derive adjusted ORs for SCD associated with severe LV dilatation. Additional models were used to estimate odds for SCD associated with low EF only and presence of both low EF and severe LV dilatation (using a dummy variable) after adjusting for the other covariates considered in the first model. A P value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corporation).

### Right ventricular dysfunction and its association with mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117PgLmZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether right ventricular dilation or systolic impairment is associated with mortality and/or disease severity in invasively ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Single-center U.K. ICU.

Patients

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation that received a transthoracic echocardiogram between March and December 2020.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Right ventricular dilation was defined as right ventricular:left ventricular end-diastolic area greater than 0.6, right ventricular systolic impairment as fractional area change less than 35%, or tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion less than 17mm. One hundred seventy-two patients were included, 59 years old (interquartile range, 49–67), with mostly moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 101; 59%). Ninety-day mortality was 41% (n = 70): 49% in patients with right ventricular dilation, 53% in right ventricular systolic impairment, and 72% in right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment. The right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment phenotype was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.15–7.60]), but either disease state alone was not. Right ventricular fractional area change correlated with Pao2:Fio2 ratio, Paco2, chest radiograph opacification, and dynamic compliance, whereas right ventricular:left ventricle end-diastolic area correlated negatively with urine output.

Conclusions

Right ventricular systolic impairment correlated with pulmonary pathophysiology, whereas right ventricular dilation correlated with renal dysfunction. Right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment was the only right ventricular phenotype that was independently associated with mortality.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^1112EzkW]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular remodeling in pulmonic regurgitation describes that significant primary PR enlarges the right ventricle with preserved function and a volume overload septal pattern, chronic severe PR may impair RV function, RV dilation alone is nonspecific and should be correlated with PR severity by Doppler, dilation may localize to the RVOT after tetralogy repair, and in secondary PR RV changes reflect underlying disease with PR usually at most moderate. Supporting lines include "Significant primary PR leads to an enlargement of the RV with preserved RV function and a volume overload pattern of the septum. Chronic severe PR may lead to RV dysfunction", and "However, RV dilation by itself is not a specific sign of significant PR since it can result from a number of conditions, so it is important to correlate RV dilation with the severity of PR by Doppler. Dilation may also be localized to the RVOT as can be seen after a tetralogy repair", plus "In secondary PR, RV dilation and function as well as septal motion relate more to the underlying disease state (e.g., pulmonary hypertension severity) than to the degree of PR, which is usually at most moderate".

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1179Af1T]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary valve (PV) insufficiency — surgical indications state that surgery for pulmonary regurgitation (PR) is considered when symptoms or signs of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) have occurred and PR is severe, and surgery is generally recommended for asymptomatic severe PR in the setting of severe right ventricular (RV) dilation or dysfunction (cardiac MRI–derived RV end-diastolic volume index > 150 mL/m², RV end-systolic volume index > 80 mL/m², RVEF < 47%) or symptomatic atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; current guidelines support surgery for severe PR with moderate to severe RVD (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), moderate to severe RV enlargement (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), symptomatic or sustained atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C), or moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Different substrates of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in post-infarction patients with and without left ventricular dilatation [^1112bhUY]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the relationship between nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and left ventricular (LV) dilatation, function, remodeling, and scar tissue extent in patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Methods and Results

Eighty-two patients (ages 64 ± 10 years) with first previous MI were referred for 24-hour electrocardiogram recording and cine and delayed enhancement (DE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). LV volumes, ejection fraction, systolic wall thickening, sphericity index, and core and peri-infarctual areas of scar tissue by CMR were evaluated. LV dilatation was observed in 39 patients. Episodes of NSVT were recorded in 32 patients: 23 with LV dilatation and 9 without. In the entire population, NSVT was related to ejection fraction, LV volumes, LV mass, and sphericity index; end-systolic volume (P = 0.001) resulted in the only independent predictor at multivariate analysis. In patients without LV dilatation, the occurrence of NSVT was only positively related with percentage of contracting segments with DE (P = 0.008). Conversely, in patients with LV dilatation, increase in LV mass (P = 0.020) and end-systolic volume (P = 0.038) were independent predictors of NSVT.

Conclusions

Necrotic and viable myocardium coexistence within the same wall segments predicted occurrence of NSVT in patients without LV dilatation, whereas LV mass and end-systolic volume were predictors of NSVT in those with LV dilatation.

### Altered right ventricular papillary muscle position and orientation in patients with a dilated left ventricle [^116L4jo2]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the impact of left ventricular dilatation on right ventricular papillary muscle displacement.

Methods

Thirteen patients underwent high-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at Emory University Hospital: Seven patients with congestive heart failure and a dilated left ventricle composed the dilated left ventricular group, and 6 normal subjects were used as a control. A total of 120 cardiac magnetic resonance imaging slices were acquired in a short-axis view at end diastole for each subject. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging slices were used to identify the papillary muscle tip position in 3-dimensional coordinates for the septal, posterior, and anterior papillary muscles. The centroid of the papillary muscle coordinates was used as the reference point for comparison between subjects. The relative orientation between the right ventricular papillary muscles was evaluated and compared between the dilated left ventricular group and normal subjects.

Results

Dilatation of the left ventricle resulted in a significant (P = 0.05) displacement of the septal right ventricular papillary muscle toward the centroid: normal group, 0.0285 ± 0.036 mm/mm versus dilated left ventricular group, 0.1437 ± 0.026 mm/mm. More specifically, the septal papillary muscle significantly (P = 0.03) moved away from the septal wall (normal group: 0.61 ± 0.09 mm/mm, dilated left ventricular group: 0.379 ± 0.037 mm/mm). Specific locations of all 3 right ventricular papillary muscles were reported for normal subjects and patients with a dilated left ventricle.

Conclusions

Patients with a dilated left ventricle have significantly increased displacement of the septal right ventricular papillary muscle away from the septum when compared with normal controls. This demonstrates pathophysiologic contribution of the left ventricle to specific papillary muscle alterations within the right ventricle.

### Initial right ventricular dysfunction severity identifies severe peripartum cardiomyopathy phenotype with worse early and overall outcomes: a 24-year cohort study [^116rnV3C]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Moderate‐to‐severe RV dysfunction at time of PPCM diagnosis is strongly and independently associated with adverse outcomes, especially within the first year of diagnosis. These subjects had an overall more severe cardiomyopathy phenotype marked with more dilated and dysfunctional LVs, worse atrioventricular valvular regurgitation, and higher biventricular filling pressures. Our findings highlight the importance of initial RV functional assessment in PPCM as moderate‐to‐severe RVD signals a more advanced cardiomyopathy phenotype with an increased adverse event rate and accelerated clinical decline. Recognizing these patients promptly may lead to early referral for advanced HF therapies.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^115hfUV5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Acuity of echocardiography findings and communication — critical findings "represent a threat to life and require immediate clinical action" and "A direct verbal notification to the ordering provider or clinician immediately after the finding is identified is recommended (communication in minutes)", with examples including "Suspected cardiac tamponade", "Suspected aortic dissection or acute aortic syndrome", "Thrombus in transit", and "Severe valve obstruction/stenosis in prosthetic or native valves, especially if acute or new". Urgent findings "may require clinical action in the short term" with "Direct personal notification… (communication in hours)", examples including "New large pericardial effusion without tamponade", "New severe left or right ventricular dysfunction", "Orthotopic heart transplant with signs of acute rejection, including newly depressed LVEF", "New LV outflow tract obstruction (pre-Valsalva resting gradient > 30 mm Hg)", and "High-risk findings on a stress echocardiogram". Significant findings "may warrant consultation and additional or follow-up testing", such as "Significant reduction in the LV systolic or diastolic function" and "Significant aortic dilatation". The reporting physician "should consider the indication, patient history, acuity of a finding, and exert clinical judgment when determining the urgency and method for communication of these findings".

### Recommendations on the use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in young adult competitive athletes: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography and the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^1143MqCv]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Right ventricular adaptations in endurance-trained competitive athletes — prevalence and diagnostic caution: In an echocardiographic study of 102 amateur competitive athletes, right ventricular (RV) chamber dimensions were larger than "normal" in over one-half of athletes and 28% had an RV outflow tract dimension meeting proposed major size criteria for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy; in a similar Italian cohort, 15.6% exceeded a basal RV dimension of 40 mm. Cardiac magnetic resonance has similarly demonstrated that RV enlargement is common among endurance athletes, and differentiating exercise-induced RV changes from the diagnosis of ARVC is one of the most important clinical challenges for imagers. In endurance-trained competitive athletes, RV dilation should be associated with concomitant LV remodeling (dilation), and isolated RV enlargement should raise suspicion of a pathologic process.

### Effect of preoperative volume overload on left ventricular function recovery after ventricular septal defect repair [^111c1kQp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significant left-to-right shunt across a ventricular septal defect (VSD) may lead to left ventricle (LV) volume overload and dilation. The acute loss of LV preload after repair of VSD may contribute to postoperative LV systolic dysfunction. The primary aim of the study is to assess the effect of presence of preoperative LV dilation on LV systolic function recovery after VSD repair. We evaluated the LV systolic function by measuring LV longitudinal strain and ejection fraction (EF) before surgery (time point 1) and at 5 time points after VSD repair (time point 2: 0 to 2 weeks, time point 3: 2 to 6 weeks, time point 4: 6 weeks to 4 months, time point 5: 4 to 12 months, and time point 6: > 12 months). A total of 120 patients were included in the study cohort. A total of 84 patients (70%) had LV dilation (group 1) and 36 patients (30%) had normal LV size on preoperative echocardiogram (group 2). Median age (interquartile range 25% to 75%) at surgery was 5.5 months (4 to 10) and 7 months (5 to 44.5) in groups 1 and 2 respectively (p = 0.03). Mean LV EF and strain were not significantly different among the 2 groups at time point 1. At time point 2, both mean EF and strain were significantly lower in group 1 compared with group 2 (p < 0.05). At time point 3, mean EF was not significantly different among the two groups, while mean LV strain was significantly lower in group 1 (p = 0.044). At time points 4, 5 and 6, mean EF and strain were not significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, presence of preoperative LV dilation is associated with a more pronounced LV systolic dysfunction in the early postoperative period only. The LV systolic function recovers back to the baseline after the first year following the repair. These are very reassuring prognostic findings.

### The relationship between left ventricular deformation and different geometric patterns according to the updated classification: findings from the hypertensive population [^117UYpxG]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to investigate left ventricular mechanics in hypertensive patients with different geometric patterns by using two-dimensional (2DE) and three-dimensional (3DE) strain analysis.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included 197 hypertensive individuals who underwent a complete 2DE and 3DE examination. We applied the new updated criteria of left ventricular geometry that considered left ventricular mass index, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and relative wall thickness. According to this classification the individuals were divided into six groups: normal geometry, concentric remodelling, eccentric nondilated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), concentric LVH, dilated LVH and concentric-dilated LVH.

Results

Multidirectional 2DE and 3DE left ventricular strain decreased from the hypertensive patients with normal geometry, across the individuals with left ventricular concentric remodelling, eccentric nondilated LVH, to the patients with concentric LVH and dilated LVH patterns. The reduction of left ventricular systolic and early diastolic strain rates was noticed to be heading in the same direction, as well as the elevation of late diastolic strain rates. Left ventricular twist and torsion were increased in the participants with concentric and dilated LVH patterns. Reduced 2DE and 3DE strains were associated with concentric and dilated LVH patterns independent of demographic and clinical parameters.

Conclusion

Left ventricular deformation in hypertensive patients is significantly impacted by left ventricular geometry. Concentric and dilated LVH patterns have the greatest unfavourable effect on 2DE and 3DE left ventricular mechanics. The updated classification of left ventricular geometry provides valuable and comprehensive information about left ventricular mechanical deformation and function in hypertensive population.

### No additive effect of passive containment surgery in patients with aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilation [^114YzefF]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

After valve replacement in patients with aortic regurgitation short-term and long-term improvement of left ventricular function are related to early reduction of left ventricular dilatation. This case-control study was conducted to investigate the potential beneficial effects by concomitant application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac Support Device (Acorn Cardiovascular Inc, St. Paul, MN) on reduction of ventricular dilatation in patients with aortic regurgitation and advanced ventricular dilatation undergoing aortic valve replacement.

Methods

Of ten patients with longstanding aortic regurgitation and ventricular dilatation subjected to aortic valve replacement using mechanical valve prostheses, five were in addition subjected to application of the Cardiac Support Device (Acorn). Cardiac function and dimensions were measured by echocardiography preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively.

Results

After aortic valve replacement, there was a rapid and sustained decrease in end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (before operation 72 ± 4 and 54 ± 8 mm, to 54 ± 10 and 40 + 11 mm at 3 months; and 53 ± 9 and 35 ± 6 mm, 12 months after operation). This did not differ after Cardiac Support Device (Acorn) application (before operation 74 ± 1 and 56 ± 5 mm; 52 ± 8 and 39 ± 9 mm, 3 months after operation; and 54 ± 6 and 39 ± 8 mm, at 12 months). The left ventricular ejection fraction remained unchanged in both groups.

Conclusions

Application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac Support Device in patients with aortic regurgitation and severe ventricular dilatation does not influence reverse remodeling or cardiac function compared with aortic valve replacement alone.

### Discoveries in peripartum cardiomyopathy [^116Wgvve]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen remarkable gains for outcomes in peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in the USA and many other countries, including the high-incidence areas of Haiti and South Africa. This review article emphasizes the importance of continuing the process of increasing awareness of PPCM and presents details of this evolving picture, including important discoveries that point the way to full recovery for almost all PPCM subjects. In addition, new interventions will be highlighted, which may facilitate recovery. Numerous studies have demonstrated that when the diagnosis of PPCM is made with LVEF > 0.30, the probability is that recovery to LVEF ≥ 0.50 will occur in the overwhelming majority of subjects. PPCM patients diagnosed with severely depressed systolic function (LVEF < 0.30) and a remodeled left ventricle with greater dilatation (LVEDd ≥ 60mm) are least likely to reach the outcome recovery goals. These are the patients with the greatest need for newer interventional strategies.

### Controlled right ventricular pressure overload can rescue left ventricular dysfunction by promoting biventricular adaptive hypertrophy [^1158Aq4i]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

We hypothesized that early controlled RV pressure overload created by PAB provides a therapeutic benefit by inducing immediate positive ventricular-ventricular hemodynamic interactions (reduction of LV dilatation) and through recruitment of healthy remote myocardium to sustain global ventricular contractility. Importantly, we were able to confirm the presence of established LV dysfunction and dilatation between the interval of LAD ligation and PAB treatment, emulating the clinical scenario. Delayed but early treatment of myocardial injury with PAB as implemented in this study recreates the clinical setting in which PAB can be most effective in achieving LV rehabilitation. Clinical series with higher recovery rates after PAB reflect the efficacy of early surgical treatment (few days-weeks after LV failure diagnosis).

PAB constrains LV dilatation and improves LV systolic and diastolic function

Increasing RV pressure through PAB induces a leftward shift of the interventricular septum and reduces LV end-diastolic dimensions, interrupting the progression of LV eccentric dilatation which was otherwise observed in untreated LAD animals. The favorable reshaping of LV geometry may have promoted the acute improvement in LV systolic function observed in LAD + PAB animals. Similar findings have been documented in patients, where an 11% to 27% increase in LV ejection fraction can be expected in PAB responders. Children with DCM can develop abnormal septal and LV apical motion, which is associated with electromechanical dyssynchrony and LV systolic dysfunction. By restoring a more linear interventricular septum, controlled RV pressure overload can counteract this phenomenon. In addition, PAB may optimize LV preload by reducing left atrial volume overload (by partially restricting RV output), which translates into improved LV diastolic function and systo-diastolic performance, as previously described. The delicate interventricular hemodynamic balance required to optimally achieve LV rehabilitation with RV pressure overload can be modulated in clinical practice by partial de-banding.

Echocardiography revealed that PAB induced a hypertrophic response into the LV posterior wall, which was evident in all animals undergoing RV pressure overload (independently from previous LV injury). We suggest that PAB-mediated prohypertrophic signaling is a paracrine effect that is not ventricular-specific and results in a positive LV adaptive response, which becomes manifest in the presence of LV dysfunction. The source of the beneficial signaling could, at least in part, be due to secreted biomolecules (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, or other) or cell-cell interactions with infiltrating macrophages (see below).
