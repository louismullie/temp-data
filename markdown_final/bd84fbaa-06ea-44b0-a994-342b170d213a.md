## Question

what complication are seen with TMS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what complications are seen with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall safety profile across large randomized datasets. Then, I should verify the common non-serious adverse events and their comparative rates versus sham. Next, I will examine serious adverse events, especially seizures, and the protocol or patient factors that modify that risk. After that, I should review population-specific considerations in children, psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, and neurologic cohorts such as epilepsy and TBI. Finally, I need to outline practical mitigation strategies and close with a balanced, clinically grounded risk summary.

> Let me first confirm the broad safety signal from high-quality evidence in depression, where most safety data exist. Large randomized controlled trial meta-analyses in major depressive disorder show no excess drop-outs due to adverse events or serious adverse events with active TMS compared to sham, supporting that TMS is generally safe and well tolerated when delivered per protocol, with low discontinuation rates and no signal for deaths or cognitive harm in programmatic datasets exceeding 10,000 sessions [^1165eYCw] [^111YpUEF].

> Wait, let me verify the common, non-serious adverse events and quantify them against sham conditions. Headache, scalp pain at the stimulation site, and local discomfort are the most frequent and are more common with active TMS than sham; pooled randomized evidence in unipolar depression reports headaches in roughly 22.6% versus 16.2%, stimulation-site pain around 23.8% versus 5.2%, and general discomfort about 10.9% versus 5.0%, typically mild, self-limited, and responding to simple analgesics or accommodation over sessions [^1165eYCw]. I should also confirm other tolerability features: accelerated TMS series report fatigue around 8.6%, with overall side-effect rates similar to once-daily schedules, and routine audiometry in longitudinal programs shows no change in auditory thresholds despite the coil click, supporting standard hearing protection as a precaution rather than a corrective need [^112LHGTR] [^111YpUEF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about serious events before checking seizure data carefully across modalities and populations. The most critical but rare complication is a provoked seizure; in accelerated protocols, one seizure in 43,873 sessions yields a session-level risk around 0.0023%, while pediatric repetitive TMS in CNS-disordered youth shows approximately 0.14% per session in pooled reports, and large standard MDD development programs reported no seizures across more than 10,000 sessions, indicating that risk is highly contingent on protocol and population context [^112LHGTR] [^111wLmec] [^111YpUEF].

> I need to check which protocol and clinical factors heighten seizure risk so clinicians can mitigate them. Reported seizures in schizophrenia cohorts clustered with 20 Hz stimulation delivered at or above motor threshold, sometimes with H-coils for deep TMS, and occasionally in the setting of concomitant clozapine; broader reviews emphasize additional modifiable risks such as sleep deprivation and concurrent agents that lower seizure threshold, underscoring the importance of parameter selection, medication reconciliation, and state-dependent screening before stimulation [^112ipft3] [^114pnsyz].

> Let me consider pediatric and adolescent populations next, given potentially distinct autonomic responses. In children and adolescents, adverse event rates with theta-burst stimulation appear higher than with conventional rTMS, roughly 9.8–10.1% in healthy and CNS-disordered youth, and there are case reports of neurocardiogenic syncope in teenagers that can be mitigated by hydration and supine positioning; nevertheless, broader pediatric syntheses conclude that overall risk resembles adults when best practices are followed, and most children rate TMS as acceptable or even enjoyable, which aligns with real-world tolerability [^111wLmec] [^114A3WeF] [^1147NRNF].

> Next, I should review psychiatric populations beyond depression, especially schizophrenia where regulators have voiced concerns. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis in schizophrenia find higher rates of benign events such as headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea with active rTMS versus sham, but no difference in seizures between active and sham arms and no evidence of worsening psychosis or mood, supporting that rTMS is safe and well tolerated in this group when standard precautions are applied; clozapine use warrants added caution due to seizure threshold effects but does not preclude treatment in stable patients [^112ipft3]. For major depression cohorts, the absence of an excess serious adverse event signal and stable acceptability further corroborate psychiatric safety in routine practice [^1165eYCw].

> I will now examine neurologic populations where baseline seizure risk and structural lesions can complicate safety judgments. In epilepsy, evidence remains limited and heterogeneous, but updated systematic reviews and controlled trials suggest low-frequency inhibitory protocols can be delivered with careful screening and risk-benefit assessment, while pediatric rTMS series in epilepsy report very low adverse event rates with small samples; for TBI, small randomized and pilot studies find rTMS to be safe and well tolerated without observed seizures, and in disorders of consciousness, expert reviews emphasize pre-treatment screening for subclinical epileptiform activity and prudent parameter choices to minimize risk [^1116RQRS] [^111wLmec] [^117SW6zM] [^117VoQEd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should separate device and pattern nuances because they influence both efficacy and risk. Deep TMS with H-coils reaches broader volumes and has featured in isolated seizure reports under high-frequency conditions, warranting conservative dosing and vigilance, whereas H1-coil studies in bipolar depression show cognitive safety with no decrement and even practice-related improvements; theta-burst stimulation markedly reduces session time, with accumulating data indicating overall tolerability similar to conventional rTMS, though pediatric TBS may carry higher minor adverse event rates, so extra caution is reasonable in youth [^112ipft3] [^114ZKXas] [^115CAUn2] [^111wLmec].

> I should confirm practical mitigation steps that translate this risk knowledge into bedside safety. Pre-session screening for implants and structural lesions, review of pro-convulsant medications and recent sleep deprivation, use of ear protection, careful motor-threshold titration and avoidance of high-frequency trains at or above threshold in high-risk settings, hydration and supine positioning for adolescents prone to vasovagal events, and clear policies around intoxication or acute withdrawal in patients with substance use all reduce complication risk and improve tolerability profiles in routine care [^117VoQEd] [^114A3WeF] [^112LHGTR] [^114HHsMF].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance to ensure I am not underestimating rare events. Across randomized trials and large clinical programs, TMS demonstrates a favorable safety margin with predominantly mild, transient, and manageable side effects, and seizures remain rare when evidence-based parameters are observed; population- and protocol-specific risks can be mitigated by conservative dosing, tailored screening, and situational precautions, supporting the conclusion that TMS is a safe, noninvasive neuromodulation option across diverse indications with appropriate safeguards [^1165eYCw] [^111YpUEF] [^112LHGTR] [^112ipft3].

TMS is **generally safe** [^1165eYCw], but clinicians should be aware of rare serious events and common mild effects. The most serious risk is **seizure** [^1178eMZ1], with an incidence of about 0.1% per patient and 0.02% per session, higher in those with epilepsy, brain lesions, or on medications that lower seizure threshold [^114HHsMF] [^113KZQvd]. The most frequent side effects are **headache and scalp discomfort** (10–30%) [^1165eYCw], usually mild and transient [^111YpUEF]. Other complications include dizziness, syncope, facial twitching, nausea [^113KZQvd], and rare hearing changes [^111YpUEF]; cognitive effects are minimal [^114ZKXas], and mood or anxiety changes are uncommon. Serious adverse events are rare, and TMS is generally well tolerated across populations, including schizophrenia [^113KZQvd] and pediatric groups [^111wLmec] [^113ShWZK].

### Safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in children: A systematic review of the literature [^111wLmec]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Data and best practice recommendations for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) use in adults are largely available. Although there are fewer data in pediatric populations and no published guidelines, its practice in children continues to grow.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature search through PubMed to review all TMS studies from 1985 to 2016 involving children and documented any adverse events. Crude risks were calculated per session.

- **Results**: Following data screening, we identified 42 single-pulse and/or paired-pulse TMS studies involving 639 healthy children, 482 children with central nervous system disorders, and 84 children with epilepsy. Adverse events occurred at rates of 3.42%, 5.97%, and 4.55% respective to population and number of sessions. We also report 23 repetitive TMS studies involving 230 central nervous system and 24 children with epilepsy with adverse event rates of 3.78% and 0.0%, respectively. We finally identified three theta-burst stimulation studies involving 90 healthy children, 40 children with central nervous system disorders, and no epileptic children, with adverse event rates of 9.78% and 10.11%, respectively. Three seizures were found to have occurred in central nervous system disorder individuals during repetitive TMS, with a risk of 0.14% per session. There was no significant difference in frequency of adverse events by group (P = 0.988) or modality (P = 0.928).

- **Conclusions**: Available data suggest that risk from TMS/theta-burst stimulation in children is similar to adults. We recommend that TMS users in this population follow best practices to ensure safety and efficacy.

### Safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in unipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^1165eYCw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). High credibility.

To study the safety and patients' tolerance of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the major depressive disorder population. Our study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched the literature published before April 30th, 2021 and performed random-effects meta-analyses which included drop-out due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and other non-serious adverse events as primary and secondary outcomes.

A total of 53 randomized sham-controlled trials with 3,273 participants were included. There was no increased risk of drop-out due to an adverse event (active TMS intervention group = 3.3%, sham TMS intervention group = 2.3%, odds ratio = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.78–2.16, P = 0.31) or a serious adverse event (active TMS intervention group = 0.9%, sham TMS intervention group = 1.5%, odds ratio = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.29–1.55, P = 0.35).

- **Findings**: Our findings suggest that TMS intervention may significantly increase the risk of non-serious adverse events including:
	- **Headaches**: Active TMS intervention group = 22.6%, sham TMS intervention group = 16.2%, odds ratio = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.15–1.91, P = 0.002.
	- **Discomfort**: Active TMS intervention group = 10.9%, sham TMS intervention group = 5.0%, odds ratio = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.22–3.21, P = 0.006.
	- **Pain at the stimulation site**: Active TMS intervention group = 23.8%, sham TMS intervention group = 5.2%, odds ratio = 8.09, 95% CI = 4.71–13.90, P < 0.001.

These non-serious events were mostly mild and transient after TMS treatment.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KZQvd]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis: Prevalence of Side Effects

After extracting the adverse effects reported in each study, we calculated the prevalence of each reported side effect across all included studies. We calculated the prevalence of each adverse effect for active rTMS treatment and for sham rTMS, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. The prevalence of headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea were significantly higher in active rTMS compared to sham (P < 0.05). The calculated prevalence of each other adverse effect, including seizures, was not different between active and sham rTMS.

- **Estimated prevalence of side effects**:
	- We identified a total of three seizures in people with schizophrenia. All seizures occurred with rTMS administered at 20 Hz at, or above, motor threshold (MT). One seizure occurred with an H-coil, known to have a higher risk of seizure, and two occurred with figure-of-eight coils. One seizure occurred in a patient taking clozapine 500 mg daily, although 285 other participants taking clozapine did not have seizures.

The prevalence of seizures among participants was assessed, but no further prevalence details were available.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of major depressive disorder: A comprehensive summary of safety experience from acute exposure, extended exposure, and during reintroduction treatment [^111YpUEF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder; however, prior studies have provided only partial safety information. We examined the acute efficacy of TMS in a randomized, sham-controlled trial under open-label conditions and assessed its durability of benefit.

- **Method**: Aggregate safety data were obtained from a comprehensive clinical development program examining the use of TMS in the treatment of major depressive disorder. There were three separate clinical protocols, including 325 patients from 23 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Active enrollment occurred between January 2004 and August 2005. Adverse events were assessed at each study visit by a review of spontaneous reports with separate reporting of serious adverse events. Safety assessments were also completed for cognitive function and auditory threshold. Assessment of disease-specific risk included the potential for worsening of depressive symptoms. Finally, the time course and accommodation to the most commonly appearing adverse events were considered.

- **Results**: TMS was administered in over 10,000 cumulative treatment sessions in the study program. There were no deaths or seizures. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. Transient headaches and scalp discomfort were the most common adverse events. Auditory threshold and cognitive function did not change. There was a low discontinuation rate (4.5%) due to adverse events during acute treatment.

- **Conclusions**: TMS was associated with a low incidence of adverse events.

### Brain stimulation for chronic pain management: A narrative review of analgesic mechanisms and clinical evidence [^1178eMZ1]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

A large number of studies were conducted on rTMS from 2013 to 2022. Based on these studies, the most serious adverse effect is seizures; other than that, hearing impairment and short-term decline in cognition were reported, while minor side effects are local pain, headache, and discomfort. However, the occurrence of side effects is rare. Most patients who received TMS treatment did not experience unpleasant side effects, which suggests that it is safe to use in treating various disorders, including chronic neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder.

From these studies, it has been found that anyone with any condition who undergoes rTMS delivery may be at risk of TMS-induced seizures, ranging from healthy individuals to those with neurological (e.g. post-stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, meningoencephalitis, and brain tumors) or psychiatric disorders (e.g. major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, and alcohol abuse). Certain factors have been suggested to increase the chance of TMS-induced seizures. For instance, certain medications and medical conditions that lower the seizure threshold may increase the chance of seizures caused by TMS stimulation. In theory, first-degree relatives of persons with epilepsy may also have a higher possibility of TMS-related seizures, yet no such event has been observed and reported so far. Apart from the previously mentioned risk factors, sleep deprivation is considered to be of particular relevance. Some studies have reported an increase in cortical excitability, which was monitored with EEG.

### Therapies to restore consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries: A gap analysis and future directions [^117VoQEd]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation: State of the science

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) consists of an oscillating current passed through a metal coil, which creates a fluctuating magnetic field at the surface of the skull, inducing an electric current in a volume of brain tissue. Like other means of electrically stimulating the central nervous system (CNS), a wide range of stimulation parameters can be adjusted, with some patterns modeled after neural oscillations, such as theta burst stimulation. TMS has been applied over multiple cortical regions, including prefrontal, parietal, motor, and occipital cortices. Evidence of repetitive TMS (rTMS) efficacy has been demonstrated for the following disorders: neuropathic pain, depression, stroke, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), a few randomized controlled trials using 20-Hz stimulation over the motor cortex have been conducted, without significant evidence of neurobehavioral improvements. Other stimulation sites, including the prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus, have not yet been tested with control groups. TMS can also be used in conjunction with EEG as a diagnostic tool to measure brain complexity, an approach that holds potential as a neurophysiologic biomarker of treatment effect in patients with DoC.

The most common adverse effects of rTMS are transient headaches, local discomfort in the targeted area, dizziness, and, very rarely, seizure. It is important to screen for potential (subclinical) seizures in patients with DoC prior to rTMS treatment. As with transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), proper screening is essential.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and degree of personalization [^116Jjs3b]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder. Although our knowledge of the causes of AD remains limited and no curative treatments are available, several interventions have been proposed to improve patients' symptoms. Among these, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a promising, safe, and noninvasive intervention to enhance global cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, there is currently no consensus among research studies on the optimal stimulation protocol that yields the highest efficacy for these patients.

To address this issue, we conducted a systematic literature search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases, along with a meta-analysis of studies published over the last 10 years (2010–2021), following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Unlike previous meta-analyses, we investigated whether protocols that utilized participant-specific neuroimaging scans for the selection of individualized stimulation targets were more effective compared to those relying on generalized targeting selection criteria.

- **Efficacy of individualized protocols**: We compared the effect sizes of subsets of studies based on additional protocol characteristics, including frequency, duration of intervention, number of stimulation sites, use of concomitant cognitive training, and patients' educational level.

Our results confirm the efficacy of TMS in improving global cognitive functioning in mild-to-moderate AD patients; however, they also highlight the limitations of protocol characteristics.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ipft3]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Treatments for schizophrenia are only partially effective, and there are no medications for negative symptoms or cognitive impairment. Neuromodulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has potential as a novel intervention for schizophrenia. Prior to clinical use, rTMS should have demonstrated safety in a large schizophrenia population. However, the safety profile of rTMS in schizophrenia is not well characterized, and regulatory agencies have expressed concern about safety in this population.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of rTMS studies in schizophrenia. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Science Citation Index Expanded for rTMS studies in schizophrenia that reported adverse effects. We extracted the number of participants who experienced an adverse effect and calculated the prevalence of each adverse effect for active or sham rTMS. We tested the difference between the prevalence of events in the active and sham conditions. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook.

- **Study results**: The initial search identified 1472 studies. After screening, 261 full-text studies were assessed, and 126 met inclusion criteria (N = 4122 total subjects). The prevalence of headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea was higher for active rTMS compared to sham (p < 0.05). The prevalence of all other adverse effects, including seizure, was not different between active and sham rTMS.

- **Conclusions**: rTMS is safe and well tolerated for people with schizophrenia.

### MRI of motor and nonmotor therapy-induced complications in Parkinson's disease [^1116sxap]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Levodopa therapy remains the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, offering the greatest improvement in motor function as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Dopamine agonists have proven their efficacy both as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as adjunct therapy. However, the chronic use of dopaminergic therapy is associated with disabling motor and nonmotor side effects and complications, with levodopa-induced dyskinesias and impulse control behaviors being the most common. The underlying mechanisms of these disorders are not fully understood.

In the last decade, classic neuroimaging methods and more sophisticated techniques, like the analysis of gray-matter structural imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging, have provided insights into anatomical and functional abnormalities in the brain. This review offers an overview of structural and functional brain changes associated with motor and nonmotor therapy-induced complications in Parkinson's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging may present structural and/or functional neuroimaging biomarkers that could serve as predictive signs for the development, maintenance, and progression of these complications.

Neurophysiological tools, such as theta burst stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, might assist in integrating neuroimaging findings with clinical features and could be used as therapeutic options, translating neuroimaging data into clinical practice. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Theta-burst stimulation: A new form of TMS treatment for depression [^115CAUn2]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common debilitating condition where only one-third of patients achieve remission after the first antidepressant treatment. The inadequate efficacy and adverse effects of current treatment strategies call for more effective and tolerable options. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive approach to manipulate brain activity and alter cortical excitability.

There has been more than 15 years of research on the use of repetitive TMS (rTMS) for the treatment of patients with depression, which has shown it to be an effective antidepressant treatment. However, despite rTMS having proven efficacy, there is significant interindividual variability in response. A newer rTMS protocol, known as theta-burst stimulation (TBS), has been shown to produce similar, if not greater, effects on brain activity than standard rTMS.

- **Advantages of TBS**: One major advantage TBS protocols have over standard rTMS is the reduced administration duration. Conventional rTMS procedures last between 20 and 45 minutes, whereas TBS paradigms require only 1 to 3 minutes of stimulation.

- **Efficacy of TBS**: Recently, a small number of studies have suggested that TBS has similar or better efficacy in treating depression compared to rTMS.

Optimization, identification of response predictors, and clarification of neurobiological mechanisms of TBS are required if it is to be further developed as a less time-intensive, safe, and effective treatment for MDD.

### Antidepressant class and concurrent rTMS outcomes in major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FKNBu]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is frequently used as an adjunctive treatment with antidepressants for depression. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of antidepressant classes when administered concurrently with rTMS for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD).

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to April 12, 2024, for terms related to medication, depression, and rTMS. Two independent screeners appraised the results. All randomized clinical trials that prospectively evaluated a specific antidepressant adjunctively with sham rTMS as a control in MDD were included. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023418435). The primary outcome measure assessed symptomatic improvement measured by formal depression scales. A random-effects model with pooled Standardized Mean Differences (SMDs) and log odds ratios (OR) was used. All studies were assessed for their methodological quality and bias using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool version 2 (RoB2).

From 5376 identified studies, 14 articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. There was only sufficient trial data to evaluate the effects of rTMS and combination therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Across studies, 848 participants (mean [SD] age: 41.1 [18.7] years for SSRIs, 51.8 [3.8] years for SNRIs) were prospectively examined for the efficacy of antidepressant treatment.

### Comparison of the analgesic effects of "superficial" and "deep" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with central neuropathic pain: a randomized sham-controlled multicenter international crossover study [^116AWhzG]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

The study was approved by the local ethics committee and registered in clinical trials.gov: NCT03370107. All participants provided written informed consent at inclusion, and the study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

- **Participants**: Eligible participants were recruited and treated at two university hospitals in France (Boulogne-Billancourt, Créteil) and one in Norway (Oslo) by experienced teams from January 2018 to October 2021. Inclusion criteria were as follows: woman or man > 18 and < 80 years; pain for at least six months; continuous pain (at least four days per week) of at least moderate intensity (≥ 4/10 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale for pain on average on the Brief Pain Inventory); central neuropathic pain related to stabilized multiple sclerosis, spinal cord lesion, or stroke fulfilling criteria for probable or definite neuropathic pain and scoring ≥ 4 of 10 on the DN4 questionnaire; and stable pharmacological treatment for pain at least one month before inclusion.

- **Non-inclusion criteria**: Any clinically significant or unstable ongoing medical or psychiatric disorder, including major depression or history of substance abuse (alcohol, drugs), peripheral neuropathic pain, past treatment with rTMS, contraindications to rTMS (previous severe head trauma or neurosurgical intervention, active brain tumor, intracranial hypertension, or implanted ferromagnetic devices, e.g. cardiac pacemaker, neurostimulator, or cochlear implants), other types of pain more severe than neuropathic pain.

### Deep brain stimulation and motor cortex stimulation for central post-stroke pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yChXo]. Pain Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Although motor cortex stimulation (MCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are distinct procedures, adverse events appear to be rare and manageable. Potential adverse effects following DBS and MCS surgery include seizures, hematomas, infections, headaches, and hardware malfunction. In addition, some complications are procedure-specific. For MCS surgery, these include epidural fibrosis, electrode migration, and effusion formation. In the case of DBS, side effects are more location-dependent, such as paraesthesias, muscle spasms, and phosphenes. Side effects can also occur at accustomed therapeutic voltages, necessitating the repositioning of electrode leads into a slightly altered location. The findings underscore that while DBS and MCS are effective therapies for chronic neuropathic pain, careful and accurate post-surgical management is essential not only for optimizing results but also for cost-effectiveness and minimizing the risk of adverse events.

In contrast to the invasive nature of DBS and MCS, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have been investigated to adjust the excitability of specific functional brain regions. The most frequently utilized NIBS techniques in a clinical setting are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

Research indicates that repetitive TMS (rTMS) can effectively reduce neuropathic pain. A study demonstrated that rTMS targeting the motor cortex resulted in significant pain relief for patients suffering from refractory neuropathic pain. The described mechanism by which rTMS alleviates pain is thought to involve modulation of cortical excitability.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tinnitus [^113tsXkv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for tinnitus, particularly in the context of neuromodulation, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend not routinely offering transcranial magnetic stimulation to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.

### Noninvasive brain stimulation in the study of the human visual system [^115c4q2V]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

There are currently two techniques to manipulate brain function non-invasively: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). These brain stimulation techniques work to cause long-term change within the brain. We have been combining noninvasive brain stimulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the plasticity of brain networks. When fMRI is used as an outcome measure, it is possible to identify the specificity of tDCS-modulated plasticity in a visual rehabilitation protocol. Alternatively, fMRI can be used as a guide for stimulation. Brain stimulation with TMS affects neural networks, and fMRI guidance combined with an understanding of network effects of TMS may improve TMS therapy.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-operative neurorehabilitation in neuro-oncology: A review of the literature and future directions [^117EdfKn]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neuromodulation technology capable of targeted stimulation and inhibition of cortical areas. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders, and novel uses of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in patients with acute and chronic neurologic deficits are being investigated. However, studies at the time of writing have primarily focused on neurorehabilitation in stroke patients, with little data supporting its use for neurorehabilitation in brain tumor patients.

- **Methods**: We performed a review of the available literature regarding uses of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in post-operative neuro-oncologic patients.

- **Results**: Data have demonstrated that rTMS is safe in the post-operative neuro-oncologic patient population, with minimal adverse effects and no documented seizures. The evidence also demonstrates potential effectiveness in terms of neurorehabilitation of motor and language deficits.

- **Conclusions**: Although data are overall limited, both safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated for the use of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in the neuro-oncologic population. More randomized controlled trials and specific comparisons of contralateral versus ipsilateral rTMS protocols should be explored. Further work may also focus on individualized, patient-specific TMS treatment protocols for optimal functional recovery.

### The neurobiological foundation of effective repetitive transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease [^111W5Pi4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Translating preclinical evidence to patients involves several potential limitations and challenges. Although previous sections extensively discuss the shared neurobiological and pathophysiological mechanisms between Alzheimer's disease animal models and human patients, along with promising preliminary evidence suggesting the potential for translating preclinical findings into more effective treatment strategies, several critical limitations and challenges require caution.

First, while preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) from a neurobiological perspective, translating these findings into consistent clinical benefits remains highly complex. Neurobiological differences likely play a key role in this regard. Indeed, animal models exhibit life cycles, metabolic processes, and neuroanatomical and physiological organization that often differ profoundly from those of humans. These differences may lead to distinct responses to non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) treatments despite the modulation of largely overlapping molecular pathways. For instance, in humans, it is possible to achieve relatively focal stimulation of specific neural targets without the need for sedation, forced immobilization, or broader stimulation due to the considerably smaller cranial geometry of animal models. In contrast, these limitations are frequently present in preclinical studies, potentially influencing the effects of stimulation and complicating the generalization of findings to humans.

Moreover, as previously discussed, animal models of disease are specifically designed to exhibit hallmark neuropathologies, yet…

### Effects of a combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive training intervention in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^115CehTs]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

This clinical trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of a 6-week course of daily neuroAD™ therapy.

- **Methods**: 131 subjects between 60 and 90 years old, unmedicated for Alzheimer's disease (AD), or on stable doses of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 18 and 26, and clinical dementia rating scale scores of 1 or 2, were enrolled for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. Structural brain MRIs were obtained for transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting. Baseline Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and Clinical Global Impression of Change were assessed. 129 participants were randomized to active treatment plus standard of care (SOC) or sham treatments plus SOC.

- **Results**: Subjects with baseline ADAS-Cog ≤ 30 (approximately 85% of study population) showed a statistically significant benefit favoring active over sham. Responder analysis showed 31.7% of participants in the active group with ≤ -4 point improvement on ADAS-Cog versus 15.4% in the sham group.

- **Discussion**: neuroAD™ Therapy System provides a low-risk therapeutic benefit for patients with milder AD (baseline ADAS-Cog ≤ 30) beyond pharmacologic SOC.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the elderly [^114GNh31]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This article aims to review select applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that have significant relevance in geriatric psychiatry.

Small study sizes and parameter variability limit the generalizability of many TMS studies in geriatric patients. Additionally, geriatric patients have unique characteristics that can moderate the efficacy of TMS. Nonetheless, several promising experimental applications, in addition to the FDA-approved indication for major depression, have emerged.

- **Cognitive impairment**: Cognitive impairment has been researched the most in this population and evidence thus far suggests that TMS has potential therapeutic benefits. There is also evidence to suggest benefits from TMS for neuropathic pain and smoking cessation in working-age adults.

TMS is consistently reported as a safe and well-tolerated treatment modality with no adverse cognitive side effects. TMS is a safe treatment modality that can be effective for certain applications in the elderly. Additional research that specifically includes older subjects is needed to replicate findings and to optimize treatment protocols for this population.

### A transdiagnostic review of safety, efficacy, and parameter space in accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation [^112LHGTR]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). High credibility.

Accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation (aTMS) is an emerging delivery schedule of repetitive TMS (rTMS). TMS is "accelerated" by applying two or more stimulation sessions within a day. This three-part review comprehensively reports the safety/tolerability, efficacy, and stimulation parameters affecting response across disorders.

- **Methods**: We used the PubMed database to identify studies administering aTMS, which we defined as applying at least two rTMS sessions within one day.

- **Results**: Our targeted literature search identified 85 aTMS studies across 18 diagnostic and healthy control groups published from July 2001 to June 2022. Excluding overlapping populations, 63 studies delivered 43,873 aTMS sessions using low frequency, high frequency, and theta burst stimulation in 1,543 participants. Regarding safety, aTMS studies had similar seizure and side effect incidence rates to those reported for once daily rTMS. One seizure was reported from aTMS (0.0023% of aTMS sessions, compared with 0.0075% in once daily rTMS). The most common side effects were acute headache (28.4%), fatigue (8.6%), and scalp discomfort (8.3%), with all others under 5%. We evaluated aTMS efficacy in 23 depression studies (the condition with the most studies), finding an average response rate of 42.4% and remission rate of 28.4% (range = 0–90.5% for both).

- **Parameters**: aTMS studies ranged from 2 to 10 sessions per day over 2–30 treatment days, 10–640 minutes between sessions, and a total of 9–104 total accelerated TMS sessions per participant (including tapering sessions).

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of depression in neurologic disorders [^115637Qh]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Depression is commonly associated with neurologic disorders. Although depression in neurologic conditions often has a negative impact on quality of life, it frequently is poorly managed. Some factors, such as a multidrug regimen, lack of efficacy, and side effects of antidepressants, may explain why depression is not adequately treated in patients with neurologic disorders. Therefore, this population needs new approaches for depression treatment, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be one of them because it has been shown to be effective for the treatment of depression alone and depression in certain neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease and stroke.

rTMS is a noninvasive, focal, and painless treatment associated with few, mild side effects. It may be effective in the treatment of neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. In this paper, we discuss the potential risks and benefits of rTMS treatment for depression in Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, a framework that includes the parameters of stimulation (intensity, frequency, number of pulses, and site of stimulation) for the treatment of depression in neurologic diseases is proposed.

### Cognitive outcomes of TMS treatment in bipolar depression: Safety data from a randomized controlled trial [^114ZKXas]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression (BD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with marked cognitive deficits that persist even in the euthymic phase of the illness. Pharmacological treatments for BD might further aggravate cognitive impairment, highlighting the need to develop interventions that present cognitive safety. In this study, we evaluated the cognitive effects of H1-coil (deep) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: Forty-three patients were randomized to receive 20 sessions of active (55 trains, 18 Hz, 120% resting motor threshold intensity) or sham rTMS within a double-blind, sham-controlled trial. A battery of 20 neuropsychological assessments, grouped into six domains (attention and processing speed, working memory and executive function, inhibitory control, language, immediate verbal memory, and long-term verbal memory), was performed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of trial onset. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.

- **Results**: Cognitive improvement was shown for all cognitive domains, regardless of intervention group and depression improvement. For the language domain, greater improvement was observed in the sham group over time. No correlations between depression (at baseline or during treatment) and cognitive improvement were found.

- **Limitations**: Absence of a healthy control group.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this exploratory study provide evidence on the cognitive safety of H1-coil TMS for BD patients.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography responses as biomarkers for epilepsy: A review of study design and outcomes [^112scrBc]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). High credibility.

- **Main transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography findings**:

	- **Studies on healthy individuals only**: Twelve articles reported on the modulation of TMS-evoked EEG responses following the use of a one-off dose of an anti-seizure medication by healthy individuals. They described 15 evaluations in which single-pulse (SP) responses and five in which paired-pulse (PP) responses were analyzed in the time domain. Increased N45, and decreased N100 and P180 TEP component amplitudes were the most reported statistically significant SP stimulation findings (N45: 8/15 evaluations, N100: 7/15 evaluations, P180: 6/15 evaluations). Regarding PP stimulation, suppressed intracortical inhibition of the N100 amplitude was the only evident medication effect (4/5 evaluations). TIO showed diminished medication-induced power in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta EEG bands, though only supported by a small number of evaluations (delta: 2/3 evaluations, theta: 3/5 evaluations, alpha: 4/8 evaluations, beta: 4/8 evaluations). TIO power in the alpha band, however, was reported to increase after anti-seizure medication in 3/8 evaluations.

	- **Studies on people with epilepsy and healthy controls**: Eight articles described studies' findings in people with epilepsy and healthy controls. These studies addressed a wider variety of TMS-evoked EEG response parameters than studies only on healthy individuals. TEP components N100 and P180 findings were particularly noteworthy.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of non-surgical brain stimulation for the acute treatment of major depressive episodes in adults: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115AnTwx]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Studies had to include at least two of the following treatments: tDCS, theta burst stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, accelerated, priming, deep, or synchronized), ECT, magnetic seizure therapy, or sham therapy. For rTMS, treatment protocols were grouped according to coil location and stimulation frequency: high-frequency stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, high-frequency stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, low-frequency stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, low-frequency stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Theta burst stimulation strategies were grouped in a similar manner: intermittent stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, continuous stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. ECT strategies were categorized based on electrode placement (bitemporal, right unilateral, and bifrontal), and for right unilateral ECT also based on electrical dosage (high and low to moderate). This grouping of treatment strategies aligns with previous investigations, clinical guidelines, and information leaflets. For multi-arm trials, we combined treatment groups that could not be included individually. Sham controls were merged into one node for the main analysis. Supplementary file section 02 displays the network of potential treatment comparisons. This study assumed that any participant receiving one of the treatments included in the analysis was comparable with those across trials.

### A review of the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment for depression, and current and future strategies to optimize efficacy [^114JcFtZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

There is a growing interest in extending the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) beyond research centers to the widespread clinical treatment of depression. It is thus timely to critically review the evidence for the efficacy of rTMS as an antidepressant treatment. Factors relevant to the efficacy of rTMS are discussed, along with the implications of these for further optimization of rTMS.

- **Method**: Clinical trials of the efficacy of rTMS in depressed subjects are summarized and reviewed, focusing mainly on sham-controlled studies and meta-analyses published at the time of writing.

- **Results**: There is fairly consistent statistical evidence for the superiority of rTMS over a sham control, though the degree of clinical improvement is not large. However, this data is derived mainly from two-week comparisons of rTMS versus sham, and evidence suggests greater efficacy with longer treatment courses. Studies so far have also varied greatly in approaches to rTMS stimulation (with respect to stimulation site, stimulus parameters, etc) with little empirical evidence to inform on the relative merits of these approaches.

- **Limitations**: Only studies published in English were reviewed. Many of the studies in the literature had small sample sizes and different methodologies, making comparisons between studies difficult.

- **Conclusions**: Published studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the efficacy of rTMS as given in treatment paradigms that are almost certainly suboptimal (e.g. of two weeks' duration). While the data nevertheless supports positive outcomes for rTMS compared to sham treatments, further research is necessary to establish more effective treatment protocols.

### Efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of children, adolescents and young adults with depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113ShWZK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Depression among young populations remains a major public health concern with limited treatment options. While repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) benefits adults with depression, its efficacy and safety in younger populations are unclear. This meta-analysis evaluated TMS for depression among children, adolescents, and young adults.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, WanFang, CNKI, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to February 2025 for RCTs comparing any type of active TMS with sham/no stimulation in depressed children and youths. Data extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis via random-effects models were performed. The primary outcome was the depression scale score changes; secondary outcomes included safety and adverse events.

- **Results**: Thirty-four RCTs (n = 2705) indicated that TMS was significantly effective in reducing depression severity (SMD = -1.55, 95% CI: [-1.88, -1.23], p < 0.001, I^2 = 93%). In pairwise comparisons, the high-frequency repetitive TMS (HF-rTMS) showed the largest effect (SMD = -1.90, 95% CI: [-2.42, -1.37], p < 0.001). Low-frequency rTMS and bilateral TMS showed smaller effects. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) effects were not significant. Subgroup analysis revealed that efficacy varied by diagnostic criteria and control group intervention. Safety assessments revealed that TMS was generally safe (OR = 1.713, 95% CI: [1.422, 2.064], p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that TMS is safe and effective for depressed children and youths, particularly HF-rTMS. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger and diverse populations.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of seizures: A controlled study [^117D3Ykm]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

To perform a controlled trial of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), twenty-four patients with localization-related epilepsy were randomized to blinded active or placebo stimulation. Weekly seizure frequency was compared for 8 weeks before and after 1 week of 1-Hz TMS for 15 minutes twice daily.

When comparing the 8-week baseline and post-stimulation periods, actively treated patients had a mean seizure frequency reduction of 0.045 ± 0.13, while sham-stimulated control subjects had a change of -0.004 ± 0.20. Over 2 weeks, actively treated patients experienced a mean reduction in weekly seizure frequency of 0.16 ± 0.18, whereas sham-stimulated control subjects had a reduction of 0.01 ± 0.24. Neither difference was significant.

The conclusion drawn was that the effect of TMS on seizure frequency was mild and short-lived.

### A systematic review of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of functional (conversion) neurological symptoms [^116WSjzz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Functional (conversion) neurological symptoms (FNS) are commonly encountered in neurological and psychiatric clinical settings and represent a considerable burden on healthcare systems. There is a conspicuous paucity of evidence-based treatments for FNS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) offers a safe, non-invasive method of probing changes in cortical excitability and/or connectivity. It has already had some success in demonstrating abnormalities of cortical excitability in patients with FNS, particularly when the functional symptom in question relates to movement.

We reviewed the literature for studies in which TMS has been used in the treatment of FNS. All patients in the identified studies had motor symptoms (either weakness or movement disorder). There was considerable heterogeneity in terms of study quality, population sampled, study design, TMS parameters, and outcome measures. No studies were placebo-controlled. Despite the majority of studies claiming success for the technique, there is insufficient good quality evidence to establish TMS as an effective treatment modality for FNS.

- **Methodological considerations**: We outline the methodological considerations that should be taken into account in future studies of the efficacy of TMS in treating FNS.

- **Potential mechanisms**: We discuss mechanisms by which TMS, if efficacious, may exert a therapeutic effect, including:
	- Via genuine neuromodulation.
	- Via non-specific placebo effects.
	- By demonstrating, through its immediate effects on the motor system (e.g. movement in a 'paretic' limb), that symptom improvement is possible, thus directly changing higher-level expectations.

### Efficacy and safety of non-invasive brain stimulation on cognitive function for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177WRhH]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Based on existing evidence of the effects of the most commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the cognitive improvement and safety of NIBS on schizophrenia-related cognitive impairment. We searched databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was employed to assess the risk of bias of the included RCTs, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager, version 5.4.1.

Twenty double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trials involving 997 patients were included. The analysis revealed no significant improvement in cognitive function after NIBS treatment. However, the overall treatment effect of the two main NIBS modes (i.e. rTMS and tDCS) was associated with significantly larger improvements in negative symptoms and good tolerability in patients with schizophrenia compared to sham-controls (SMD = -0.56, 95% CI [-1.03, -0.08], p = 0.02, I² = 88%). The NIBS model and stimulus parameters influenced the effect of NIBS. More favorable effects were observed in patients who received rTMS stimulation (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI [0.01, 0.49], p = 0.04, I² = 0%) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with a stimulation intensity of 20 Hz (p = 0.004) for a period longer than one month (p < 0.05). However, due to the limited number of included studies and heterogeneity in both study design and target population, the results of this analysis need to be interpreted with caution.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy [^1116RQRS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological condition characterized by repeated unprovoked seizures with various etiologies. Although antiepileptic medications produce clinical improvement in many individuals, nearly a third of individuals have drug-resistant epilepsy that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Even individuals who experience clinical improvement from antiepileptic medications often report iatrogenic symptoms. There remains a need for non-invasive and more effective therapies for this population. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses electromagnetic coils to excite or inhibit neurons, with repetitive pulses at low frequency producing an inhibitory effect that could conceivably reduce cortical excitability associated with epilepsy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence for the use of TMS in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy compared with other available treatments in reducing seizure frequency, improving quality of life, reducing epileptiform discharges, antiepileptic medication use, and side effects.

- **Search methods**: For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid 1946 to 2 June 2020). CRS Web includes randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials from PubMed and Embase.

### Neurocardiogenic syncope complicating pediatric transcranial magnetic stimulation [^114A3WeF]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Pediatric applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly expanding but lack the safety data established for adults. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced neurocardiogenic syncope may represent an age-dependent adverse event that is essentially undescribed in the transcranial magnetic stimulation literature. We report on two adolescents (of ten children studied) with transcranial magnetic stimulation-related neurocardiogenic syncope, identify modifiable risk factors, and suggest measures to improve the safety of future pediatric transcranial magnetic stimulation studies.

### Subjective reactions of children to single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation [^1147NRNF]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a useful tool to investigate cortical function in childhood neuropsychiatric disorders. Magnetic stimulation is associated with a shock-like sensation that is considered painless in adults. Little is known about how children perceive the procedure. We used a self-report questionnaire to assess children's subjective experience with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Normal children and children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation in a study of cortical function in ADHD.

Subjects were asked to rate transcranial magnetic stimulation on a 1 to 10 scale (most disagreeable = 1, most enjoyable = 10) and to rank it among common childhood events. Thirty-eight subjects completed transcranial magnetic stimulation; 34 said that they would repeat it. The overall rating for transcranial magnetic stimulation was 6.13, and it was ranked fourth highest among common childhood events. These results suggest that although a few children find transcranial magnetic stimulation uncomfortable, most consider it painless. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

### A pilot investigation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-traumatic brain injury depression: Safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^117SW6zM]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

Depression following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and difficult to treat using standard approaches. The study investigated, for the first time, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of post-TBI depression. We specifically assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TMS in this patient population, while also exploring cognitive outcomes. Twenty-one patients with an episode of major depression subsequent to a TBI participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of repetitive TMS (rTMS). Sequential bilateral rTMS (to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) was provided in 20 treatments over a period of 4 weeks. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either active or sham stimulation.

There were no adverse effects, and treatment was well tolerated. There was no significant effect of rTMS on post-TBI depression, with all patients showing a significant improvement in depressive symptoms irrespective of their treatment group (p = 0.002). There were significant improvements in cognition following active rTMS in the areas of working memory (p = 0.021) and executive function (p = 0.029). rTMS was shown to be safe and well tolerated in patients who had developed depression following a TBI. We did not find a therapeutic effect for post-TBI depression; however, this approach may have some utility in improving cognitive function. Future research should focus on alternative rTMS treatment approaches for post-TBI depression and the direct investigation of rTMS as a treatment for cognitive impairment in TBI.

### Systematic review of preservation TMS that includes continuation, maintenance, relapse-prevention, and rescue TMS [^111R7XSC]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

A dearth of evidence-based information exists to guide the delivery of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) following a successful acute course of treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. To provide guidance for clinicians, existing literature focused on "preservation TMS" was systematically reviewed and synthesized. Preservation TMS was defined as TMS used to sustain a clinical response following a successful acute course of treatment and included reports using the terms maintenance, continuation, relapse prevention, or rescue TMS. The review protocol was registered on Open Science Framework and reported following PRISMA guidelines. Data were abstracted by two authors and discrepancies were resolved by a third author. Primary outcome measures focused on clinical efficacy. The evaluated studies were graded using the Levels of Evidence criteria published by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

The search included 536 abstracts and 16 additional papers, from which 63 full articles were screened. Data were abstracted from 30 qualifying sources (N = 1,494), including 4 randomized controlled trials (one sham controlled), 14 open trials, and 12 case series. Overall, the quality of existing literature was low regarding efficacy but provided clear support for effectiveness and safety across a range of preservation TMS protocols based on mostly uncontrolled studies.

Existing literature suggests that preservation TMS protocols significantly vary and are mostly supported by open trials and case series. Due to a lack of effective alternatives, these findings may inform the clinical application of TMS in sustaining remission in patients with Major Depressive Disorder.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GGJK2]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

However, there are questions about the scalability of rTMS. Is rTMS safe and appropriate for use in large populations of people with schizophrenia? Although there have been many studies and multiple systematic reviews of rTMS in schizophrenia, some regulatory agencies have expressed concern about its safety in this population due to the illness itself (i.e. does rTMS worsen psychotic or mood symptoms) and the use of medications that may alter seizure threshold, thereby increasing the risk of rTMS-induced seizure. Importantly, no one has ever characterized the safety profile of rTMS in schizophrenia. We therefore conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to characterize the safety and adverse event profile of rTMS in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. We hypothesized that there would be no differences in the prevalence of serious adverse events between active and sham rTMS in schizophrenia and that the prevalence of seizure would be at or below the prevalence in the general population.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography responses as biomarkers for epilepsy: A review of study design and outcomes [^114WDEgD]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). High credibility.

We appraised the quality of reporting by evaluating many study cohort and TMS‐EEG protocol parameters, partly based on a Delphi consensus study. Assessed TMS‐EEG protocol parameters included items describing the administration of the magnetic pulses rather than the analysis of the evoked responses. We acknowledge the influence of pre‐processing and analysis methodology on the TMS‐EEG readout, but these items were outside the scope of this review. Our assessment of the reporting of methodological parameters was distorted because multiple studies were conducted with the same subject cohorts and experimental set‐ups. We accounted for this by only using the first article in our analysis of reported study parameters.

### Imaging the effective networks associated with cortical function through intracranial high-frequency stimulation [^113jmGgt]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical effects**: Multiple stimulation trials were performed, gradually increasing the intensity from 0.1 to 3 mA, usually in 0.25 mA steps. Wider steps of 0.5 or even 1 mA may have been used if repeated anterior stimulations did not elicit any effect. Narrow steps of 0.1 mA were used when a clinical effect was obtained at low intensities or when there was a need to choose between simultaneous multimodal clinical effects. The upper limit was set by the presence of clinical or electrical response (after discharges). If none of these were obtained, the upper limit was set by default to 3 mA, generating the maximum charge-per-density allowed in our setup.

Patients were instructed to report any psychological or physical changes they experienced during or after each stimulation. Furthermore, patients were engaged in different tasks during the stimulation session, such as repetitive movements of the limbs to test for motor deficits and reading or counting to test for language or attentional deficits. Tasks were selected based on the region stimulated. For example, if the contacts were placed near the motor area (primary or secondary), patients were asked to perform a repetitive movement and to count. Tasks had no interpatient variability. The electrical stimulation was delivered for 1–3 seconds after clinical testing started. In many situations, the stimulation was repeated to confirm the reproducibility of the observed effects. Sham stimulation was applied to rule out subjective manifestations.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and degree of personalization [^111uPkvf]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In a second set of analyses, we compared additional protocol characteristics, such as the different number of stimulation sites, pulse frequency, number of stimuli delivered, number of treatment sessions, and concomitant cognitive training during stimulation, along with participants' characteristics like educational level. This was done to identify other factors that might modulate the success of high-frequency rTMS protocols in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the routine application of other neurostimulation interventions, such as transcranial electrical stimulation, to ameliorate AD symptomatology, TMS shows the highest potential effectiveness. For this reason, we decided to only review studies employing this methodology.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography responses as biomarkers for epilepsy: A review of study design and outcomes [^111XHe2K]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was introduced almost four decades ago, paving the way for the non-invasive and pain-free assessment of cortical function in brain disorders. Cortical responses to TMS pulses likely reflect cortical excitability, generally interpreted as the magnitude of the neuronal response to a received stimulus and reflective of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory dynamics. Alterations in cortical excitability are considered at the core of the disease in focal and generalised epilepsies. Hence, by examining cortical excitability, TMS might provide biomarkers to distinguish people with epilepsy from healthy controls and to monitor response to anti-seizure medication.

### Effects and safety of high-frequency rTMS in acute intracerebral hemorrhage patients: A pilot study [^117HQyEw]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

Although high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) in chronic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is beneficial, it has been poorly investigated in rTMS for acute ICH. Our aim is to investigate the effects and safety of rTMS in acute spontaneous ICH.

We prospectively performed HF-rTMS on consecutive patients with ICH within 24 hours from onset between April 2019 and August 2021. The inclusion criterion was persistent paralysis, with an NIHSS scale of 1 or higher for at least 3 days after onset. The exclusion criteria included cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar ICH; disturbance of consciousness; and being over 80 years of age. For comparison, we used a conventional rehabilitation group whose patients met the same criteria between April 2016 and March 2019. We evaluated the incidence of epilepsy and exacerbation of the NIHSS score in the rTMS group. We also compared the two groups regarding clinical background and outcome.

A total of 44 patients were enrolled in the study. Of the patients, 22 (50%) were in the rTMS group. The median (IQR) time from onset to the start of rTMS was 9 (6–12) days. There were no cases of epilepsy or exacerbation of NIHSS after the start of rTMS. A favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score between 0 and 2) at 3 months was frequently observed in the rTMS group (73% vs 27%, p = 0.006). HF-rTMS was independently associated with favorable outcome at 3 months (OR = 11.5, 95% CI = 2.194–60.447, p = 0.004).

HF-rTMS may be safe and effective in acute ICH patients.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pxAkT]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness and a leading cause of disability worldwide. It is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Treatment typically involves the use of antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy. However, antipsychotics are only partially effective, substantially improving symptoms in less than 25% of individuals, with only a minority achieving remission. Antipsychotics are most effective for positive symptoms, and there are no pharmacologic treatments for negative symptoms or cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Given the limited treatment options, there has been a substantial search for alternative interventions.

Neuromodulation, or the use of brain stimulation to change neuronal activity, is one intervention explored for schizophrenia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a form of noninvasive neuromodulation that involves pulsing an electrical current through an external electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp, using the induced electromagnetic field to temporarily alter patterns of neuronal activity. rTMS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and smoking cessation. Since its initial FDA approval for MDD in 2008, rTMS has become a valuable and readily available research tool to probe neural circuitry involved in many other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.

### Preliminary guidelines for safe and effective use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury [^111PTY8N]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation has generated extensive interest within the traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation community. However, little work has been done with repetitive protocols, which can produce prolonged changes in behavior. This is partly due to concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria.

In this article, we identify guidelines for safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study. Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. After stimulation, we performed monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure.

The stimulation was well tolerated, and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, and these improvements continued through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score.

### Effectiveness of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in migraine: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111knK9R]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). High credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in migraine, measured by a decrease in pain severity or attack frequency.

- **Methods**: A search was conducted in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus. The risk of systematic bias was rated using the Cochrane domain-based quality assessment tool, and a random-effects model was applied.

- **Results**: Of 434 identified records, eight randomized control studies were included in the meta-synthesis. All studies used high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The risk of systematic bias was low. The difference between repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and control groups in frequency of migraine days per month was 8.1 days (95% confidence interval = 4.8–11.4) in favor of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. For intensity of migraine pain (scaled from 0 to 100), this difference was 13.6 points (95% confidence interval = 5.3–21.8) in favor of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The heterogeneity was substantial with I² = 86%.

- **Conclusions**: In chronic migraine, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation appears to have positive effects on both migraine pain severity and attack frequency compared to sham stimulation. Although the effect on pain intensity was probably clinically insignificant, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reduced pain frequency by an average of 8 days per month.

### Antidepressant efficacy of administering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with psychological and other non-pharmacological methods: a scoping review and meta-analysis [^115kzBMU]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To optimize the antidepressant efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is important to examine the impact of brain state during therapeutic rTMS. Evidence suggests that brain state can modulate the brain's response to stimulation, potentially diminishing antidepressant efficacy if left uncontrolled or enhancing it with inexpensive psychological or other non-pharmacological methods. Thus, we conducted a PRISMA-ScR-based scoping review to pool studies administering rTMS with psychological and other non-pharmacological methods. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 10 July 2024.

Inclusion criteria: neuropsychiatric patients underwent rTMS; studies assessed depressive symptom severity; non-pharmacological tasks or interventions were administered during rTMS, or did not include a wash-out period. Of 8,442 studies, 20 combined rTMS with aerobic exercise, bright light therapy, cognitive training or reactivation, psychotherapy, sleep deprivation, or a psychophysical task.

Meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted based on change scores on standardized scales. The effect size was large and therapeutic for uncontrolled pretest-posttest comparisons (17 studies, Hedges' g = -1.91, standard error (SE) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.80 to -1.03, p < 0.01); medium when studies compared active combinations with sham rTMS plus active non-pharmacological methods (8 studies, g = -0.55, SE = 0.14, 95% CI = -0.82 to -0.28, p < 0.01); and non-significant when active combinations were compared with active rTMS plus active non-pharmacological methods.

### Brain stimulation for chronic pain management: a narrative review of analgesic mechanisms and clinical evidence [^114pnsyz]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). High credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment used to address certain neurological and psychological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression, by inducing depolarization of the neurons in the brain. This is achieved by transmitting a strong current through a wire from a machine to a circular wire, which initiates a magnetic field in a perpendicular direction based on Faraday's law of induction. When the circular wire is applied to the scalp, the time-changing magnetic field induces an electric current in the axons beneath the scalp, running in the opposite direction to the current in the coil, thereby stimulating the brain tissue.

There are three main types of TMS: single-pulse TMS, paired-pulse TMS, and trains of repetitive stimuli (repetitive TMS, or rTMS). In this article, we will only focus on rTMS. Typically, a single-pulse TMS lasts for only a few seconds; therefore, to prolong its effects, repetitive TMS is used. rTMS works by firing the single-pulse stimuli repeatedly at a specific frequency, intensity, and time duration, either to inhibit or to stimulate the activity of a specific cortical area to which it is applied.

- **High-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS)**: Frequencies ≥ 5 Hz are used to increase cortical excitability, motor-evoked potential (MEP) size, and provoke intercellular interactions.
- **Low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS)**: Frequencies ≤ 1 Hz are used depending on the treatment purpose.

These subgroups can be used for treatment based on their purpose, with HF-rTMS typically increasing cortical excitability.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation: Diagnostic, therapeutic, and research potential [^117MHX7w]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique, developed 20 years ago, that was initially used to noninvasively investigate nervous propagation along the corticospinal tract, spinal roots, and peripheral nerves in humans. TMS is extensively utilized in clinical neurophysiology, including rehabilitation and intraoperative monitoring. Single-pulse TMS and other more recent versions, such as paired-pulse TMS, repetitive TMS, integration with structural and functional MRI, and neuronavigation, allow precise mapping of motor output to specific body districts.

Moreover, TMS can evaluate excitatory and inhibitory intracortical circuits, providing information on brain physiology, the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric diseases, and the mechanisms of brain plasticity and neuroactive drugs. When applied over nonmotor areas, TMS has extended research applications, often complementing other functional neuroimaging techniques, across several fields of psychophysiology. It enables causal testing of brain-behavior relationships. Repetitive TMS can induce relatively long-lasting excitability changes, making it a possible treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases associated with brain excitability dysfunctions. Nevertheless, these applications warrant further large-scale studies.

In emerging research fields, TMS-EEG co-registration is recognized as a promising approach for evaluating corticocortical connectivity and brain reactivity with high temporal resolution. However, the safety and ethical limitations of the TMS technique necessitate a high level of vigilance.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and degree of personalization [^115HyG5i]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder. Although our knowledge of the causes of AD remains limited and no curative treatments are available, several interventions have been proposed to improve patients' symptomatology. Among these, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been shown to be a promising, safe, and noninvasive intervention to improve global cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, there is currently no agreement between research studies on the optimal stimulation protocol yielding the highest efficacy in these patients.

To address this, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases and a meta-analysis of studies published in the last 10 years (2010–2021) according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Different from prior published meta-analyses, we investigated whether protocols that considered participant-specific neuroimaging scans for selecting individualized stimulation targets had more successful outcomes compared to those relying on generalized targeting selection criteria.

We then compared the effect sizes of subsets of studies based on additional protocol characteristics, such as frequency, duration of intervention, number of stimulation sites, use of concomitant cognitive training, and patients' educational level. Our results confirm TMS efficacy in improving global cognitive functioning in mild-to-moderate AD patients but also highlight the flaws of protocol characteristics.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for schizophrenia [^114n74cx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms that fail to fully respond to antipsychotic medication. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been proposed as a new treatment for individuals with schizophrenia, especially those who experience persistent auditory hallucinations.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the effects of TMS alone, compared with sham TMS or with 'standard management' and any other comparison interventions in reducing psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2006, June 2008, April 2013). This register is compiled by methodical searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts, LILACS, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, and Sociofile, and is supplemented with handsearching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials recruiting at least five participants and comparing TMS with sham TMS or any other treatment for people with schizophrenia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. We used a fixed-effect model and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 41 studies with 1473 participants in the review. We found significant differences in favor of temporoparietal TMS compared to sham TMS for global state measured on the CGI scale.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of non-surgical brain stimulation for the acute treatment of major depressive episodes in adults: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115fFGS9]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

The results of the network meta-analysis suggest that priming transcranial magnetic stimulation was more acceptable than low-frequency left rTMS (summary odds ratio 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.59), magnetic seizure therapy (0.13, 0.02 to 0.95), accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation (0.16, 0.03 to 0.93), tDCS (0.18, 0.05 to 0.61), low-frequency right rTMS (0.23, 0.08 to 0.72), deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (0.25, 0.07 to 0.92), high-frequency left rTMS (0.26, 0.08 to 0.79), and sham (0.21, 0.07 to 0.65). Moreover, bilateral rTMS was associated with fewer drop-outs than tDCS and sham. All treatments were at least as acceptable as sham therapy.

The forest plot of active versus sham treatment comparisons for all-cause discontinuation rates indicates that effect sizes represent summary odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and 95% prediction interval estimates from network meta-analysis. Abbreviations include: aTMS = accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation; BF ECT = bifrontal electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); BL rTMS = bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; blTBS = bilateral theta burst stimulation; BT ECT = bitemporal ECT; cTBS = continuous theta burst stimulation; dTMS = deep transcranial magnetic stimulation; HFL rTMS = high-frequency left repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; HFR rTMS = high-frequency right repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; HRUL ECT = high dose right unilateral ECT; iTBS = intermittent theta burst stimulation; LFL rTMS = low-frequency left repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; LFR rTMS = low-frequency right repetitive.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166PsE6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Background and hypothesis: Treatments for schizophrenia are only partially effective, and there are no medications for negative symptoms or cognitive impairment. Neuromodulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has potential as a novel intervention for schizophrenia. Prior to clinical use, rTMS should have demonstrated safety in a large schizophrenia population. However, the safety profile of rTMS in schizophrenia is not well characterized, and regulatory agencies have expressed concern about safety in this population.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of rTMS studies in schizophrenia. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Science Citation Index Expanded for rTMS studies in schizophrenia that reported adverse effects. We extracted the number of participants who experienced an adverse effect and calculated the prevalence of each adverse effect for active or sham rTMS. We tested the difference between the prevalence of events in the active and sham conditions. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook.

- **Study results**: The initial search identified 1472 studies. After screening, 261 full-text studies were assessed, and 126 met inclusion criteria (N = 4122 total subjects). The prevalence of headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea was higher for active rTMS compared to sham (P < 0.05). The prevalence of all other adverse effects, including seizure, was not different between active and sham rTMS.

Conclusions: rTMS is safe and well tolerated.

### Assessment and management of concurrent substance use in patients receiving repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for depressive, obsessive-compulsive, psychotic, and trauma-related disorders: A Delphi consensus study and guideline [^114HHsMF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Limited data are available to inform clinicians on how to manage concurrent substance use in the context of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depressive, obsessive-compulsive, psychotic, or trauma-related disorders. The authors convened an international panel of 24 rTMS experts, representative of different geographic regions and subspecialties, and created a consensus guideline for clinicians and researchers on approaches to concurrent substance use in patients receiving rTMS as treatment for primary psychiatric disorders.

- **Methods**: A Delphi method survey and expert opinion were elicited over consecutive rounds of surveys, with feedback and discussion after each round. Recommendation statements were established upon very high (≥ 80%) agreement.

- **Results**: Three rounds of surveys and feedback were sufficient to reach a consensus for most topics; where consensus could not be reached, the panel discussed limitations in the evidence base. Informed by a synthesis of the literature and practice-based evidence, the expert panel provides several consensus recommendations on the topics of screening, monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation associated with various degrees of substance use, and specific considerations for alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and opioids. Instead of excluding all people who use substances, a nuanced approach should be taken based on an assessment of risk factors for clinical instability and severity of use. The most important safety risk with substance use is the presence of intoxication or withdrawal.
