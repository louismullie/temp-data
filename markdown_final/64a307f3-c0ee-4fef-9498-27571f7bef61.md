## Question

Management of cholelithiasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of cholelithiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify gallstone disease by symptoms and complications. Then, I should verify the management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Next, I will examine symptomatic uncomplicated disease and the role of early versus delayed cholecystectomy versus conservative management. After that, I need to check the approach to complicated disease, including acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and gallstone pancreatitis. Finally, I should consider special populations, perioperative details, and synthesize a practical algorithm with attention to guideline concordance and shared decision-making [^113gkusG] [^116JpZ4J] [^1112NUxF].

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification because downstream decisions hinge on it. Cholelithiasis is best categorized as asymptomatic, symptomatic uncomplicated (biliary colic), or complicated (acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis), and this framing aligns with major society guidance and contemporary reviews, so I should anchor to that schema to avoid missteps in testing and timing of intervention [^113gkusG] [^115LuUuz].

> Now, for asymptomatic cholelithiasis, I need to ensure I do not over-treat. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — prophylactic cholecystectomy is not routinely recommended in adults with silent stones, and expectant management with education and selective imaging is favored, with exceptions such as porcelain gallbladder, gallbladder polyps with concerning features, or specific high-risk contexts like sickle cell disease where prophylactic surgery may be justified, so I should confirm that counseling emphasizes low annual risk of complications and the option to observe [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp] [^116pcFZ3].

> For symptomatic uncomplicated disease, I should double-check the default standard of care. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the reference treatment because it addresses the source of symptoms and prevents recurrence, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence — guidelines consistently endorse LC for symptomatic cholelithiasis, and operative technique should prioritize the critical view of safety to mitigate bile duct injury risk [^117UtTyq] [^112Uy7T3].

> Next, I should review timing, because this is where practice often diverges. Early cholecystectomy during the index admission reduces recurrent symptoms and biliary complications compared with delayed or conservative strategies, and meta-analyses show substantially lower risks of pain, cholangitis, and total biliary complications with early surgery, so I need to ensure systems enable prompt surgical evaluation and scheduling [^113f4G3J] [^113hxXo2].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid surgery or is a borderline candidate? The C-GALL randomized trial shows that conservative management can be a reasonable short-term alternative for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, with similar quality-of-life outcomes and lower costs at 18 months, though about 25% crossed over to surgery and long-term durability remains uncertain, so shared decision-making is essential here [^114StrkJ] [^112N6ZkR] [^1179BbM5].

> I should also consider the SECURE trial's longer-term perspective. A restrictive, stepwise selection strategy reduced cholecystectomies modestly but did not meaningfully improve pain outcomes, reinforcing that many patients with gallstone-type pain have non-biliary drivers and that surgery is an imperfect solution for a subset, which means I need to screen carefully for functional biliary disorders and set expectations [^111tpmf5] [^1134RJ4A].

> Turning to complicated disease, I will now examine acute cholecystitis. The Tokyo Guidelines and WSES recommend early cholecystectomy within 48 hours when feasible, with antibiotics and supportive care initiated promptly; if the patient is high risk or unstable, percutaneous cholecystostomy serves as a bridge, and I should confirm that definitive cholecystectomy is pursued once the patient is optimized to prevent recurrence [^116GMBC8] [^114LBbeH].

> For choledocholithiasis, I need to check risk stratification because it drives the pathway. The ASGE recommends high-risk features (CBD stone on imaging, total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL with CBD > 6 mm, or cholangitis) prompt ERCP, intermediate-risk features warrant EUS or MRCP or IOC, and low-risk patients can proceed to cholecystectomy without additional biliary imaging; importantly, after ductal clearance, cholecystectomy should generally follow to reduce recurrence, and laparoscopic CBD exploration is a viable single-stage alternative where expertise exists [^116JpZ4J] [^114pP6iR] [^115ikB6v].

> Hold on, I should verify the pancreatitis piece because timing nuances matter. In mild gallstone pancreatitis, same-admission cholecystectomy is recommended to prevent recurrence, whereas in severe disease, cholecystectomy should be delayed until systemic inflammation resolves; ERCP is reserved for cholangitis or persistent biliary obstruction rather than routine use in all pancreatitis cases, so I must align endoscopic intervention with objective indications [^117EWVRy] [^114TTh3j].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics. I should confirm that pediatric management is heterogeneous and often more conservative than adult care, with delayed surgery common; however, emerging data suggest increased risks with delays, so early involvement of pediatric surgery and standardization toward adult-derived algorithms where appropriate may mitigate unnecessary morbidity until pediatric-specific guidelines mature [^115oGV8i] [^116hVUqF] [^116UPgZS].

> For patients with cirrhosis, I need to ensure I stratify by Child-Pugh class. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is reasonable in Child A–B, albeit with higher complication rates, whereas Child C patients generally should avoid surgery and be managed with antibiotics and drainage when indicated, and I should double-check that any operative plan includes meticulous perioperative risk assessment and optimization [^11363sjb].

> In pregnancy, let me reconsider the trimester and approach. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally preferred in the second trimester when surgery is necessary, with supportive care prioritized in the first trimester unless there is failure of medical therapy or complications, and I should confirm that maternal-fetal monitoring and trocar positioning adjustments are incorporated into the plan [^notfound].

> For bariatric patients, I should verify whether concomitant cholecystectomy is warranted. Data suggest concomitant cholecystectomy at the time of bypass is safe and does not increase operative morbidity, while expectant management of asymptomatic stones may also be reasonable; shared decision-making should weigh the risk of postoperative biliary events against the added operative time and complexity [^117GYzTn].

> Next, I should review perioperative details that influence outcomes. The critical view of safety reduces bile duct injury and should be documented, routine IOC is not mandated for all but is reasonable in intermediate-risk choledocholithiasis scenarios, and for uncomplicated cases, same-day discharge is often feasible with appropriate analgesia and safety netting; I need to ensure pathways support these standards [^112Uy7T3] [^116JpZ4J] [^115udxLv].

> I will now examine postoperative issues. If a bile leak occurs, ERCP with stenting is first-line and highly effective, and if retained CBD stones are discovered postoperatively, ERCP is again the treatment of choice, with percutaneous or surgical rescue for failed endoscopic therapy, so I should have a low threshold to image when LFTs remain abnormal or symptoms persist [^112Usqqd] [^114aErSU].

> But wait, what about antimicrobial prophylaxis in children — does it help? A large NSQIP-P analysis suggests prophylaxis reduces surgical site infections in pediatric cholecystectomy, which conflicts with adult IDSA guidance derived from adult populations; given the pediatric signal, I should individualize decisions while acknowledging the evidence gap and favor narrow-spectrum agents when prophylaxis is used [^114ydVXW].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Asymptomatic patients should generally be observed with counseling on warning signs; symptomatic uncomplicated patients should be offered early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with conservative management as an acceptable alternative after discussing crossover risk and uncertainty beyond 18 months; complicated disease should trigger expedited source control — early cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, risk-stratified ERCP followed by cholecystectomy for choledocholithiasis, and same-admission cholecystectomy for mild gallstone pancreatitis — while tailoring for special populations and institutional expertise [^113gkusG] [^116JpZ4J] [^116GMBC8] [^117EWVRy].

> Finally, I should confirm that shared decision-making is embedded throughout, because patient values, comorbidity, and access to expertise meaningfully alter the balance of benefits and harms; aligning choices with guideline-concordant pathways while transparently discussing trade-offs and uncertainties will optimize outcomes and minimize unnecessary interventions [^117VYidN] [^116LRZq7].

Management of cholelithiasis centers on **laparoscopic cholecystectomy** for symptomatic disease [^117UtTyq], with **expectant management** for asymptomatic cases [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp]. Early surgery reduces recurrence and complications compared to delayed or conservative care [^113f4G3J] [^113hxXo2]. For suspected choledocholithiasis, use **ASGE risk stratification** [^116JpZ4J] to guide preoperative MRCP/EUS or ERCP, and perform intraoperative cholangiography when indicated [^111y9pBZ]. Conservative management is reasonable for high-risk or declining patients, but recurrence is common [^114LBbeH] [^113hxXo2]. Antibiotics are reserved for acute cholecystitis or cholangitis, and ERCP is indicated for retained or impacted CBD stones [^111wxMjc] [^114aErSU].

---

## Asymptomatic cholelithiasis

Expectant management is appropriate for asymptomatic patients, with **no routine prophylactic cholecystectomy** [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp]. Indications for prophylactic cholecystectomy include porcelain gallbladder, gallbladder polyps > 1 cm, or patients at high risk for gallbladder cancer (e.g. Native American descent, chronic typhoid carriers) [^notfound].

---

## Symptomatic cholelithiasis

### Uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis

- **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: Standard of care for symptomatic patients [^117UtTyq] [^111DzNJ7].
- **Timing**: Early cholecystectomy (within 7 days of symptom onset) reduces recurrence and complications compared to delayed surgery [^113f4G3J] [^111QN436].
- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs and dietary modifications can be considered for patients declining surgery or with high surgical risk, but recurrence is common [^1129skaj] [^111QN436] [^113hxXo2].

---

### Complicated cholelithiasis

#### Acute cholecystitis

- **Early cholecystectomy**: Recommended within 7 days of symptom onset [^notfound].
- **Antibiotics**: Indicated for acute cholecystitis or cholangitis [^111wxMjc].
- **Percutaneous cholecystostomy**: For patients unfit for surgery or with severe comorbidities [^114LBbeH].

---

#### Choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stones)

- **Risk stratification**: Use ASGE guidelines to guide preoperative evaluation and management [^116JpZ4J].
- **Imaging**: MRCP or EUS for intermediate-risk patients; ERCP for high-risk patients [^111y9pBZ].
- **ERCP**: For confirmed CBD stones, either preoperative or postoperative depending on clinical context [^111y9pBZ].
- **Intraoperative cholangiography**: Consider during cholecystectomy when choledocholithiasis is suspected [^111y9pBZ].

---

#### Gallstone pancreatitis

- **Mild pancreatitis**: Early cholecystectomy during the same admission [^114TTh3j].
- **Severe pancreatitis**: Delay cholecystectomy until pancreatic inflammation resolves [^notfound].
- **ERCP**: Indicated for cholangitis or persistent biliary obstruction [^116JpZ4J].

---

## Special populations

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **laparoscopic cholecystectomy** remains the preferred approach, with careful perioperative management [^notfound]. Conservative management may be considered for those with significant comorbidities or high surgical risk [^11363sjb].

---

### Pregnant patients

In pregnant patients, **second trimester** is the preferred timing for cholecystectomy [^notfound]. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe [^117BA6mk], though open surgery may be necessary in select cases [^112Uy7T3].

---

### Patients with cirrhosis

In patients with cirrhosis, **Child-Pugh A or B** patients may undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy with careful perioperative management [^11363sjb]. Child-Pugh C patients should generally avoid surgery; consider percutaneous cholecystostomy or endoscopic drainage if necessary [^11363sjb].

---

## Postoperative complications and management

- **Bile duct injury**: Rare but serious; requires surgical or endoscopic intervention [^113E48Wm].
- **Bile leak**: Managed endoscopically with stenting or sphincterotomy [^112Usqqd].
- **Recurrent symptoms**: Occur in approximately 12% of patients post-cholecystectomy, often due to retained stones or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [^113hxXo2].

---

## Summary of management algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic cholelithiasis | Expectant management |
| Symptomatic uncomplicated cholelithiasis | Laparoscopic cholecystectomy |
| Acute cholecystitis | Early cholecystectomy; antibiotics |
| Choledocholithiasis | ERCP; cholecystectomy |
| Gallstone pancreatitis | Early cholecystectomy (mild); delayed (severe) |
| High surgical risk patients | Conservative management or percutaneous cholecystostomy |

---

Management of cholelithiasis is **individualized**, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the standard for symptomatic patients and expectant management for asymptomatic cases. Early surgery reduces complications, and conservative management is reserved for high-risk patients.

Abstract

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis encountered by the acute care surgeon. There is a wide spectrum of variation in management of this disease due to evolutions in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Intricacies in management are related to the timing of diagnosis as well as locally available imaging modalities, surgical expertise, and ancillary advanced endoscopy and interventional radiological support. While individual patient demographics and institutional characteristics will determine management of choledocholithiasis, it is incumbent for the treating surgeon to be well versed in all manners of therapy currently available. The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-based summary of the contemporary management of choledocholithiasis.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^113hxXo2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cholelithiasis/gallstone disease management imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, costing about 6.5 billion dollars/year only in the United States itself. The prevalence of gallstones ranges from 0.1% to 50.5% worldwide. Although gallstone disease is usually asymptomatic, certain risk factors drive the progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic illness, with or without complications, making it imperative to treat. Gallstone-related complications include common bile duct stones (CBD stones)/choledocholithiasis, acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis and others. Surgical removal of the gallbladder (known as cholecystectomy) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment option over open cholecystectomy for gallstones and cholecystitis. However, approximately 12% of patients who have undergone cholecystectomy continue to experience pain and recurrent gallstone-related symptoms.

Conservative management (CM), involving pain and symptomatic treatment with gallbladder in situ, carries no risk of operative complications and is also considered an alternative to cholecystectomy. However, among conservatively managed patients with uncomplicated gallstones, recurrence of gallstone symptoms and subsequent development of gallstone-related complications often lead to cholecystectomy. Similarly, several randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing early versus delayed cholecystectomy (DC) for gallstone disease reported recurrence of symptoms/complications in the waiting period before surgery and also reported higher postsurgical complications with delayed surgery. Thus, the effectiveness of early cholecystectomy (EC) over CM/DC is ambiguous. Therefore, we aimed to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise treatment outcomes between EC and CM/DC. The study's objective is to synthesise treatment outcomes such as (1) gallstone-related complications between EC and CM/DC (2) surgical complications, length of hospital stays and operative time between early and DC.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^115drt4z]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion — choledocholithiasis is a commonly encountered diagnosis for general surgeons, and management decisions hinge on the probability of choledocholithiasis based on clinical presentation and investigations, the timing of presentation in relation to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the availability of technology and expertise of surgeons, endoscopists and interventional radiologists; regardless, the surgeon must be familiar with all possible options at their disposal for managing the patient presenting with choledocholithiasis.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: which test is best? [^111y9pBZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic cholelithiasis will affect approximately 10–15% of Americans in the next 5–10 years. It is estimated that at least 10–20% of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis will also have concurrent common bile duct stones. While the incidence of truly asymptomatic common bile duct stones is unknown, it is important to attempt to identify and stratify these patients to help guide their surgical management of both the gallbladder and the common bile duct. Common bile duct stones are one of the leading cause of acute pancreatitis in the US and also, when left untreated, can lead to cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction and bacterial superinfection. These diagnoses increase patients morbidity as well as create a significant cost burden to our health care system.

Historically, patients with straightforward acute cholecystitis or biliary colic have been managed with minimally invasive cholecystectomy. Patients with clear evidence of acute cholangitis or biliary obstruction secondary to calculous disease require common bile duct drainage (either via ERCP or PTC depending on the situation), followed by cholecystectomy. There is, however, no general consensus on how to manage, or even how to identify, patients with intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis. Recognizing this, the American Society for Gastroenterology (ASGE) created a scoring system in 2010 (revised in 2019 to improve diagnostic accuracy) to help stratify these patients into low, intermediate, and high risk of choledocholithiasis and therefore help guide management. Low-risk patients should proceed to the operating room for cholecystectomy with or without intra-operative cholangiogram (IOC) at the surgeons discretion. High-risk patients should have planned common bile duct interrogation and clearance typically in the form of pre-operative or intra-operative ERCP. There is some evidence to support minimally invasive surgical common bile duct exploration in these ASGE high-risk patients though this still remains debated. There remains wide variability in the management of the intermediate-risk group. Some centers will plan to take most of these patients to the operating room for a cholecystectomy with a planned IOC. Others will defer definitive management to trend liver function tests. Others will obtain additional imaging to provide clarity prior to proceeding with invasive intervention. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are the two most commonly employed imaging techniques to help establish the diagnosis. Additionally, some patients will proceed to ERCP pre/intra/or post-operatively.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^115oGV8i]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the actual treatment of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents is characterized by a diagnostic and therapeutic heterogeneity. Future aims should focus on an early interdisciplinary cooperation and a work consensus between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. With this publication, we would like to present an insight into real therapeutic management and to emphasize the need for large population-based, prospective studies. The development of evidence-based pediatric guidelines may represent a key factor in treating this increasing entity sufficiently and in an improved and homogeneous way.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116GMBC8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of cholelithiasis in children and adolescents appears to be increasing, even if the entity remains to be a rare disease within this population. Prevalence is ranking between 0.13 and 1.9%. Diagnostic and therapeutic management seems to be heterogeneous in clinical practice and appears to be based on small population studies. In contrast, different guidelines apply to adults in various countries (e.g. Europe, Japan, USA). In Germany, guidelines by the German Societies for Digestive and Metabolic Diseases and for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract regulate the management of cholelithiasis in adults. Separate treatment guidelines in the pediatric sector on the basis of evidence-based large-scale population studies are either lacking, outdated or represent expert opinions of distinct hospitals (e.g. Sweden, Brazil, India, USA, Egypt, Iran). This is significant with regard to the timing of surgery. The guidelines for adult management updated in 2018 are based on the largest randomized trial in adults so far, the multi-center "Acute cholecystitis: early versus delayed cholecystectomy" trial. Even though the results are being controversially discussed, they recommend an early cholecystectomy within the first 48 h of symptoms of acute cholecystitis and an elective cholecystectomy in symptomatic cases without signs of inflammation.

Aiming at assessing the management and especially the surgical timing of this rare but increasing pediatric disease, we chose a dual approach in this study. Firstly, a retrospective analysis of patients with cholecystectomy was performed within our institution, comparing diagnostics and therapy of children and adolescents in the pediatric surgery department with the management of young patients (aged < 25 years) in the visceral surgery department. Secondarily, diagnostic and therapeutic standards of this entity were evaluated in pediatric patients using an online survey via the German Society of Pediatric Surgery.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^1159Nksr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis — epidemiology and presentation — has a prevalence of approximately 10–15% of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. The clinical presentation can range from completely asymptomatic to biliary colic and symptoms of obstructive jaundice, such as pruritus, dark urine and acholic stools, and although up to a third of patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones will pass them spontaneously without intervention, the majority of patients will require endoscopic and/or surgical intervention.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^11247nbf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The establishment of evidence-based pediatric guidelines is required in order to reduce insecurities and to deliver scientific facts on the basis of multicenter and prospective studies. These should not only focus on a diagnostic algorithm, but especially on the indications for expectant management versus surgical therapy and further therapeutic options in acute and chronic disease. In an effort to achieve an improved standardized treatment and to emphasize the consensus between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons until results of evidence-based pediatric guidelines are available, we illustrated a flow chart based on our findings and to encourage common strategies (Fig. 3). We especially excluded different marginal subgroups of patients, e.g. symptomatic patients with no clear association between symptoms and cholelithiasis. These may be the subject of subsequent research projects.

Limitations of the study have to be discussed carefully. Aimed at gaining insight into real therapeutic management, we are presenting a foundation for further research and are not able to add results of a large prospective study on this topic. Accordingly, one limitation of our presented retrospective research lies in the relatively small study population over a large period of time, which limits the informative value of our study. However, it reflects the still low incidence. Although representing the diverse patient spectrum in patients with cholelithiasis, the case mix and the variety of complications additionally limit the possibility to draw strong conclusions because of even smaller case numbers within subgroup analyses. Nevertheless, statistically significant differences between the two study groups have been obtained for several parameters of clinical relevance. Certainly, a type II error cannot be excluded for non-significant test results because of the minor statistical power. Furthermore, challenges in the interpretation of data are caused by two aspects of the study design. First, analysis of complicated cases is of special interest and must be seen with caution, as they are analyzed separately and within the whole study group. We aimed at distinguishing between these subgroups to emphasize the need for different management and surgical timing. Second, the study's approach was chosen from the therapeutic endpoint of cholecystectomy, which influences the selection of patients (bias). This study design was chosen based on rising numbers of cholecystectomies, which were not attributable to a changed therapeutic regimen with earlier indication for surgery. Finally, our study does therefore not include any aspects on the effects of an expectant management in asymptomatic cases, which might certainly be a relevant subgroup of patients with cholelithiasis. The presented online survey additionally showed a restricted response rate, but is in the range of other published online surveys. It was designed not to report exact numbers, but to deliver an insight in the current management and to create awareness for the lack of a guideline. This first ever online survey on this topic might therefore hold a high risk of recollection bias, as we asked for individual characteristics in practices. However, even from this restricted point of view, we observed a heterogeneous picture in the pediatric management with a tendency of delayed timing of surgery. We propose to conduct further prospective multicenter studies and international consensus conferences to further explore single aspects on diagnostics and therapy.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^114pP6iR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Pre-operative choledocholithiasis management — If choledocholithiasis is confirmed pre-operatively, options for clearance of the common bile duct (CBD) include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before cholecystectomy or common bile duct exploration with cholecystectomy; ERCP is highly sensitive and specific and therapeutic to clear stones, with a success rate of approximately 80–90% for ductal clearance. Reasons for failure include large or impacted stones, duodenal diverticula, altered gastric or duodenal anatomy and intrahepatic stones, and risks include pancreatitis (1.3–6.7%), infection (0.6–5%), hemorrhage (0.3–2%), perforation (0.1–1%) and mortality (up to 1%). Following biliary clearance with ERCP, it is generally recommended to proceed with subsequent cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis which occurs in approximately 20% of patients. However, in patients with advanced comorbidities who are at significantly high risk for operative intervention, ERCP with sphincterotomy without further intervention can also be considered definitive therapy, as there has been no statistical difference in mortality.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116hVUqF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In contrast to adults, for whom guidelines on the cholelithiasis treatment exist, there is no consistent treatment of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis throughout national and international departments, most probably due to the lack of evidence-based studies.

Methods

We evaluated the German management of pediatric cholelithiasis in a dual approach. Firstly, a retrospective, inter-divisional study was established, comparing diagnostics and therapy of patients of the pediatric surgery department with the management of patients aged < 25 years of the visceral surgery department in our institution over the past ten years. Secondarily, a nation-wide online survey was implemented through the German Society of Pediatric Surgery.

Results

Management of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis was primarily performed by pediatricians in the retrospective analysis (p < 0.001). Pediatric complicated cholelithiasis was not managed acutely in the majority of cases with a median time between diagnosis and surgery of 22 days (range 4 days–8 months vs. 3 days in visceral surgery subgroup (range 0 days–10 months), p = 0.003). However, the outcome remained comparable. The hospital's own results triggered a nation-wide survey with a response rate of 38%. Primary pediatric medical management of patients was confirmed by 36 respondents (71%). In case of acute cholecystitis, 22% of participants perform a cholecystectomy within 24 h after diagnosis. Open questions revealed that complicated cholelithiasis is managed individually.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cholelithiasis differs between various hospitals and between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based large-scale population studies as well as a common guideline may represent very important tools for treating this increasing diagnosis.

### Symptomatic cholelithiasis and functional disorders of the biliary tract [^111GVuNQ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Symptomatic cholelithiasis and functional disorders of the biliary tract present with similar signs and symptoms. The functional disorders of the biliary tract include functional gallbladder disorder, dyskinesia, and the sphincter of Oddi disorders. Although the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis are relatively straightforward, the diagnosis and treatment of functional disorders can be much more challenging. Many aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of functional disorders are in need of further study. This article discusses uncomplicated gallstone disease and the functional disorders of the biliary tract to emphasize and update the essential components of diagnosis and management.

Purpose

Cholelithiasis is an issue in bariatric surgery patients. The incidence of cholelithiasis is increased in morbidly obese patients. After bariatric surgery, the management maybe sometimes challenging. There is no consensus about how to deal with cholelithiasis prior to bariatric surgery.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review from our prospectively collected bariatric surgery database. Primary bariatric procedures from 2009 to 2020 were included. Prevalence of cholelithiasis and its management prior to bariatric surgery and the incidence and management of postoperative biliary events were analyzed.

Results

Over 1445 patients analyzed, preoperatively cholelithiasis was found in 153 (10.58%), and 68 out of them (44.44%) were symptomatic. Seventy-six patients had a concomitant cholecystectomy. In those cases, the bariatric procedure did not show increased operative time, length of stay, morbidity, or mortality compared to the rest of primary bariatric procedures. Twelve patients (15.58%) with previous cholelithiasis and no concomitant cholecystectomy presented any kind of biliary event and required cholecystectomy. De novo cholelithiasis rate requiring cholecystectomy was 3.86%. Postoperative biliary events both in de novo and persistent cholelithiasis population did not show any difference between the type of surgery, weight loss, and other characteristics.

Conclusions

Cholelithiasis was present in 10.58% of our primary bariatric surgery population. Concomitant cholecystectomy was safe in our series. Non-surgical management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis did not lead to a higher risk of postoperative biliary events. The global postoperative cholecystectomy rate was equivalent to the general population.

Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm

The assessment of the retrospective study's and the survey's findings prompted the development of a diagnostic and therapeutic proposal in accordance with the adult guidelines due to the lack of large-scale multi-center studies in pediatric patients. This algorithm is depicted in Fig. 3. It emphasizes the close and early interdisciplinary consensus of pediatricians and pediatric surgeons, as well as the clear differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic cholelithiasis and complicated cholelithiasis in cases of acute inflammation or choledocholithiasis. We propose to discuss cases with concomitant diseases early and interdisciplinary due to the continued lack of large-scale population studies for evidence-based guidelines. It certainly cannot provide answers to all therapeutic options (e.g. antibiotic therapy), as large-scale population studies are missing, and information has to be transferred from adult management.

Introduction — epidemiology and pathophysiology of gallstones are summarized, stating that "Bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) most frequently result from the migration of gallstones from the gallbladder into the biliary tree" and that "Gallstones are the consequence of cholesterol supersaturation in bile, inadequate bile salt levels or function, and diminished contractility of the biliary epithelium because of the multifactorial effects of diet, hormones, and genetic predisposition". The introduction adds that "Prospective population data reveal that 10% of American adults will develop symptomatic gallstones over the course of a decade", and that "Greater than 700,000 will undergo outpatient cholecystectomy".

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^1178tsxF]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113NB7Ht]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with clinical surveys suggesting prevalence rates of 6% to 25% and a tendency to increase with age. Gallstones are more common in women. A clinical ultrasound survey in the UK reported prevalence rates of 12% and 22% among men and women older than 60 years, respectively.

In the UK and North America, the number of surgical procedures for gallstone disease increased steadily between the 1950s and 1990s, reflecting the rise in prevalence and prompt identification of gallstone disease and the use of cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice. Rates of surgical procedures stabilised in these countries towards the end of the 20th century. In England, about 61 000 episodes cost the NHS > £200m in 2018/19.

The natural course of gallstones is benign; most people remain asymptomatic and show a relatively low progression to symptomatic disease. A systematic review published in 2007 reported the range for disease progression as 10% to 25% in studies that followed-up patients after initial diagnosis (≤ 15 years of follow-up). The annual risk of developing symptoms has been estimated at 2–4%.

Most people with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease do not develop complications; reported annual rates of developing complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholangitis obstructive jaundice) have been as low as 1–3%. The Italian Group for the Epidemiology and Prevention of Cholelithiasis study reported an annual incidence for complications of 0.7% in patients with symptoms.

Mortality from gallstone disease is rare — typically less than 1% from gallstone related causes.

Methods

Screening and study selection

We carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered the protocol at PROSPERO. We systematically searched the studies indexed in PubMed-Medline, Scopus and Embase. The search terms were constructed based on domains of population, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) as described below. The search terms were combined using Boolean operator 'OR' within the same domains, and Boolean operator 'AND' between domains of PICO as described in online supplemental tables 1–3. An initial search was performed on 16 June 2020 and an updated search was performed on 12 January 2021.

According to the inclusion criteria, search results were screened for eligibility. The population included individuals with gallstones (cholelithiasis/cholecystolithiasis) or CBD stones (choledocholithiasis) or acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis. The intervention included surgical removal of the gallbladder through open or laparoscopic methods, where surgery was performed on an emergency basis or within 7 days, treated as EC. The comparator is CM and DC. CM included both observation management (OM) (also known as wait and watch strategy) and Endoscopic management (EM). Under OM, this study considered patients with gallstones who were symptomatically managed using pain killer, antibiotics, diet and lifestyle changes. Under EM, this study considered patients who underwent endoscopic removal of CBD stones with gallbladder left in situ. In DC, we considered patients who were initially managed conservatively and later underwent cholecystectomy after 6 weeks. Outcomes included complications related to gallstone disease, perioperative, intraoperative and postoperative complications with cholecystectomy, length of hospital stays, operative time and the studies included were RCTs. Nonrandomised trials, observational studies, reviews and studies published in non-English languages for which a translation could not be obtained were excluded. Studies were also excluded for their selection of PICO, that is not of study's interest.

Titles and abstracts of studies listed from the electronic database search were meticulously screened independently by authors (BSB, MH, AS) using Rayyan-web application. After screening, authors independently reviewed and selected studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria with authors' mutual consensus (figure 1).

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Clinical management of infantile cholelithiasis [^1178EDrh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Infantile cholelithiasis is a rare disease process, and management strategies are poorly defined. We therefore examined the risk factors, complications, and management of this disease at our institution.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed infants with cholelithiasis diagnosed on ultrasound between 1997 and 2013. Details of the patient's medical history, presentation, imaging findings, laboratory values, and treatment were reviewed and analyzed.

Results

Over the 16-year period, 50 infants were evaluated for cholelithiasis. Thirty-seven (74%) had at least one risk factor for gallstone development which included total parenteral nutrition, diuretic therapy, cephalosporin antibiotic treatment, sepsis, congenital heart disease (CHD), prematurity, or a malabsorptive gastrointestinal condition. Thirteen (26%) infants were symptomatic, most commonly presenting with emesis and jaundice. Complications from gallstones included choledocholithiasis (9), cholecystitis (3), and pancreatitis (1). Nearly half (6/13) of patients with complicated cholelithiasis had CHD. Of infants presenting with complications, 9 had a cholecystectomy, most commonly via a laparoscopic approach, 2 had an ERCP for choledocholithiasis, and 2 were medically managed. In patients managed conservatively, resolution of gallstones occurred in 25%.

Conclusions

Infantile cholelithiasis has variable outcomes ranging from spontaneous resolution to choledocholithiasis or cholecystitis. While patients with complicated cholelithiasis often undergo an operation, infants < 1year of age have higher anesthetic and surgical risks. Conservative management with ERCP or medical treatment can also be successful, which offers an alternative to operative intervention in properly selected patients.

### Clinical update on acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis: between certainties and Grey areas [^112zhTUw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

10–15% of the general population is affected by cholelithiasis and 20–40% of them will develop complications. In most patients, the index presentation of gallstone-related complications is Acute Calculous Cholecystitis (ACC), accounting for 10–15% of symptomatic patients. The most widely used guidelines worldwide for the management of ACC are the Tokyo Guidelines (TG) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines. In many aspects, the TG were in line with the recommendations of the WSES. However, there are still some differences between the TG and the WSES guidelines. Our review, herein, will particularly focus on the grey and controversial areas in the management of ACC and acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP). These areas still remain under-addressed despite the breadth of prior published literature.

ASGE guideline — Strength of recommendation (GRADE) is labeled as either strong or conditional, with standard wording and practical implications by audience. The recommendations are labeled as either "strong" or "conditional" according to the GRADE approach, and the words "the guideline panel recommend" are used for strong recommendations and "suggest" for conditional recommendations. For patients: Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not for strong recommendations, whereas most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not for conditional recommendations. For clinicians: Most individuals should receive the intervention and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed for strong recommendations, whereas for conditional recommendations different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences, and decision aids may be useful. For policymakers: The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator for strong recommendations, whereas conditional recommendations mean policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis for patients awaiting renal transplantation [^111AkmNo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients awaiting renal transplantation. Cholecystectomy is considered before renal transplantation because of potential worsened complications from cholelithiasis with posttransplantation immunosuppression. This study reviewed the outcomes for operative and nonoperative management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients awaiting renal transplantation.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all patients who received renal transplant at the authors' institution during the period 1994 to 2000 was completed. All patients underwent pretransplantation abdominal ultrasound.

Results

Of the 411 patients receiving renal transplants (242 men and 169 women with a mean age of 45.7 years), 32 had cholelithiasis at the pretransplantation workup (7.8%), and 35 had gallbladder abnormalities (8.5%): polyps, thickened wall, sludge, bile duct dilation. Before transplantation, 12 of the 32 patients (38%) with cholelithiasis underwent uncomplicated cholecystectomy. None of the remaining 19 patients with cholelithiasis required cholecystectomy after renal transplantation (mean follow-up period 6.2 years). Of the 35 patients with gallbladder abnormalities, 2 required post transplantation elective cholecystectomy.

Conclusions

No evidence was found for increased morbidity related to cholelithiasis or gallbladder abnormalities after renal transplantation. As in the general population, the risks associated with asymptomatic cholelithiasis do not appear to warrant prophylactic cholecystectomy for patients awaiting renal transplantation.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has revolutionized the field of surgery, and is currently the gold standard in the treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The goal of every laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be attainment of the critical view of safety before cutting the cystic duct and artery to reduce the risk of bile duct injury. Open cholecystectomy is most commonly performed when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is converted to open or when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is contraindicated. Robotic cholecystectomy is a safe alternative to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and follows the same basic operative principles.

### Comprehensive review of the management of patients with acute cholecystitis who are ineligible for surgery [^114LBbeH]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Review the current literature for available treatments for acute cholecystitis (AC) in non-surgical candidates and provide guidelines for the management of these patients.

Background

Cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment modality for AC. A considerable number of patients who are not eligible for surgery are managed by percutaneous and endoscopic techniques. There is recent data regarding endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) and emerging percutaneous approaches to address cholelithiasis and remove drains.

Methods

An expert panel of surgeons, gastroenterologists, and interventional radiologists reviewed the current literature and provided recommendations for AC management in non-surgical candidates. Recommendations were based on relevant evidence, with quality and strength assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Results

Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is advised for patients ineligible for lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) or with reversible conditions, aiming to bridge to cholecystectomy. The optimal timing of cholecystectomy after PC remains unclear. In cases where surgery is not feasible, potential definitive treatments such as percutaneous cholecysto-lithotripsy/lithectomy and cholecystoduodenal stenting should be considered. For calculous AC, EUS-GBD with LAMS is recommended as a therapy for never-surgical candidates if they are eligible for monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia and there is institutional expertise and minimal intervening ascites.

Conclusions

The management of AC in non-surgical candidates remains a challenge, with institutional protocols varying based on physician preferences and expertise. The proposed protocol integrates percutaneous and endoscopic approaches and emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. Further research is required to evaluate these evolving management techniques, as the current literature is limited.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^116JpZ4J]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — risk stratification to prompt ERCP specifies that in order to minimize the risk of diagnostic ERCP, we suggest the following HIGH-RISK criteria to directly prompt ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis: (1) common bile duct (CBD) stone on ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging or (2) total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL AND dilated common bile duct on imaging (> 6 mm with gallbladder in situ) or (3) ascending cholangitis. In patients with INTERMEDIATE-RISK criteria of abnormal liver tests or age > 55 years or dilated CBD on ultrasound, we suggest EUS, MRCP, laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), or laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound for further evaluation. For patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis without any of these risk factors, we suggest cholecystectomy without IOC.

### Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration [^115ikB6v]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Choledocholithiasis management — epidemiology and procedural context indicates that choledocholithiasis complicates the management of 10–15% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for uncomplicated, symptomatic cholelithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is often used before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with suspected or confirmed common bile duct (CBD) stones, but disadvantages include an up to 86% normal exam rate when performed routinely and short-term complications such as pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis, with potential long-term sequelae from division of the sphincter of Oddi including ampullary stenosis, duodenobiliary reflux, and recurrent stone formation. The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy into clinical practice in 1989 and subsequent refinements in technique and improvements in equipment have provided the tools necessary for surgeons with advanced laparoscopic training to effectively treat choledocholithiasis in a single-stage, laparoscopic procedure.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116UPgZS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We are presenting this study with the specific aim of exploring especially the therapeutic management and the surgical timing in pediatric cases of cholelithiasis. Findings of the retrospective study indicate a preferred expectant management in pediatric patients with an increased time span with symptoms and longer timeframe between diagnosis and surgery. This may be largely determined by the high proportion of primary pediatric medical admissions. Overall percentage of complicated cases was not significantly higher in pediatric patients in comparison to patients of the visceral surgery subgroup. However, we see an increased risk for complications, especially for biliary pancreatitis, in these patients besides the unnecessarily extended duration of symptoms in pediatric patients. The preference for an expectant management in symptomatic or even acute and complicated cases was also reported within the online survey. Based on the results of the dual approach of our study, we can conclude that the management practice is heterogeneous and deviates fundamentally from the guidelines of adult medicine. Moreover, the survey's findings revealed a lack of standardization or homogeneous optimal surgical timing after end of conservative treatment. The ideal surgical timing has been widely discussed in adult medicine so far, which could be partially solved by the guideline for adults. Various publications appear to be in consensus on the association of delayed treatment with increased complication rates. However, certain limitations, such as restricted case numbers, the high risk of selection bias and inconsistent definitions of diagnoses, must be taken into account to properly classify the value of these publications. Sarrami et al. demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of 188 children and adolescents with cholelithiasis that the risk of subsequent hospital admission was increased by 5% for every 10 days with delayed treatment. They speculated that a delay in surgery might increase complication rates, while acknowledging their limitations of an inconsistent definition and therapeutic approach in patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis and the need for large, randomized trails.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^115h3Bzp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Whereas cholelithiasis is one of the most widespread diseases in adult visceral surgery, only little is known about specific factors of cholelithiasis and its complications in children and adolescents. We therefore primarily conducted a retrospective analysis of our own patients' cohort, differentiating between pediatric and adult management. While an elevated BMI is estimated as one of the important risk factors in the development of adult cholelithiasis, other diagnoses such as metabolic disorders, parenteral nutrition, cystic fibrosis, hemolytic diseases and malignancies are strongly correlated with pediatric gallstones. We can confirm this through the findings of the retrospective analysis, as concomitant diseases are correlated with the pediatric surgery subgroup and obesity with the visceral surgery subgroup. Etiology and predisposing factors of cholelithiasis in pediatric patients are recommended to be discussed carefully. They may ultimately have an influence on interdisciplinary therapeutic decisions and management should be discussed within a pediatric guideline.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113FgVY]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered, but we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta-analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Findings

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines in 2019. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively.

Conclusion

ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low-risk patients, allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. All guidelines have limited specificity in identifying patients at high risk for CBDS and cannot reliably select patients for upfront ERCP.

### Incremental net benefit of cholecystectomy compared with alternative treatments in people with gallstones or cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cost-utility studies [^116AnaHG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). This study is part of a more extensive economic evaluation study.

Data sources, screening and study selection

The search was performed from inception to 1 July 2020, in PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases. We followed the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome approach to construct the search terms. The desired population for the study included all the adult patients presenting with cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis who were being considered for a cholecystectomy. Surgical removal of the gallbladder using early, open or LC was the intervention, and non-surgical methods like conservative management, wait-and-watch or endoscopic management covered the comparator strategy. The possible economic outcomes included were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net benefit (INB), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, life years saved and costs saved.

The detailed search terms and search strategies are reported in online supplemental material 1. The total number of studies identified from the database search was 8710, including 2977 from PubMed, 3696 from Scopus and 2037 from Embase. After removing the duplicates (n = 1414), 7296 studies were selected for an initial title and abstract screening.

Titles and abstracts of the studies listed from the electronic database search were screened independently by the authors (BSB, MN and AS) for potential inclusion using the Rayyan software. After screening, the authors (BSB, MN and AS) independently reviewed the full-text articles (n = 660). The final list of studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was prepared by the authors' mutual consensus (BS, MN and AS).

All full economic evaluation studies with a study population of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis that compared the costs and consequences of intervention with a comparator in terms of QALYs, ICERs or INBs were included in the study. Studies other than cost–utility analysis (CUA), reviews, letters, editorials, abstracts, books, reports, grey literature and methodological articles were excluded from the study. We identified 28 studies for systematic review based on these inclusion–exclusion criteria, and the data were extracted from these papers using a data extraction form. The PRISMA flow chart of the screening process is appended as figure 1.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^117EWVRy]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE choledocholithiasis guideline — gallstone pancreatitis management and ERCP role: The panel recommended that same admission cholecystectomy be performed for patients presenting with gallstone pancreatitis. In a very large cohort comparing endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) alone versus ES plus cholecystectomy, 7330 versus 4478 patients were included, with 39.3% recurrent adverse events after ES alone versus 18.0% with ES and cholecystectomy (adjusted OR, .38 [95% CI, .34-.42]). ERCP with prophylactic sphincterotomy to prevent recurrent pancreatitis or other biliary adverse events should not be used as an alternative to cholecystectomy unless surgery is absolutely contraindicated. A Cochrane analysis of 662 patients from 5 RCTs found increased risk with a nonoperative approach after ES and bile duct clearance, including recurrent biliary pain (14.6 [95% CI 5.0–42.8]), jaundice or cholangitis (2.5 [1.15–5.9]), and mortality (1.8 [1.2–2.8]) versus prophylactic cholecystectomy.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116pcFZ3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Curro et al. proposed to conduct cholecystectomies even in cases of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients with sickle cell disease. In symptomatic patients, association with increased operative time, morbidity rate, and postoperative stay could be revealed. However, these results are based on an observational study within a restricted number of 30 patients with cholelithiasis and sickle cell disease. Tannuri et al. observed within their retrospective study with the large time period of 17 years a high percentage of 25% of patients, presenting directly with a complication due to cholelithiasis. Pelizzo et al. most recently identified new diagnostic scores in a small population study to improve surgical timing. They see however that the lack of certain clinical background data causes a selection bias and therefore limits the interpretation of results. We observed 55% of the pediatric patients within our retrospective study being operated on in a time period of day 5–42 after acute signs of inflammation. In the pediatric subgroup, only one patient with acute cholecystitis was treated with a cholecystectomy within 24 h. The inflammatory process within this time slot might unnecessarily complicate surgeries, elongate operation time and cause intra- and postoperative complications. Recommendations of the adult guideline are thus not implemented and their respective value in pediatric management should be carefully discussed.

Furthermore, with this given preference for expectant management, the value of UDCA in pediatrics has to be carefully evaluated. According to the S3-guidelines, therapy with UDCA is recommended in asymptomatic patients. However, in pediatric practice, a relevant number of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis receives UDCA for litholysis. Our results confirm the broad range of application in pediatric management without sufficient success. In 2008, Della Corte et al. claimed the ineffectiveness of UDCA in treatment of cholelithiasis, even though a significant relief of symptoms could be reported. This reduction of symptoms is also confirmed by Baran et al. who reported a study of 74 children, mostly responding to UDCA treatment within the first six months. Larger population studies are required to evaluate the real value of UDCA in pediatric patients.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nrvi1]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered, but we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta‐analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Findings

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines in 2019. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively.

Conclusion

ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low‐risk patients, allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. All guidelines have limited specificity in identifying patients at high risk for CBDS and cannot reliably select patients for upfront ERCP.

### Acute biliary disease [^114qadk4]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acute biliary disease is a ubiquitous acute surgical complaint. General surgeons managing emergency surgical patients must be knowledgeable and capable of identifying and caring for common presentations. This article discusses the work-up, diagnosis, and management of the varying pathologies that make up biliary disease including cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, biliary dyskinesia, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus. Also addressed are more challenging and rare presentations including pregnancy and bariatric anatomy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^113f4G3J]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of early cholecystectomy for gallstone diseases treatment is uncertain compared with conservative management/delayed cholecystectomy.

Aims

To synthesise treatment outcomes of early cholecystectomy versus conservative management/delayed cholecystectomy in terms of its safety and effectiveness.

Design

We systematically searched randomised control trials investigating the effectiveness of early cholecystectomy compared with conservative management/delayed cholecystectomy. We pooled the risk ratios with a 95% CI, also estimated adjusted number needed to treat to harm.

Results

Of the 40 included studies for systematic review, 39 studies with 4483 patients are included in meta-analysis. Among the risk ratios of gallstone complications, pain (0.38, 0.20 to 0.74), cholangitis (0.52, 0.28 to 0.97) and total biliary complications (0.33, 0.20 to 0.55) are significantly lower with early cholecystectomy. Adjusted number needed to treat to harm of early cholecystectomy compared with conservative management/delayed cholecystectomy are, for pain 12.5 (8.3 to 33.3), biliary pancreatitis > 1000 (50–100), common bile duct stones 100 (33.3 to 100), cholangitis (100 (25–100), total biliary complications 5.9 (4.3 to 9.1) and mortality > 1000 (100 to100 000).

Conclusions

Early cholecystectomy may result in fewer biliary complications and a reduction in reported abdominal pain than conservative management.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 per cent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Aspects on gallbladder cancer in 2014 [^111iL9be]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss some key issues involved in the management of gallbladder cancer (GBC).

Recent Findings

The decline in incidence and mortality of GBC began decades before the introduction of laparoscopic surgery. In consecutive autopsies and in cases in which cholelithiasis was present, the incidence of gallbladder carcinoma is 3–4%. A number of genetic alterations have been identified in the different stages of GBC and they support the morphological evidence of two pathways by which tumors develop. Some of these genetic changes are associated with particular risk factors. All management of GBC and all comparisons of treatment results from different centers must be based on the stages.

Summary

Simple cholecystectomy is the adequate treatment for T1a GBC. Lymph node excision improved survival in patients with T2 lesions. Radical en bloc resection of T2 tumors offers greater benefit over conventional cholecystectomy alone in terms of greater long-term survival times. Provided that negative surgical margins are secured, hepatectomy and lymph node resection can, therefore, be withheld in most cases in the surgical treatment of pT2 GBC. With improvements in surgical and anesthetic techniques, aggressive surgery has proven to be performed with safety.

### Prevention and treatment of bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the clinical practice guidelines of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) [^113E48Wm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in Europe (and the world) and has become the standard procedure for the management of symptomatic cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis in patients without specific contraindications. Bile duct injuries (BDI) are rare but serious complications that can occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Prevention and management of BDI has given rise to a host of publications but very few recommendations, especially in Europe.

Methods

A systematic research of the literature was performed. An international expert panel was invited to appraise the current literature and to develop evidence-based recommendations. Statements and recommendations were drafted after a consensus development conference in May 2011, followed by presentation and discussion at the annual congress of the EAES held in Torino in June 2011. Finally, full guidelines were consented and adopted by the expert panel via e-mail and web conference.

Results

A total of 1,765 publications were identified through the systematic literature search and additional submission by panellists; 671 publications were selected as potentially relevant. Only 46 publications fulfilled minimal methodological criteria to support Clinical Practice Guidelines recommendations. Because the level of evidence was low for most of the studies, most statements or recommendations had to be based on consensus of opinion among the panel members. A total of 15 statements and recommendations were developed covering the following topics: classification of injuries, epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, and management of BDI.

Conclusions

Because BDI is a rare event, it is difficult to generate evidence for prevention, diagnosis, or the management of BDI from clinical studies. Nevertheless, the panel has formulated recommendations. Due to the currently limited evidence, a European registry should be considered to collect and analyze more valid data on BDI upon which recommendations can be based.

### Atazanavir [^112Xuboj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Guidelines on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^115NsHVC]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

The last 30 years have seen major developments in the management of gallstone-related disease, which in the United States alone costs over 6 billion dollars per annum to treat. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become a widely available and routine procedure, whilst open cholecystectomy has largely been replaced by a laparoscopic approach, which may or may not include laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct (LCBDE). In addition, new imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiography (MR) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) offer the opportunity to accurately visualise the biliary system without instrumentation of the ducts. As a consequence clinicians are now faced with a number of potentially valid options for managing patients with suspected CBDS. It is with this in mind that the following guidelines have been written.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^11363sjb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Cholecystectomy in cirrhosis — prevalence, indications, and alternatives are as follows: Cholelithiasis is approximately 2-fold more prevalent in cirrhosis, and patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis should not be treated. In Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) A and B cirrhosis, indications for elective cholecystectomy are the same as in noncirrhotic patients, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the procedure of choice. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe in CTP A and B but is associated with significantly higher postoperative complications and mortality in CTP class C. For acute cholecystitis, antibiotics and cholecystostomy are the standard of care. When concern or uncertainty exists, perioperative mortality estimation using the VOCAL-Penn score may help decision-making, and for prohibitive surgical risk, antibiotics with percutaneous cholecystostomy, transpapillary drainage, or endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural gallbladder drainage are alternatives.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1179BbM5]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

In the short term (< 18 months), conservative management, as an alternative to surgery, may be effective and cost effective for patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

We conclude that the costs and benefits will continue to be incurred in both groups beyond 24 months, so future research should focus on long term follow-up data to establish lifetime cost effectiveness and aid identification of the cohort of patients who will benefit from surgery.

### Laparoscopy for appendicitis and cholelithiasis during pregnancy: a new standard of care [^117BA6mk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subsequent to a report from the authors' institution, the laparoscopic management of symptomatic cholelithiasis and appendicitis during pregnancy has become the standard of care at LDS Hospital using institutional guidelines. For comparison with previous outcomes described by the authors, 59 additional laparoscopic cases are reported.

Methods

Medical records of all pregnant patients at LDS Hospital who underwent open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy between 1998 and 2002 were reviewed. The outcomes were compared with the authors' previous data.

Results

The laparoscopic management of symptomatic cholelithiasis and appendicitis during pregnancy increased from 54% to 97%. No significant differences in preterm delivery rates, birth weights, or 5-min Apgar scores were found between the two periods. No birth defects or uterine injuries occurred.

Conclusions

With the use of the authors' guidelines, laparoscopy has become the standard of care for managing symptomatic cholelithiasis and appendicitis during pregnancy at LDS Hospital without significant increase in morbidity or mortality.

### Restrictive strategy vs usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones: 5-year follow-up of the SECURE randomized clinical trial [^111tpmf5]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The 5-year follow-up from the SECURE trial illustrated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers a mediocre solution for patients experiencing symptomatic cholelithiasis in achieving a pain-free state. In the long term, a restrictive strategy resulted in a significant but small reduction in operation rate compared with usual care and was not associated with increased biliary and surgical complications. A restrictive strategy was equally disappointing as usual care for reaching a pain-free state after cholecystectomy. Overall, an 8.3% reduction in operation rate was observed after a restrictive strategy compared with usual care. A similar trade-off between cholecystectomies saved and pain-free patients was observed after 1 year. However, the patient-reported long-term treatment satisfaction between usual care and the restrictive strategy was not significantly different and increasingly converged over time. Therefore, the long-term outcome of this trial contends that the indications for gallbladder surgery in patients with uncomplicated cholelithiasis should still be critically examined.

Both short- and long-term results of the SECURE trial indicate that surgery represents a poor solution for certain patients presenting symptoms attributable to gallstones. Based on the used definition of pain-free state, persisting pain is reported in 20% to 40% of patients after cholecystectomy. The recently published C-GALL trial accords with our findings and supports the hypothesis that observation/conservative management is an alternative strategy to surgery. This study assessed whether cholecystectomy is cost-effective compared with observation/conservative management at 18 months. The score on the bodily pain domain of the SF-36 was the primary end point of the study. By 18 months, 25% in the observation/conservative management arm and 67% in the cholecystectomy arm had received surgery. The mean (SD) SF-36 norm-based bodily pain score was 49.4 (11.7) and 50.4 (11.6), respectively. The long-term outcome of the trial needs to show whether the lower operation rate is due to waiting lists in the UK and whether observation is sustainable in terms of biliary complications and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, after given detailed information on the alternative options for cholecystectomy, many patients in the C-GALL opted for nonsurgical treatment and even declined participation in the trial to not receive surgery. This observation advocates shared decision making in selecting patients for cholecystectomy.

### Expectant management is safe for cholelithiasis after heart transplant [^113chKfm]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of cholelithiasis after heart transplant remains unclear. We use expectant management based on symptoms, without screening studies or prophylactic treatment. We hypothesized that expectant management for cholelithiasis after heart transplant does not result in significant mortality or morbidity from gallstone-associated disease.

Methods

Between November 1985 and August 2004, 409 heart transplants were performed in 402 recipients at the University of Washington. This is a non-concurrent cohort study of these recipients.

Results

Among recipients, 24 underwent cholecystectomy before heart transplant. After transplant, in the remaining 378 patients, 34 were found to have gallstones during the observation period. There was no mortality from gallstone-associated disease. Thirty patients developed morbidity from gallstones, including 25 cases of biliary colic, 3 of acute cholecystitis and 2 of pancreatitis, and there was 1 abnormal liver function test. Acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis were treated with conservative management followed by cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy was performed in 32 patients after transplant. Indications included symptomatic cholelithiasis in 31, and prophylactic cholecystectomy prior to kidney transplant in 1. The laparoscopic approach was performed in 25 of these 32 patients. There was no mortality from cholecystectomy, but there were 4 complications: surgical site infections (n = 2); wound dehiscence (n = 1); and bile duct injury (n = 1). Median hospital stay was 1 day.

Conclusions

Our expectant management for cholelithiasis after heart transplant resulted in no mortality or significant morbidity related to delay in treatment. Symptomatic cholelithiasis was successfully treated with cholecystectomy, mostly with the laparoscopic approach. We believe expectant management is safe for patients after heart transplant.

### Endoscopic management of biliary leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^112Usqqd]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the procedure of choice for management of symptomatic cholelithiasis. Although it has distinct advantages over open cholecystectomy, bile leak is more common. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the diagnostic and therapeutic modality of choice for management of postcholecystectomy bile leaks and has a high success rate with the placement of plastic biliary stents. Repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with placement of multiple plastic stents, a covered metal stent, or possibly cyanoacrylate therapy may be effective in refractory cases. This review will discuss the indications, efficacy, and complications of endoscopic therapy.

### National adherence to the ASGE-SAGES guidelines for managing suspected choledocholithiasis: an EAST multicenter study [^115HeZy2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons provide guidelines for managing suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones. We sought to evaluate adherence to the guidelines among patients with choledocholithiasis and/or acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) and to evaluate the ability of these guidelines to predict choledocholithiasis.

Methods

We prospectively identified patients undergoing same-admission cholecystectomy for choledocholithiasis and/or ABP from 2016 to 2019 at 12 United States medical centers. Predictors of suspected CBD stones were very strong (CBD stone on ultrasound; bilirubin > 4 mg/dL), strong (CBD > 6 mm; bilirubin ≥ 1.8 to ≤ 4 mg/dL), or moderate (abnormal liver function tests other than bilirubin; age > 55 years; ABP). Patients were grouped by probability of CBD stones: high (any very strong or both strong predictors), low (no predictors), or intermediate (any other predictor combination). The management of each probability group was compared with the recommended management in the guidelines.

Results

The cohort was comprised of 844 patients. High-probability patients had 64.3% (n = 238/370) deviation from guidelines, intermediate-probability patients had 29% (n = 132/455) deviation, and low-probability patients had 78.9% (n = 15/19) deviation. Acute biliary pancreatitis increased the odds of deviation for the high- (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.8; p = 0.03) and intermediate-probability groups (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.07–2.42; p = 0.02). Age older than 55 years (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.4–3.43; p < 0.001) also increased the odds of deviation for the intermediate group. A CBD greater than 6 mm predicted choledocholithiasis in the high (adjusted OR (aOR), 2.16; 95% CI, 1.17–3.97; p = 0.01) and intermediate group (aOR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.59–4.86; p < 0.001). Any very strong predictor (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.76–3.37; p < 0.0001) and both strong predictors predicted choledocholithiasis (aOR, 2; 95% CI, 1.35–2.96; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Almost 45% of patients with suspected CBD stones were managed discordantly from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines. We believe these guidelines warrant revision to better reflect the ability of the clinical variables at predicting choledocholithiasis.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis use and outcomes for children undergoing cholecystectomy [^114ydVXW]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Consensus guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America recommend against antimicrobial prophylaxis in the operative management of uncomplicated cholelithiasis; however, these guidelines were derived entirely from the adult surgical population.

Objective

To compare surgical site infection (SSI) outcomes between children undergoing cholecystectomy who received prophylaxis and those who did not.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cohort study using data from 141 hospitals participating in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric. Patients younger than 18 years who underwent cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis from January 2021 to December 2022 were identified. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, hematologic disorders, and emergent procedures.

Exposure

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics before incision.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were 30-day postoperative SSI and readmission. Propensity score weighting on the likelihood of receiving prophylaxis was used to balance groups on case acuity, duration of surgery, hospital discharge diagnosis, and patient characteristics. The association between outcomes and the use of prophylaxis was estimated using logistic regression models, weighted by the inverse probability of treatment with a random effect by hospital to control for hospital-level clustering. A secondary analysis was performed exploring the association between broad-spectrum prophylaxis and outcomes.

Results

Of 2234 children who met criteria for inclusion (median age, 15.3 years; 19.7% male [399 of 2025]), 2025 (90.6%) received prophylaxis (utilization rates ranged from 0% to 100% among hospitals). Cefazolin was the most commonly used antibiotic (69.2% [1401 of 2025]), and 559 of 2025 patients (27.6%) received extended-spectrum prophylaxis (compared with cefazolin). In the propensity-weighted cohort, SSI rates were lower for children who received prophylaxis compared with those who did not (18.0 of 2016 [0.9%] vs 7.8 of 212 [3.7%]; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11–0.70), and rates were similar between children receiving cefazolin and those receiving more extended-spectrum antibiotics in a secondary propensity-weighted analysis (13.9 of 1399 [1.0%] vs 2.9 of 558 [0.5%]; AOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.15–1.95).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this study support prophylaxis use for children undergoing nonemergent cholecystectomy; however, use of extended-spectrum antibiotics was not associated with superior outcomes compared with cefazolin alone. Opportunities to optimize infection prevention or antimicrobial stewardship were identified in more than one-third of all children undergoing cholecystectomy.

### Restrictive strategy vs usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones: 5-year follow-up of the SECURE randomized clinical trial [^1134RJ4A]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the predominant treatment for patients with abdominal pain and gallstones, resulting in approximately 700 000 operations in the United States each year. While complicated cholelithiasis (ie, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, biliary pancreatitis) is an indication for cholecystectomy, there is lack of consensus about patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis (cholecystolithiasis) for who will benefit from surgery. To investigate the appropriateness and the benefit from a stepwise selection for cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholelithiasis, the Scrutinizing (In)efficient Use of Cholecystectomy, A Randomized Trial Concerning Variation in Practice, (SECURE trial) was initiated.

The SECURE trial compared usual care vs a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on the Rome III criteria for biliary colic. Between 2014 and 2017, the trial included 1067 patients and showed that the primary outcome of pain reduction was suboptimal for both usual care and the restrictive strategy. The restrictive strategy was associated with a reduction in cholecystectomies by 7.7% compared with usual care, but noninferiority regarding patients without persistent pain was not demonstrated: 321 of 536 patients (59.9%) following usual care vs 298 of 529 (56.3%) after a restrictive strategy (noninferiority P = .32). Two other randomized trials compared pain in patients after cholecystectomy vs conservative treatment. A Norwegian single-center study (n = 137) investigated prevalence of symptomatic events and showed that a watchful waiting strategy was shown to be a feasible option in 31% of patients during 14 years of follow-up. A recent multicenter study in the UK randomizing 434 patients to receive conservative management or surgery showed that 25% of the participants in the conservative arm and 67% in the surgical arm had received surgery at the 18-month follow-up. While there was no difference observed in 36-item Short Form score (SF-36)–based bodily pain score, results were constrained by the high number of patients who declined to participate and the short-term follow-up.

### Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis at a safety net hospital: early surgeon involvement matters [^112Qx9Ba]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gallstones are a common diagnosis in the United States; though many patients remain asymptomatic, others develop symptoms. Standard of care for symptomatic cholelithiasis is cholecystectomy, but many do not undergo surgery. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence receipt of cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis at a safety net hospital.

Methods

This is a retrospective study performed at a large, academic, tertiary care and safety net state hospital. Patients who presented with symptomatic cholelithiasis were included. Same admission cholecystectomy and elective outpatient cholecystectomy were considered success/standard of care, and readmission cholecystectomy or no cholecystectomy were considered failures/not standard of care.

Results

Of 376 patients, a substantial minority were Spanish speaking, and almost half had public insurance. 23.7% were successfully treated, and 76.3% had failure in management. A larger number of patients in the group that had successful treatment had surgery consultation, 67.4%. Only 28.5% of patients saw a surgeon as an outpatient within 30 days of their visit. On multivariable analysis, patients who were provided a surgery consultation were more likely to receive standard of care. Age, sex, language, smoking status, lack of insurance, and alcohol use were not associated.

Conclusion

Surgery consultation during presentation for symptomatic cholelithiasis was associated with receipt of same admission, or outpatient elective cholecystectomy, or successful management. There should be a low threshold to involve a surgeon for symptomatic cholelithiasis.

### Comparing percutaneous treatment and cholecystectomy outcomes in acute cholecystitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hQU7U]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common and significant condition marked by inflammation of the gallbladder, most often resulting from the obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones. This blockage leads to bile stasis, gallbladder distension, and, ultimately, an inflammatory response that can escalate if untreated. The condition is a major contributor to acute abdominal pain presentations in emergency settings and frequently necessitates prompt medical attention, often culminating in surgical intervention. The disease not only poses a substantial burden on healthcare systems but also represents a critical condition that requires timely diagnosis and management to prevent severe complications, such as gallbladder gangrene, perforation, or systemic sepsis. The urgency of treatment is underscored by the fact that delayed intervention can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The estimated overall prevalence of gallstones is 10–15% in the general population, with some differences across countries. Between 20 and 40% of patients with gallstones will develop gallstone-related complications, with an incidence of 1–3% annually; acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) is the first clinical presentation in 10–15% of the cases. Gallstones, a primary risk factor, are implicated in approximately 85% of cases. The prevalence of AC correlates strongly with advancing age, particularly among individuals over 60, where up to 30% may have cholelithiasis. This condition not only heightens the risk of cholecystitis but also underscores the importance of targeted prevention and management strategies in older populations.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114StrkJ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of conservative management compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the prevention of symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

Design

Parallel group, pragmatic randomised, superiority trial.

Setting

20 secondary care centres in the UK.

Participants

434 adults (> 18 years) with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease referred to secondary care, assessed for eligibility between August 2016 and November 2019, and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive conservative management or laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Interventions

Conservative management or surgical removal of the gallbladder.

Main outcome measures

The primary patient outcome was quality of life, measured by area under the curve, over 18 months using the short form 36 (SF-36) bodily pain domain, with higher scores (range 0–100) indicating better quality of life. Other outcomes included costs to the NHS, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

Results

Of 2667 patients assessed for eligibility, 434 were randomised: 217 to the conservative management group and 217 to the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. By 18 months, 54 (25%) participants in the conservative management arm and 146 (67%) in the cholecystectomy arm had received surgery. The mean SF-36 norm based bodily pain score was 49.4 (standard deviation 11.7) in the conservative management arm and 50.4 (11.6) in the cholecystectomy arm. The SF-36 bodily pain area under the curve up to 18 months did not differ (mean difference 0.0, 95% confidence interval −1.7 to 1.7; P = 1.00). Conservative management was less costly (mean difference −£1033, (−$1334; −€1205), 95% credible interval −£1413 to −£632) and QALYs did not differ (mean difference −0.019, 95% credible interval −0.06 to 0.02).

Conclusions

In the short term (≤ 18 months), laparoscopic surgery is no more effective than conservative management for adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, and as such conservative management should be considered as an alternative to surgery. From an NHS perspective, conservative management may be cost effective for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease. As costs, complications, and benefits will continue to be incurred in both groups beyond 18 months, future research should focus on longer term follow-up to establish effectiveness and lifetime cost effectiveness and to identify the cohort of patients who should be routinely offered surgery.

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

C-GALL was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, patient randomised, superiority trial to test if the strategy of standard, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is more effective and cost effective than conservative management. The trial protocol was published in 2021.

We recruited patients from 20 secondary care sites in the UK. Potential participants were adults aged > 18 years with confirmed, symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease (ie, biliary colic or acute cholecystitis) who were electively referred to secondary care and considered suitable for cholecystectomy. Clinical diagnosis of gallstone disease was confirmed by appropriate imaging. Patients who were unable to consent, medically unfit for surgery, pregnant, or had had previous open major upper abdominal surgery were not eligible for the trial. Also excluded were patients with gallstones in the common bile duct, evidence of previous choledocholithiasis, a history of acute pancreatitis, evidence of obstructive jaundice, evidence of empyema of the gallbladder with sepsis, suspicion of gallbladder cancer, perforated gallbladder (recent or old perforation detected on imaging), or haemolytic disease.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either laparoscopic cholecystectomy or conservative management using the remote, computer based randomisation application at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials. The minimisation algorithm used recruitment site, sex (male, female), and age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years). A random element (20% chance) was incorporated into the minimisation algorithm. Participants, investigators, and the trial statistician were not masked to treatment allocation.

### Investigating the shared genetic information between serum concentration levels of liver enzymes and cholelithiasis [^116JpNxi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholelithiasis is a prevalent digestive disorder, affecting approximately 6% of the global population. Typical symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. The disease can be classified into symptomatic and asymptomatic types. For asymptomatic cases, surgical intervention is usually avoided to prevent complications. Instead, regular follow-ups with physical exams and ultrasounds are recommended to monitor risks such as gallbladder cancer. For symptomatic patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment to prevent complications like cholecystitis or pancreatitis. However, even after gallbladder removal, patients may experience declines in health and quality of life. This also imposes financial burdens on both individuals and healthcare systems. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing cholelithiasis is crucial, with a strong emphasis on prevention.

Liver injury, caused by factors such as alcohol consumption and hepatitis virus infection, impairs hepatocyte function and disrupts liver physiology. Research indicates a higher incidence of cholelithiasis in individuals with liver cirrhosis, suggesting a potential link between liver injury and cholelithiasis. However, most of this evidence originates from observational studies. Therefore, a definitive causal relationship remains unproven, and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.

### Management of obesity across women's life course: FIGO best practice advice [^112f3JEC]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

4 LIFELONG HEALTH IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN LIVING WITH OBESITY

As shown in Figure 1, obesity can affect many aspects of a woman's health beyond pregnancy. This section highlights key areas for providers of women's health care. Cardiovascular health, diabetes mellitus, COVID‐19 and pandemic considerations, and fertility are covered elsewhere.

4.1 Gastrointestinal and liver diseases

Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

The prevalence of NAFLD increases with increasing BMI. A higher incidence of gestational diabetes and early pregnancy miscarriages exists among women with NAFLD.NAFLD can develop into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis over 5–7 years, leading to fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the second most common cause of liver transplantation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Women with NAFLD could benefit from assessment 6–12 weeks after giving birth to avoid long‐term liver complications.

Cholelithiasis

Obesity, female sex, and multiparity are associated with increased risk of cholelithiasis. Women choosing to manage obesity with rapid weight loss interventions and/or surgery have a paradoxical increased risk of cholelithiasis. Therefore, screening women with class III obesity for cholelithiasis and complications of cholelithiasis, such as cholecystitis and pancreatitis secondary to choledocholithiasis, following weight loss interventions is recommended.

4.2 Micronutrient deficiency without weight loss surgery

Obesity, particularly class III obesity, is associated with several micronutrient deficiencies. This is likely due to aberrations in absorptive, metabolic, and hormonal functions in these individuals. The most common deficiencies among this group include folate, vitamins B1, B12, A, and C, and iron. Such deficiencies may be exacerbated by pregnancy. Thus, dietary and blood screening of micronutrient levels with appropriate supplementation may be necessary.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^116LRZq7]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

The results of the C-GALL trial add to existing evidence. Two small Norwegian randomised controlled trials with a total of 201 participants found that 55% of people randomised to observation did not require an operation during the 14 year follow-up period, and 12% of people randomised to cholecystectomy did not undergo the scheduled procedure. This contrasts with 70% randomised to conservative management not undergoing surgery at 24 months in the current trial and 30% in the surgery group not undergoing cholecystectomy.

The SECURE (restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain) trialwas a non-inferiority multicentre randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands to assess the effects of immediate cholecystectomy versus a restrictive strategy. Participants underwent cholecystectomy only when they fulfilled five prespecified surgery criteria at clinic visits. The authors reported that 7.7% fewer patients had cholecystectomies with the restrictive strategy, but 37% in both groups continued with abdominal pain. The investigators concluded that the current surgical management of patients with gallstone disease and abdominal symptoms is suboptimal, that a restrictive policy is not a solution, and that doctors need to be more careful in advising a surgical approach to patients with symptoms of gallstone disease. The findings of the C-GALL trial are consistent with the conclusions of the SECURE trial and provide stronger evidence from a broader range of patients, as the current trial enrolled participants with biliary colic or acute cholecystitis (SECURE only focused on biliary colic).

Policy implications

Current clinical guidelines recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary pain or acute cholecystitis and radiological evidence of gallstones. Hence, laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the first line treatment for people with symptomatic gallstone disease and is one of the most common elective surgical procedures performed in the NHS. The C-GALL trial found that in adults presenting with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease to secondary care, conservative management may be effective and cost effective than surgery. The study found it is safe to manage patients conservatively for at least 18 months. The crossover between groups suggested that it remains key to identifying patients who require surgery. As healthcare professionals often underestimate surgical risks, and post-cholecystectomy syndrome may occur, a discussion about conservative management should form part of a patient's decision making and consent process.

### Management of gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114TTh3j]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Without appropriate and timely treatment, patients are at increased risk of disease progression and recurrence. While there is increasing consensus among guidelines for the management of mild GSP, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. In addition, there is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis.

Observations

The management of GSP continues to evolve and is dependent on severity of acute pancreatitis and concomitant biliary diagnoses. Across the spectrum of severity, there is evidence that goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation decreases the risk of fluid overload and mortality compared with aggressive resuscitation. Patients with isolated, mild GSP should undergo same-admission cholecystectomy; early cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission has been supported by several randomized clinical trials. Cholecystectomy should be delayed for patients with severe disease; for severe and moderately severe disease, the optimal timing remains unclear. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is only useful for patients with suspected cholangitis or biliary obstruction, although the concomitance of these conditions in patients with GSP is rare. Modality of evaluation of the common bile duct to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis varies and should be tailored to level of concern based on objective measures, such as laboratory results and imaging findings. Among these modalities, intraoperative cholangiography is associated with reduced length of stay and decreased use of ERCP. However, the benefit of routine intraoperative cholangiography remains in question.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment of GSP is dependent on disease severity, which can be difficult to assess. A comprehensive review of clinically relevant evidence and recommendations on GSP severity grading, fluid resuscitation, timing of cholecystectomy, need for ERCP, and evaluation and management of persistent choledocholithiasis can help guide clinicians in diagnosis and management.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kJknF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this systematic review, we have identified 6 diagnostic guidelines predicting CBDS in patients with acute biliary presentation. Of these, there is sufficient data in the literature for the meta‐analysis of the original ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines. All three guidelines stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk categories for CBDS, and are similar in their management recommendations.

When the guidelines are used to distinguish patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, both iterations of ASGE guidelines have excellent pooled sensitivities of 95%–97% for CBDS, while that of the ESGE guidelines is lower at 84%. The observed difference may reflect the inclusion of patients older than 55 as intermediate risk in both ASGE but not the ESGE guidelines, even though age was found to be a nonspecific and minimally predictive criterion in a meta‐analysis of predictor performance by Wang et al. These high sensitivities can be utilized to advantage clinically, because a low‐risk classification can reliably rule out most CBDS and allow low‐risk individuals to proceed to cholecystectomy without additional investigations. At this diagnostic threshold, all guidelines have poor specificities for CBDS from 7% to 15% only, resulting in many patients classified as at least intermediate risk thus prompting for additional investigations.

Data extraction and management

All relevant details were extracted from the studies included, using a specific data extraction form. Data extracted include study characteristics (study design, location of study etc), participant characteristics (age, gender, duration of symptoms and timing of surgery), intervention, comparators and treatment outcomes (gallstone symptoms and complications, surgical complications). All the data for pooling were extracted as reported in the primary studies. For quality control, data extraction was performed by one reviewer and cross checked by another reviewer (BSB, MH). Any discrepancies between authors were resolved by discussion and consulting with a third reviewer (AS), whenever necessary. The extracted data were checked and used for further analysis after confirmation of its consistency.

We assessed the risk of bias using a revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB-2 tool) for randomised trial. RoB-2 tool comprises five domains: bias arising from randomisation process, deviation from intended intervention, missing outcome data, bias in the measurement of outcome and selection of reported results. The judgement regarding the risk of bias was determined by means of signalling questions with responses as 'yes', 'probably yes', 'probably no', 'no' and 'no information'. Two authors (MH and KVJ) independently assessed the risk of bias; later, a consensus was reached for any disagreement through discussion. However, a third reviewer's opinion (BSB) was obtained wherever necessary. The overall risk of bias was ascertained as high, some concerns or low for each study.

Statistical analysis

Risk ratio along with its 95% CI was estimated for each complication from individual studies. Subsequently, risk ratios were pooled across studies using a random effects DerSimonian and Laird method considering possible heterogeneity across studies. For continuous variables, such as operation time and duration of hospital stay, mean difference and its 95% CI were estimated for individual studies and then pooled using a random-effects DerSimonian and Laird method. While performing the analysis, zero cells were corrected by adding 0.5.

### Male gender: risk factor for severe symptomatic cholelithiasis [^113ryXg6]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of male gender on the clinical presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been accepted as standard procedure for the management of symptomatic cholelithiasis even when the gallbladder is acutely inflamed. With the accumulated experience in the management of acute cholecystitis, some factors including male gender were recognized to influence the clinical presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis and increase the conversion rate during LC. This retrospective study tried to clarify the correlation between male gender and the clinical presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis. The medical records of all patients presenting with symptomatic cholelithiasis from January 1994 to August 1999 were evaluated. These cases were divided into four groups as follows: (1) elective LC group: patients with a history of biliary colic or acute attack of cholecystitis but whose LC was performed electively without any inflammatory change in the gallbladder during operation; (2) acute LC group: patients presenting with acute cholecystitis, and LC was performed successfully without conversion; (3) acute conversion group: patients who underwent LC during the course of acute cholecystitis but the procedure were disturbed by severe inflammatory change so they were converted to open surgery; (4) acute open group: patients whose acute cholecystitis was managed by direct open surgery due to the preoperative prediction that LC would not succeed. The correlation of gender, age, and operating time were assessed among these four groups. We found that: (1) the male/female ratio increased (in the patient group sequence of simple LC, acute LC, acute open, and acute conversion group); (2) in the acute LC group male patients had significantly (p = 0.04, t-test) longer operating time than females; (3) although there was no significant difference between the mean age of male (55.7 ± 13.4) and female (56.3 ± 15.7) patients in the acute cholecystitis groups (i.e., all patients in the acute LC, acute conversion, and acute open groups), the distribution curve by age in male patients showed a significantly shift to a younger age compared with female patients (p = 0.009, Fisher's exact test).

### Gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114wzfdN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the Western world. In most cases, gallstone pancreatitis is a mild and self-limiting disease, and patients may proceed without complications to cholecystectomy to prevent future recurrence. Severe disease occurs in about 20% of cases and is associated with significant mortality; meticulous management is critical. A thorough understanding of the disease process, diagnosis, severity stratification, and principles of management is essential to the appropriate care of patients presenting with this disease. This article reviews these topics with a focus on surgical management, including appropriate timing and choice of interventions.

### Cost-effectiveness of a new strategy to identify uncomplicated gallstone disease patients that will benefit from a cholecystectomy [^114xLqT4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Effectiveness of an intervention is often reported in cost-effectiveness studies as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). However, abdominal pain is the most characteristic feature of uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and therefore the main aim of cholecystectomy in this patient group. In addition, absence of pain after cholecystectomy is the main predictor of a patient-reported successful outcome of the operation. The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, a patient-reported outcome measure computing quality of life, may not be sufficiently disease-specific. Abdominal pain, for example, is equally scored as flatulence in this questionnaire. Other patient-reported outcome measures computing quality of life are not different in weighing persistent abdominal pain. Furthermore, a quality of life score is less applicable in surgical practice compared to presence or absence of abdominal pain. We therefore selected absence of postoperative abdominal pain as effectiveness outcome.

This study must be considered within the context of some limitations. First, the criteria for selection for cholecystectomy remain non-specific, although they are more specific than current practice entirely based on the surgeons' preference. Second, the criteria of the new strategy were not externally validated, although this may have been challenging to perform due to strong treatment preferences of patients and surgeons. Third, we focused on uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis patients. Patients with complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis were not considered. Exclusion of complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis may not have had a large impact as the patient group with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis only have an annual 1–3% risk on complications because of the stones. Furthermore, the observation group of a randomized controlled trial of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis did not suffer complications during 14 years of follow-up. Fourth, we excluded patients having a bile duct injury as this specific complication of cholecystectomy has a low incidence of 0.04–1.5%. Fifth, we did not consider additional diagnostic work-up because of lack of data, variability, and patient-dependency. Finally, the new strategy was evaluated from a healthcare perspective for a time horizon of 1 year. If a societal perspective would be taken into account, the restrictive care strategy of having one out of two criteria satisfied would probably be even more cost-effective, because this strategy was more effective in terms of relief of abdominal pain and it prevented cholecystectomies, probably preventing sick leave. Especially, patients with ongoing abdominal pain after cholecystectomy would continue to seek medical help with additional diagnostic interventions.

### Surgical treatment of… [^114Hy2fD]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Surgical Treatment of Gallstone Disease Cholecystectomy remains the primary procedure for the management of symptomatic gallstone disease. It is safe, has the lowest risk of recurrence, and provides 92 percent of patients with complete relief of their biliary pain. 10 Indications for cholecystectomy are listed in Table 3. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy continues to have numerous advantages compared with the open technique, and the safety of the laparoscopic approach to the treatment of gallstone disease in various patient populations is gaining clinical acceptance |Thickened gallbladder wall| Historically, early surgery for acute cholecystitis was discouraged. Patients were treated medically with intravenous fluid, antibiotics, and analgesics until the inflammation in the gallbladder resolved, and then elective cholecystectomy was performed.

However, more than 20 percent of patients fail to respond to medical management or experience recurrent cholecystitis during the intervening period. Based on these findings, once the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is made, the patient should be resuscitated with intravenous fluids, concomitant medical problems should be stabilized, and cholecystectomy should be performed at the earliest available time. Patients with acute cholecystitis who are critically ill or otherwise at very high risk for surgical complications should be managed medically with intravenous fluid, antibiotics, and analgesics; if this treatment fails, a percutaneous cholecystostomy should be considered. This procedure has been shown to achieve clinical improvement in 80 percent of patients within five days after placement.

19 Patients with common bile duct stones will most likely present with biliary pain, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis in combination with bile duct dilation, and/or elevated liver function tests. 19 Essential elements for treating choledocholithiasis involve gallbladder removal and clearance of retained common bile duct stones. Results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial. Although the studies on cholecystectomy in patients with Child class C cirrhosis are not large enough to yield significant results, unacceptably high mortality rates have been reported. Therefore, it is generally agreed that a more conservative approach is warranted in patients with Child class C cirrhosis and symptomatic gallstone disease, directing treatment toward improving their liver function before cholecystectomy.
