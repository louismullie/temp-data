## Question

Adult hydration recommendations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about adult hydration recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between total water intake and drinking water only. Then, I should verify population-level adequate intake recommendations and their evidentiary basis. Next, I will examine individualized factors that modify needs, including activity, environment, age, and disease. After that, I need to check practical monitoring strategies and the role of urine markers. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a pragmatic, safety-conscious approach with clear caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction so I don't conflate terms. Total water intake includes water from beverages plus water in foods and metabolic water, whereas drinking water refers to fluids consumed as beverages; in sedentary adults in temperate climates, roughly 20–30% of total water comes from food, so a 2.5–3.0 L/day total water target corresponds to about 2.0–2.3 L/day from fluids, which is why "8 cups a day" is a simplification that often approximates fluid-only intake rather than total water needs [^f82e61c8] [^858849f5].

> Next, I should review authoritative population recommendations and their basis. The European Food Safety Authority proposes about 2.5 L/day total water for men and 2.0 L/day for women aged 14–70 years, with approximately 80% from fluids, while the U.S. Institute of Medicine sets 3.7 L/day for men and 2.7 L/day for women aged 19–70 years, again including water from foods; importantly, these figures are derived from population median intakes and theoretical renal solute load models rather than randomized trials demonstrating health outcomes, which limits their precision for individuals [^858849f5] [^58e045d7] [^d9dc2f69].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "optimal" intake. I need to ensure I incorporate modifiers that shift needs upward or downward. Physical activity, heat exposure, altitude, and high solute diets increase water turnover and thus fluid requirements, whereas older age, sedentary behavior, and certain comorbidities may reduce needs or alter risk profiles; a large doubly labeled water analysis shows water turnover varies widely across individuals and declines with age, reinforcing that fixed targets are inadequate and that individualized estimates can be substantially higher or lower than population averages [^fd4459d1] [^858849f5].

> I will now examine practical monitoring because intake alone is an incomplete proxy of hydration. Wait, let me verify the utility of urine markers. Urine specific gravity less than about 1.020, urine osmolality less than about 500 mOsm/kg, and pale yellow urine color generally indicate adequate hydration in free-living adults, but I should double-check that these are interpreted in context, as high solute intake, diuretics, or recent exercise can confound interpretation; importantly, no single urine marker reliably detects mild dehydration in older adults, so combining urine indices with weight change and thirst yields a more robust assessment [^df80ce43] [^58e045d7] [^ab47c44a].

> Let me consider older adults specifically, since thirst is blunted and dehydration risk is higher. I should confirm that daily fluid requirements may be lower than in younger adults, yet many older adults still under-consume relative to needs; encouraging frequent small drinks, preferred beverages, and environmental cues can modestly increase intake, and when oral intake is inadequate, subcutaneous fluids can be a safer alternative to intravenous hydration in some settings, though evidence for hard outcomes remains limited [^4d3a9e1b] [^f0c6f3bc].

> Next, I should review exercise and heat, where misapplication of "drink to thirst" can be risky. The Wilderness Medical Society and IOC recommend a drink-to-thirst approach for most exertional contexts to avoid both dehydration and overhydration, with a practical guardrail to limit body mass loss to less than about 2% during activity; for athletes training in the heat, pre-exercise euhydration and individualized sweat-rate–based plans are prudent, and urine color or specific gravity can be used to track status when collected under standardized conditions [^b5e372ea] [^df80ce43] [^a5e21b33].

> But wait, what if the patient has a disease-specific indication to push fluids? I need to check those. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, guidelines suggest 2–3 L/day of water to maintain dilute urine and reduce vasopressin-driven cyst growth, with individualized assessment for fluid retention or hyponatremia risk; in primary hyperoxaluria, hyperhydration of 3.5–4 L/day is recommended to reduce stone risk; in acute diarrheal illness, reduced-osmolarity oral rehydration solution is first-line for mild-to-moderate dehydration; and in hypercalcemia of malignancy, aggressive isotonic IV hydration is foundational therapy, illustrating that "adequate intake" is context-dependent and sometimes supraphysiologic [^f7460f5a] [^21415af0] [^e60fa080] [^047d4211].

> I should double-check the evidence quality so I don't overstate certainty. Population intake recommendations are largely observational and theoretical, and a recent systematic review of randomized trials testing increased water intake found limited and heterogeneous effects on clinical outcomes, underscoring that we lack definitive, universal intake targets; thus, recommendations should be framed as individualized, risk-stratified, and monitored rather than fixed-volume prescriptions [^d9dc2f69] [^867eb3ee].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic approach while keeping these caveats in mind. For most healthy, sedentary adults in temperate environments, aiming for about 2.0–2.5 L/day of total water, recognizing that roughly 0.5–0.7 L comes from food, implies about 1.3–2.0 L/day from fluids, with adjustment upward for activity, heat, high solute intake, or illness, and downward for older age or medical constraints; monitor with urine color/specific gravity, thirst, and occasional weight tracking, and prioritize plain water while limiting sugar-sweetened and highly caffeinated beverages; in older adults, proactively address barriers to intake and consider assisted strategies if oral intake is inadequate [^858849f5] [^df80ce43] [^4d3a9e1b].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety messages are explicit. Overhydration can precipitate hyponatremia, particularly in endurance events or when thirst is blunted, so "drink to thirst" is a useful default that balances risks; in older adults, avoid relying on single signs like dry mouth or urine color alone to diagnose dehydration, and use a composite approach; and in disease-specific scenarios, align fluid targets with guideline-directed therapy and monitor electrolytes and volume status to avoid iatrogenic harm [^7603056d] [^ab47c44a] [^f7460f5a].

Adult hydration should be **individualized** to body size, activity, climate, and health status, with a typical baseline of **about 3.7 L/day for men and 2.7 L/day for women** (including fluids from foods and beverages) [^858849f5] [^58730049]. For most healthy adults, **drink to thirst** is sufficient; during exercise or heat, aim to limit weight loss to ≤ 2% and replace fluids and electrolytes as needed [^b5e372ea] [^df80ce43]. Older adults, athletes, and those with kidney, heart, or liver disease need tailored guidance; monitor urine color (pale yellow), frequency, and thirst to gauge adequacy [^df80ce43] [^fc93cc13].

---

## General hydration recommendations

- **Total water intake**: About 3.7 L/day for men and 2.7 L/day for women, including fluids from foods and beverages [^858849f5] [^58730049].
- **Fluids from beverages**: Roughly 3.0 L/day for men and 2.2 L/day for women [^notfound].
- **Fluids from foods**: About 0.7 L/day (20% of total intake) [^33329e2d].

---

## Individualized factors influencing hydration needs

Hydration needs vary with **body size and composition** — larger individuals and those with more muscle mass require more fluids — and with **physical activity**, as exercise increases sweat losses and fluid needs [^df80ce43]. Environmental conditions such as heat, humidity, and altitude also raise requirements, and health status — including kidney, heart, or liver disease, diabetes, and pregnancy — further modifies needs [^fd4459d1] [^56d7ae96].

---

## Hydration strategies for specific populations

### Older adults

- **Risk**: Higher dehydration risk due to blunted thirst, reduced kidney function, and medications [^c7d89092].
- **Strategy**: Encourage regular, small fluid intake; monitor urine color and frequency [^f0c6f3bc].

---

### Athletes and active individuals

- **Pre-exercise**: Start euhydrated; monitor urine color and body weight [^df80ce43].
- **During exercise**: Drink to thirst; limit weight loss to ≤ 2% [^b5e372ea].
- **Post-exercise**: Replace 150% of fluid losses (about 1.5 L per kg lost) [^notfound].

---

### Individuals with chronic conditions

In chronic kidney disease, **individualize intake** to balance hydration with fluid restrictions [^notfound]. In heart failure, **limit fluids** to avoid overload. In liver disease, tailor intake to prevent both dehydration and fluid retention.

---

## Signs of adequate hydration

- **Urine color**: Pale yellow (specific gravity ≤ 1.020) [^df80ce43].
- **Urine frequency**: Regular, adequate output.
- **Thirst**: Minimal or absent.

---

## Risks of inadequate hydration

Inadequate hydration can cause **acute effects** — such as fatigue, dizziness, cognitive impairment, and reduced physical performance — and **chronic effects**, including kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and chronic kidney disease [^58730049] [^14454c11].

---

## Risks of overhydration

Overhydration can cause **hyponatremia** (water intoxication), particularly in endurance athletes or those with impaired renal function [^7603056d] [^44e98daa].

---

## Practical hydration tips

- **Carry a reusable bottle**: Encourage regular sipping.
- **Flavor water**: Add lemon, cucumber, or mint to improve palatability.
- **Eat hydrating foods**: Fruits, vegetables, and soups contribute fluids [^33329e2d].
- **Monitor urine**: Use color and frequency to gauge hydration [^df80ce43].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Population** | **Recommended fluid intake** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 3.7 L/day (men); 2.7 L/day (women) | Individualize based on activity, climate, health |
| Older adults | 2.5–3.0 L/day | - Blunted thirst <br/> - Monitor urine color |
| Athletes | Drink to thirst; limit ≤ 2% weight loss | Replace 150% of losses post-exercise |
| Pregnant women | 3.0 L/day | Increased needs for fetal development |

Adult hydration should be **personalized** to body size, activity, climate, and health status, with a typical baseline of about 3.7 L/day for men and 2.7 L/day for women (including fluids from foods and beverages) [^858849f5] [^58730049]. For most healthy adults, **drink to thirst** is sufficient; during exercise or heat, aim to limit weight loss to ≤ 2% and replace fluids and electrolytes as needed [^b5e372ea] [^df80ce43]. Older adults, athletes, and those with kidney, heart, or liver disease need tailored guidance; monitor urine color (pale yellow), frequency, and thirst to gauge adequacy [^df80ce43] [^fc93cc13].

### Hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat [^4c100557]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Where do we go from here?

With only limited published research and reported on-court hydration and thermal strain responses and profiles in youth and adult tennis, we are far from a full appreciation of the related challenges facing players and being able to confidently prescribe definitive heat safety and optimal performance protocols for all scenarios and environmental conditions. That is, much more research needs to be carried out to better appreciate the broader scope and full extent of the physiological demands and hydration and thermal strain challenges facing junior and adult players in various environments, venues and competition scenarios. This is essential before more specific and all-inclusive evidence-based guidelines for optimally enhancing safety and performance can be established. For example, a more comprehensive and clear perspective of court surface and variation in reflective heat on respective differences in intensity, pace and duration of play and consequent influences on thermal strain would be helpful to players and tournament officials and staff. And while no sex-specific differences in on-court thermal strain were noted in the studies cited here, potential differences and contributing factors should be examined further. Accordingly, it needs to be recognised that currently established general recommendations for maintaining hydration and minimising on-court thermal strain and exertional heat illness risk in youth and adultshave a limited field-supported, sport-specific (tennis) evidence base.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^d9dc2f69]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Water is a major constituent of the human body and is considered an essential nutrient that cannot be sufficiently produced by metabolism. The National Academy of Medicine suggests a daily fluid intake of approximately 13 eight-ounce cups for men and 9 for women, respectively. A common public health-related recommendation is to drink 8 cups of water per day, yet the supporting evidence is not clear. Given the wide variability of body weight, activity level, and health status at the population level and the numerous mechanisms that regulate water balance, a single optimal amount of daily water consumption is a challenging concept.

Behavioral factors and hydration status have been widely studied in relation to health conditions owing to the known detrimental effects of dehydration. To our knowledge, there has been no study to compile reports of the benefits of water interventions on clinical outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the impact of increased daily water consumption on health-related outcomes.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^858849f5]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To maintain adequate hydration status, several countries and public organizations have proposed water intake recommendations for the public. These recommendations have been determined based on data from population studies and accounted for water from beverage and food sources. For instance, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), based on data from population studies from 13 European countries, proposed the dietary reference values (DRV) for the adequate intake (AI) of water which increases with age up to 2.5 L and 2.0 L of water daily for men and women (aged 14 to 70 years), respectively. Similarly, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed increasing water intake levels with age up to 3.7 L/day and 2.7 L/day (aged 19 to 70 years) in men and women, respectively. Yet, the World Health Organization and other guidelines related to cognitive health do not currently include recommendations related to water intake or hydration status. Further understanding of health behaviors, such as cognitive functioning, related to something as fundamental as water intake can have a substantial impact on public health.

Inadequate water intake and dehydration have been associated with existing signs of cognitive impairment among older adults living in long-term care facilities. Moreover, acute studies have shown that dehydration and water supplementation affect mood and cognitive performance. However, fluid and water intake has received limited attention in epidemiological studies, and the literature scarcely examines water intake as a predictor of cognitive performance among older adults. The few studies that have assessed hydration status as a potential predictor of cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults have been inconclusive. Furthermore, to date, few studies have prospectively captured and examined the impact of water and hydration status on cognitive function over a multi-year period. Therefore, the objective of the present analyses was to prospectively investigate the relation between hydration status, water intake, and 2-year changes in cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^14454c11]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Water is essential for a wide variety of physiological functions, and water intake must be sufficient to compensate for daily losses. Low daily water intake and low urine output increase long-term risk of kidney dysfunction, and insufficient intake may also have a role in the development of hyperglycemia. Guidelines for adequate total water intake for the general adult population have been proposed by several international governing bodies. Yet, these recommendations are based on population median water intakes, with limited consideration of links between water intake and hydration status and without links between water intake and health. Moreover, the recommendations do not provide a method for individuals to ensure they are consuming enough water to meet their specific hydration needs.

Establishing the adequacy of fluid intake based on physiological indicators of hydration is challenging, because there are multiple biological indicators of hydration in average adults in free-living conditions, each sensitive to a different aspect of hydration. The accurate measurement of hydration status is complicated because body water turnover occurs constantly and water moves between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Proposed biomarkers of hydration include the direct measurement of blood, urine, saliva and tears, as well as estimates of body water via bioelectrical impedance or spectroscopy. No single method appears to be ideal for all situations. Serum osmolality is considered a good marker for acute or critical dehydration situations, but is tightly regulated and insensitive to mild hydration deficits in healthy sedentary individuals with ad libitum access to fluids. In contrast, urinary hydration biomarkers do vary according to fluid intake, and are biologically significant in terms of predicting health outcomes such as chronic kidney disease.

### Nutrition in pressure injury prevention [^33329e2d]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Diet and hydration guidance for individuals at risk of pressure injuries — It is good practice to encourage individuals at risk of a pressure injury to consume a balanced diet that includes nutrient dense food and adequate hydration. For most individuals, nutritional requirements can be met with a healthy oral diet, and dietary/nutrition guidelines outline recommended dietary intake based on individualized circumstances (e.g., medical condition, lifestyle, demographics, geographic context, etc.). In healthy individuals who are adequately hydrated, water released from food and metabolism accounts for 20% or more of total water intake.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^58e045d7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Finally, the strong relation between fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers, notably 24hU osmolality, provides an opportunity to revisit the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in establishing its total water intake guidelines for adults (2.5 and 2.0 l per day of total water for men and women, respectively, with ∼80% coming from fluids). EFSA bases its water daily reference values on observed intakes as well as relative to a 'desirable' urine osmolarity of 500 mOsm/l, calculated from the renal solute load derived from European dietary surveys. The EFSA recommendations incorporated a calculation of the theoretical amount of water required to excrete solute at a urine osmolarity of < 500 mOsm/l. Osmolarity (expressed in mOsm/l) and osmolality (expressed in mOsm/kg) are not synonymous; however, the difference between the two is negligible in solutions of low concentration. Thus, our study data provided an opportunity to test the cutoff of 500 mOsm/kg relative to daily fluid intake. Overall, the calculations and recommendations made by EFSA were well adapted to the majority of adults in our sample. On days when subjects met or exceeded EFSA reference value for water from fluid, urine osmolality was < 500 mOsm/kg 80% of the time. Similarly, urine osmolality exceeded 500 mOsm/kg in 82% of the cases where fluid intake was inferior to daily recommendations. It is worth noting, however, that the reference values for daily water intake may not be sufficient to ensure a low urine osmolality in ∼20% of the population, which is nonetheless substantial. This underscores the large interindividual variability in daily water needs, as well as the necessity of developing biomarkers for adequate fluid intake that are tailored to physiological indicators.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^4d3a9e1b]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As dehydration is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in older people, its recognition and treatment is important. While individual clinical signs and bedside tests are limited in diagnostic value, a holistic clinical evaluation should still be recommended. Serum osmolality has a role in the diagnosis in hypertonic dehydration with further studies required to evaluate point of care testing. Daily fluid requirements may be lower than previously recommended, but this evidence is weaker for older people. While oral hydration is usually the preferred method, the subcutaneous rate offers reasonable rates of fluid absorption and has the advantage over intravenous routes of having much fewer adverse effects. As complex interventions, behavioural and environmental strategies may result in small increases in fluid intake but are limited by motivation and longevity.

### Daily water intake among US men and women, 2009–2012… [^58730049]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

- Among U. S. adults, men consumed an average of 3. 46 liters of water per day, and women consumed
2. 75 liters per day.
- Men aged 60 and over consumed less water than men aged 20–39 and 40–59. Similarly, women aged 60 and over consumed less water than women aged 20–39 and 40–59. Water is an essential nutrient for life. Institute of Medicine recommendations from 2004 set adequate levels for total water intake from all foods and liquids at 3. 7 liters for men and
2. 7 liters for women. Consuming inadequate amounts of water increases the risk of dehydration, kidney stones, and poorer cognitive performance. Total water intake was lowest among both men and women aged 60 and over compared with younger age groups. Men aged 20–39 and 40–59 consumed significantly more water per day than men aged 60 and over.

Women aged 20–39 consumed 2. 78 L of total water per day, while those aged 40–59 consumed significantly more, and those aged 60 and over consumed significantly less. On average, men aged 20–39 and 40–59 consumed water at about the recommended adequate intake level of 3. 7 L, while those aged 60 and over consumed
0. 78 L less water than the recommended adequate intake. Women aged 20–39 consumed water at about the adequate intake level of 2. 7 L, while women aged 40–59 consumed
0. 2 L more than the adequate intake, and women aged 60 and over consumed 0. 19 L less than the recommended adequate intake. Previous studies have shown that adults aged 60 and over are among the most vulnerable to dehydration. This report found that men aged 60 and over consumed 2. 92 L, roughly
0. 8 L less than the adequate intake, and women aged 60 and over consumed 2. 51 L, approximately
0. 2 L less.

### Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration [^1b42cdd1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

How much water we really need depends on water functions and the mechanisms of daily water balance regulation. The aim of this review is to describe the physiology of water balance and consequently to highlight the new recommendations with regard to water requirements. Water has numerous roles in the human body. It acts as a building material; as a solvent, reaction medium and reactant; as a carrier for nutrients and waste products; in thermoregulation; and as a lubricant and shock absorber. The regulation of water balance is very precise, as a loss of 1% of body water is usually compensated within 24 h. Both water intake and water losses are controlled to reach water balance. Minute changes in plasma osmolarity are the main factors that trigger these homeostatic mechanisms. Healthy adults regulate water balance with precision, but young infants and elderly people are at greater risk of dehydration. Dehydration can affect consciousness and can induce speech incoherence, extremity weakness, hypotonia of ocular globes, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Human water requirements are not based on a minimal intake because it might lead to a water deficit due to numerous factors that modify water needs (climate, physical activity, diet and so on). Water needs are based on experimentally derived intake levels that are expected to meet the nutritional adequacy of a healthy population. The regulation of water balance is essential for the maintenance of health and life. On an average, a sedentary adult should drink 1.5 l of water per day, as water is the only liquid nutrient that is really essential for body hydration.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. exercise and fluid replacement [^8f6c314a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

This Position Stand provides guidance on fluid replacement to sustain appropriate hydration of individuals performing physical activity. The goal of prehydrating is to start the activity euhydrated and with normal plasma electrolyte levels. Prehydrating with beverages, in addition to normal meals and fluid intake, should be initiated when needed at least several hours before the activity to enable fluid absorption and allow urine output to return to normal levels. The goal of drinking during exercise is to prevent excessive (> 2% body weight loss from water deficit) dehydration and excessive changes in electrolyte balance to avert compromised performance. Because there is considerable variability in sweating rates and sweat electrolyte content between individuals, customized fluid replacement programs are recommended. Individual sweat rates can be estimated by measuring body weight before and after exercise. During exercise, consuming beverages containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can provide benefits over water alone under certain circumstances. After exercise, the goal is to replace any fluid electrolyte deficit. The speed with which rehydration is needed and the magnitude of fluid electrolyte deficits will determine if an aggressive replacement program is merited.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^867eb3ee]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

There are some limitations to our findings. Mainly, the results of RCTs are interpreted from an intention-to-treat perspective; thus, the actual causal effect of water might not have been accurately demonstrated. While interventions consisted of a recommendation for increasing water intake, adherence to these recommendations and actual intake are not guaranteed. Moreover, since observational studies on the topic may be heavily confounded and subject to several biases, especially recall bias, we restricted our study to RCTs that led to fewer included studies. Lastly, many end points were examined by single studies and thus only limited evidence is available for these end points. The literature would benefit from further studies confirming these results, especially in cases in which the primary end point is a clinical outcome and when the current available studies have obvious limitations or could not achieve target recruitment or participants did not adhere to the intervention. Although current RCTs specify a certain volume of water as the intended intervention, they do not establish what the optimal or target total daily intake should be, which could be addressed in future studies.

### Acute kidney injury: prevention, detection, and management. summary of updated NICE guidance for adults receiving iodine-based contrast media [^e225d55b]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recently updated the guideline for Acute kidney injury: prevention, detection and management (NG148), providing new recommendations on preventing acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults receiving intravenous iodine-based contrast media. The association between intravenous iodinated contrast media and AKI is controversial, particularly with widespread use of iso-osmolar agents. Associations between contrast media administration and AKI are largely based on observational studies, with inherent heterogeneity in patient populations, definitions applied, and timing of laboratory investigations. In an attempt to mitigate risk, kidney protection has typically been employed using intravenous volume expansion and/or oral acetylcysteine. Such interventions are in widespread use, despite lacking high-quality evidence of benefit. In the non-emergency setting, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements should be obtained within the preceding 3 months before offering intravenous iodine-based contrast media. In the acute setting, adults should also have their risk of AKI assessed before offering intravenous iodine-based contrast media; however, this should not delay emergency imaging. Based on the evidence available from randomised controlled trials, the NICE committee recommends that oral hydration should be encouraged in adults at increased risk of AKI and that volume expansion with intravenous V fluids should only be considered for inpatients at particularly high risk.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^4dc76c4b]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydration is a fundamental but confusing area of practice for clinicians working with older people. There is little doubt that addressing dehydration can prevent and treat common disorders such as urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury, orthostatic hypotension, constipation and delirium. However, the assessment of dehydration can be rather subjective, non-evidence based and affected by multiple factors. Once identified, reversing dehydration can be challenging as it often involves behavioural change and overcoming barriers such engrained habits and fear of incontinence.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^6c1d8395]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Hypertonic dehydration is predominantly a water deficit; isotonic dehydration is a deficit of both water and salt.
Clinical examination is of limited diagnostic value when diagnosing dehydration in older people.
Recent research suggests daily fluid requirements may not be as high as previously recommended.
Oral rehydration salts or milk are superior to water alone when treating dehydration orally.
Subcutaneous fluid replacement is much safer than the intravenous route but is slower

### Hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat [^ee857f8b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This brief review provides an overview of the important practical relevant knowledge until now in tennis, with recommendations for further research, advancing the field and improving player well-being, performance and safety in the heat.
First, the key reported findings featuring hydration-related measures and thermal strain during high-level tennis training and competition in the heat are highlighted. A description of sweat losses and hydration status in junior and adult tennis is presented, followed by representative thermal strain responses in these same distinct populations. Notably, the specific studies examining sweat losses, hydration status and thermal load during tennis highlighted here are limited to selected, published on-court and postplay/training responses in elite-level junior and adult players.
Scheduling challenges are emphasised next, with an emphasis on same-day repeated bouts of match-play and the potential for 'carry-over' effects from previous competition-related physical activity and heat stress on subsequent physiological strain and performance.
Selected clinical conditions and medications that can potentially affect a player's thermoregulation, exercise-heat tolerance or exertional heat illness risk during tennis competition or practice in the heat are featured, along with the purported similar effects of caffeine.
Overall practical implications are then noted, with an emphasis on the hydration challenges associated with tennis in the heat and lowering thermal strain for all players by focusing on readily modifiable and individualised risk factors and reinforcement by close monitoring.
Recognising the gaps in the literature, the question "Where do we go from here?" is candidly addressed. The appropriate answer to this important question prompts a recognised challenge, as it is typically very difficult to obtain the necessary access and consent to closely assess players during high-level competition; however, clinicians, scientists and tennis governing bodies need to approach this perceived barrier with innovation and creative solutions, if tennis research is going to advance beyond simply profiling physiological characteristics of tennis training and match-play in more convenient populations and scenarios.
Lastly, this synopsis on hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat concludes importantly with specific recommendations of best practices to minimise exertional heat illness risk and improve well-being and on-court performance for all players.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^c7d89092]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive decline is an important public health concern given 55 million people have been diagnosed with dementia and almost 80 million people are projected to be affected by 2030. Cognitive function is particularly important, especially as the population ages, because it determines the maintenance of our independence, the performance of everyday activities, and the quality of life. Cognitive decline and dementia have a diverse etiology, and effective treatment is still not available. For this reason, prevention strategies targeting modifiable factors, such as nutritional habits and dietary intake to slow the development of cognitive impairment, remain a promising public health approach. Evidence to date assessing individual dietary factors and dietary patterns in relation to cognitive health has been summarized in the Lancet Neurology, while there is information related to various macro- and micronutrients and patterns, evidence related to water appears limited.

Water intake is a nutritional habit that is often overlooked, yet it is considered essential for the optimal physiological function of the human body. As the most abundant component of the human body, water intake and optimal hydration are considered key aspects for the proper functioning of organ systems, aiding, among others, in efficient digestion, elimination of toxins, energy production, thermoregulation, and joint lubrication, as well as a multitude of biochemical reactions. Furthermore, proper hydration is thought to be important for optimal cognitive functioning as it plays a vital role in neural conductivity.

Dehydration occurs when the body loses more water than is taken in, whereas hypohydration refers to the state of water deficit; these conditions result in less-than-optimal hydration and may elicit adverse physiological consequences. For the purposes of this paper, dehydration will be the term used to encompass the state of improper hydration due to unbalanced water loss or water deficit. In Europe, the percentage of the population reported to have inadequate water intake is estimated to vary from 5 to 35%. Understanding water intake and hydration status is of particular importance in older adults as this population tends to be less likely to meet recommendations on water intake and is at greater risk for dehydration due to blunted sensitivity to thirst signals, lower body reserves due to reduced muscle mass, reduced ability to deal with heat stress, and use of medications or laxatives with diuretic effects. Multiple health organizations and dietary guidelines have acknowledged that adequate hydration status is associated with the preservation of physical and mental functions and that water intake is the best way to achieve hydration.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^22e347a3]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for weaning long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) for adult and pediatric patients include the following steps. Routinely assess gastrointestinal function for readiness to begin or advance oral or enteral intake. Verify metabolic and clinical stability on current PN regimen. Establish clear goals with patient to reduce or eliminate dependence on PN. Optimize pharmacologic management of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea. Provide nutrition counseling and dietary guidance as indicated. Monitor weight and hydration status closely. Consider increasing the frequency of weight and laboratory monitoring during the transition. Assess the need to provide oral vitamin and mineral supplementation. Eliminate 1 or 2 nonconsecutive infusions per week; in children, consider weaning by a small percentage every week. Adjust PN during the transition to avoid overfeeding. Consider further reductions if nutrition and hydration remains stable. Evaluate the need for oral or intravenous fluid and/or electrolyte supplementation. Make a nutrition monitoring plan after PN is stopped to ensure safe transition to full oral or enteral nutrition.

### Water intake in drinks and food: how should we advise patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction on their water intake and / or urine output, as a cornerstone of lifestyle interventions? ICI-RS 2024 [^e517809e]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Water intake in drinks and food is essential for life. Multiple guidelines exist to help give recommendations for healthy water intake and urine output, but few of these are specific to patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.

Methods

A debate held at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting, held in Bristol in June 2024, considered ways to improve this situation.

Results and Conclusion

There are challenges in measuring both total water intake and also urine output, but we suggest that urine output may be the most helpful measure to focus on for future guidelines for patients.

### Nutrition and water: drinking eight glasses of water a day ensures proper skin hydration-myth or reality? [^f84693b2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

How-to books, beauty journals, the Internet, and the media usually recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water each day for keeping the skin hydrated, helping it look healthier, and making it less prone to wrinkles. We have found no scientific proof for this recommendation; nor is there proof, we must admit, that drinking less water does absolutely no harm. The only certainty about this issue is that, at the end of the day, we still await scientific evidence to validate what we know instinctively to be true — namely, that it is all a myth.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

Heat illness prevention — acclimatization and hydration: For preparation and prevention, we recommend avoiding the use of medications that could limit the thermoregulatory response, and we recommend optimizing general aerobic fitness levels. To achieve full acclimatization to a hot environment, we recommend 1–2 h per day of heat-exposed exertion for at least 7 days. To reduce risk, we recommend euhydration prior to activity, and to replace fluids during activity, we recommend a drink-to-thirst approach sufficient to prevent > 2% loss of body weight.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^fb44250d]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Nutrition and water [^6901632c]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Water has numerous functions necessary for survival including cellular homeostasis, solvent properties for dissolving ions and solutes, thermoregulation, and transport of waste and nutrients. Despite the established beneficial role of water in skin physiology, the optimal methods for skin hydration and requirements for daily water consumption remain elusive. This review summarizes the cellular and molecular biology of skin hydration, the debate and current recommendations of daily water requirements, and the latest research on interventions to improve skin hydration by both internal and external means of water exposure. We also explore the chemical properties of water, such as the concept of water "hardness" and environmental pollutants, and their impact on skin physiology.

### Current hydration guidelines are erroneous: dehydration does not impair exercise performance in the heat [^da30faf0]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Laboratory studies that support the hydration guidelines of leading governing bodies have shown that dehydration to only -2% of body mass can lead to increase in body temperature and heart rate during exercise, and decrease in performance. These studies, however, have been conducted in relatively windless environments (ie, wind speed < 12.9 km/h), without participants being blinded to their hydration status.

Aim

To investigate the effect of blinded hydration status on cycling time-trial performance in the heat with ecologically valid facing wind speed conditions.

Methods

During three experimental trials, 10 cyclists were dehydrated to -3% body mass by performing 2 h of submaximal exercise (walking and cycling) in the heat, before being reinfused with saline to replace 100%, 33% or 0% of fluid losses, leaving them 0%, -2% or -3% hypohydrated, respectively. Participants then completed a 25 km time trial in the heat (33°C, 40% relative humidity; wind speed 32 km/h) during which their starting hydration status was maintained by infusing saline at a rate equal to their sweat rate. The treatment was participant-blinded and the order was randomised. Completion time, power output, heart rate, rectal temperature and perceptual variables were measured.

Results

While rectal temperature was higher beyond 17 km of the time trial in the -3% vs 0% conditions (38.9 ± 0.3°C vs 38.6 ± 0.3°C; p < 0.05), no other differences between trials were shown.

Conclusion

When well-trained cyclists performed a 25 km cycling time trial under ecologically valid conditions and were blinded to their hydration status, performance, physiological and perceptual variables were not different between trials. These data do not support the residing basis behind many of the current hydration guidelines.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^df80ce43]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydration principles

Healthy humans are generally well hydratedwith a day-to-day variation in total body water of 0.2%–0.7% of body mass. However, the rise in sweat rate when exercising in the heat can dramatically change this fluid balance. A reduction in total body water is associated with a decrease in plasma volume and an increase in plasma osmolalitythat will increase the core temperature threshold for vasodilation and sweating, reduces the sweat rate for any given core temperatureand decreases cardiac filling and challenges blood pressure regulation. Dehydration will therefore exacerbate the rate of heat storage and cardiovascular strain imposed by exercising in the heat, thus reducing exercise heat tolerance. Given the potential limit in accessing and ingesting fluid during the competition (see further), the general principle of hydration should be to avoid hypohydration (less than 2% body mass) during the periods of training in the heat, especially immediately before and during intense training and competition exercise in the heat. Any increase in fluid consumption should be progressive and not limited to competition day as an acute increase in fluid absorption may first increase the urine production. The fluid needs for an athlete training in the heat are highly individual but consistent within the individual when influencing variables are consistent. Fluid needs should be adapted based on changes in body mass and/or plasma osmolality and/or urine specific gravity. Hydration measures should be obtained in the morning to avoid confounding effects of recent diet and exercise. The following examples can also be used as a general guide at first before individualised data are ascertained: 6 mL of fluid per kg of body mass every 2–3 hour, or 2 L per day plus 1–2 L per hour of exercise plus 1 L for each 5°C increase in ambient temperature above 21.5°C.

Recommendations

Hydration capacity during exercise itself is limited; therefore, athletes should ascertain sufficient fluid intake "out of exercise", from the days before and throughout the period of training/competing in the heat.
A simple way to monitor hydration status during a period of training/competing in the heat is to follow the weight–urine–thirst principle with daily monitoring of body mass (changes should remain < 1–2%), urine specific gravity (should remain < 1.020) or colour and thirst. If available to the team, plasma osmolality (< 290 mmol/kg) can be included in cases of suspected chronic dehydration.

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric and adult tumor lysis syndrome: an evidence-based review [^470015cc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has recently been subclassified into either laboratory TLS or clinical TLS, and a grading system has been established. Standardized guidelines, however, are needed to aid in the stratification of patients according to risk and to establish prophylaxis and treatment recommendations for patients at risk or with established TLS.

Methods

A panel of experts in pediatric and adult hematologic malignancies and TLS was assembled to develop recommendations and guidelines for TLS based on clinical evidence and standards of care. A review of relevant literature was also used.

Results

New guidelines are presented regarding the prevention and management of patients at risk of developing TLS. The best management of TLS is prevention. Prevention strategies include hydration and prophylactic rasburicase in high-risk patients, hydration plus allopurinol or rasburicase for intermediate-risk patients, and close monitoring for low-risk patients. Primary management of established TLS involves similar recommendations, with the addition of aggressive hydration and diuresis, plus allopurinol or rasburicase for hyperuricemia. Alkalinization is not recommended. Although guidelines for rasburicase use in adults are provided, this agent is currently only approved for use in pediatric patients in the United States.

Conclusion

The potential severity of complications resulting from TLS requires measures for prevention in high-risk patients and prompts treatment in the event that symptoms arise. Recognition of risk factors, monitoring of at-risk patients, and appropriate interventions are the key to preventing or managing TLS. These guidelines should assist in the prevention of TLS and improve the management of patients with established TLS.

### Consensus conference on the management of tumor lysis syndrome [^001df5ac]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially life threatening complication of massive cellular lysis in cancers. Identification of high-risk patients and early recognition of the syndrome is crucial in the institution of appropriate treatments. Drugs that act on the metabolic pathway of uric acid to allantoin, like allopurinol or rasburicase, are effective for prophylaxis and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome. Sound recommendations should regulate diagnosis and drug application in the clinical setting. The current article reports the recommendations on the management of tumor lysis syndrome that were issued during a Consensus Conference project, and which were endorsed by the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE), the Italian Association of Pediatric Oncologists (AIEOP) and the Italian Society of Medical Oncology (AIOM). Current concepts on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapy of tumor lysis syndrome were evaluated by a Panel of 8 experts. A consensus was then developed for statements regarding key questions on tumor lysis syndrome management selected according to the criterion of relevance by group discussion. Hydration and rasburicase should be administered to adult cancer patients who are candidates for tumor-specific therapy and who carry a high risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Cancer patients with a low-risk of tumor lysis syndrome should instead receive hydration along with oral allopurinol. Hydration and rasburicase should also be administered to patients with clinical tumor lysis syndrome and to adults and high-risk children who develop laboratory tumor lysis syndrome. In conclusion, the Panel recommended rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis in selected patients based on the drug efficacy profile. Methodologically rigorous studies are needed to clarify its cost-effectiveness profile.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^4c42a682]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Water intake and hydration status have been suggested to impact cognition; however, longitudinal evidence is limited and often inconsistent. This study aimed to longitudinally assess the association between hydration status and water intake based on current recommendations, with changes in cognition in an older Spanish population at high cardiovascular disease risk.

Methods

A prospective analysis was conducted of a cohort of 1957 adults (aged 55–75) with overweight/obesity (BMI between ≥ 27 and < 40 kg/m²) and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-Plus study. Participants had completed bloodwork and validated, semiquantitative beverage and food frequency questionnaires at baseline, as well as an extensive neuropsychological battery of 8 validated tests at baseline and 2 years of follow-up. Hydration status was determined by serum osmolarity calculation and categorized as < 295 mmol/L (hydrated), 295–299.9 mmol/L (impending dehydration), and ≥ 300 mmol/L (dehydrated). Water intake was assessed as total drinking water intake and total water intake from food and beverages and according to EFSA recommendations. Global cognitive function was determined as a composite z -score summarizing individual participant results from all neuropsychological tests. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to assess the associations between baseline hydration status and fluid intake, continuously and categorically, with 2-year changes in cognitive performance.

Results

The mean baseline daily total water intake was 2871 ± 676 mL/day (2889 ± 677 mL/day in men; 2854 ± 674 mL/day in women), and 80.2% of participants met the ESFA reference values for an adequate intake. Serum osmolarity (mean 298 ± 24 mmol/L, range 263 to 347 mmol/L) indicated that 56% of participants were physiologically dehydrated. Lower physiological hydration status (i.e.g.reater serum osmolarity) was associated with a greater decline in global cognitive function z -score over a 2-year period (β: − 0.010; 95% CI − 0.017 to − 0.004, p -value = 0.002). No significant associations were observed between water intake from beverages and/or foods with 2-year changes in global cognitive function.

Conclusions

Reduced physiological hydration status was associated with greater reductions in global cognitive function over a 2-year period in older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity. Future research assessing the impact of hydration on cognitive performance over a longer duration is needed.

### Water: neglected, unappreciated and under researched [^0f6db735]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Water, an essential nutrient, is often ignored in reports of dietary surveys and nutrition. Although it is ubiquitous in foods and beverages, the attention is often focused on the minerals or calorific values of the fluids imbibed rather than the water per se. Water is often taken for granted by many in Western countries due to its abundant availability through water systems. In developing countries, however, water and sanitation raise significant problems. This review overviews (i) the global perspective of the potable water supply, (ii) human rights and water, (iii) dietary guidelines and sources of water and (iv) the physiology of water balance. Gaps in knowledge and understanding around hydration and water requirements are also discussed. Nutritionists are urged to look at the bigger picture of the global water supply and to use good judgement and common sense when advising on water requirements.

### Hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat [^ba375ed5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Competitive tennis in the heat can prompt substantial sweat losses and extensive consequent body water and electrolyte deficits, as well as a level of thermal strain that considerably challenges a player's physiology, perception of effort, and on-court well-being and performance. Adequate hydration and optimal performance can be notably difficult to maintain when multiple same-day matches are played on successive days in hot weather. Despite the recognised effects of the heat, much more research needs to be carried out to better appreciate the broader scope and full extent of the physiological demands and hydration and thermal strain challenges facing junior and adult players in various environments, venues and competition scenarios. However, certain recommendations of best practices should be emphasised to minimise exertional heat illness risk and improve player safety, well-being and on-court performance.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^feceafac]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Dehydration may, in its simplest form be considered a deficiency of water, but even this simplistic definition is controversial. The lack of formal definition has hindered academic progress, with several professional societies differing in even the basic principles of whether the definition should include factors such as osmolality, intake or output, clinical findings and volume distribution. In 2019, a group of UK academics convened to reach consensus. The group which identifies as multidisciplinary was drawn from anaesthesia/critical care (50%), sports science, cardiology and dietetics and was largely based in southeast England. The group of 12 experts used expert opinion, literature reviews and a modified Delphi process to produce a series of recommendations.

Two types of dehydration were defined by the consensus group:

Hypertonic dehydration, an uncompensated, predominantly pure water deficit (e.g. inadequate water intake or excessive loss) resulting in a raised extracellular osmolality.
Isotonic dehydration, which is a deficiency of water with an associated reduction in salt (e.g. caused by diarrhoea) which does not increase the extracellular osmolality.

While these definitions may have a role in standardising diagnosis, the narrow geographical membership and lack of diverse expertise will likely lead to a lack of uptake by the wider community. However, the definitions are clear and compared with other existing definitions are easily translated into clinical practice.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^f0c6f3bc]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hydration is a fundamental aspect of clinical practice and yet it is an under-researched topic, particularly in older people, leading to many areas of uncertainty. There are two types of dehydration; hypertonic, which is a water deficit, and isotonic, which is a deficit of both water and salt. Individual clinical signs and bedside tests are poor diagnostic tools, making dehydration difficult to identify. However, the diagnostic value of a holistic clinical approach is not known. The gold-standard clinical test for dehydration is serum osmolality, but this cannot diagnose isotonic dehydration and may delay diagnosis in acute situations. Salivary osmolality point-of-care testing is a promising and rapid new diagnostic test capable of detecting both hypertonic and isotonic dehydration in older people, but further evidence to support its clinical utility is needed. Daily fluid requirements may be less than previously thought in adults, but the evidence specific to older people remains limited. Hydration via the subcutaneous route is safer and easier to initiate than the intravenous route but is limited by infusion speed and volume. Prompting older adults more frequently to drink, offering a wider selection of drinks and using drinking vessels with particular features can result in small increases in oral intake in the short-term. The ongoing clinically-assisted hydration at end of life (CHELsea II) trial will hopefully provide more evidence for the emotive issue of hydration at the end of life.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^c660dd01]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Hydration in heat illness and heat stroke — euhydration is an important factor in reducing hyperthermia, and dehydration predisposes patients to hyperthermia by decreasing sweat rates and increases thermal strain at a given temperature. We recommend that dehydration be minimized in heat illness and, for patients with mild and moderate heat illness, we recommend using oral fluid replacement as first-line therapy for dehydration. For heat stroke, we recommend the use of intravenous fluids, not oral, for rehydration, and any effort to provide hydration in suspected heat stroke should not delay rapid whole-body cooling. As those with exertional heat stroke (EHS) may be volume depleted, we recommend initiating rehydration treatment with 1–2 L of isotonic (0.9% sodium chloride or lactated Ringer's) fluids for adult patients or 20 mL/kg estimated body weight for pediatric patients.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for palliative or terminal nutrition in adults with progressive cancer (2001) [^e2f77eae]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Enteral nutrition

Enteral nutrition in a palliative setting can slow down nutritional deprivation, avoid dehydration and improve the quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer (standard, level of evidence: C). The optimal modalities for delivery, administration and follow-up are the same as those for enteral nutrition when given for other indications (standard, expert agreement). In the terminal or palliative stage, any complications and discomfort resulting from enteral nutrition should be considered. In the event of any change of treatment, the reasons for the change should be discussed with the patients and their families and their preferences taken into consideration (standard, expert agreement). Gastrostomy in terminal-stage patients is associated with a risk of complications that can be contrary to the objectives of palliative care. It is not recommended in this situation (recommendation, level of evidence: C).

Parenteral nutrition

Parenteral nutrition in the palliative setting can slow down nutritional deprivation, avoid dehydration and improve the quality of life in patients with a malignant bowel obstruction and/or other causes of food intolerance (standard, level of evidence: C). The modalities for delivery, administration and follow-up are the same as those for parenteral nutrition when used for other indications (standard, expert agreement). The benefits expected from parenteral nutrition should be reassessed at regular intervals or each time that a complication related to the technique or the illness occurs (recommendation, expert agreement). There is no justification for parenteral nutrition in patients with a Karnofsky index of 50% or less, or with a performance status score higher than 2 (recommendation, expert agreement).

Hydration

Dehydration in the terminal phase is often neither painful nor uncomfortable (standard, level of evidence: C). If hydration is administered to control symptoms, the least invasive route should be chosen, for example, the subcutaneous route, if intravenous access is not available (recommendation, expert agreement). Mouth washing is an important component of the management (recommendation, expert agreement). Symptoms can usually be controlled by the subcutaneous administration of 0.5–1.0 l of 0.9% saline solution per 24 h (recommendation, level of evidence: C).

Background

Drinking water is often applied as a dietary means for weight loss and overweight/obesity prevention, but no evidence-based recommendation exists for this indication.

Objective

We summarized the existing evidence on the association between water consumption and body weight outcomes in adults of any body weight status.

In a systematic review, we retrieved studies from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE), cross-references by PubMed functions and hand-searching, and experts' recommendations. Any type of study including adults aged > 18 y that reported the association between daily water consumption and any weight-related outcome, such as body weight, body mass index, or body weight classifications, was eligible.

Results

Of 4963 retrieved records, 11 original studies and 2 systematic reviews were included. In participants dieting for weight loss or maintenance, a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized controlled trial, and an observational longitudinal study showed that increased water consumption, in addition to a program for weight loss or maintenance, reduced body weight after 3–12 mo compared with such a program alone. In mixed-weight populations not primarily dieting for weight loss or maintenance, 2 short-term randomized trials showed no effect of water consumption on body weight; 6 cross-sectional studies showed inconsistent results.

Conclusions

Studies of individuals dieting for weight loss or maintenance suggest a weight-reducing effect of increased water consumption, whereas studies in general mixed-weight populations yielded inconsistent results. The evidence for this association is still low, mostly because of the lack of good-quality studies. This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/Prospero as CRD42012002585.

### Hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat [^87ea38da]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Practical implications

Considering the sweating rates reported here for junior and adult tennis players in the heat, it is easy to appreciate how players can readily incur significant total body water and sodium deficits during such training and competition, especially when participating in multiple same-day practice/training sessions or matches over several days or more in a row. Coaches and tournament directors need to appreciate this and accordingly provide frequent breaks during practice and sufficient opportunities to rehydrate and recover during tournament play, respectively, as conditions warrant. And even when a player drinks regularly or on each changeover during a match, the postpractice/play body water and sodium deficits can be significant, especially following a long session or contest (table 1). Accordingly, a deliberate effort to fully (or to the extent appropriate, given the time provided) and effectively rehydrate between practice/training sessions and matches is essential to prevent or minimise accumulated body water and electrolyte deficits.

Regarding thermal strain in junior tennis, there has been a long-standing perspective that children are less effective than adults in regulating body temperature during exercise in the heat. Consequently, they are less tolerant to and capable of performing well in a hot environment and are at greater risk for incurring heat illness compared to adults. However, more current research does not support this viewpoint, indicating that children (9–12 years) do not have insufficient cardiovascular capacity, less effective thermoregulation or lower exercise-heat tolerance when hydration is amply maintained. This perspective is supported as well by the on-court (albeit limited) observations of body core temperature in young players during practice and competition in the heat presented here. Accordingly, appropriate and effective safety and performance guidelines for all tennis players training and competing in the heat should initially focus on readily modifiable risk factors such as hydration management, acclimatisation and scheduling of play, with close monitoring and modifications in activity based on individualised clinical risk characteristics. These recommendations are outlined below.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^e6f1a16b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Use of performance-enhancing substances [^0bc3b28e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Hydration and carbohydrate strategies for training — timing, composition, and fluid replacement. Strong evidence supports carbohydrate ingestion during exercise sessions lasting longer than 1 h to help athletes maintain intensity of effort. Low-carbohydrate solutions (6%–8% carbohydrate) may be beneficial for training sessions longer than 30 min, and sports drinks or nonacidic fruit juice diluted 1:1 are options. Young athletes should be encouraged to drink to thirst and replace 16–20 oz of fluid for every pound of weight lost, with adequate hydration before training sessions.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^e5ac27d7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Intermittent sports testing — nutrition, carbohydrate availability, hydration, and ergogenic aids should align with competition strategies: "Energy and nutrient intake, hydration, and ergogenic aids usage… should be consistent with competition strategies". Meeting carbohydrate "recommendations (> 7 g · kg⁻¹ · body weight per day) is generally important", while inadequate preexercise glycogen leading to "reductions below ~250 mmol/kg⁻¹ dw during testing may impair muscle function". Hydration is critical because "performance decrements can be realized with dehydration of > 2% of BW". Body mass management matters since "standardization of body weight prior to strength/speed/power testing is important", and if performance unexpectedly declines, "Nutritional status should be evaluated… including assessment of potential dietary changes and examination of biomarkers".

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^014ad993]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — End-of-life nutrition therapy recommendations state that the clinician is not obligated to provide hydration and nutrition therapy in end-of-life situations, and the decision to initiate nutrition therapy is no different than the decision to stop therapy once it has started (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). If requested, nutrition therapy in end-stage malignancy should be provided by the enteral route (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence), whereas use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in this setting may cause net harm and should be held or aggressively discouraged (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). The clinician who has ethical concerns of his own in a difficult end-of-life situation should excuse himself from the case, as long as he can transfer care to an equally qualified and willing health-care provider (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^16c8d06d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Oral rehydration — elderly with severe diarrhea or travelers with cholera-like watery diarrhea: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral options "is recommended" for these groups (Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). For most otherwise healthy adults with traveler's diarrhea (TD), "Formal ORS is not needed" because they can replace losses with salty soups, fruit juices, and carbohydrates to drive glucose–sodium cotransport. Travelers with diarrhea "should keep up with fluids and electrolytes" to pass urine regularly and maintain moist mucous membranes. In severe diarrhea, a balanced oral rehydration solution (ORS) available at pharmacies typically contains "sodium of 60–75 mEq/l and glucose of 75–90 mmol/l"; sports drinks "while not adequate alone to treat severe diarrhea can provide partial sodium and potassium replacement".

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^980be199]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: Body composition assessment context — Body composition is an important factor in assessing nutrition status in CKD, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a direct method that is considered the gold standard for assessing body composition in patients with CKD; however, this measure is labor intensive, expensive and can be influenced by a number of CKD related factors such as hydration status. Timing of body composition measurements is important in CKD since assumptions of hydration are required for accurate interpretation of the results, and fluid/electrolyte balance is likely to be altered significantly in CKD patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^fc93cc13]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies of urinary hydration biomarkers have shown that during acute progressive dehydration, USG, urine osmolality and urine color may be used interchangeably to track hydration status. In sedentary to moderately active adults, where sweat losses are not as pronounced, water balance is largely determined by the adequacy of fluid intake. Our results extend the utility of urinary hydration biomarkers beyond acute water loss and progressive dehydration into the context of drinking behaviors seen in real-life conditions. Within the context of free-living French adults, 24-h USG, osmolality, volume and color were all strongly related. This finding is not surprising, given that urine concentration and volume are inversely related, and that USG, osmolality and color all represent urine concentration. Perhaps more important, the values for these biomarkers span a sufficiently broad range to show linear relations to fluid intake. This suggests that urinary biomarkers of hydration may have the potential to be used to approximate fluid intake volume in situations where collecting fluid intake data is difficult. Moreover, fluid intake records alone account for only one side of the water balance equation, and cannot account for daily water loss. Urinary biomarkers of hydration status, in contrast, provide information about the adequacy of fluid intake relative to body water losses, and are thus more indicative of adequate hydration status than relying on fluid intake alone. In the current study, data was collected during temperate environmental conditions, and the physical activity of participants was restricted to sedentary activities, thus limiting water losses. Thus, we anticipated that urine biomarkers would closely reflect fluid intake volume to the extent possible in a study conducted in free-living conditions.

Currently, adequate intake guidelines for water are based largely on median intake reported in large population surveys. Although collection methods vary, intake studies commonly employ recall-based methods such as 24-h diet recall and food frequency questionnaires that have a tendency to underestimate intake. Moreover, these instruments were developed mainly to examine nutrient intakes from food; little is known about their validity to accurately assess fluid intake. Despite the shortcomings of dietary intake surveys, water intake guidelines rely heavily on these reported intake values, and rarely take into account the impact of a given level of fluid intake on hydration physiology or health. The ability to model the relationship between fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers would allow for the establishment of adequate intake recommendations based on physiological indicators of hydration; moreover, it would facilitate studies evaluating the link between adequate fluid intake and health.

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^d7e4f807]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Classic 'recommendations', such as 'at least 8 × 8 ounce glasses of water per day', have been questioned in an elaborate review by Valtin (2002). However, although there seems to be little scientific support for such recommendations, there is no evidence to show that drinking such a level of fluid might be bad for health. Recently, experts have suggested that such a level of intake may actually be insufficient to appropriately cover bodily needs, even in a sedentary middle-aged individual living in a temperate environment. As much as 3 l of fluid daily have been recommended recently by American experts (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2004). This report did not specify the exact requirements for water intake, but set general recommendations for women at ∼2.7 l of total water — from all beverages and foods — each day, and for men an average of ∼3.7 l of total water. The panel did not set an upper level for water.

This report is the first specific description of beverage intake among the French, based on a quota sample of the population. Differences have appeared between the four age groups in the selection of various types of beverages, as well as consistencies (the major part of daily fluid intake is water). The proportion of daily energy obtained from drinks (all types combined) is ∼10%. Wide variations are observed around mean values, suggesting that fluid intake could be insufficient in some people, or that energy intake from fluids might contribute significantly to adequate or inadequate total energy intake. Longitudinal studies should be carried out in different populations (different countries, different age groups, different socioeconomic levels, etc.) to determine whether the chronic contribution of beverages does impact health or body weight control, as suggested in studies examining the longitudinal changes in body weight associated with the intake of energy-containing drinks (Ludwig et al. 2001; Schulze et al. 2004; Stookey et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009).

### Cystinuria: clinical practice recommendation [^08d0d32c]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Cystinuria (OMIM 220100) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in which high urinary cystine excretion leads to the formation of cystine stones because of the low solubility of cystine at normal urinary pH. We developed clinical practice recommendation for diagnosis, surgical and medical treatment, and follow-up of patients with cystinuria. Elaboration of these clinical practice recommendations spanned from June 2018 to December 2019 with a consensus conference in January 2019. Selected topic areas were chosen by the co-chairs of the conference. Working groups focusing on specific topics were formed. Group members performed systematic literature review using MEDLINE, drafted the statements, and discussed them. They included geneticists, medical biochemists, pediatric and adult nephrologists, pediatric and adult urologists experts in cystinuria, and the Metabolic Nephropathy Joint Working Group of the European Reference Network for Rare Kidney Diseases (ERKNet) and eUROGEN members. Overall 20 statements were produced to provide guidance on diagnosis, genetic analysis, imaging techniques, surgical treatment (indication and modalities), conservative treatment (hydration, dietetic, alkalinization, and cystine-binding drugs), follow-up, self-monitoring, complications (renal failure and hypertension), and impact on quality of life. Because of the rarity of the disease and the poor level of evidence in the literature, these statements could not be graded. This clinical practice recommendation provides guidance on all aspects of the management of both adults and children with cystinuria, including diagnosis, surgery, and medical treatment.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) — initial management workflow (Figure 2) directs that mild HCM receive adequate hydration and avoidance of exacerbating factors, while moderate HCM that is chronic and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic uses the same approach as mild HCM. For moderate HCM with an acute increase in serum calcium or symptomatic, provide adequate IV saline hydration and recommend denosumab (Dmab) or intravenous bisphosphonate (IV BP) over no treatment (Recommendation 1), and suggest Dmab over IV BP (Recommendation 2). For severe HCM, adequate IV saline hydration and suggest calcitonin as initial treatment with IV BP or Dmab (Recommendation 3). For refractory or recurrent HCM on BP, adequate IV saline hydration and suggest Dmab (Recommendation 4).

### Intravenous fluid therapy in critically ill adults [^cbfbc474]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is one of the most common interventions in acutely ill patients. Each day, over 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are 'normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.

### Thermoregulation and dehydration in children and youth exercising in extreme heat compared with adults [^3aaf890f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Children are often exposed to extreme heatand have been historically thought to be more vulnerable to heat stress during physical activity than adults due to physiological and morphological disadvantages including 'less effective' sweating, and a higher body surface area (BSA)-to-mass ratio. Many major health organisations thus warn that children are uniquely susceptible to heat-related illness during hot weather, especially when physically active. However, in 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a new Policy Statement for Climatic Heat Stress and Exercising Children and Adolescents concluding "youth do not have less effective thermoregulatory ability… compared with adults during exercise in the heat when adequate hydration is maintained". This policy document (reaffirmed in 2019) cited three relatively small-scale experiments and an expert reviewto support this shift away from previous thinking. Alongside the synthesis of evidence provided by Rowland, which holistically considered the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory capacities of children and reported the findings of another small study of 7 prepubertal boys, these experiments examined the responses of 32 children (23 boys, 9 girls) aged 9–12 years each to a single exercise heat stress condition. These studies included a small adult comparison group, but only one study (n = 8 children; 0 girls) exposed participants to air temperatures > 35°C.

There is also an international clinical consensus (eg, American College of Sports Medicine: ACSM, AAP) that attributes difficulties with maintaining hydration as a leading risk factor for heat-related illness in children, alongside other factors such as exercise intensity, recovery opportunities and clothing. Additionally, a large proportion of children fail to meet daily adequate fluid recommendations, which may compromise their hydration status prior to exercise. However, fluid intake recommendations are often broad and do not account for ambient conditions or exercise intensity. For example, ACSM recommends 9–12 years drink 100–250 mL every 20 min (0.3–0.75 L/hour), while 'adolescents' should consume 1–1.5 L/hour to minimise sweating-induced body-water deficits, assuming pre-exercise euhydration. Recently, whole-body sweat rate prediction equations were developed to inform fluid intake recommendations for adults exercising in hot environments. However, growing evidence of hydration challenges in children underscores the need to evaluate the applicability of sweat rate calculators for paediatric use.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^44e98daa]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) water intake and diet — people with ADPKD should be advised to maintain optimal hydration; plain drinking water, mainly obtained from tap water, is the preferred fluid for drinking in people with ADPKD, and the consumption of drinks with added sugar and/or salt or alcohol should be minimized. A high dietary solute load requires a higher fluid intake to maintain dilute urine, and people with ADPKD should be educated about the importance of dietary solute intake in determining obligatory urine volume; as outlined in Chapter 7, people with ADPKD should be advised to achieve and maintain a moderate protein intake (0.8–1.0 g/kg/d, per WHO recommendations) and limit sodium (Na) intake (Na < 2 g/d [< 90 mmol/d] or < 5 g salt/d). No evidence indicates that the source or type of water (tap, bottled, filtered) is important to the progression of kidney cyst growth; prior self-reported estimates suggest most people (61%) with ADPKD probably have a high habitual intake of fluid (≥ 2 L/d). For implementation context, the increase in urine volume in 3 RCTs was ~0.8 L/d. Safety considerations include that water intake that vastly exceeds population-based recommendations can lead to life-threatening hyponatremia, and in a systematic review of 590 people without ADPKD with life-threatening hyponatremia, psychogenic polydipsia and iatrogenic advice were identified as underlying factors in 68% of cases. The overall grade of certainty of evidence is very low.

Fluid and nutritional management of diarrhea — oral rehydration solution (ORS) dosing for mild to moderate dehydration specifies infants and children: ORS, 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours; adolescents and adults (≥ 30 kg): ORS, ≥ 2 L, with maintenance replacement for infants and children of < 10 kg body weight: 60–120 mL ORS for each diarrheal stool or vomiting episode; up to ~500 mL/day, and > 10 kg body weight: 120–240 mL ORS for each diarrheal stool or vomiting episode; up to ~1 L/day, while adolescents and adults take ad libitum, up to ~2 L/day, and losses are replaced as long as diarrhea or vomiting continue; in severe dehydration, children, adolescents, and adults receive intravenous isotonic crystalloid boluses until pulse, perfusion, and mental status return to normal, with administration up to 20 mL/kg body weight, malnourished infants may benefit from smaller-volume frequent boluses of 10 mL/kg body weight, and if unable to drink, rehydration can be via nasogastric tube or intravenous 5% dextrose 0.25 normal saline with 20 mEq/L potassium chloride; breastfed infants should continue nursing, and after rehydration, maintenance fluids are resumed with an age-appropriate normal diet.

### Fluid and electrolyte management: putting a plan in motion [^45ed8829]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid and electrolyte management is challenging for clinicians, as electrolytes shift in a variety of settings and disease states and are dependent on osmotic changes and fluid balance. The development of a plan for managing fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should start with correcting the underlying condition. In most cases, this is followed by an assessment of fluid balance with the goal of achieving euvolemia. After fluid status is understood and/or corrected, electrolyte imbalances are simplified. Many equations are available to aid clinicians in providing safe recommendations or at least to give a starting point for correcting the abnormalities. However, these equations do not take into consideration the vast differences between clinical scenarios, thus making electrolyte management more challenging. The supplementation plan, whether delivered intravenously or orally, must include an assessment of renal and gastrointestinal function, as most guidelines are established under the assumption of normal digestion, absorption and excretion. After the plan is developed, frequent monitoring is vital to regain homeostasis. A fluid and electrolyte management plan developed by a multidisciplinary team is advantageous in promoting continuity of care and producing safe outcomes.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^e393c68b]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease monitoring and evaluation — body mass index (BMI) should be used routinely to assess weight status in CKD patients since it is useful in predicting mortality, but in isolation BMI is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of protein-energy wasting (PEW) unless it is very low (< 18 kg/m²). Methods for assessing body composition in CKD include anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), creatinine kinetics, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is considered the gold standard but is labor intensive, invasive, expensive, and can be influenced by CKD-related factors such as hydration status.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^05e2f44b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI rationale/background — body composition assessment methods and timing in CKD. Methods of assessing body composition, including anthropometric measurements, are components of the nutrition assessment in CKD. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a direct method that is considered the gold standard for assessing body composition in patients with CKD; however, the measure is labor intensive, invasive, and expensive and can be influenced by a number of CKD-related factors such as hydration status. Timing of body composition assessments is important in CKD because assumptions of hydration are required for accurate interpretation of the results, and fluid/electrolyte balance is likely to be altered significantly in patients with CKD. For these reasons, in adults undergoing dialysis, assessments are best obtained after treatment when body fluid compartments have been balanced.

### The void in using urine concentration to assess population fluid intake adequacy or hydration status [^0ae7029d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Urine concentration can be used to assess fluid intake adequacy or to diagnose dehydration. However, too often urine concentration is used inappropriately to draw dubious conclusions that could have harmful health and economic consequences. Inappropriate uses of urine concentration relate primarily to convenience sampling (timing) and problems related to convenience sampling (misapplication of thresholds), but a conceptual problem also exists with using urine concentration in isolation. The purpose of this Perspective article is to briefly explain the problematic nature of current practices and to offer a possible solution to improve practice with minimal added complication. When urine is used exclusively to assess fluid intake adequacy and hydration status in adults, we propose that only when urine concentration is high (> 850 mmol/kg) and urine excretion rate is low (< 850 mL/24 h) should suspicion of inadequate drinking or impending dehydration be considered. Prospective tests of the 850 × 850 thresholds will provide supporting evidence and/or help refine the best thresholds for men and women, young and old.

Water intake and loss in sedentary adults in a temperate climate — typical daily intake is drinks 1575 ml/day (range, 1400–1750 ml/day; 70–80% total intake), food 675 ml/day (range, 600–750 ml/day; 20–30% total intake), metabolism 300 ml/day (range, 250–350 ml/day), with total intake 2550 ml/day (range, 2250–2850 ml/day); corresponding losses are urine 1600 ml/day, skin ("insensitive perspiration") 450 ml/day, respiration 300 ml/day (range, 250–350 ml/day), faeces 200 ml/day (range, 100–300 ml/day), with total loss 2550 ml/day (range, 2000–3100 ml/day), noting that pyrexia and exercise result in activation of sweat glands/additional water loss ("sensitive perspiration").

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^30e5b8f8]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations and strengths of the present analyses that need to be acknowledged. The first notable limitation is that the results may not be generalizable to other populations since the participants are older Spanish individuals with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity. Second, measurement error and recall bias are possibilities given the use of questionnaires to estimate water and fluid intake and that these rely on responders' memory which is a component of cognitive function. However, these questionnaires have been validated and determined as reliable methods of assessing long-term intake in the present study population. Third, despite its longitudinal design, water and fluid intake and hydration status were only considered at baseline; however, as the questionnaires measure habitual beverage and food intake, and older adults are considered to have reasonably stable dietary habits, this is not expected to significantly impact the findings. Along these lines, the possible effect of seasonality on water intake and osmolarity was not considered a concern in the present analyses as the validation of the fluid questionnaire measurements included assessments at various points throughout the year (baseline vs. 6 months vs 1 year) with no significant differences observed in fluid consumption across the different time points assessed. Hence, the finding of no difference between 6-month intervals, suggests no significant differences between opposing seasons (e.g. winter vs. summer; spring vs. fall). Furthermore, SOSM determination may not necessarily detect acute dehydration or rehydration immediately prior to the cognitive testing, and it is unknown whether observed elevated SOSMs were due to inadequate water intake, ADH abnormality, or other factors. While it is possible that the hydration status of some individuals was misclassified because serum osmolarity was estimated as opposed to being directly measured, the equation has been shown to predict directly measured serum osmolarity well in older adult men and women with and without diabetes or renal issues with a good diagnostic accuracy of dehydration and has been considered a gold standard for the identification of impending and current water-loss dehydration in older adults. Lastly, a discrepancy was observed between the percentage of individuals that were considered to have met EFSA fluid intake recommendations and those considered to be dehydrated based on calculated osmolarity. This may have been due to the fact that the EFSA fluid intake recommendations are meant for individuals in good health; whereas the present study population had overweight or obesity, and it has been shown that individuals with higher BMIs have higher water needs related to metabolic rate, body surface area, body weight, and water turnover rates related to higher energy requirements, greater food consumption, and higher metabolic production. Strengths of the present analyses include the longitudinal, prospective design, the large sample size, the use of an extensive cognitive test battery, the use of validated questionnaires, and the robustness of the current findings due to the adjustment of relevant covariates.

### Associations between hydration state and pregnancy complications, maternal-infant outcomes: protocol of a prospective observational cohort study [^56d7ae96]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

In order to promote enough water intake, it is necessary to propose recommendations on water intake for pregnant women. Only some countries or organizations have made specific recommendations on water intake for pregnant women: 2.7 L/d is recommended by the American Institute of Medicine and 4.8 L/d is advised by the World Health Organization (WHO). A survey of dietary guidelines in 84 countries revealed that only 8 countries had quantitative recommendations for fluid intake. Of the four editions of Dietary Guidelines (1989, 1997, 2007, and 2016) released in China, the first two editions had no recommendation for fluid intake. In 2007, the recommended amount of daily fluid intake was 1.2 L/d for adults, but no recommendation was given for pregnant women. In 2016, the recommendation was 2.7 L/d for women and 3.0 L/d for men and pregnant women. However, the recommendation for water intake for pregnant women was based on data of the water intake survey among pregnant women in other countries, not the data in China. Water requirements vary among pregnant women in different countries due to differences in dietary pattern, environment, and other factors; thus, it is necessary to undertake studies related to water intake during pregnancy in China.

Two hypotheses are proposed in this study: one is that some pregnant women are dehydrated due to having insufficient water intake and the other is that dehydration has negative effects on pregnancy and maternal and infant outcomes. The objectives of this study are, firstly, to investigate the fluid intake among pregnant women, secondly, to assess their hydration state, and finally, to investigate the associations with pregnancy complications and maternal-infant outcomes. This preliminary exploratory study on will provides some related reference data for updating the recommendation for adequate water intake among pregnant women. In addition, it will provide some evidences on water-related education. Based on this preliminary study, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required for the development of clinical guidelines and recommendations. The ultimate goals are to promote adequate water intake, to maintain optimal hydration state, and to improve mater health and birth outcomes.

### Medically assisted hydration for adults receiving palliative care [^890bfb40]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many people receiving palliative care have reduced oral intake during their illness, and particularly at the end of their life. Management of this can include the provision of medically assisted hydration (MAH) with the aim of improving their quality of life (QoL), prolonging their life, or both. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 2, 2008, and updated in February 2011 and March 2014.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of MAH compared with placebo and standard care, in adults receiving palliative care on their QoL and survival, and to assess for potential adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, CareSearch, Dissertation Abstracts, Science Citation Index and the reference lists of all eligible studies, key textbooks, and previous systematic reviews. The date of the latest search conducted on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase was 17 November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of studies of MAH in adults receiving palliative care aged 18 and above. The criteria for inclusion was the comparison of MAH to placebo or standard care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts for relevance, and two review authors extracted data and performed risk of bias assessment. The primary outcome was QoL using validated scales; secondary outcomes were survival and adverse events. For continuous outcomes, we measured the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD), and reported the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) between groups. For dichotomous outcomes, we estimated and compared the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs between groups. For time-to-event data, we planned to calculate the survival time from the date of randomisation and to estimate and express the intervention effect as the hazard ratio (HR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE and created two summary of findings tables. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one new study (200 participants), for a total of four studies included in this update (422 participants). All participants had a diagnosis of advanced cancer. With the exception of 29 participants who had a haematological malignancy, all others were solid organ cancers. Two studies each compared MAH to placebo and standard care. There were too few included studies to evaluate different subgroups, such as type of participant, intervention, timing of intervention, and study site. We considered one study to be at high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding; otherwise, risk of bias was assessed as low or unclear. MAH compared with placebo Quality of life One study measured change in QoL at one week using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) (scale from 0 to 108; higher score = better QoL). No data were available from the other study. We are uncertain whether MAH improves QoL (MD 4.10, 95% CI -1.63 to 9.83; 1 study, 93 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Survival One study reported on survival from study enrolment to last date of follow-up or death. We were unable to estimate HR. No data were available from the other study. We are uncertain whether MAH improves survival (1 study, 93 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events One study reported on intensity of adverse events at two days using a numeric rating scale (scale from 0 to 10; lower score = less toxicity). No data were available from the other study. We are uncertain whether MAH leads to adverse events (injection site pain: MD 0.35, 95% CI -1.19 to 1.89; injection site swelling MD -0.59, 95% CI -1.40 to 0.22; 1 study, 49 participants, very low-certainty evidence). MAH compared with standard care Quality of life No data were available for QoL. Survival One study measured survival from randomisation to last date of follow-up at 14 days or death. No data were available from the other study. We are uncertain whether MAH improves survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.59; 1 study, 200 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events Two studies measured adverse events at follow-up (range 2 to 14 days). We are uncertain whether MAH leads to adverse events (RR 11.62, 95% CI 1.62 to 83.41; 2 studies, 242 participants, very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since the previous update of this review, we have found one new study. In adults receiving palliative care in the end stage of their illness, there remains insufficient evidence to determine whether MAH improves QoL or prolongs survival, compared with placebo or standard care. Given that all participants were inpatients with advanced cancer at end of life, our findings are not transferable to adults receiving palliative care in other settings, for non-cancer, dementia or neurodegenerative diseases, or for those with an extended prognosis. Clinicians will need to make decisions based on the perceived benefits and harms of MAH for each individual's circumstances, without the benefit of high-quality evidence to guide them.

Chapter 1: Diagnosis of hypovolaemia

Background to recommendation 1–1

One of the most basic decisions for maintenance of the homeostasis of the human body is the choice of delivering external solutions. The objectives at the heart of such decision-making are the goals of volume substitution (intravascular) and fluid substitution (interstitial). In the majority of studies, the terms (intracellular) dehydration and (extracellular) volume depletion are used interchangeably, although defining two quite different entities. In addition, posture-related syncope or reflex tachycardia while standing (by over 30 beats min −1) is frequently indicative of a fluid volume deficit (hypovolaemia). In 1999, McGee et al. demonstrated that a dry axilla, in contrast to moist mucous membranes, would also increase the sensitivity for a diagnosis of hypovolaemia. Interestingly, capillary refill time and skin turgidity showed only very poor sensitivity, whereas presence of tachycardia when lying down had only a high specificity.

As every substance delivered to the body interacts with the body's own fluids in accordance with its composition, stability and mode of delivery, predictions as to inertness or the exchange of substances (down to the level of the cell) are virtually impossible.

Total body water is held enclosed in various fluid spaces (compartments): two-thirds are found in cells (intracellular compartment), whereas the remaining water is held in the extracellular compartment and comprises interstitial fluid (31%), blood plasma (7%) and other transcellular fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). The body's own regulation of fluid balance is achieved by osmoregulation and volume regulation, and the thirst reflex. The goal is to maintain body water at a volume of approximately 42 l. As the volume of the intracellular space is generally co-controlled by the extracellular space (cell walls are water-permeable), any fluid delivered to the body can cause water displacement, down to the level of the cell. As the interstitial fluid forms part of the extracellular space and can be determined only indirectly as the difference between overall extracellular space and plasma volume, investigations of interstitial fluid deficit are virtually impossible – at least without additional instrument-based diagnostics. Accordingly, the substance-based substitution of the interstitial space is certainly neither advisable nor necessary. In the event of isotonic hyperhydration, for example extended intravascular volume delivery would result in an expansion of the extracellular space with an increased incidence of interstitial oedema because of diffusion.

Fluid requirements

The UK NHS's Eatwell Guide recommends a daily intake of six to eight glasses of fluid per day and the European Food Safety Authority recommends 2.5 l of water for males over 14 years and 2 l for females. However, these recommendations have recently been called into doubt following a large international study. This cross-sectional study analysed water turnover (fluid balance, ml/day) data from over 5,604 subjects, from birth to 96 years old, from 23 different countries, available from the International Atomic Energy Agency International Doubly Labelled Water database. Each participant consumed a weight-adjusted dose of deuterated water. The level of deuterated water was measured before and after the isotope drink using either saliva, urine or serum, allowing an estimation of the amount of deuterated water left in the body and therefore the total body water volume. The study team found that water turnover reduced with advancing age and was lowest in females aged > 65 years. Total body water also declined with advancing age, presumed secondary to reduced muscle mass. The authors then used extensive data on geography, climate, activity levels and water turnover to produce an equation to estimate an individual's daily water requirements:

[1,076 × PAL] + [14.34 × body weight (kg)] + [374.9 × sex] + [5.823 × humidity (%)] + [1,070 × athlete status] + [104.6 × HDI] + [0.4726 × altitude (m)] — [0.3529 × age (years)²] + [24.78 × age (years)] + [1.865 × ambient temperature (°C)²] — [19.66 × temperature (°C)] — 713.1.

PAL, physical activity level = total energy expenditure/basal energy expenditure, roughly estimated as light work = 1.7, moderate work female (F) 2.2, male (M) 2.7, moderately heavy work F 2.3, M 3.0, heavy work F 2.8, M 3.8; athlete = 1, non-athlete = 0; male = 1, female = 0; HDI, human development index, high (e.g. UK) = 0, middle = 1, low = 2;

Intravenous fluid selection for sepsis resuscitation is outlined, with two categories and explicit recommendations. The 2 major categories of resuscitation fluids are isotonic crystalloids and colloids. Among crystalloids, the primary choices are saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride, or "normal saline") and balanced crystalloids; saline contains chloride at 154 mmol/L, which can lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may increase renal inflammation. Figure guidance states "We recommend balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary fluid type for resuscitation in sepsis" and "We do not recommend using colloids", with colloid examples including albumin (4%, 5%, 20%).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^a5e21b33]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Individual factors — hydration and cooling strategies: The most readily modifiable physiologic risk factor is hydration status, with endurance athletes comfortably tolerating weight losses of 3–4% during events but fluid losses causing a 2–3% decrease in body weight correlating with greater core temperatures; dehydration increases physiologic strain, decreases sweat rates, increases perceived exertion, and increases core temperatures; maintaining euhydration is done via a "drink-to-thirst" approach or a scheduled regimen, but scheduled regimens risk accidental over or underconsumption; an increase in plasma osmolality by 2% triggers thirst and renal water retention, and thirst during activity indicates avid renal free water retention, a key step toward exercise-associated hyponatremia; adequate hydration cannot prevent heat accumulation in all circumstances; some hyperhydration methods decrease physiologic strain but have not reliably been proven protective from heat illness; precooling may help for short exertion in hot environments but is unlikely to benefit longer activity.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit. expert opinion of the working group for nephrology, ESICM [^5c19120d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute renal failure on the intensive care unit is associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine recommendations for the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI), focusing on the role of potential preventative maneuvers including volume expansion, diuretics, use of inotropes, vasopressors/vasodilators, hormonal interventions, nutrition, and extracorporeal techniques.

Method

A systematic search of the literature was performed for studies using these potential protective agents in adult patients at risk for acute renal failure/kidney injury between 1966 and 2009. The following clinical conditions were considered: major surgery, critical illness, sepsis, shock, and use of potentially nephrotoxic drugs and radiocontrast media. Where possible the following endpoints were extracted: creatinine clearance, glomerular filtration rate, increase in serum creatinine, urine output, and markers of tubular injury. Clinical endpoints included the need for renal replacement therapy, length of stay, and mortality. Studies are graded according to the international Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group system.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Several measures are recommended, though none carries grade 1A. We recommend prompt resuscitation of the circulation with special attention to providing adequate hydration whilst avoiding high-molecular-weight hydroxy-ethyl starch (HES) preparations, maintaining adequate blood pressure using vasopressors in vasodilatory shock. We suggest specific vasodilators under strict hemodynamic control, sodium bicarbonate for emergency procedures administering contrast media, and periprocedural hemofiltration in severe chronic renal insufficiency undergoing coronary intervention.

### Clinical symptoms, signs and tests for identification of impending and current water-loss dehydration in older people [^ab47c44a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that water-loss dehydration is common in older people and associated with many causes of morbidity and mortality. However, it is unclear what clinical symptoms, signs and tests may be used to identify early dehydration in older people, so that support can be mobilised to improve hydration before health and well-being are compromised.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of state (one time), minimally invasive clinical symptoms, signs and tests to be used as screening tests for detecting water-loss dehydration in older people by systematically reviewing studies that have measured a reference standard and at least one index test in people aged 65 years and over. Water-loss dehydration was defined primarily as including everyone with either impending or current water-loss dehydration (including all those with serum osmolality ≥ 295 mOsm/kg as being dehydrated).

Search Methods

Structured search strategies were developed for MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL, LILACS, DARE and HTA databases (The Cochrane Library), and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Reference lists of included studies and identified relevant reviews were checked. Authors of included studies were contacted for details of further studies.

Selection Criteria

Titles and abstracts were scanned and all potentially relevant studies obtained in full text. Inclusion of full text studies was assessed independently in duplicate, and disagreements resolved by a third author. We wrote to authors of all studies that appeared to have collected data on at least one reference standard and at least one index test, and in at least 10 people aged ≥ 65 years, even where no comparative analysis has been published, requesting original dataset so we could create 2 x 2 tables.

Data Collection and Analysis

Diagnostic accuracy of each test was assessed against the best available reference standard for water-loss dehydration (serum or plasma osmolality cut-off ≥ 295 mOsm/kg, serum osmolarity or weight change) within each study. For each index test study data were presented in forest plots of sensitivity and specificity. The primary target condition was water-loss dehydration (including either impending or current water-loss dehydration). Secondary target conditions were intended as current (> 300 mOsm/kg) and impending (295 to 300 mOsm/kg) water-loss dehydration, but restricted to current dehydration in the final review. We conducted bivariate random-effects meta-analyses (Stata/IC, StataCorp) for index tests where there were at least four studies and study datasets could be pooled to construct sensitivity and specificity summary estimates. We assigned the same approach for index tests with continuous outcome data for each of three pre-specified cut-off points investigated. Pre-set minimum sensitivity of a useful test was 60%, minimum specificity 75%. As pre-specifying three cut-offs for each continuous test may have led to missing a cut-off with useful sensitivity and specificity, we conducted post-hoc exploratory analyses to create receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves where there appeared some possibility of a useful cut-off missed by the original three. These analyses enabled assessment of which tests may be worth assessing in further research. A further exploratory analysis assessed the value of combining the best two index tests where each had some individual predictive ability.

Main Results

There were few published studies of the diagnostic accuracy of state (one time), minimally invasive clinical symptoms, signs or tests to be used as screening tests for detecting water-loss dehydration in older people. Therefore, to complete this review we sought, analysed and included raw datasets that included a reference standard and an index test in people aged ≥ 65 years. We included three studies with published diagnostic accuracy data and a further 21 studies provided datasets that we analysed. We assessed 67 tests (at three cut-offs for each continuous outcome) for diagnostic accuracy of water-loss dehydration (primary target condition) and of current dehydration (secondary target condition). Only three tests showed any ability to diagnose water-loss dehydration (including both impending and current water-loss dehydration) as stand-alone tests: expressing fatigue (sensitivity 0.71 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.96), specificity 0.75 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.85), in one study with 71 participants, but two additional studies had lower sensitivity); missing drinks between meals (sensitivity 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.86), in one study with 71 participants) and BIA resistance at 50 kHz (sensitivities 1.00 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.00) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90) and specificities of 1.00 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.00) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.99) in 15 and 22 people respectively for two studies, but with sensitivities of 0.54 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.81) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.79) and specificities of 0.50 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.84) and 0.19 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.21) in 21 and 1947 people respectively in two other studies). In post-hoc ROC plots drinks intake, urine osmolality and axillial moisture also showed limited diagnostic accuracy. No test was consistently useful in more than one study. Combining two tests so that an individual both missed some drinks between meals and expressed fatigue was sensitive at 0.71 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.96) and specific at 0.92 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.97). There was sufficient evidence to suggest that several stand-alone tests often used to assess dehydration in older people (including fluid intake, urine specific gravity, urine colour, urine volume, heart rate, dry mouth, feeling thirsty and BIA assessment of intracellular water or extracellular water) are not useful, and should not be relied on individually as ways of assessing presence or absence of dehydration in older people. No tests were found consistently useful in diagnosing current water-loss dehydration.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of the diagnostic utility of any individual clinical symptom, sign or test or combination of tests to indicate water-loss dehydration in older people. Individual tests should not be used in this population to indicate dehydration; they miss a high proportion of people with dehydration, and wrongly label those who are adequately hydrated. Promising tests identified by this review need to be further assessed, as do new methods in development. Combining several tests may improve diagnostic accuracy.
