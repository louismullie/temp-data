## Question

This question refers to the following information.
Under the name of Chartist well-meaning inconsiderate men and other misled men have in very many cases, all over the country from the extreme west to the extreme east and from Brighton in the south to nearly the extreme north of Scotland, denounced every man who is not a working man, applied to him, the grossest epithets and most atrocious intentions and conduct, have threatened them with vengeance and in some places, have proposed plans for the seizure and division of their property — numbers of misled men and others of bad character, under the self-denomination of Chartists have gone from place to place and in the most violent manner disturbed and dispersed meetings of various kinds. Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words — they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms — and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.
 — Excerpt of a letter from British social reformer Francis Place, written in 1842
The primary goal of the Chartist movement was which of the following?

Answer Choices:
A. Universal suffrage
B. Universal male suffrage
C. Universal health care
D. Social security and unemployment insurance

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the primary goal of the Chartist movement based on a historical excerpt and answer choices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical context and what Chartism actually demanded. Then, I should verify the specific clues in the excerpt that signal the suffrage demand. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that evidence. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and state the conclusion clearly, making sure I don't over-interpret beyond what the text supports.

> Let me first confirm the historical context. The Chartist movement in 19th-century Britain is known for its People's Charter, which centered on political reform, especially expanding the right to vote, and the excerpt dates from 1842, which aligns with the height of Chartist agitation for electoral change rather than social welfare policies like health care or unemployment insurance, which are modern constructs not on the Chartist agenda [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the key textual signal. The excerpt explicitly objects to the phrase "Household Suffrage" because, under any honest definition, it would exclude a large majority of men, and this objection is framed by working people who are part of the political movement; that strongly implies the movement's demand is broader than household-based suffrage and aimed at enfranchising more men, which points toward universal male suffrage rather than a property-restricted household suffrage or something narrower [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option A, universal suffrage. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while "universal suffrage" in modern usage often includes women, the Chartist platform historically focused on male suffrage and did not, in this period, advocate votes for women, so calling the primary goal "universal suffrage" would be anachronistic for 1842 even if it sounds more expansive at first glance [^notfound].

> Next, Option B, universal male suffrage. Let me think about this carefully. The criticism of "Household Suffrage" as exclusionary to most men, coupled with the movement's broader demands for democratic reform, supports that the Chartists sought suffrage for adult men irrespective of property qualifications, which is precisely universal male suffrage; this fits both the excerpt and the historical record of the People's Charter [^notfound].

> Now, Option C, universal health care. I should double-check whether there is any hint of health-system demands in the text. There is none; the excerpt and the Chartist era discourse are entirely about political rights and suffrage, not health services, so this is a modern policy anachronism and can be excluded [^notfound].

> Option D, social security and unemployment insurance, similarly fails the historical test. I need to ensure I'm not missing a hidden reference, but again, the text is about suffrage and political representation, not social insurance programs, which were not part of Chartist demands in the 1840s, so this is incorrect for the period and context [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the primary goal reflected in the excerpt is the expansion of the right to vote to all adult men, i.e., universal male suffrage, with the specific grievance that "Household Suffrage" would leave most men disenfranchised. Therefore, the best answer is B, universal male suffrage [^notfound].

---

The primary goal of the Chartist movement was **universal male suffrage** [^notfound], as reflected in their demand for voting rights for all adult men regardless of property ownership. The excerpt criticizes "Household Suffrage" for excluding most men, underscoring the Chartists' push for broader male enfranchisement [^notfound]. Options C and D are incorrect because Chartism focused on political reform, not social welfare or health care.

---

## Analysis of the excerpt

The excerpt criticizes "Household Suffrage" for excluding most men, which aligns with the Chartists' demand for **universal male suffrage** [^notfound]. This demand was a core part of the People's Charter, which called for voting rights for all adult men, regardless of property or income.

---

## Historical context of the Chartist movement

The Chartist movement emerged in the 1830s–1840s as a working-class campaign for political reform, centered on the **People's Charter**, which demanded:

- Universal male suffrage
- Secret ballots
- Annual parliaments
- Equal electoral districts
- Removal of property qualifications for MPs
- Payment of MPs

These demands reflect a focus on **political rights** rather than social welfare or health care.

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Relevance to chartist movement** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Universal suffrage | Partially relevant | Chartism sought universal male suffrage, not universal suffrage (including women) [^notfound]. |
| B. Universal male suffrage | Highly relevant | This was a primary demand of the Chartist movement, as evidenced by the excerpt and historical records [^notfound]. |
| C. Universal health care | Not relevant | Chartism focused on political reform, not health care or social welfare. |
| D. Social security and unemployment insurance | Not relevant | These modern social welfare concepts were not part of Chartist demands. |

---

## Conclusion

The primary goal of the Chartist movement was **universal male suffrage**, as clearly supported by the excerpt and historical context. The movement sought to expand political rights to all adult men, regardless of property ownership, and did not address social welfare or health care.

### Association of postoperative infections after fractures with long-term income among adults [^1afca606]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Individual Earnings

Postoperative infections were associated with reduced annual individual incomes by approximately $4000 for up to 6 years after injury (Figure 1; Table 2). However, the reductions in annual individual income associated with a postoperative infection were only statistically significant within 2, 3, and 4 years after the injury.

Social Security and Unemployment Benefits

Postoperative infections were associated with a lower amount of Social Security benefits (difference, −$288; 95% CI, −$477 to −$98; P = 0.002) in the year after injury (Figure 1; Table 2). In the following years, we did not observe a significant association between a postoperative infection and the value of Social Security benefits received. However, a postoperative infection was associated with increased odds of receiving Social Security benefits at 2 years after fracture (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.51–2.02; P < .001) and 5 years after injury (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.25–1.68; P < .001) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Postoperative infections were not associated with receiving unemployment insurance at 2 years (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72–1.21; P = 0.62) but were associated with a 3-fold increase in the odds of receiving unemployment insurance at 5 years after injury (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.82–4.23; P < .001) (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).

### Family economic security policies and child and family health [^a949a120]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2017). Low credibility.

In this review, we examine the effects of family economic security policies (i.e., minimum wage, earned income tax credit, unemployment insurance, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) on child and family health outcomes, summarize policy generosity across states in the USA, and discuss directions and possibilities for future research. This manuscript is an update to a review article that was published in 2014. Millions of Americans are affected by family economic security policies each year, many of whom are the most vulnerable in society. There is increasing evidence that these policies impact health outcomes and behaviors of adults and children. Further, research indicates that, overall, policies which are more restrictive are associated with poorer health behaviors and outcomes; however, the strength of the evidence differs across each of the four policies. There is significant diversity in state-level policies, and it is plausible that these policy variations are contributing to health disparities across and within states. Despite increasing evidence of the relationship between economic policies and health, there continues to be limited attention to this issue. State policy variations offer a valuable opportunity for scientists to conduct natural experiments and contribute to evidence linking social policy effects to family and child well-being. The mounting evidence will help to guide future research and policy making for evolving toward a more nurturing society for family and child health and well-being.

### Unemployment insurance and deteriorating self-rated health in 23 European countries [^536efcfa]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Theoretically, it is reasonable to assume that there are several pathways linking unemployment insurance to self-rated health. First, unemployment insurance reduces volatility of household income by transferring money to the unemployed who can invest resources in health-enhancing goods and activities. This consumption effect of increased household income is expected to occur even after more basic material needs have been satisfied, although with reduced health returns at higher income levels. Second, unemployment insurance plays an important redistributive role, lowering income differences in society, of relevance for the psychosocial foundations of health. Third, unemployment insurance may have beneficial health effects also for those in employment, not least by reducing feelings of stress and anxiety that may follow periods of increased job insecurity in society as a whole.

Although we may not fully disentangle these pathways, we can formulate two overarching hypotheses. At country level, we expect more extensive unemployment insurance programmes to reduce transitions into self-rated ill-health. Due to processes of risk-sharing in social protection, it is further reasonable to assume that unemployment insurance is linked to socioeconomic gradients of health at individual level. More specifically, we expect unemployment insurance to mitigate health risks associated with socioeconomic position.

### Unemployment insurance and deteriorating self-rated health in 23 European countries [^a02f2296]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Empirical investigations in this study are based on an analytical approach where legislated structures of unemployment insurance are at the centre. Appropriate dimensions of unemployment insurance are here systematically conceptualised and measured to facilitate large-scale comparative analyses of links between social protection and health. Specifically, we evaluate the role of unemployment insurance coverage and income replacement for self-rated health.

The health effects of recessions are subject for intense discussion. Macro-level analyses, surprisingly, show that economic downturns have few adverse effects on population health in high-income countries. In the short term, mortality may even decrease during recessions, and increase in economic upturns. Changes in risky behaviours is one proposed explanation for these counter-cyclical fluctuations in population health. However, macro-level relationships cannot straightforwardly be deduced to circumstances affecting health at individual level, where studies repeatedly demonstrate higher prevalence of ill-health among people in socioeconomically vulnerable positions. Although poverty and/or low income are important for the socioeconomic distribution of health, surprisingly few studies explicitly analyse the mediating effects of social protection. A recent study on the financial crisis and health in Europe concludes that the most vulnerable people are found in countries having largest public budget cuts and greatest unemployment increases. Results of this kind call for research on how policy-related factors structure individual health, and here unemployment insurance constitutes a crucial point of departure.

### Association between receipt of unemployment insurance and food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States [^1c093610]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the receipt of unemployment insurance and a $600/wk federal supplement to unemployment insurance associated with reduced food insecurity among people in low- and middle-income households who lost work during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1119 adults who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment insurance was associated with a 35% relative decline in food insecurity and a 48% relative decline in eating less due to financial constraints. The $600/wk federal supplement was associated with additional reductions in food insecurity.

Meaning

These findings suggest that expanding the amount and duration of unemployment insurance may be an effective approach to reducing food insecurity.

### Unemployment insurance and deteriorating self-rated health in 23 European countries [^8e2d9896]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this subject?

The prevention of the economic crisis with escalating mass unemployment turning into a health crisis was recently identified as a major challenge by WHO. Comparative research has empirically demonstrated important cross-national variations in health, differences that are assumed to be caused by welfare state organisation. However, we still know little about programme-level effects.

What this study adds?

This study uses a social rights perspective and empirically shows that unemployment insurance mitigated adverse health effects both at individual and country level during the economic crisis. Especially, programme coverage appears to counteract transitions into self-rated ill-health, and effects are particularly pronounced among individuals with low educational attainment.

Discussion

We have analysed the role of unemployment insurance for transitions into self-rated ill-health among working-age individuals at the onset of financial crisis in 23 European countries. The results show that unemployment insurance coverage reduces transitions into self-rated ill-health, whereas income replacement somewhat surprisingly appears to increase transitions. However, this replacement rate effect approaches zero at higher coverage rates. We also show that coverage rates are related to individual-level risk factors and socioeconomic gradients of health. Specifically, unemployment insurance coverage reduces the likelihood of people with lower education to experience transitions into self-rated ill-health.

The importance of benefit coverage for a well-functioning unemployment insurance system is intuitively reasonable. Administratively, programme access and eligibility of social risk groups comes prior to determining the size of entitlements. In this regard, income replacement matters less for health when few people are entitled to benefits. It is also evident that unemployment insurance affects the health status of people who are employed. As such, the association between unemployment insurance and self-rated health seems to be closely related to the psychosocial foundations of health. Reviewing social determinants of health, Wilkinson and Marmotconclude that health is affected before people actually get unemployed, as the first signs of ill-health appear already when people feel their jobs being threatened. Our analyses indicate that unemployment insurance has the potential to counteract this psychosocial mechanism, reducing the social gradient of health linked to educational attainment. Further analyses are welcome to validate our results, not least concerning alternative health outcomes.

Another issue that warrants more attention is regional differences in health and policy impacts. Not only the magnitude of the financial crisis differs across Europe, but also responses to the crisis varied. Although the association between unemployment insurance and transitions into self-rated ill-health is fairly robust in terms of overall regional differences, a few countries introduced major changes to unemployment insurance over the studied period. Such changes may be difficult to analyse in broadly comparative regression frameworks, instead requiring more indepth assessment, for example, through carefully chosen case studies of strategically selected countries, allowing researchers to identify meaningful and testable hypotheses of linkages between policy change and transitions into self-rated ill-health.

The results of our study underscore the merits of a comparative institutional approach in social epidemiology, where welfare states are analysed in terms of programmatic effects, quantifying core dimensions of social rights to facilitate sophisticated statistical analysis of policy impacts relevant for ongoing discussions about public health and other societal outcomes, not least during periods of financial crisis.

### Unemployment insurance and deteriorating self-rated health in 23 European countries [^23281dca]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The global financial crisis of 2008 is likely to have repercussions on public health in Europe, not least through escalating mass unemployment, fiscal austerity measures and inadequate social protection systems. The purpose of this study is to analyse the role of unemployment insurance for deteriorating self-rated health in the working age population at the onset of the fiscal crisis in Europe.

Methods

Multilevel logistic conditional change models linking institutional-level data on coverage and income replacement in unemployment insurance to individual-level panel data on self-rated health in 23 European countries at two repeated occasions, 2006 and 2009.

Results

Unemployment insurance significantly reduces transitions into self-rated ill-health and, particularly, programme coverage is important in this respect. Unemployment insurance is also of relevance for the socioeconomic gradients of health at individual level, where programme coverage significantly reduces health risks attached to educational attainment.

Conclusions

Unemployment insurance mitigated adverse health effects both at individual and country-level during the financial crisis. Due to the centrality of programme coverage, reforms to unemployment insurance should focus on extending the number of insured people in the labour force.

### Association between receipt of unemployment insurance and food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States [^bbcce82b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, UI was associated with a 35% reduction in reporting any food insecurity and a 48% decline in eating less due to financial constraints. Larger amounts of UI were associated with larger reductions in food insecurity. Millions of people are expected to lose UI when the federal UI provisions expire on March 14, 2021. Policy makers may wish to consider continued expansion of UI eligibility, duration, and amount as an approach to reducing food insecurity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Unemployment insurance and deteriorating self-rated health in 23 European countries [^7b015880]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The global financial crisis of 2008 is likely to have repercussions on public health in Europe, not least through escalating mass unemployment, fiscal austerity and inadequate social protection systems.WHOrecently expressed worries that developments may turn into a health crisis. Due to the socioeconomic gradients of health, we may further expect that health effects of the economic crisis are unequally distributed in society, with citizens in lower socioeconomic positions being particularly exposed.

The purpose of this study is to analyse the role of unemployment insurance for transitions into self-rated ill-health among the working-age population in 23 European countries during the onset of the global financial crisis between 2006 and 2009. Research on social protection and health is typically based on social expenditure dataor on categorisations of countries into welfare state regimes. These research strategies have provided important insights, but in terms of analysing distinct policy impacts they have analytical shortcomings. The poor validity of social expenditure to account for welfare state structures is well known. Perhaps the most serious problem is that social expenditures are heavily influenced by welfare needs and changes in the gross domestic product (GDP), the most widely used denominator. Welfare state regime classifications suffer from other and less recognised validity problems. In social epidemiology, welfare state regimes are often used as additional country-level variables to measure economic, political and institutional effects on public health. While this approach may show how welfare states function in different economic and political contexts, one drawback is that regime labels often are crude approximations of realities, suitable more as heuristic devices in descriptive analysis than addressing causal questions about policy effects. To gain a deeper understanding about how social protection contributes to healthier societies, we therefore need stronger focus on programmatic effects.

### Can differences in benefit levels explain duration and outcome of sickness absence? [^67a0c477]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study is to examine the long- and short-term economic incentives inherent in the sickness and unemployment insurances. In particular, how the differences, in, for instance, benefit levels between the two systems, affect the duration and outcome of long-term sickness for the unemployed.

Method

A sample of 280 sick-registered unemployed in the county of Värmland, Sweden was used in two regression models. Sickness duration was modelled in a linear regression and the outcome (healthy and non-healthy) in a logistic regression.

Results and Conclusion

The study shows that economic incentives, i.e. differences in benefit levels, help in explaining sickness duration. The proven fact, that benefits from the sickness insurance are in general higher than from the unemployment insurance, results in the sickness spells being prolonged. Indications are also found of a preference for long-term income security through the sickness and disability insurances, using the length of unemployment before sickness registration, as a determinant of the outcome of the sickness spell.

### Catastrophic health expenditure and mental health in the older Chinese population: the moderating role of social health insurance [^32e41a29]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

SHI offers household protection against future health risks. Unlike private health insurance, which is often voluntary and has restrictions on enrollment and benefits depending on the insurance program, SHI is usually compulsory, centrally administered by the government, and can be provided against risks that private insurance does not cover. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of SHI on the reduction of OOP health payments and consequently CHE and health payment-induced poverty, but the mechanism by which SHI relates to mental health status has not been specified in the literature. The existing evidence points to relevant perspectives in understanding this relationship. As a loss of income, or a change in financial status, and the associated negative events may lead people to feel that they have a lack of control over their own life, studies have demonstrated that social/welfare policies can improve mental health status through the increased availability of financial resources to cope with adverse economic and social conditions. For instance, andexamined sickness benefits that provided financial support during times of illness and concluded that generous sickness benefits had long-term impacts on self-reported life satisfaction and individual health trajectories and helped people to recuperate from illness.

Past CHE experience may be associated with future mental health status by influencing perceptions of future CHE risk, and policies aimed at reducing potential financial losses may help to improve financial security and consequently mental health. Using a social experimental design, found that expanding the coverage of a newly entitled Social Security Disability Insurance in the United States led to substantial improvements in mental health in the short run. They also suggested that short-term improvements in mental health may lead to longer-term reductions in other health impairments and mortality.) focused on old-age pensions and public unemployment insurance and found that these policies may lessen the negative effects of financial insecurity on individuals' subjective well-being.

### Falling between two stools; how a weak co-operation between the social security and the unemployment agencies obstructs rehabilitation of unemployed sick-listed persons [^a3845a5e]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore significant factors behind the weak co-operation between local social insurance and unemployment agencies impairing the rehabilitation of unemployed sick-listed persons.

Method

Individual, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with main actors directly involved in the sick-listing and rehabilitation process were conducted in the year 2000. In all 39 persons were interviewed: 25 professionals (physicians, public employment and social insurance officers) and 14 clients. Data were analysed according to Grounded theory method.

Results

The majority of unemployed sick-listed persons were declared too sick to work and were erased from the unemployment registers. This measure weakened the incentives for co-operation between the two main rehabilitation actors. The implication was that the unemployed sick-listed persons lost the opportunity of the co-ordinated rehabilitation they were entitled to. Three significant factors behind this process were identified by the main actors: indistinct regulation of co-operation, shifting political goals over time and conflicting goals between agencies; the last factor mainly a consequence of the other two.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that labour market changes and manifest political goals influence the rehabilitation efforts giving low priority to difficult-to-place individuals such as unemployed sick-listed persons. In fact, a labour market problem turns into a medical problem. The hypothesis needs further testing in quantitative studies.

### Analysis of patient income in the 5 years following a fracture treated surgically [^354b0e5a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limited Access to Social Welfare

Our second conclusion was that Social Security benefits significantly increased after the injury but offset less than 10% of lost income in any given year. Similar levels of Social Security protection were reported in a California-based study of hospitalized patients. Over one-quarter of tax-filing patients treated for fractures reported individual incomes of $0. Lacking formal employment precludes the contributary requirements of many social insurance benefits in the US, such as sick leave, unemployment insurance, and long-term disability benefits. By contrast, research from Denmark suggests that various social programs insured almost 50% of posthospitalization earnings decline.

The US has weaker employment protections than other Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and is only 1 of 3 OECD countries that do not provide universal access to paid sick leave. A lack of such social insurance policies likely contributes to the significant financial loss observed after injury. Employer-based health insurance was the most common form of coverage in the study population. Physical impairment that prevents patients from returning to work exposes individuals to further liability for downstream health care expenses. Increasing employment protections for sudden health events, passing legislation for mandatory sick pay benefits, and expanding social welfare programs may reduce the financial implications of orthopedic injury.

Catastrophic Income Loss

Our third conclusion was that fractures were associated with an 11.6% increase in the risk of catastrophic wage loss in the 2 years following injury. One in 10 patients treated for fractures experienced catastrophic wage loss under a more restrictive definition of a 75% reduction in income. Our estimates of catastrophic wage loss observed in the control group were similar to previous national estimates. Dobkin et alestimated an 11% decline in the probability of being employed 3 years after hospitalization, which was consistent with these findings.

### Association between receipt of unemployment insurance and food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States [^3aeecd08]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

More than 50 million US residents have lost work during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and food insecurity has increased.

Objective

To evaluate the association between receipt of unemployment insurance, including a $600/wk federal supplement between April and July, and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used difference-in-differences analysis of longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of US adults residing in low- and middle-income households (ie, < $75 000 annual income) who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from 15 waves of the Understanding Coronavirus in America study (conducted April 1 to November 11, 2020).

Exposure

Receipt of unemployment insurance benefits.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints, assessed every 2 weeks by self-report.

Results

Of 2319 adults living in households earning less than $75 000 annually and employed in February 2020, 1119 (48.3%) experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and made up our main sample (588 [53.6%] White individuals; mean [SD] age 45 [15] years; 732 [65.4%] women). Of those who lost employment, 415 (37.1%) reported food insecurity and 437 (39.1%) reported eating less due to financial constraints in 1 or more waves of the study. Among people who lost work, receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8–6.9) percentage point decrease in food insecurity (a 35.0% relative reduction) and a 5.7 (95% CI, 3.0–8.4) percentage point decrease in eating less due to financial constraints (a 47.8% relative reduction). Decreases in food insecurity were larger with the $600/wk supplement and for individuals who were receiving larger amounts of unemployment insurance.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this US national cohort study, receiving unemployment insurance was associated with large reductions in food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The $600/wk federal supplement and larger amounts of unemployment insurance were associated with larger reductions in food insecurity.

### Earnings losses in young-onset dementia: population-based study with admin data [^660e55fd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Outcomes

Outcome measures encompassed (1) earnings, (2) earnings plus benefits, and (3) income source, categorized as employment, disability insurance benefits, welfare benefits, unemployment benefits, retirement benefits, or other social security benefits. Earnings are equal to an individual's gross income from employment and self‐employment (euros, 2021 price level). Earnings plus benefits refer to an individual's personal income, which includes earnings along with additional income from social insurance benefits. Employment encompasses both employees and self‐employed individuals.

Disability insurance benefits refer to those receiving sickness or disability benefits in the reporting year. Sickness benefits are intended to cover short‐term illnesses or injuries. In the Netherlands, they amount to usually 70% of the daily wage and are provided for a period of a maximum of 2 years before disability benefits can be applied for. Throughout this designated "waiting period," employers are tasked with facilitating the worker's return to work by providing reintegration services or accommodations, alongside maintaining wage payments.

After sickness benefits, individuals can apply for disability benefits, which are intended to provide ongoing support for individuals with long‐term or permanent disabilities. In the Netherlands, eligibility for disability insurance is determined through a medical assessment and an evaluation of remaining job opportunities by a physician. A documented diagnosis is required to receive benefits. Depending on the assessed "remaining work capacity," benefits can range up to 75% of the last earned gross income, and last until reaching retirement age.

In cases of involuntary dismissal, individuals in the Netherlands can access unemployment benefits for a period ranging from 3 to 24 months depending on their work history. Initially, these benefits amount to 75% of the last salary for the first 2 months, and 70% thereafter, contingent on actively seeking new employment. If reemployment proves elusive after exhausting unemployment benefits, individuals may apply for welfare benefits.

Welfare benefits refer to social assistance and are a financial benefit provided to individuals who lack sufficient income or assets to meet their basic living expenses, with the amount determined by the established social minimum, which is ≈ €1050 per month in the Netherlands.

All income sources were treated as separate dichotomous variables. Further details on the definitions of outcome measures can be found in Tables S5‐S6 in supporting information.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^fbe4c8ca]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 3–1 — factors that influence health, quality of life, HIV transmission, and use of HIV prevention, medical, and social services among persons with HIV — details how specific social and structural factors affect care and prevention. Real or perceived alienation, discrimination, or stigma due to HIV infection, sexual orientation, sexual practices, drug use, race, ethnicity, age, gender, or other factors: factors may impair access to medical care, housing, or employment that can promote use of HIV prevention and care services and limit social support that can foster retention in HIV medical care, adherence to ART, transportation, housing, and use of other medical and social services that influence HIV transmission. Poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, or unstable housing: factors may lead to behaviors that can increase the risk of HIV transmission (e.g., exchanging sex for housing and money, sharing drug-injection equipment), hinder access to health insurance, medical care, ART, support for adherence to ART, risk-reduction interventions (e.g., condoms and sterile drug-injection equipment), and other medical and social services, and weaken immune function and impair adherence to and absorption of ART, which may influence viral load and infectiousness. Inadequate health insurance or access to affordable health care services: factors may impair access to HIV medical care, ART, support for adherence to ART, risk-reduction interventions, condoms, sterile drug-injection equipment, and other medical and social services. Limited education and health literacy: factor may impair understanding of the biologic or social basis for HIV transmission, prevention, and care.

### Employment insurance may mitigate impact of unemployment on food security: analysis on a propensity-score matched sample from the Canadian income survey [^3d8d800b]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Food insecurity, the inadequate access to food due to financial constraints, affects one-sixth of Canadian households, with substantial health implications. We examine the impact of unemployment and the mitigating effect of Employment Insurance (EI) on household food insecurity in Canada. Using the Canadian Income Survey 2018–2019, we sampled 28,650 households with adult workers 18–64 years old. We used propensity score matching to pair the 4085 households with unemployed workers with 3390 households with only continuously employed workers on their propensity towards unemployment. Among unemployed households, we also matched 2195 EI recipients with 950 nonrecipients. We applied adjusted logistic regression to the two matched samples. Food insecurity affected 15.1% of the households without unemployed workers and 24.6% of their unemployed counterparts, including 22.2% of EI recipients and 27.5% of nonrecipients. Unemployment was associated with 48% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–1.66; 5.67 percentage points) higher likelihood of food insecurity. This association was significant and similar across income levels, full-time and part-time workers, and household compositions. EI receipt was associated with 23% (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66–0.90; 4.02 percentage points) lower likelihood of food insecurity, but this association was only significant among households with lower income, full-time workers, and children under 18. The findings suggest a broad impact of unemployment on working adults' food insecurity and a substantial mitigating effect by EI on select unemployed workers. Making EI more generous and accessible for part-time workers may help alleviate food insecurity.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^84da7c49]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 12–1 — poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, and unstable housing: Factors may lead to behaviors that can increase the risk of HIV transmission (e.g., exchanging sex for housing and money, sharing drug-injection equipment) and hinder access to health insurance, medical care, ART, support for adherence to ART, risk-reduction interventions (e.g., condoms and sterile drug-injection equipment), and other medical and social services. Malnutrition and inconsistent access to food may also weaken immune function and impair adherence to and absorption of ART, which may increase viral load and infectiousness. Unstable housing or reliance on temporary shelter may also hinder the security and storage of ART and prevention devices (e.g., sterile drug-injection equipment and condoms) and complicate adherence to ART. Examples of specialty services include public income assistance; job training and employment support; nutrition services, counseling, food stamps, food banks, and soup kitchens; housing services: rental assistance, community shelters, supportive housing; and case management and navigation services to assist with enrollment in services.

### Comparison of unemployment-related health insurance coverage changes in medicaid expansion vs nonexpansion States during the COVID-19 pandemic [^74dc1d83]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased unemployment rates and long periods when individuals were without health insurance. Little is known about how Medicaid expansion facilitates Medicaid enrollment as a buffer to coverage loss owing to unemployment.

Objective

To compare changes in health insurance coverage status associated with pandemic-related unemployment among previously employed adults in states that have vs have not expanded Medicaid eligibility.

Design Setting and Participants

This cohort study included US adults aged 27 to 64 years who were employed at baseline in the 2020 to 2021 Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement, which included calendar years 2019 to 2020 (32462 person-years). Data analyses were conducted between November 2021 and April 2022.

Exposures

Job loss (ie, new unemployment) experienced during 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were coverage status (ie, uninsured status) and source of coverage (ie, employer sponsored, marketplace, and Medicaid). Using 2-way person-by-year fixed-effects regression models, changes in coverage status associated with unemployment in states that expanded Medicaid were compared with states that did not expand Medicaid. Additional analyses were performed based on prepandemic coverage status.

Results

The cohort included 16231 adults (mean age, 46.8 [95% CI, 46.6–47.0] years; 51.6% women). New unemployment was associated with an increase of 2.9 (95% CI, 1.1–4.6) percentage points (P = 0.002) in the proportion of uninsured adults in Medicaid expansion states and an increase of 10.7 (95% CI, 2.4–18.9) percentage points (P = 0.01) in nonexpansion states. Workers were 5.4 (95% CI, 1.9–8.9) percentage points (P = 0.003) more likely to enroll in Medicaid after a job loss if they lived in a Medicaid expansion state compared with workers experiencing job loss in nonexpansion states.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of US adults, unemployment-related Medicaid enrollment was more frequent in Medicaid expansion states during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medicaid expansion led to a smaller increase in uninsured adults because those who lost private insurance coverage (eg, employer sponsored) appeared more able to transition to Medicaid after job loss.

### Unemployment insurance program accessibility and suicide rates in the United States [^bf78781b]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Unemployment is a risk factor for suicide. Unemployment insurance is the primary policy tool in the United States for alleviating the burden of unemployment on individuals. Our objective was to estimate the effect of state unemployment insurance accessibility on suicide rates, and effect modification by sociodemographic factors and unemployment rate. We used quarterly data from all 50 U.S. states and Washington, DC from 2000 to 2015, for a total of 3264 state-quarter units of analysis. The exposure was the quarterly unemployment insurance recipiency rate, i.e. the percentage of unemployed persons who received unemployment insurance. The outcome was the state-quarterly suicide rate per 100,000 population. Linear regression models included state, year, and calendar quarter fixed effects, state time trends, and state-level economic covariates to account for state-specific time-varying confounding. We assessed effect modification by the state-level unemployment rate, educational attainment, age, gender, and race. Based on fully adjusted models, potential protective effects of higher unemployment insurance recipiency rates appear to be small and restricted to demographic groups at higher risk of suicide including men, non-Hispanic White Americans, and those 45–64 years of age. These groups also generally have higher UI recipiency rates, therefore differences in subgroup estimates may reflect variations in eligibility policies and accessibility of UI programs.

### Hypertension in young adults: social determinants of prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control [^b5179942]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension prevalence remains high among U.S. young adults, and the role of social needs in their hypertension management remains poorly understood.

Methods

Data from 2017–2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (N = 8,024, representing 244 million adults) were used to study hypertension, defined per 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines or self-report of blood pressure-lowering medications. Prevalences of hypertension, awareness of condition, treatment if aware, and control if treated were estimated among young (18–39 years), middle-aged (40–64 years), and older adults (≥ 65 years). Weighted log binomial regression estimated associations between social needs (0, 1, or ≥ 2) and hypertension outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Social needs included less than high school education, family income < 100% of the federal poverty level, no health insurance, food insecurity based on the U.S. Food Security Survey, and current unemployment.

Results

Among 2,680 young adults (weighted N = 92 million; 51% female, 58% NHW), hypertension prevalence was 22.6% (95% CI: 19.5%-25.7%). Among those with hypertension, 19.3% of young, 20.2% of middle-aged, and 10.0% of older adults had ≥ 2 social needs. Among treated adults, those with ≥ 2 vs no social needs were less likely to have controlled hypertension (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.59–0.92). This aRR was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.43–1.32) in young adults, 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57–0.96) in middle-aged adults, and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.51–1.04) in older adults (p for interaction = 0.12).

Conclusions

Unmet social needs, more prevalent among young adults, were associated with lower rates of hypertension control, highlighting directions for interventions.

### The great recession, unemployment and suicide [^4dc7b123]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Welfare state regimes

In her review of the literature, Bartleyidentifies poverty and financial anxiety as especially important mechanisms linking unemployment to increased suicide risk (similar conclusions are drawn by Hamermesh and Soss). This suggests a potentially modifying effect of a generous welfare system that can provide a safety net in precarious situations and mitigate the adverse effect of a job loss. The hypothesis that the health effect of economic downturns is contingent on the generosity of the social welfare system receives support from the few studies that have addressed this topic. Thus Stuckler et al, on the basis of time-series data for 26 European Union (EU) countries between 1970 and 2007, found that the unemployment effect on suicide was lower in countries with high labour market security, proxied by government spending on labour market programmes. Similar findings are reported on the basis of US state data. Further, in their analyses of time-series data for 23 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for the period 1960–1997, Gerdtham and Ruhmfound a modifying impact of social insurance spending on the association between unemployment and total mortality. However, the approach of using data on government expenditure on welfare provisions has some well-known limitations; social spending is in itself heavily influenced by structural changes reflecting business cycles, demographic trends or labour market transformation. We will instead rely on an alternative approach that classifies welfare states on the basis of the content and nature of social citizenship rights, as indicated by legislated social insurance replacement rates. More specifically, we will apply a scheme that has been developed within comparative population health research, and that has been used in comparative analyses of the association between unemployment and health. In this scheme the countries are classified into five welfare state regimes, ranked from low (1) to high (5) levels of social and financial protection during unemployment: (1) Eastern European countries; (2) Southern European countries; (3) Anglo-Saxon countries; (4) Bismarckian; and (5) Scandinavian countries (see table 1). The ranking is based on the generosity of the unemployment protection system as indicated by four indicators: 'the generosity of benefits paid to the unemployed (replacement rates), the qualifying period and conditions, duration of benefit payments and the waiting period before entitlement is activated'. The highest replacement rates (the most important indicator)are thus found in the Scandinavian and Bismarckian countries, the lowest in the eastern and southern European countries, with the Anglo-Saxon countries in between (table 1).

### Psychosocial determinants predicting long-term sickness absence: a register-based cohort study [^16db99e7]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Design and sample

We conducted a register-based cohort study using psychosocial determinants and disability-related data from the disability register of sickness fund organisations. Psychosocial determinants are collected by sickness fund organisations, in compliance with the legislation, I which requires the collection of psychosocial data in sick-listed individuals. Other data (eg, diagnosis, sociodemographic variables) were extracted via the patients' file within the sickness fund organisations.

We included socially insured Belgian citizens who entered the seventh week of sickness absence for any reason between August 21 and December 3, 2017, excluding civil servants and self-employed individuals, who have different social insurance systems in Belgium. The eligibility criteria for receiving disability benefits are the same for employees and unemployed patients. The major evaluation criterion is having a reduced earning capacity of more than 66% due to new or worsening of functional disorders. When unemployed patients are no longer eligible, they will receive again unemployment benefits. The selected cohort was followed at least 341 days after the start of their sick leave period. The sickness fund organisations provided this follow-up data. Data extraction was executed on November 9, 2018.

### Association of postoperative infections after fractures with long-term income among adults [^c11fce66]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The preinjury household income levels of the sample were less than half the state median household income level. This difference highlights the profound socioeconomic deprivation faced by many patients with orthopedic trauma prior to their injury. The low reported earnings imply that many patients with fracture were without formal employment prior to their injury. This lack of workforce participation would negate the patient's eligibility to obtain sick leave benefits from a workplace, unemployment insurance, and Social Security Disability Insurance. The early access to Social Security benefits in this study was realized by patients who were male and White and were in the top income quartile. This allocation inequity questions the distributional fairness of social insurance programs. The distributions observed in the study provide further evidence of limited social welfare for historically disenfranchised subpopulations.

Despite the frequency and associated socioeconomic impacts, surgical site infections that occur after fracture surgery are not currently included in the National Healthcare Safety Network Surgical Care Improvement Project. Therefore, they are not captured in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's National Scorecard on Hospital-Acquired Conditions. Given the profound societal costs, surgical site infections that occur after fracture surgery should be included in this national health care quality surveillance program. The financial implications of postoperative infections for patients should be included in evaluating infection prevention interventions and should be used to assess the marginal value of public investments in patient safety. Finally, the study highlights the disconnect between health care and social insurance programs, supporting the need for the further integration of these 2 domains.

### Analysis of patient income in the 5 years following a fracture treated surgically [^5f6f1932]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Study Outcomes

Tax-reported income was evaluated up to 5 years after injury. The primary outcome was individual earnings, obtained from pretax wages and salary reported on W-2 tax forms. Secondary outcomes included household income, Social Security benefits, and catastrophic wage loss. Household income was estimated using the federal adjusted gross income of the patient's household and includes wage earnings, Social Security benefits, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, disability insurance, and most legal settlements. Social Security benefits were reported at the individual level and included Supplementary Security Income, Disability Insurance, and Social Security Retirement Income. Catastrophic wage loss was defined as a ratio of less than 0.5 when dividing the sum of the mean wage earnings in the year of the injury plus 2 years postinjury by the sum of the mean wage earnings in the 2 years prior to injury. We adjusted incomes for inflation using the Consumer Price Index and reported in 2018 US dollars. We recoded the earnings of individuals with negative incomes or nonfilers to zero, consistent with the methods previously used by Chetty et al.

Covariates

Demographic and injury characteristics were obtained from patient medical records and tax data. Demographic data included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and type of health insurance. Clinical data included the mechanism of injury, Abbreviated Injury Scale scores for all body regions, location of the fracture, and the number of surgical procedures associated with the index injury. Comorbidity data included tobacco use, hypertension, depression, diabetes, alcohol use, and drug use. Each individual was assigned an Area Deprivation Index (ADI) value based on their tax return address in the year before time zero. ADI measures neighborhood deprivation based on income, education, employment, and housing quality indicators from the 2011–2015 American Community Survey.

### Unemployment and associations with diagnosed health problems in the Norwegian GP-DEP study: a repeated cross-sectional register study (2010–2016) [^ea59c40a]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Materials and methods

The study design is a repeated cross-sectional registry-based study, that is, we performed cross-sectional examinations of the Norwegian working-age population for each year from 2010 to 2016.

Setting

Social security benefits

Unemployment benefits are paid to workers who register as job seekers in the Norwegian social insurance system and submit an employment status form fortnightly. Unemployment benefits cover 62,4% of mean income during the last 12 or 36 months and may last up to 52 or 104 weeks depending on income level (< €20 972 or ≥ €20 972, respectively (exchange rates per 13 December 2024)). The benefit replaces ordinary income and is registered as pensionable income. Recipients of unemployment benefits must agree to work at least 50% anywhere in Norway and participate in active labour market initiatives under the auspices of the Norwegian Labours and Welfare Administration (NAV). The right to unemployment benefits (at least 50%) also includes partially sick-listed workers up to 50% and disability pensioners who work at least 30%. The unemployed also have sick leave rights in health-related reduced working capacity cases. Thus, work and health-related benefits and unemployment benefits may run parallel or sequentially during 1 year. Therefore, in this study, 'a recipient' can have one or more cumulative days of unemployment benefits during the year in question and may transit between and combine work, unemployment benefits and health-related benefits.

Healthcare

Norway offers universal healthcare, ensuring all residents equal access to low-cost medical care covered by the National Insurance Scheme. More than 99% of the population has a designated GP providing assessments and care for a broad range of health problems. GPs act as gatekeepers to specialised healthcare, certify sickness absence and recommend disability pension. Statistics from the Norwegian Directorate of Health report that 64% of the working-age population consulted their GP each year during the study period.

### Associations between health-related social needs and cardiovascular health among US adults [^f55ebd6a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Health‐Related Social Needs

Healthy People 2030 grouped SDOH into 5 domains: economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context. Based on the 5 domains of the SDOH, we identified 8 HRSN components and assigned a value of 1 for unfavorable status of each: employment status (unemployed versus employed); family poverty‐to‐income ratio (< 130% versus ≥ 130%); food security (not secure versus secure); education level (less than high school versus high school or above); health care access (not having a routine place to go, except an emergency room versus having a routine place to go for health care or health advice); health insurance status (no insurance, except Indian Health Service or single service versus insurance); homeownership (rent or another arrangement versus own the home even if still paying a mortgage); and marriage status (never married, divorced, widowed or separated versus married or living with a partner). Details of HRSN‐related questions are available in Table S1. The information on homeownership is not available in NHANES 2017 to March 2020 cycles. The number of unfavorable HRSNs were summed and ranged from 0 to 8, with higher numbers indicating more unfavorable HRSNs. We categorized unfavorable HRSNs as none, 1–2, 3–4, and ≥ 5.

### Assisting social security disability insurance beneficiaries with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression in returning to work [^96436d2e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

People with psychiatric impairments (primarily schizophrenia or a mood disorder) are the largest and fastest-growing group of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries. The authors investigated whether evidence-based supported employment and mental health treatments can improve vocational and mental health recovery for this population.

Method

Using a randomized controlled trial design, the authors tested a multifaceted intervention: team-based supported employment, systematic medication management, and other behavioral health services, along with elimination of barriers by providing complete health insurance coverage (with no out-of-pocket expenses) and suspending disability reviews. The control group received usual services. Paid employment was the primary outcome measure, and overall mental health and quality of life were secondary outcome measures.

Results

Overall, 2,059 SSDI beneficiaries with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression in 23 cities participated in the 2-year intervention. The teams implemented the intervention package with acceptable fidelity. The intervention group experienced more paid employment (60.3% compared with 40.2%) and reported better mental health and quality of life than the control group.

Conclusions

Implementation of the complex intervention in routine mental health treatment settings was feasible, and the intervention was effective in assisting individuals disabled by schizophrenia or depression to return to work and improve their mental health and quality of life.

### Association of medicaid expansion with health insurance coverage among persons with a disability [^8deaa9da]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Outcome Measures

The outcome variable was whether the respondent had any health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage, or private health insurance coverage. The predictor variable was disability, defined in the ACS as a reporting of 1 or more conditions limiting activity that included cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, independent living, and sensory difficulties. The Social Security Administration's rules for defining disability require that a person have 1 or more medically diagnosed physical or mental impairments that are expected to prevent the person from substantial gainful activity for at least 12 months. An important difference between the Social Security Administration definition and our measure is that in ours, disability is self-reported by the respondent rather than medically determined. The trend in health insurance coverage by disability category can be found in the eFigure in the Supplement.

Control variables included sex (female or male), age (26–44 or 45–64 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, or other race/ethnicity), immigration status (born in the United States, naturalized citizen, noncitizen), marital status (married or unmarried), level of education (less than high school, high school, some college, or college), employment status (unemployed or employed), residence in a metropolitan area, and poverty status (income of 0% to < 100% vs 100% to 138% of the federal poverty level).

### Social determinants of health and pediatric cancer survival: a systematic review [^2ebfc3e3]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

4 | DISCUSSION

We conducted a systematic review that examines any association between social determinants and cancer survival among pediatric patients. Previous reviews have linked race and ethnicity as well as SES to cancer survival. As defined by Healthy People 2030, SDoH span multiple categories that race/ethnicity and SES alone do not address. Findings from this review generally support existing literature linking SES to poor survival outcomes. Additionally, this review examines several studies that test the relationship between poverty (or income), education, insurance coverage, geography (rural vs. urban and driving distance), and crowding. Only insurance coverage, particularly being uninsured or having low-income public insurance, was associated with poorer survival outcomes. Finally, this review identifies several social determinants that have not been extensively studied in the context of pediatric cancer survival: food security, stable employment (and not overall unemployment rates), health literacy, civic participation, social cohesion, and discrimination.

### The effect of re-employment on perceived health [^ba04f66b]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between unemployment and poor health has been well established. Unemployment causes poor health, and poor health increases the probability of unemployment.

Methods

A prospective study with 6&emsp14; months' follow-up was conducted among unemployed participants receiving social security benefits who were capable of full-time employment and were referred to a re-employment training centre. Re-employment was defined as ending social security benefits for at least 3 months because of starting with paid employment. Health-related quality of life was measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. A Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the factors that predicted re-employment during follow-up. The influence of re-employment on changes in perceived health was investigated with linear regression analysis.

Results

Unemployed participants with a poor health at baseline were less likely to return to paid employment during follow-up. Almost all dimensions of health at baseline had an influence on the likelihood of becoming employed. Among the re-employed participants, general health, physical functioning, social functioning, vitality, mental health, bodily pain and role limitations due to emotional or physical problems improved, with an effect size varying from 0.11 to 0.66.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that re-employment leads to improvement of self-perceived health within a short time window. This suggests that labour force participation should be considered as therapeutic intervention within health promotion programmes among unemployed persons.

### Trends in permanent work disability associated with rheumatoid arthritis in the United States, 1999–2015 [^7e53b3b8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advances in treatment over the past 20years have resulted in improved control of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of our study was to investigate whether there has been a decrease in permanent work disability associated with RA in the US.

Methods

Medicare data from 1999 to 2015 were used to identify beneficiaries age 20-59years with RA who became eligible for Medicare coverage under Social Security Disability Insurance. Diagnosis of RA was based on physician claims in the first year of enrollment. Annual rates of enrollment were sex- and age-standardized to the 2000 US population.

Results

The study included 97,787 beneficiaries with RA and Social Security Disability Insurance across all years. Medicare enrollment was 26.0 per million in 1999 and 26.0 per million in 2015. Rates increased following the Great Recession of 2008–2009 before returning to prerecession levels. There was no linear trend over time after adjusting for the annual national unemployment rate (relative risk 0.99 per year [95% confidence interval 0.99–1.00]; P = 0.69). Risks of work disability were much higher among workers over age 50 years.

Conclusion

Based on Medicare enrollment by recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance, there was no decrease in permanent work disability among young and middle-age workers with RA in the US between 1999 and 2015.

### Social risk profile and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome in US adults [^c0f1d1b0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessments of

Information was collected by standardized questionnaire through face‐to‐face interviews. According to the Healthy People 2030 five domains of social determinants of health, economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context, we included 8 measures of SRP and dichotomized the factors based on conventional cutoff points and analyses (Table S1): employment (employed, unemployed), income level (measured with the family income/poverty ratio [PIR]: low as PIR < 3, high as PIR ≥ 3), food security (measured with food security survey module questions:secure as 0 affirmative, insecure as ≥ 1 affirmative), education (low as high school or lower, high as college or above), access to health care (routine place, no routine place), health insurance (private insurance, government, or no insurance), housing instability (own, rent, or other arrangements), and marital status (married, not married).

We defined employed, high PIR, food secure, high education attainment, private insurance, owning a house, and married as positive SRP measures, which was detailed in Table S1. The SRP scores were graded according to the number of coexistent positive SRP measures, ranging from 0 to 8. The higher the SRP score was, the better the SRP a participant had. We then classified SRP scores into 4 levels by quartiles: low (0–2), lower‐middle (3–4), upper‐middle (5–6), and high (7–8).

### Employer reasons for failing to report eligible workers' compensation claims in the BLS survey of occupational injuries and illnesses [^c953dd79]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Washington workers' compensation data

Washington State industrial insurance laws mandate that all employers obtain workers' compensation insurance through the Washington State Fund workers' compensation insurance program, unless they are covered by another insurance system, 1 or meet the requirements to self‐insure. The State Fund is administered by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The self‐insurance program is also regulated by L&I, and self‐insured employers are required to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements that mandate routine submission of claims data to L&I. Over 99% of Washington workers' compensation employer accounts are insured through the State Fund. The remaining accounts are self‐insured and typically represent Washington's largest employers.

Workers' compensation accounts are associated with an employer's Uniform Business Identifier (UBI), a Washington State specific employer identifier that links an employer across Washington State government administrative databases (e.g. Washington Department of Labor and Industries and Washington State Employment Security Department).

A Washington State workers' compensation claim is initiated by an injured worker and a healthcare provider who together complete a Report of Industrial Injury or Occupational Disease and file it with L&I. After receiving the report, L&I notifies the employer that a workers' compensation claim has been opened. Workers' compensation insurance pays for medical treatment of a work injury or illness. The injured worker becomes eligible for wage replacement if missed work extends beyond the three calendar days immediately following the day of injury.

Washington unemployment insurance data

The Washington State Employment Security Department collects and maintains unemployment insurance (UI) data on Washington employers. Each employer in Washington is assigned an account, which may be divided into multiple report units to denote separate worksites, each described by a unique report unit number and address. Employers submit quarterly payroll data that include worker names and social security numbers for each UI account (worker names and social security numbers are not available at the level of the report unit). The UI account is associated with the Washington UBI.

BLS samples establishments for participation in the SOII from the UI data in the form of the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages [Selby et al. 2008]. Sampled establishments may represent an entire UI account or one of many report units within an account.

UI data were made available through a data sharing agreement with the Washington State Employment Security Department.

### Workplace injuries and receipt of benefits from workers' compensation and social security disability insurance [^39315e4e]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We examine whether workers who experience permanently disabling injuries covered by workers' compensation (WC) end up on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and whether Social Security Administration (SSA) seems to offset WC payments for permanently disabling injuries against SSDI benefits, when appropriate. Methods: We capture data on WC benefit receipt from the Health and Retirement Study and link it to SSA data on WC and SSDI recipients to study descriptive information on these questions. Results: We find that SSA seems to be missing data on WC benefits for a sizable share of recipients of WC benefits and that the frequency with which SSDI benefits are reduced because of the WC offset seems surprisingly low. Conclusions: For a variety of reasons, WC benefits for permanently disabling injuries may not be appropriately offset against SSDI benefits, possibly shifting the cost of these workplace injuries to SSDI.

### Regional socioeconomic disparities in outcomes for workers with low back pain in the United States [^01e1c5bb]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although regional socioeconomic (SE) factors have been associated with worse health outcomes, prior studies have not addressed important confounders or work disability.

Methods

A national sample of 59360 workers' compensation (WC) cases to evaluate impact of regional SE factors on medical costs and length of disability (LOD) in occupational low back pain (LBP).

Results

Lower neighborhood median household incomes (MHI) and higher state unemployment rates were associated with longer LOD. Medical costs were lower in states with more workers receiving Social Security Disability, and in areas with lower MHI, but this varied in magnitude and direction among neighborhoods. Medical costs were higher in more urban, more racially diverse, and lower education neighborhoods.

Conclusions

Regional SE disparities in medical costs and LOD occur even when health insurance, health care availability, and indemnity benefits are similar. Results suggest opportunities to improve care and disability outcomes through targeted health care and disability interventions.

Individual-Level Household SEP

The main exposure was household SEP classified by the legal employment status of either the parent whose health insurance covered the child or the adolescent themself if they were enrolled as a full member of the insurance carrier. Most children and adolescents in Germany are insured as part of their parents' insurance until they finish secondary education. After reaching the age of 14 years, young people who start gainful employment or vocational training or have their income paid by social security become full members of the insurance carrier. Most children in our sample were insured by a parent (637 741 [92.6%]), and 50 964 (7.4%) were individual members of the insurance carrier.

The employment status of the insurance holder is documented using a standard coding system. Since the status information is time-varying, it was recorded at the point of study entry (ie, beginning of the study period, beginning of the insurance, birth). We distinguished 5 household SEPs: insurance holder (1) has regular employment, (2) has low-wage employment (wage less than poverty line) with additional social benefits, (3) receives short-term unemployment benefits, (4) receives social benefits for long-term unemployment, and (5) is economically inactive, ie, students, retired early, or otherwise economically inactive.

Area-Level Socioeconomic Characteristics

Previous studies have shown that neighborhood characteristics are associated with COVID-19; therefore, we additionally included area-level information. Indicators were linked using the postal code of the participant's home address. Linkage was performed on the level of the 400 German districts ((Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques–3 level), and 3 indicators derived from official statistics were assigned: (1) degree of urbanization of the community of residence, (2) mean living space (in meters squared) per inhabitant in the district of residence, and (3) median income (in euros) in the district of residence. Areas were classified according to their relative position in the distribution of the respective indicator in Germany using quartiles.

### Social insurance literacy: a scoping review on how to define and measure it [^b13690c9]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sickness insurance and workers' compensation systems decide on peoples' eligibility for benefits, and are commonly based on medical certificates and assessments of work ability. Systems differ in the extent to which they preserve clients' dignity and right to fair assessments. In this article, we define a new concept for studying interactions between individuals and systems: social insurance literacy, which concerns how well people understand the different procedures and regulations in social insurance systems, and how well systems communicate with clients in order to help them understand the system.

Methods

The concept was defined through a scoping literature review of related concepts, a conceptual re-analysis in relation to the social insurance field, and a following workshop.

Results

Five related concepts were reviewed for definitions and operationalizations: health literacy, financial/economic literacy, legal capability/ability, social security literacy, and insurance literacy.

Conclusions

Social insurance literacy is defined as the extent to which individuals can obtain, understand and act on information in a social insurance system, related to the comprehensibility of the information provided by the system. This definition is rooted in theories from sociology, social medicine and public health. In the next step, a measure for the concept will be developed based on this review. Implications for rehabilitationSocial insurance literacy is a new concept that is based on theories in sociology, social medicine and public health. It provides conceptual orientation for analyzing factors that may influence different outcomes of peoples' contacts with social insurance systems. The concept is of relevance for rehabilitation professionals since it focuses on how interactions between individuals and systems can influence the rehabilitation process. The study will in the next step develop a measure of social insurance literacy which will have practical applications for rehabilitation professionals.

### Inequalities in health system coverage and quality: a cross-sectional survey of four latin American countries [^f0a03900]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Mexico

The system includes heterogeneous public and private sectors. There are five social security institutions: the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) covering 54·4%, the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers covering 10·7%, and the medical services for oil industry workers, the Army, and the Navy collectively covering 1·9% of the population. Four bodies provide services to the population without social security: the Ministry of Health, the state health secretariats, Institute of Health for Welfare, and IMSS-Bienestar. Approximately 9·7% of the population have private health insurance.

Peru

The health system in Peru is fragmented. The Ministry of Health provides health services through the Comprehensive Insurance System, covering around 61% of the total population — mainly the poorest, those from the informal economy, and the unemployed and their families. The Ministry of Labour, through the Social Security System, provides health services to the working class and their families (20%). Those working in the Peruvian Armed Forces and National Police (2%) are protected by their own health institution. Private health insurance covers around 3% of the population.

Uruguay

The health system in Uruguay consists of the public sector (28%), social security (70%; referred to as mutuales — non-profit organisations providing services to members who are generally workers from a specific sector) — and a small private sector. The National Integrated Health System (SNIS) was created in 2007 and comprises public and private health-care providers, and is financed through the National Health Fund — a single, public and mandatory fund, with a contributory component (employers and employees) and a general state revenue component. The SNIS guarantees universal coverage through 42 eligible health providers, which provide a comprehensive package of benefits that is the same for all. The Ministry of Public Health manages the system, defines health policies, and regulates providers.

### Public pensions and unmet medical need among older people: cross-national analysis of 16 European countries, 2004–2010 [^80a96672]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Since the onset of the Great Recession in Europe, unmet need for medical care has been increasing, especially in persons aged 65 or older. It is possible that public pensions buffer access to healthcare in older persons during times of economic crisis, but to our knowledge, this has not been tested empirically in Europe.

Methods

We integrated panel data on 16 European countries for years 2004–2010 with indicators of public pension, unemployment insurance and sickness insurance entitlement from the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset and unmet need (due to cost) prevalence rates from EuroStat 2014 edition. Using country-level fixed-effects regression models, we evaluate whether greater public pension entitlement, which helps reduce old-age poverty, reduces the prevalence of unmet medical need in older persons and whether it reduces inequalities in unmet medical need across the income distribution.

Results

We found that each 1-unit increase in public pension entitlement is associated with a 1.11 percentage-point decline in unmet medical need due to cost among over 65s (95% CI -0.55 to -1.66). This association is strongest for the lowest income quintile (1.65 percentage points, 95% CI -1.19 to -2.10). Importantly, we found consistent evidence that out-of-pocket payments were linked with greater unmet needs, but that this association was mitigated by greater public pension entitlement (β = -1.21 percentage points, 95% CI -0.37 to -2.06).

Conclusions

Greater public pension entitlement plays a crucial role in reducing inequalities in unmet medical need among older persons, especially in healthcare systems which rely heavily on out-of-pocket payments.

### Universalism without the targeting: privatizing the old-age welfare state [^7fc23b28]. The Gerontologist (2005). Low credibility.

Decades of conservative attempts to scale back Social Security and Medicare, by limiting the program's universality through means testing and drastic benefit cuts, have failed. Thus, after numerous unsuccessful attempts at dismantling the U.S.'s universal old-age welfare state, or even meaningfully restraining its growth, conservative critics have developed a new approach. They are wrapping promarket "privatization" policy proposals in the popular universal framework of Social Security and Medicare. What is fundamentally different about privatization is that it embraces (or at least acquiesces to) key aspects of universalism, including broad-based eligibility and benefits that "maintain accustomed standards of living", which leave universal programs with rock-hard public support. Proponents argue privatization will "save" these programs. What distinguishes this approach from past retrenchment efforts is that promarket privatization policies, while supporting key universal tenets, will retrench Social Security's and Medicare's redistributive facets. Instead of limiting the most popular features of universalism, privatization proposals limit the redistributive elements of our large social insurance programs.

### Social and medical vulnerability factors of emergency department frequent users in a universal health insurance system [^6bd5af16]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives were to identify the social and medical factors associated with emergency department (ED) frequent use and to determine if frequent users were more likely to have a combination of these factors in a universal health insurance system.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review case-control study comparing randomized samples of frequent users and nonfrequent users at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland. The authors defined frequent users as patients with four or more ED visits within the previous 12 months. Adult patients who visited the ED between April 2008 and March 2009 (study period) were included, and patients leaving the ED without medical discharge were excluded. For each patient, the first ED electronic record within the study period was considered for data extraction. Along with basic demographics, variables of interest included social (employment or housing status) and medical (ED primary diagnosis) characteristics. Significant social and medical factors were used to construct a logistic regression model, to determine factors associated with frequent ED use. In addition, comparison of the combination of social and medical factors was examined.

Results

A total of 359 of 1,591 frequent and 360 of 34,263 nonfrequent users were selected. Frequent users accounted for less than a 20th of all ED patients (4.4%), but for 12.1% of all visits (5,813 of 48,117), with a maximum of 73 ED visits. No difference in terms of age or sex occurred, but more frequent users had a nationality other than Swiss or European (n = 117 [32.6%] vs. n = 83 [23.1%], p = 0.003). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that social and specific medical vulnerability factors most increased the risk of frequent ED use: being under guardianship (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 15.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7 to 147.3), living closer to the ED (adjusted OR = 4.6; 95% CI = 2.8 to 7.6), being uninsured (adjusted OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.8), being unemployed or dependent on government welfare (adjusted OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.4), the number of psychiatric hospitalizations (adjusted OR = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.5 to 14.1), and the use of five or more clinical departments over 12 months (adjusted OR = 4.5; 95% CI = 2.5 to 8.1). Having two of four social factors increased the odds of frequent ED use (adjusted = OR 5.4; 95% CI = 2.9 to 9.9), and similar results were found for medical factors (adjusted OR = 7.9; 95% CI = 4.6 to 13.4). A combination of social and medical factors was markedly associated with ED frequent use, as frequent users were 10 times more likely to have three of them (on a total of eight factors; 95% CI = 5.1 to 19.6).

Conclusions

Frequent users accounted for a moderate proportion of visits at the Lausanne ED. Social and medical vulnerability factors were associated with frequent ED use. In addition, frequent users were more likely to have both social and medical vulnerabilities than were other patients. Case management strategies might address the vulnerability factors of frequent users to prevent inequities in health care and related costs.

### Unemployment due to the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic among people with and without severe disabilities: a difference-in-differences analysis [^c23269d8]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Unemployment reduces health and impairs participation in important areas of life, especially for people with severe disabilities, who tend to have a longer duration of unemployment and are less likely to find new employment than their counterparts without such constraints. Our analysis examines the increase in unemployment due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among people with and without severe disabilities in Germany.

Methods

Monthly cross-sectional data on unemployment for 2019 and 2020 were provided by the Federal Employment Agency. We used a difference-in-differences model to estimate the increase in unemployment attributable to the pandemic. The months April to December 2020 represented the months of exposure to the pandemic. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) are reported.

Results

The increase in unemployment among people with severe disabilities due to the pandemic is 11.2% (IRR 1.112; 95%CI 1.107 to 1.117). People with severe disabilities receiving unemployment benefits due to unemployment lasting less than a year (Social Code III: short-term unemployment) and women have been most affected. Among people without severe disabilities, unemployment has increased by 24.8% due to the pandemic (IRR 1.248; 95%CI 1.246 to 1.249), while people receiving unemployment benefits according to social code III and men have been most affected. Both groups show a varying increase in unemployment depending on the region of residency.

Conclusions

The findings show a particularly significant increase in unemployment among people without severe disabilities. People with severe disabilities might be less impacted due to the special legal protection against their dismissal. The clear regional differences in the increase in unemployment suggest a strong influence of regional economics.

### The association between becoming uninsured and forgoing medical care among middle-aged and older adults in Mexico with chronic health conditions [^9038b2ea]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Translational Significance

The replacement of the health insurance program Seguro Popular with Instituto de Salud para el Bienestar in 2020 led to a large increase in the uninsured population in Mexico. Using nationally representative data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study, we found that middle-aged and older adults in Mexico who became uninsured were more likely to discontinue medications for chronic conditions and to forgo medical care for a serious health condition. Our results further emphasize the importance of middle-aged and older adults maintaining health insurance coverage to avoid interruptions to their health care.

The decrease in infant mortality in Mexico, driven by advances in public health and improvements in living conditions, has led to a considerable increase in total life expectancy. From 1960 to 2022, life expectancy at birth in Mexico increased from 53 to 72 for men and from 57 to 78 for women. This increase in total life expectancy, along with a decline in fertility, has increased the proportion of Mexico's population that is comprised of older adults. Projections indicate the percentage of Mexico's population aged 60 years and older will increase from 6.3% in 2010 to nearly 23% in 2050. These rapid demographic changes raise concerns about how Mexico can meet the needs of its growing older adult population, particularly their health care needs.

Population aging in Mexico is occurring in the context of a highly fragmented health care system. Health insurance coverage is divided into employer-based contributory social security programs, government-sponsored providers for people who are unemployed or work in the informal sector, and private providers. Nearly half of Mexico's population had health insurance through contributory social security programs. The largest of these programs is the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), which provides health insurance to people formally employed in the private sector and their family members, covering approximately 40% of Mexico's population. The second largest is the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), which covers approximately 8% of the population and provides health insurance for federal employees and their families. Military personnel and oil industry employees have employer-based health insurance. Less than 5% of the population has private health insurance.

### Prevalence, perceptions and associated factors of health insurance enrollment among older persons in selected cash grant communities in Ghana: a cross-sectional mixed method [^47f84788]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Further, this study observed that the sex of participants positively affected health insurance enrollment. Exploring health insurance coverage by sex from the data for this study, it showed that females are 15.3 percentage points higher than male counterparts to be covered by health insurance. Females have been reported to be higher users of healthcare among poor older persons in Ghana. The authors attributed it to the country's cash grant programme, Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP). Findings from this present study also revealed that one (1) in every 20 of the study participants achieved health insurance membership through this cash grant programme. Contrary to this study's findings, earlier studies have reported higher coverage among males than females.

The findings from this study highlight the importance of occupation in health insurance enrollment in cash grant communities in Ghana. Three in every five older persons are engaged in agriculture among both the survey and FGD participants. In this study, participants are more likely to reside in rural areas, and similar studies have supported this finding. This could be attributed to the fact that persons engaged in agriculture are more likely to be found in the informal sector, and rural areas, and may largely be non-contributors to social security which guarantees automatic health insurance coverage. This may also account for the low (2.5%) achievement of health insurance membership through social security among participants in this study averred that older persons engaged in agriculture operate on small scale bases, and have limited access to income and social security. Corroborating findings from this current study from three national household surveys, found the association between occupation and health insurance coverage in Ghana. Those working in the professional sector, skilled-manual, sales and even the unemployed were more likely to be health insurance enrollees compared to those in the agriculture sector. The authors attributed this inequity to the lack of reliable income among workers in the agricultural sector. Other studies have attributed it to the rurality of agriculture engagements, and may often reside in rural settings where transport costs for insurance enrollment may be a barrier). Nevertheless, there is evidence of a positive association between employment and health insurance coverage reported of the gender dynamics of the correlation between agriculture and health insurance coverage.

### Social and policy interventions to reduce hospital admissions among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in OECD countries with universal health care: a systematic review [^dfe2769b]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Unemployed persons

We found one study evaluating policy changes that aimed to improve health among unemployed persons with concurrent severe mental health illness. This multicentre international randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of individual placement and support (IPS) programmes across six European countries compared with traditional vocational services. The trial was rated as moderate quality due to high drop-rate in recruitment and follow-up. The IPS is a policy intervention that consisted of individualised job placements and support programme for service users, an intervention that was compared with vocational service. The trial found that individuals in vocational service were more likely to be re-admitted (31% risk of re-admission) to the hospital than those assigned to IPS (20% risk of readmission) — a difference of –11·2% (–21·5 to –0·90).

### Late-life working participation and mental health risk of retirement-aged workers: how much impact will there Be from social security system? [^e9a506f7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Increasing retirement-aged workers are encouraged to stay in the labor market, as delayed retirement initiative is proposed. This study investigates the interplay of late-life working participation and social security on the mental health risk of retirement-aged workers.

Method

We applied data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS-2018), and the instrumental variables regression was conducted.

Results

Late-life working could alleviate depression, as did the beneficiary status of employment-based social health insurance and the pensionable phase of social pension participation. Besides, the role of late-life working in alleviating depression became more salient when late retirees were not insured by the employment-based social health insurance and still in the pension contribution phase.

Conclusions

It is suggested that the current social security system in China has not been sufficiently well designed to protect the mental health of retirement-aged workers.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^c2b15d12]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Community/structural application — unexpected work transitions, including the moves from employment to unemployment and subsequent loss of financial security, are likely to have an impact on individuals, families, and communities; psychologists are encouraged to contribute to primary prevention interventions to bolster resilience, increase coping efficacy, and build relevant world-of-work skills and knowledge to protect against the potential negative implications of VU experiences; at a social level, psychologists are encouraged to work with local and regional employers and to address potential sources of discrimination and stigma that may prevent them from pursuing or hiring employees who are unemployed, underemployed, and financially under-resourced; finally, psychologists can also have an important influence by advocating for improved policies and programs that support living wages for all workers.

### Social security contributions and return migration among older male Mexican immigrants [^bc8c4bdb]. The Gerontologist (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

For decades, scholars have studied the effects of immigration on the U.S. social security system. To date, this research has been primarily limited to migrants within the United States and does not consider those who return to their countries of origin. We estimate the proportion of male Mexican return migrants who contributed to the U.S. social security system and analyze their socioeconomic characteristics and migration histories. We also estimate the proportion that receive or expect to receive U.S. social security benefits.

Design and Methods

Using probit regression on the 2012 Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), we describe the predictors of having contributed to the U.S. social security system among Mexican males in Mexico aged 50 years and older who at some point lived in the United States.

Results

We find that 32% of male return migrants reported having contributed to the U.S. social security system, but only 5% of those who contributed, received or expected to receive benefits. Those who reported having contributed spent more years in the United States and were more likely to be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents than those who did not contribute.

Implications

Immigrants often pay Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance taxes using legitimate or illegitimate social security numbers and return to their home countries without collecting U.S. social security benefits.

### Prevalence and risk factors for medical debt and subsequent changes in social determinants of health in the US [^7b289992]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Cost barriers discourage many US residents from seeking medical care and many who obtain it experience financial hardship. However, little is known about the association between medical debt and social determinants of health (SDOH).

Objective

To determine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with medical debt and the association of medical debt with subsequent changes in the key SDOH of food and housing security.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional analyses using multivariable logistic regression models controlled for demographic, financial, insurance, and health-related factors, and prospective cohort analyses assessing changes over time using the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Surveys of Income and Program Participation. Participants were nationally representative samples of US adults surveyed for 1 to 3 years.

Exposures

Insurance-related and health-related characteristics as risk factors for medical debt; Newly incurred medical debt as a risk factor for deterioration in SDOHs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence and amounts of medical debt; 4 SDOHs: inability to pay rent or mortgage or utilities; eviction or foreclosure; and food insecurity.

Results

Among 51 872 adults surveyed regarding 2017, 40 784 regarding 2018 and 43 220 regarding 2019, 51.6% were female, 16.8% Hispanic, 6.0% were non-Hispanic Asian, 11.9% non-Hispanic Black, 62.6% non-Hispanic White, and 2.18% other non-Hispanic. A total of 10.8% (95% CI, 10.6–11.0) of individuals and approximately 18.1% of households carried medical debt. Persons with low and middle incomes had similar rates: 15.3%; (95% CI,14.4–16.2) of uninsured persons had debt, as did 10.5% (95% CI, 10.2–18.8) of the privately-insured. In 2018 the mean medical debt was $21 687/debtor (median $2000 [IQR, $597-$5000]). In cross-sectional analyses, hospitalization, disability, and having private high-deductible, Medicare Advantage, or no coverage were risk factors associated with medical indebtedness; residing in a Medicaid-expansion state was protective (2019 odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70–0.83). Prospective findings were similar, eg, losing insurance coverage between 2017 and 2019 was associated with acquiring medical debt by 2019 (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.23–2.14), as was becoming newly disabled (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.95–3.00) or newly hospitalized (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 2.40–3.62). Acquiring medical debt between 2017 and 2019 was a risk factor associated with worsening SDOHs, with ORs of 2.20 (95% CI,1.58–3.05) for becoming food insecure; 2.29 (95% CI, 1.73–3.03) for losing ability to pay rent or mortgage; 2.37 (95% CI, 1.75–3.23) for losing ability to pay utilities; and 2.95 (95% CI, 1.38–6.31) for eviction or foreclosure in 2019.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional and cohort study, medical indebtedness was common, even among insured individuals. Acquiring such debt may worsen SDOHs. Expanded and improved health coverage could ameliorate financial distress, and improve housing and food security.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^57c669a3]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Any cancer experience — potential late effects include mental health disorders: depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and suicidal behavior. Periodic evaluation lists "Psychosocial assessment with attention to: Depression, Anxiety, Post-traumatic stress, Suicidal ideation" and indicates "Yearly." Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include "Preference should be given to self vs. proxy report," "Psychological consultation in patients with emotional difficulties related to cancer experience, including physical deformities or chronic disabilities," "Appropriate psychotropic medications, as clinically indicated," "Evaluation of parent for posttraumatic stress," and to "Assess social determinants of health including economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context." Additional information states: "Consider patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk," including patient factors "Female sex, family history of depression, anxiety, or mental illness, lower household income, lower educational attainment, especially school withdrawal, unemployment, not in a relationship, poor social support, perceived poor physical health, no health insurance or public health insurance," cancer/treatment factors "CNS tumor, CNS-directed therapy, history of HCT," and pre-morbid/co-morbid medical conditions "Chronic pain, scarring or physical disfigurement, permanent hair loss, premorbid learning or emotional difficulties, sleep/fatigue issues, substance misuse." System notation reads "SYSTEM = Psychosocial" with "SCORE = 2A."

### The effect of neighbourhood income and deprivation on pregnancy outcomes in amsterdam, the Netherlands [^61fe2182]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Studies suggest that the neighbourhoods in which people live influence their health. The main objective of this study was to investigate the associations of neighbourhood-level income and unemployment/social security benefit on pregnancy outcomes: preterm delivery, small for gestational age (SGA), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and miscarriage/perinatal death in Amsterdam.

Methods

A random sample of 7883 from 82 neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. Individual-level data from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) study were linked to data on neighbourhood-level factors. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and neighbourhood-level variance.

Results

After adjustment for individual-level factors, women living in low-income neighbourhoods (third, second and first quartiles) were more likely than women living in high-income neighbourhoods (fourth quartile) to have SGA births: OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.68), 1.42 (1.11 to 1.82) and 1.62 (1.25 to 2.08) respectively. Women living in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the highest unemployment/social security benefit were more likely than those living in the quartile with the lowest unemployment/social security benefit to have SGA births 1.36 (1.08 to 1.72). The neighbourhood-level variance was significant only for SGA births. No significant associations were found between neighbourhood-level factors and other pregnancy outcomes.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that neighbourhood income and deprivation are related to SGA births. More research is needed to explore possible mechanisms underlying poor neighbourhood environment and pregnancy outcomes, in particular through stress mechanisms. Such information might be necessary to help improve maternal and fetal health.

### Workers' ignorance of retirement benefits [^6049d70c]. The Gerontologist (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study considered the extent of workers' unfamiliarity with retirement benefits, a problem that could compromise informed retirement planning.

Design and Methods

Among workers in the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, we examined the frequency of "don't know" responses to question series about employer pensions, health insurance, and Social Security.

Results

Eligible workers readily offered responses about the shared, public details of pension plans, but knowledge about personal pension wealth was lacking for one third of persons in defined benefit plans and for one fifth of those in defined contribution plans. Among household financial respondents, 14% did not know about health insurance continuation after retirement, and 52% could not offer an expected Social Security amount. Such nonresponse was patterned by proximity to retirement and by social and occupational factors.

Implications

More than a problem of missing data, these findings argue for a theoretical reconsideration of the role of financial knowledge in retirement behavior. Ignorance of benefits is probably less a problem of disclosure than of workers' inattention to available information.

### Clinical guidance to optimize work participation after injury or illness: the role of physical therapists [^f80d1eb7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Restricted work participation — economic and disability burden statistics indicate that only 0.5% of individuals with work-related injuries are considered permanently and totally disabled under workers' compensation, yet individuals experiencing work absence had double the risk of receiving disability benefits; after 10 years, 6% of individuals with medical-only claims received Social Security Disability Insurance payments compared to 12% of those with work absence. In 2018, workers receiving disability payments through Social Security cost $143.7 billion overall and accounted for almost 75% of disability insurance payments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the societal cost of work-related injury, illness, and fatalities could have been as high as $2.2 trillion from 2007 to 2015. Both health and illness can impact work productivity and performance, and the costliest causes of workplace injuries include overexertion, falls, being struck by equipment or an object, motor vehicle accidents, or burns; among Unum long-term disability claims, the top 5 categories were cancer (17%), back disorders (13%), injury (12%), cardiovascular disorders (9%), and joint disorders (9%).

### Social inequalities in supportive care needs and quality of patient-centered care of cancer patients in Mexico [^93312a88]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate educational and health insurance-related inequalities in supportive care (SC) needs and quality of patient-centered care (PCC) for cancer patients in Mexico.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey in one Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) and one Ministry of Health (MoH) oncology hospital in Mexico City. Formal labor market workers and their families have access to social health insurance that IMSS provides, while unemployed and informal workers receive care at the MoH. The study population comprised breast, colorectal, prostate, and hematologic cancer patients, aged ≥ 18 years, who attended outpatient consultations. Patients responded a short-form SC-needs questionnaire and a quality of PCC questionnaire. We used multiple logistic regression models to determine the independent association between educational attainment and high SC-needs and quality of PCC after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical covariates.

Results

We included 1058 IMSS and 606 MoH cancer patients. MoH patients perceived higher SC-needs and lower quality of PCC than IMSS patients. MoH patients with low education had a greater probability of high psychological and health system SC needs and lower likelihood of being informed for treatment decision-making and care for their biopsychosocial needs. IMSS patients with low educational levels had lower probability of receiving timely care and clarity of information than those with high education. Receiving high-quality PCC was associated with decreased SC needs.

Conclusion

Uninsured cancer patients with low educational attainment have higher SC-needs and receive lower quality of PCC than their counterparts. Health services should face these challenges to reduce inequalities in Mexico.

### The impact of employment status, income, and occupation on the association between workplace benefits and health-related work absences [^caebefc1]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study demonstrated associations between workplace benefits — paid sick leave and employer‐sponsored health insurance — and health‐related work absence, as well as the impact of employment status, income level, and occupation type on those associations. Together, these findings contribute new evidence to a growing body of work and suggest that policies must consider broader employment factors in order for individuals to accrue benefits from workplace benefits such as paid sick leave and employer‐sponsored health insurance coverage.

We found that workers with both paid sick leave and employer‐sponsored health insurance were the most likely to take time off due to illness or injury, followed by those with only health insurance or sick leave alone. On one level, this finding aligns with prior evidence suggesting that access to workplace benefits reduces financial and job‐related barriers to taking time off when ill. On another level, these results yield new insight by demonstrating that paid sick leave and employer‐sponsored health insurance can complement each other — for instance, because paid sick leave provides job protection and wage replacement, while health insurance facilitates access to medical care and greater recognition of the need for recovery time.

We found that the association of workplace benefits and work absence varied by employment status. Full‐time workers were significantly more likely to take time off than part‐time workers across all levels of benefit access. This finding suggests that part‐time employment may introduce structural barriers that limit the practical use of sick leave and health insurance, such as reduced work‐hour flexibility, fear of job loss, or employer expectations to continue working while sick. While many state and local policies extend sick leave mandates to part‐time workers, the ability to use these benefits may be constrained by workplace norms and economic insecurity.

The association between workplace benefits and work absences differed by income level. Our results indicated that lower‐income workers with no benefits were more likely to take time off compared to their higher‐income counterparts, yet there was not a difference by income level for workers with at least one benefit, suggesting that access to benefits — not just economic security — affects leave‐taking decisions. These findings underscore that expanding both paid sick leave and health insurance may support lower‐income workers in taking needed time off, thereby reducing economic disparities in leave‐taking.

### Changes in employment status and access to care during COVID-19 pandemic among low-income adults in 4 Southern States [^67f041e9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While the impact of the COVID-19 recession on the economy is clear, there is limited evidence on how the COVID-19 pandemic-related job losses among low-income people may have affected their access to health care.

Objective

To determine the association of job loss during the pandemic with insurance coverage and access to and affordability of health care among low-income adults.

Design

Using a random digit dialing telephone survey from October 2020 to December 2020 of low-income adults in 4 states-Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas-we conducted a series of multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographics, chronic conditions, and state of residence.

Participants

US citizens aged 19–64 with a family income less than 138% of the federal poverty line who became newly unemployed during pandemic, remained employed during pandemic, or were chronically unemployed before and during the pandemic.

Main Measures

Rates of insurance, type of insurance coverage, measures of access to/affordability of care, and food/housing security KEY RESULTS: Of 1,794 respondents, 14.5% were newly unemployed, 49.6% were chronically unemployed, and 35.7% were employed. The newly unemployed were slightly younger and more likely Black or Latino. The newly unemployed were more likely to report uninsurance compared to the employed (+16.4 percentage points, 95% CI 6.0–26.9), and the chronically unemployed (+26.4 percentage points, 95% CI 16.2–36.6), mostly driven by Texas' populations. The newly unemployed also reported lower rates of access to care and higher rates of financial barriers to care. They were also more likely to report food and housing insecurity compared to others.

Conclusions

In a survey of 4 Southern States during pandemic, the newly unemployed had higher rates of uninsurance and worse access to care-largely due to financial barriers-and reported more housing and food insecurity than other groups. Our study highlights the vulnerability of low-income populations who experienced a job loss, especially in Texas, which did not expand Medicaid.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^35695d1c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — burden and economic impact: COPD is the primary contributor (> 95%) to deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases, the third leading cause of death in the United States, and COPD-related medical costs were estimated at $32 billion in the United States in 2010 with an additional $4 billion in absenteeism costs. Persons with COPD are less likely to be employed and more likely to be limited in the type of work they can do compared with persons without COPD, and in this study, adults with COPD were more likely to report activity limitations and being unable to work compared with adults without COPD. After accounting for age, U.S. adults with COPD are also more likely to collect Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income than those without the condition, and because there is currently no cure for COPD, public health efforts should focus on prevention, such as antismoking.

### Employment status and health after privatisation in white collar civil servants: prospective cohort study [^8c9ea70b]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether employment status after job loss due to privatisation influences health and use of health services and whether financial strain, psychosocial measures, or health related behaviours can explain any findings.

Design

Data collected before and 18 months after privatisation.

Setting

One department of the civil service that was sold to the private sector.

Participants

666 employees during baseline screening in the department to be privatised.

Main Outcome Measures

Health and health service outcomes associated with insecure re-employment, permanent exit from paid employment, and unemployment after privatisation compared with outcomes associated with secure re-employment.

Results

Insecure re-employment and unemployment were associated with relative increases in minor psychiatric morbidity (mean difference 1.56 (95% confidence intervals interval 1.0 to 2.2) and 1.25 (0.6 to 2.0) respectively) and having four or more consultations with a general practitioner in the past year (odds ratio 2.04 (1.1 to 3.8) and 2.39 (1.2 to 4.7) respectively). Health outcomes for respondents permanently out of paid employment closely resembled those in secure re-employment, except for a substantial relative increase in longstanding illness (2.25; 1.1 to 4.4). Financial strain and change in psychosocial measures and health related behaviours accounted for little of the observed associations. Adjustment for change in minor psychiatric morbidity attenuated the association between insecure re-employment or unemployment and general practitioner consultations by 26% and 27%, respectively.

Conclusions

Insecure re-employment and unemployment after privatisation result in increases in minor psychiatric morbidity and consultations with a general practitioner, which are possibly due to the increased minor psychiatric morbidity.

### Association of household deprivation, comorbidities, and COVID-19 hospitalization in children in Germany, January 2020 to July 2021 [^f6174ad7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Adults in disadvantaged socioeconomic positions have elevated risks of a severe course of COVID-19, but it is unclear whether this holds true for children.

Objective

To investigate whether young people from disadvantaged households have a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and whether differences were associated with comorbidities that predispose children to severe courses.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included all children and adolescents (aged 0–18 years) who were enrolled in a statutory health insurance carrier in Germany during the observation period of January 1, 2020, to July 13, 2021. Logistic regressions were calculated to compare children from households with and without an indication of poverty. Age, sex, days under observation, nationality, and comorbidities (eg, obesity, diabetes) were controlled for to account for explanatory factors.

Exposures

Disadvantage on the household level was assessed by the employment status of the insurance holder (ie, employed, long- or short-term unemployed, low-wage employment, economically inactive). Socioeconomic characteristics of the area of residence were also assessed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Daily hospital diagnoses of COVID-19 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes U07.1 and U07.2) were recorded. Comorbidities were assessed using inpatient and outpatient diagnoses contained in the insurance records.

Results

A total of 688 075 children and adolescents were included, with a mean (SD) age of 8.3 (5.8) years and 333 489 (48.4%) female participants. COVID-19 hospital diagnosis was a rare event (1637 participants [0.2%]). Children whose parents were long-term unemployed were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.22–1.51) times more likely than those with employed parents to be hospitalized. Elevated odds were also found for children whose parents had low-wage employment (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05–1.58). Those living in low-income areas had 3.02 (95% CI, 1.73–5.28) times higher odds of hospitalization than those in less deprived areas. Comorbidities were associated with hospitalization, but their adjustment did not change main estimates for deprivation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, children who had parents who were unemployed and those who lived in low-income areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. This finding suggests that attention must be paid to children with SARS-CoV-2 from vulnerable families and closer monitoring should be considered. A number of explanatory factors, including comorbidities, were taken into account, but their analysis yielded no clear picture about underlying processes.

Guideline 9 — psychologists seek to understand the interaction among economic insecurity, unemployment, and underemployment and attempt to contribute to re-employment processes for individuals. The rationale states that individuals without decent work may be in a variety of different employment circumstances, but all share the potential threat of poverty, and defines underemployment as when a person holds a job that is inadequate relative to their financial needs or desires. It adds that people who are unemployed are unable to utilize their skills and abilities until they successfully complete a job search and become employed or re-employed, and notes that rates of individuals who are underemployed, unemployed, and non-employed are likely underestimated.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^56d2763d]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Psychological practice — stigma and re-employment barriers affecting unemployed and low-income individuals — notes that individuals with long-term unemployment experiences struggle with poverty-related stigma, and growing evidence suggests that individuals who have had periods of unemployment are stigmatized in ways that harm job recovery efforts, including employer stereotypes that unemployed individuals are flawed or lacking in motivation, which harms their re-employment prospects. As low-income workers attempt to regain employment, they may experience important barriers related to stigma; in general, people who are poor or of lower social class are widely stigmatized and frequently associated with negative attributes such as laziness, being "welfare queens," and incompetence. Such possible outcomes are consistent with research indicating that employment opportunities diminish quickly for unemployed individuals, in large part because of "nonemployment stigma," contributing to a type of double-jeopardy for unemployed individuals with lower socioeconomic status.

### Working while sick in context of regional unemployment: a Europe-wide cross-sectional study [^78c7f1b3]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Research suggests that areas with high unemployment have lower rates of sickness absence, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One assumption is that when unemployment is high people are more likely to work while being sick (discipline hypothesis). Against this background, we investigate the association between regional unemployment and sickness presenteeism. Second, we study interactions with factors of occupational disadvantage.

Methods

We combined survey data of 20 974 employees collected 2015 in 232 regions from 35 European countries with data on regional unemployment rates obtained from Eurostat. Presenteeism was assessed by the fraction of days worked while ill among all days with illness (presenteeism propensity). To investigate if unemployment was related to presenteeism, we estimated multi-level models (individuals nested in regions) that were adjusted for socio-demographic and occupational covariates to account for compositional differences of the regions.

Results

The mean presenteeism propensity was 34.8 (SD 40.4), indicating that workers chose presenteeism in 1 out of 3 days with sickness. We found that a change in unemployment by +10 percentage points was associated with a change in presenteeism by +5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2 to 8.6). This relationship was more pronounced among workers with low salary, low skill-level, and industrial and healthcare workers.

Conclusion

Our results support the assumption that high unemployment elevates presenteeism, and that people in disadvantaged occupations are particularly affected. Policies managing presenteeism should consider the labour market context, particularly during the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Employer-sponsored health insurance premium cost growth and its association with earnings inequality among US families [^ae4729fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Costs of employer-sponsored health care benefits have increased faster than workers' wages for several decades, with important implications for disparities in earnings and wage stagnation.

Objective

To quantify how growth in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) premiums may have been associated with reduced annual wages, disparities in earnings by race and ethnicity and wage level, and wage stagnation among US families with ESI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this economic evaluation, serial cross-sectional analyses were performed of US families receiving ESI from 1988 to 2019 based on data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Kaiser Employer Health Benefits Survey, US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, and federal payroll taxation rates. Statistical analysis was conducted from February 2022 to July 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percentage of annual compensation associated with health care premiums (after accounting for tax deductibility) and lost wages associated with growth in cost of premiums from 1989 to 2019 based on 1988 compensation. To assess disparities, analyses were stratified by race and ethnicity and wage level.

Results

In 1988, 44.7 million individuals (head of household: mean [SD] age, 43.3 [13.1] years; 30.1% were female; and 2.4% identified as Asian, 6.2% as Hispanic, 8.6% as non-Hispanic Black, and 82.8% as non-Hispanic White) were covered by ESI family plans; this number remained similar in 2019 at 44.8 million individuals (head of household: mean [SD] age, 47.1 [12.9] years; 41.3% were female; and 1.3% identified as Asian, 9.9% as Hispanic, 9.9% as non-Hispanic Black, and 78.9% as non-Hispanic White). In 1988, the mean (SD) household size was 3.3 (1.3) people, and in 2019, it was 3.4 (1.3) people. If ESI costs had remained at the same proportion of the 1988 average compensation package, then in 2019, the median US family with ESI could have earned $8774 (95% CI, $8354-$9195) more in annual wages. During all 32 years, health care premiums as a percentage of compensation were greater for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic families than for non-Hispanic White families. By 2019, 13.8% (95% CI, 13.5%-14.1%) of compensation among non-Hispanic White families with ESI went to premium costs compared with 19.2% (95% CI, 18.8%-19.7%) among non-Hispanic Black families and 19.8% (19.3%-20.3%) among Hispanic families with ESI. In 2019, health care premiums as a percentage of compensation at the 95th percentile of earnings for families with ESI were 3.9% (95% CI, 3.8%-4.0%) compared with 28.5% (95% CI, 27.8%-29.2%) at the 20th percentile of earnings. From 1988 to 2019, the mean cumulative lost earnings associated with growth in health care premiums for the median US family with ESI was $125 340 (95% CI, $120 155-$130 525) in 2019 dollars, 4.7% of earnings over the 32-year period.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation of US families receiving ESI suggests that 3 decades of increasing health care premiums were likely associated with reduced annual earnings and increased earnings inequality by race and ethnicity and wage level and were meaningfully associated with wage stagnation.

Prostate cancer — life expectancy estimation for treatment decisions: Estimates of life expectancy are a key determinant of primary treatment, particularly for active surveillance or observation. Life expectancy can be estimated using Minnesota Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables, Social Security Administration Life Insurance Tables, WHO's Life Tables by Country, or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Male Life Expectancy tool and adjusted for individuals by adding or subtracting 50% based on whether the patient is in the healthiest or unhealthiest quartile. For a 65-year-old American male, Social Security Administration life expectancy is 17.7 years, which becomes 26.5 years if in the upper quartile of health or 8.8 years if in the lower quartile, and treatment recommendations could change dramatically if a 65-year-old is in either poor or excellent health.

### Exercise, diet, and weight management during cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^4b08f49b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Exercise, diet, weight management, and health disparities — Although ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expectations for best practices, many patients have limited access to medical care or receive fragmented care. Factors including race and ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and gender identity, geographic location, and insurance access affect cancer care outcomes as well as diet and exercise behavior. Racially and/or ethnically diverse patients suffer disproportionately from comorbidities, face more substantial obstacles to receiving timely care, are more likely to be uninsured, and are at greater risk of fragmented or poor-quality care than other Americans. These disparities also affect patients' ability to achieve adequate levels of exercise, eat a plant-based diet (with lower amounts of refined grains, sugars, and red and processed meats), and achieve and maintain a healthful weight; social determinants tied to residential zip code influence safe places to exercise, access to fresh, healthful, and affordable foods, and food security, and sociodemographic factors further accentuate the need for social workers and adequate social support.

Low-income and economic marginalization — disparities span race/ethnicity, gender identity, and disability, with people of color disproportionately affected and more likely to identify as lower socioeconomic status; Native/First Americans are almost two times as likely to live in poverty as the total national average and some reservation communities have unemployment as high as 25%, compared to the national unemployment rate of 4.1%. Transgender adults are four times more likely to live below the federal poverty line than the general population. Among people with disabilities, in 2016 only 35.9% were employed compared to 76.6% among people without disabilities, the median earnings of people with disabilities was approximately two-thirds of those without disabilities, and assistance programs are only available to people who earn very little money ($1,220/month in 2019), reinforcing poverty–disability links. Wealth gaps exceed income gaps, with the median White household wealth 13 times greater than the median Black household wealth.

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^0cbeec2c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Item 23d. Discuss implications of the results for practice, policy, and future research

Explanation: There are many potential end users of a systematic review (such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, insurers, and policy makers), each of whom will want to know what actions they should take given the review findings. Patients and healthcare providers may be primarily interested in the balance of benefits and harms, while policy makers and administrators may value data on organisational impact and resource utilisation. For reviews of interventions, authors might clarify trade-offs between benefits and harms and how the values attached to the most important outcomes of the review might lead different people to make different decisions. In addition, rather than making recommendations for practice or policy that apply universally, authors might discuss factors that are important in translating the evidence to different settings and factors that may modify the magnitude of effects.

Explicit recommendations for future research — as opposed to general statements such as "More research on this question is needed" — can better direct the questions future studies should address and the methods that should be used. For example, authors might consider describing the type of understudied participants who should be enrolled in future studies, the specific interventions that could be compared, suggested outcome measures to use, and ideal study design features to employ.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^e5cad49a]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Guideline 8 — Working poor and poverty metrics (United States, 2016) — For the year 2016, the 22.8 million U.S. citizens living below the poverty line included 2.5 million who were working full time and another 6.3 million who were working part-time, as well as many people who were unable to find suitable work or had given up trying to find employment. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as working poor those adults of working age who spent at least 27 weeks of the year either working or looking for work and whose incomes are at or below the poverty level. These figures are considered by most to be underestimates of actual poverty rates because they omit individuals not included in Census data and many who were unable to find decent work or who had given up trying to find employment.

### Occupational and educational inequalities in exit from employment at older ages: evidence from seven prospective cohorts [^9ff6bbe0]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Past studies have identified socioeconomic inequalities in the timing and route of labour market exit at older ages. However, few studies have compared these trends cross-nationally and existing evidence focuses on specific institutional outcomes (such as disability pension and sickness absence) in Nordic countries. We examined differences by education level and occupational grade in the risks of work exit and health-related work exit.

Methods

Prospective longitudinal data were drawn from seven studies (n = 99164). Participants were in paid work at least once around age 50. Labour market exit was derived based on reductions in working hours, changes in self-reported employment status or from administrative records. Health-related exit was ascertained by receipt of health-related benefit or pension or from the reported reason for stopping work. Cox regression models were estimated for each study, adjusted for baseline self-rated health and birth cohort.

Results

There were 50003 work exits during follow-up, of which an average of 14% (range 2–32%) were health related. Low level education and low occupational grade were associated with increased risks of health-related exit in most studies. Low level education and occupational grade were also associated with an increased risk of any exit from work, although with less consistency across studies.

Conclusions

Workers with low socioeconomic position have an increased risk of health-related exit from employment. Policies that extend working life may disadvantage such workers disproportionally, especially where institutional support for those exiting due to poor health is minimal.

### Ethical considerations in pediatricians' use of social media [^9ddb9399]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Confidentiality and HIPAA in pediatricians' social media use — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule applies to social media and covers "individually identifiable health information" based on 18 possible identifiers, including "full-face photographic images (and any comparable images)." Even deidentification may fail because "blocked-out faces in photographs may still be identifiable." When giving health care advice directly online, "HIPAA compliance requires the use of a secure site with encryption," and legal issues to address include licensure across borders, malpractice coverage, reimbursement for telecare, and maintaining confidentiality; additionally, "The option of 24/7 patient communication also demands appropriate attention to the physician's own work-life balance."

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^0254d747]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Socioeconomic status (SES) and educational outcomes — poverty experiences are strongly linked to employment and family structure changes, with one fourth of all experiences of poverty due to a head of household becoming unemployed and another quarter due to divorce or other major family structure changes; among those living in poverty, individuals who work 30 weeks per year are one third less likely to return to poverty than those who work 20 weeks of the year. Students from lower SES families have lower reading skills at both entrance to school and the end of third grade and are more likely to drop out of high school, and a meta-analysis of 58 studies, including 75 independent samples found familial social class strongly predicted individual student success and school-level achievement, resulting in double jeopardy for student achievement.

### Guidelines for the management of work-related asthma [^66e03278]. The European Respiratory Journal (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for work-related asthma, more specifically with respect to allergen and irritant avoidance, ERS 2012 guidelines recommend to consider offering reduction of exposure to the causal agent as an alternative to complete avoidance, in order to minimize adverse socioeconomic consequences. Insufficient evidence to recommend this option as a first-line therapeutic strategy. Obtain careful medical monitoring to ensure an early identification of asthma worsening when choosing this approach.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^3b0d2a26]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Guideline development — documentation of need notes organizational action in this area, stating that the APA Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Poverty and Socioeconomic Status (2000; 2010) and commissioned the APA Task Force on Socioeconomic Status to study the impacts and consequences of poverty and low SES.

### Ethical aspects of drug testing [^4b71c752]. ACOEM (2019). High credibility.

ACOEM position statement — ethical aspects of drug testing specifies that the reason for any requirement for the drug testing program should be clearly documented, with reasons that might involve safety for the individual, other employees, or the public; security needs; or requirements related to job performance. Affected employees and applicants should be informed in advance of the company's policy concerning drug use, misuse, and screening, and employees should be made aware of their right to refuse such screening and the consequences of such refusal to their employment. Employees should have a clear understanding of — and the company's policy should state — the possible consequences of a non-negative test result including, but not limited to, refusal to hire, firing, suspension, rehabilitation, referral to substance abuse counseling, and not entering a facility. Where special safety or security needs justify testing for the presence of drugs on an unannounced and random basis, employees should be made aware of all aspects of the drug-testing program, and care should be taken to assure that such tests are done in a uniform and impartial manner for all employees in the affected group(s). Collection, transportation, and analysis of the specimens and the reporting of the results should meet stringent legal, technical, and ethical requirements, and the process should be under the supervision of a licensed physician (MD/DO). A licensed physician (MD/DO) with appropriate qualifications should be designated as the medical review officer (MRO) and should evaluate positive results prior to a report being made to the employer; this may require obtaining supplemental information from the employee or applicant to ensure that a test does not represent appropriate use of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medication, or other substances which could cause a positive test, and MRO training should include the pharmacology of substance abuse, laboratory testing methodology and quality control, forensic toxicology, pertinent federal regulations, legal and ethical requirements, chemical dependency illness, and employee assistance programs and rehabilitation. The affected employee or applicant should be advised of the positive results by the physician and have the opportunity for explanation and discussion prior to the reporting of results to the employer, if feasible, and the mechanism for accomplishing this should be clearly defined. Any report to the employer should provide only the information needed for work placement purposes or as required by government regulations; identification to the employer of the drug(s) found and quantitative levels should not be done unless required by law or upon specific release request by the donor, and reports to the employer should be made by a physician sensitive to the various considerations involved. If carefully designed and carried out, programs for the screening of employees and applicants for drugs, including alcohol, serve to protect and improve employee health and safety in an ethically acceptable manner, and physicians are encouraged to refer to the Medical Review Officer Certification Council's MRO Code of Ethics.

### Preventing needless work disability by helping people stay employed [^9dd86aa5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — stay-at-work/return-to-work (SAW/RTW) process escalation levels — progress from simplest to most complex and outline who is involved, how work capacity and job demands are determined, and what triggers return to work; involvement ranges from "Worker and supervisor" or "Worker and physician" to specialists such as "Physical therapist Ergonomist or vocational consultant Independent medical examiner," capacity assessment methods include "Return-to-work note from physician," "Objective testing Functional capacity evaluation," and "Independent medical opinion," job demands can be captured by "Verbal description of usual job," a "List of job's functional demands," "Video of job Ergonomic analysis of job," or an "On-site workplace visit," and formal decisions may require a "Written offer of employment Formal return to work plan Sign off by all parties."

### Pregnancy during COVID-19: social contact patterns and vaccine coverage of pregnant women from coMix in 19 European countries [^16f74635]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Mean contacts

The mean number of daily contact reported over the entire study period was slightly lower in pregnant women (3.6, 95%CI = 3.5–3.7) than in non-pregnant women aged 18–49 (4.0, 95%CI = 3.9–4.0), and men of same age (3.7, 95%CI = 3.7–3.8) (Table 2). Contacts at home were approximately 1.5 in all groups. Contacts made at work were lower among pregnant women (0.9, 95%CI = 0.8–1.1) than in non-pregnant individuals (1.3–1.4). Contacts made at social settings and outside of the participants' household were higher among pregnant women (0.7, 95%CI = 0.6–0.7) than in non-pregnant people (0.5–0.6).

Contacts by setting and NPIs

Contacts varied by settings as well as the strictness of the NPIs that were put in place. Home contacts remained consistent at 1.0–2.5 for pregnant women, non-pregnant women and men across all levels of NPI strigency (Fig. 2), contacts not at home declined in all groups. Pregnant women generally made the least contacts outside of the home setting at all levels of NPIs, driven primarily by fewer contacts made at work – in most cases < 2 and at high SI < 1 work contacts vs. 2–3 among non-pregnant people. In social settings, however, pregnant women reported more contacts than non-pregnant people at all levels of restrictions.

Further to making generally fewer contacts, a consistently greater proportion of pregnant women reported being in isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19 – approximately 20%-40% pregnant women versus < 20% in non-pregnant women and men prior to May 2020, and 15% versus 5% since May 2020 (Fig. 3).
