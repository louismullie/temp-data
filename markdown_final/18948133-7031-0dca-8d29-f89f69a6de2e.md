## Question

Right lower quadrant with rebound tenderness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret right lower quadrant pain with rebound tenderness and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what rebound tenderness signifies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the diagnostic weight of RLQ pain and rebound together using likelihood ratios. Next, I will consider key differentials that can mimic appendicitis and how age and sex change pretest probabilities. After that, I need to check which clinical scoring systems meaningfully incorporate these findings. Then, I should review the imaging strategy by population, including children, adults, and pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway and highlight pitfalls and special scenarios that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. Rebound tenderness, also called Blumberg's sign, reflects peritoneal irritation and is classically elicited by slow deep palpation followed by rapid release, with pain worsening on release; this is a marker of peritoneal inflammation rather than visceral pain alone, and in the RLQ it raises concern for localized peritonitis from an inflamed appendix, though it is not specific to appendicitis and can be seen with other peritoneal processes [^1deae787] [^82afdc3f].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic weight of the individual components before I combine them. RLQ tenderness is among the most useful single clinical findings in suspected appendicitis, with a positive likelihood ratio around 7–8 in meta-analyses, while rebound tenderness carries a positive likelihood ratio near 3, and when combined they substantially increase the probability of appendicitis; importantly, the absence of rebound lowers the likelihood, which is useful at the bedside [^2487d3e2] [^affc2d07].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the differential and how pretest probability shifts with age and sex. In children, appendicitis is the most common surgical cause of RLQ pain, but gastroenteritis, constipation, mesenteric adenitis, and urinary tract infection are frequent alternatives; in adult women, gynecologic pathology such as ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease must be prioritized; in older adults, diverticulitis, malignancy, and vascular events are more common; in pregnancy, appendicitis is common but atypically located and ultrasound performance declines with gestational age, so CT or MRI may be needed if ultrasound is nondiagnostic [^85c06970] [^2e59eb47] [^7003cd7c] [^50508d9f].

> I should confirm which clinical scores actually incorporate RLQ tenderness and rebound and how they perform. The Alvarado score awards 2 points for RLQ tenderness and 1 point for rebound, with total scores of 7–10 suggesting probable appendicitis; the Pediatric Appendicitis Score includes RLQ tenderness and rebound or percussion pain, with a score ≥ 6 indicating high probability; the Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score includes rebound graded by intensity and integrates CRP and neutrophilia, outperforming Alvarado in some studies; the Adult Appendicitis Score weights RLQ tenderness by sex and age and includes guarding and inflammatory markers, improving discrimination in adults [^fe9e4ac7] [^22c3cec9] [^23222e9f] [^d1c5efd5].

> Let me think about imaging strategy next, and I should double-check age-specific guidance. In children, ultrasound is first-line because it avoids radiation and can approach CT performance in experienced hands; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic, CT is reasonable, with MRI as an alternative when available; in nonpregnant adults, CT with IV contrast is generally preferred for its high sensitivity and specificity and ability to identify mimics; in pregnancy, start with ultrasound and proceed to MRI if needed, reserving CT for cases where benefits outweigh risks; across populations, imaging is most impactful when the clinical picture is equivocal rather than overwhelmingly positive or negative [^50508d9f] [^1e5f076d] [^2e59eb47].

> But wait, what if the patient has classic features and a high score; do I still need imaging? I should confirm that imaging is not mandatory when the diagnosis is clinically obvious, yet even then, preoperative imaging can reduce negative appendectomy rates and detect alternative pathology; conversely, in low-probability presentations, observation with serial exams can be safe and reduce unnecessary imaging, especially in children where validated low-risk rules perform well [^50508d9f] [^07bb8c64].

> I will now examine special scenarios that can mislead us. Isolated rebound tenderness without fever or leukocytosis can still represent appendicitis; in fact, about 15% of preoperative appendicitis cases in one series had isolated RLQ rebound without systemic inflammatory signs, and imaging clarified the diagnosis in most, so I should not anchor prematurely on normal labs or absence of fever [^e591c49c]. In postpartum patients, ovarian vein thrombosis can mimic appendicitis with RLQ pain and rebound; in older adults, cecal diverticulitis and epiploic appendagitis can present similarly; and in children, mesenteric adenitis and intussusception can confound the picture, reinforcing the need for judicious imaging when the story is atypical or evolving [^f40a73c3] [^b2d4418e] [^1bac6d60] [^85c06970].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I should double-check that it aligns with evidence. If RLQ pain with rebound is present, I should calculate a validated score such as Alvarado, PAS, AIR, or AAS depending on age, and integrate migration of pain, fever, WBC with differential, and CRP when available; high-risk scores should prompt surgical consultation and imaging as needed, intermediate-risk cases benefit from imaging and observation, and low-risk cases can be observed with clear return precautions; throughout, I should reassess for evolution of peritoneal signs, hemodynamic instability, or new red flags that would escalate care [^fe9e4ac7] [^23222e9f] [^d1c5efd5] [^07bb8c64].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances because children often present atypically. Up to half of children with appendicitis may lack classic features such as fever, migration, or rebound, so a low threshold for ultrasound and careful serial exams are essential; validated pediatric low-risk rules with high sensitivity and NPV can safely reduce CT use when applied correctly, but I need to ensure reliable follow-up if I choose observation [^dd932d64] [^07bb8c64].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the bottom line. Right lower quadrant pain with rebound tenderness is a high-risk constellation that substantially increases the likelihood of acute appendicitis, but it is not pathognomonic; integrating clinical scores, patient demographics, and selective imaging yields the best balance of diagnostic accuracy, safety, and resource use, and I should remain vigilant for mimics and atypical courses that warrant alternative diagnoses and tailored imaging strategies [^2487d3e2] [^50508d9f] [^2e59eb47].

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain with rebound tenderness is a hallmark of **acute appendicitis** [^2487d3e2] and indicates peritoneal irritation from an inflamed or perforated appendix [^1deae787]. This finding is highly specific but not pathognomonic; **other causes** include Meckel's diverticulitis, cecal diverticulitis, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, PID, and mesenteric adenitis [^1223c201] [^cdbf45c2]. Immediate evaluation with a focused history, exam, and labs is essential; **ultrasound is first-line in children and pregnancy**, while CT is preferred in adults to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^50508d9f] [^1e5f076d]. Early surgical consultation is indicated to prevent complications such as perforation, abscess, and sepsis [^131bc5fa].

## Clinical significance of RLQ pain with rebound tenderness

RLQ pain with rebound tenderness reflects **peritoneal irritation** from an inflamed or perforated appendix [^1deae787]. Rebound tenderness (Blumberg's sign) is elicited when pain worsens upon rapid release of deep palpation, indicating peritoneal inflammation [^c934bf83]. This finding is highly specific for appendicitis but not pathognomonic, as other conditions can mimic this presentation [^1223c201].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While appendicitis is the most common cause, **other conditions** can present with RLQ pain and rebound tenderness:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute appendicitis | - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Nausea/vomiting <br/> - Leukocytosis | - Most common <br/> - Migratory pain <br/> - McBurney's point tenderness [^2487d3e2] |
| Meckel's diverticulitis | - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Gastrointestinal bleeding | - Congenital anomaly <br/> - Technetium scan [^notfound] |
| Cecal diverticulitis | - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Fever <br/> - Leukocytosis | - Older adults <br/> - CT findings [^2d79cf08] |
| Ovarian torsion | - Sudden RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Adnexal mass | - Gynecologic emergency <br/> - Ultrasound [^7a973a16] |
| Ectopic pregnancy | - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Amenorrhea <br/> - Positive pregnancy test | - Gynecologic emergency <br/> - Transvaginal ultrasound [^notfound] |
| Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) | - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Cervical motion tenderness | - Sexually active women <br/> - Vaginal discharge [^notfound] |
| Mesenteric adenitis | - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Viral symptoms | - Children <br/> - Self-limited [^notfound] |

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential to differentiate these conditions:

- **History**: Onset, duration, migration, associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fever, urinary symptoms, menstrual history) [^1deae787].
- **Physical examination**: RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, Rovsing's, psoas, obturator signs [^85c06970].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, urinalysis, pregnancy test in women of childbearing age, CRP [^2e59eb47].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound first-line in children and pregnancy; CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast in adults [^50508d9f] [^1e5f076d].

---

## Management

Immediate surgical consultation is indicated for suspected appendicitis. Uncomplicated cases undergo **appendectomy**; complicated cases (abscess, perforation) may require antibiotics, drainage, and interval appendectomy [^131bc5fa] [^52ea9544]. Non-operative management with antibiotics is an option in selected uncomplicated cases [^c51170c2].

---

## Potential complications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis increases the risk of:

- **Perforation**: 20–30% if treatment delayed > 24 hours [^notfound].
- **Abscess formation**: 10% of cases [^52ea9544].
- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening [^notfound].
- **Increased morbidity and mortality**: Especially in elderly and children [^af485c8f].

---

## Prognosis

With prompt diagnosis and treatment, prognosis is **excellent**. Delayed diagnosis increases morbidity, length of stay, and healthcare costs [^af485c8f].

---

RLQ pain with rebound tenderness is a **red flag** for acute appendicitis and other serious intra-abdominal conditions. Rapid, systematic evaluation and early surgical involvement are critical to prevent complications and ensure good outcomes.

Context

Evaluation of abdominal pain in children can be difficult. Rapid, accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in children reduces the morbidity of this common cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Clinical evaluation may help identify (1) which children with abdominal pain and a likely diagnosis of appendicitis should undergo immediate surgical consultation for potential appendectomy and (2) which children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

Objective

To systematically assess the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory test results for evaluating children with possible appendicitis.

Data Sources

We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE (January 1966-March 2007) and the Cochrane Database, as well as physical examination textbooks and bibliographies of retrieved articles, yielding 2521 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they (1) provided primary data on children aged 18 years or younger in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis was considered; (2) presented medical history data, physical examination findings, or basic laboratory data; and (3) confirmed or excluded appendicitis by surgical pathologic findings, clinical observation, or follow-up. Of 256 full-text articles examined, 42 met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Twenty-five of 42 studies were assigned a quality level of 3 or better. Data from these studies were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

Results

In children with abdominal pain, fever was the single most useful sign associated with appendicitis; a fever increases the likelihood of appendicitis (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–4.8) and conversely, its absence decreases the chance of appendicitis (LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.64). In select groups of children, in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected and evaluation undertaken, rebound tenderness triples the odds of appendicitis (summary LR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.3–3.9), while its absence reduces the likelihood (summary LR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.55). Midabdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant (LR range, 1.9–3.1) increases the risk of appendicitis more than right lower quadrant pain itself (summary LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5). A white blood cell count of less than 10,000/microL decreases the likelihood of appendicitis (summary LR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.17–0.30), as does an absolute neutrophil count of 6750/microL or lower (LR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.16). Symptoms and signs are most useful in combination, particularly for identifying children who do not require further evaluation or intervention.

Conclusions

Although the clinical examination does not establish a diagnosis of appendicitis with certainty, it is useful in determining which children with abdominal pain warrant immediate surgical evaluation for consideration of appendectomy and which children may warrant further diagnostic evaluation. More child-specific, age-stratified data are needed to improve the utility of the clinical examination for diagnosing appendicitis in children.

### A practical score for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^a944c48d]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1986). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Alvarado score" for acute appendicitis.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. It was developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986. The score is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The Alvarado Score is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, helping clinicians decide whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. It is applicable to all age groups, but it should be used with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population.

The score is not recommended for use in patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic the symptoms of appendicitis, as these could potentially skew the results.

The Alvarado score is a diagnostic tool used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis based on a patient's clinical presentation. It considers eight specific signs and symptoms, with each receiving a designated point value. The sum of these values yields a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

What this involves is a checklist of symptoms and signs:

- Right lower quadrant tenderness is worth 2 points.
- An elevated temperature (higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius) adds 1 point.
- Rebound tenderness contributes an additional 1 point.
- Migration of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant counts for 1 point.
- Anorexia, or loss of appetite, is also scored as 1 point.
- Nausea or vomiting likewise adds 1 point to the total.
- Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count exceeding 10,000, provides 2 points.
- A left shift in leukocyte count, a sign of increased immature white blood cells, contributes 1 point.

To calculate the Alvarado score, determine the presence of each symptom or sign. If present, assign the associated points and sum them to get a score between 0 and 10.

The resulting score is then interpreted as follows:

- A score of 7 or above indicates "Probable appendicitis". This suggests a high likelihood of appendicitis, often prompting further medical evaluation, such as imaging or surgical consultation.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 6 denote "Possible appendicitis", indicating that appendicitis could be present. Medical professionals would typically consider additional clinical judgment and possibly further testing.
- A score below 5 implies "Unlikely appendicitis", suggesting that appendicitis is less probable, although it's important that clinicians still consider the broader clinical context.

This scoring system provides a structured approach, aiding healthcare providers in the initial assessment and decision-making process regarding suspected appendicitis.

Statement 1.1. We suggest the use of scoring systems for excluding acute appendicitis in elderly patients with a low-probability score (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).

Statement 1.2. We suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on scoring systems (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
2 Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients? In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.

According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.

Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.

There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.

According to some authors the typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.

According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

THE EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN: HISTORY AND PHYSICAL AND INITIAL LABORATORIES

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis, which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient laying on their left side. The Rovsing's sign can also be seen in acute appendicitis and is observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Acute appendicitis management.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis. A urine analysis would assist in ruling out other diagnoses, such as urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or renal stones. A pregnancy test is mandatory for women of childbearing age.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^6783f185]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children presents a diagnostic dilemma. Although many cases of acute abdominal pain are benign, some require rapid diagnosis and treatment to minimize morbidity. Numerous disorders can cause abdominal pain. The most common medical cause is gastroenteritis, and the most common surgical cause is appendicitis. In most instances, abdominal pain can be diagnosed through the history and physical examination. Age is a key factor in evaluating the cause; the incidence and symptoms of different conditions vary greatly over the pediatric age spectrum. In the acute surgical abdomen, pain generally precedes vomiting, while the reverse is true in medical conditions. Diarrhea often is associated with gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Appendicitis should be suspected in any child with pain in the right lower quadrant. Signs that suggest an acute surgical abdomen include involuntary guarding or rigidity, marked abdominal distention, marked abdominal tenderness, and rebound abdominal tenderness. If the diagnosis is not clear after the initial evaluation, repeated physical examination by the same physician often is useful. Selected imaging studies also might be helpful. Surgical consultation is necessary if a surgical cause is suspected or the cause is not obvious after a thorough evaluation.

Clinical features

Clinical features of appendicitis include right lower quadrant pain, pain migration, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, rebound tenderness, pyrexia and elevated white cell count. However, not all children with appendicitis present with such classical symptoms and this can prolong the diagnosis. Any delay in the surgical management can lead to complications as appendicitis usually does not resolve spontaneously. Potential complications include perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation and death. Because of atypical presentations and the risk of potential complications, imaging is often requested. In children, this imaging technique is usually US.

### Pain as the only consistent sign of acute appendicitis: lack of inflammatory signs does not exclude the diagnosis [^e591c49c]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults remains tricky, but radiological examinations are very helpful to determine the diagnosis even when the adult patient presents atypically. This study was designed to quantify the proportion of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis that had isolated right lower quadrant pain without biological inflammatory signs and then to determine which imaging examination led to the determination of the diagnosis.

Methods

In this monocentric study based on retrospectively collected data, we analyzed a series of 326 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis and isolated those who were afebrile and had isolated right lower quadrant pain and normal white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels. We determined whether the systematic ultrasonography examination was informative enough or a complementary intravenous contrast media computed tomography scan was necessary to determine the diagnosis, and whether the final pathological diagnosis fit the preoperative one.

Results

A total of 15.6% of the patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis had isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, i.e., they were afebrile and their white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were normal. In 96.1% of the cases, the ultrasonography examination, sometimes complemented by an intravenous contrasted computed tomography scan if the ultrasonography result was equivocal, fit the histopathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis cannot be excluded when an adult patient presents with isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant even without fever and biological inflammatory signs. In our study, ultrasonography and computed tomography were very helpful when making the final diagnosis.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^1223c201]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

General medical — abdominal pain assessment for suspected appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and pyelonephritis lists condition-specific findings. Appendicitis findings include focal right lower quadrant tenderness possibly with rebound and guarding, right lower quadrant tenderness noted during palpation of the left lower quadrant (positive Rovsing's sign), peri-umbilical or diffuse abdominal tenderness with palpation of the abdomen/pelvis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and lack of appetite. Acute cholecystitis findings include right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness, fever, nausea and vomiting, and history of gallstones. Pyelonephritis findings include fever, nausea/vomiting, urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, back/flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

Results

Clinical parameters

Statistical analysis showed that cases with appendicitis exhibited distinct patterns compared to other AAP causes (Table 1). In medical history findings, symptoms such as migration to the right lower quadrant, continuous pain, transportation pain, and movement pain were significantly more prevalent. In physical examination findings, pain in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's sign, and rebound tenderness were more frequently observed. Laboratory test results for appendicitis showed significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein, leukocytes, neutrophils, as well as a notably lower potassium concentration.

Pediatric suspected appendicitis — Kharbanda et al prospective cohort derivation and validation of decision rules: Children aged 3–18 years (total 601 patients) were evaluated, and a logistic regression rule using nausea, history of focal right lower quadrant pain, difficulty walking, rebound tenderness and absolute neutrophil count > 6.75x103 μL yielded that a score of 5 or less identified 108 patients with 106 without appendicitis, with sensitivity 98.7% (95% CI 95.5%-99.9%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.1% (95% CI 93.5%-99.7%); validation sensitivity was 96.3% (95% CI 87.5%-99%) and NPV 95.6% (95% CI 90.8%-99%). A recursive partitioning rule (absolute neutrophil count > 6.75, nausea/emesis/anorexia, maximal tenderness in right lower quadrant) achieved derivation sensitivity 100% (95% CI 97.7%-100%) and NPV 100% (95% CI 96.0%-100%), with validation sensitivity 98.1% (95% CI 90.1%-99.9%) and NPV 97.5% (95% CI 86.8%-99.9%). Patients identified as low risk by either prediction model should be considered for observation instead of imaging.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: a tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^23222e9f]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score (AIR score)" for acute appendicitis.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It is specifically applicable to patients presenting with acute abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis. The AIR score uses clinical and laboratory parameters such as fever, nausea, migration of pain, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk of having appendicitis.

The clinical utility of the AIR score is to aid in the decision-making process for the management of suspected appendicitis. It can help to identify patients who may require immediate surgical intervention, those who may benefit from further diagnostic imaging, and those who can be safely discharged with close follow-up.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the AIR score. However, it may be less accurate in certain patient populations such as pregnant women, elderly patients, or those with atypical presentations of appendicitis. It should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical tool used to evaluate the likelihood of appendicitis in patients by analyzing symptoms and lab results. Input variables include vomiting, right iliac fossa pain, rebound tenderness, fever, polymorphonuclear leukocytes percentage, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein levels. Each response assigns a numeric score per predefined criteria. These scores are cumulatively calculated to determine the risk of appendicitis, guiding subsequent medical actions.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Vomiting**:
- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Right Iliac Fossa Pain**:
- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Rebound Tenderness**:
- **None**: 0
- **Light**: 1
- **Medium**: 2
- **Strong**: 3

- **Fever (≥ 38.5ºC; 101.3ºF)**:
- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes**:
- **Less than 70%**: 0
- **70% to 84%**: 1
- **85% or more**: 2

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**:
- **Less than 10**: 0
- 10.0 to 14.9: 1
- **15 or more**: 2

- **C-Reactive Protein Level (mg/L)**:
- **Less than 10**: 0
- **10 to 49**: 1
- **50 or more**: 2

The aggregate of these scores can range from 0 to 12. Interpretation of the total score is essential for clinical decision-making:

- A score of 0 to 4 suggests a low risk of appendicitis. Patients in this category might be suited for outpatient follow-up if they are stable.
- A score ranging from 5 to 8 indicates an indeterminate risk. Such cases often require active in-hospital observation, which could involve rescoring, imaging, or even diagnostic laparoscopy based on clinic protocols.
- A score between 9 and 12 signals a high risk of appendicitis, where surgical exploration becomes a considerable option.

Summarizing, the AIR score aids clinicians by utilizing patient data to produce a coherent, actionable risk assessment for appendicitis, thereby informing optimal pathway selection based on the severity of risk.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^c934bf83]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical method

Here I am presenting my own method for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis which has been proved to be helpful in many studies around the world. The method relies on a combination of factors derived from physical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests. The method uses a simple mnemonics (MANTRELS) that is easy to remember and can be applied in many settings without the need of a computer. This mnemonics makes the method even easier to follow: First you check for the three main symptoms: Migration, Anorexia, and Nausea or vomiting; then you follow with the signs which are: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, Rebound pain (Blumberg sign) and Elevation of the temperature (oral temperature of 37.3 C or more); and finally, you do the lab tests, essentially a CBC to look for Leukocytosis and Shift to the left (increased Stabs or Segmented neutrophils), and a urinalysis to look for acetone as an indication of anorexia if it is not clinically apparent. Rebound pain can be replaced with other indirect signs such as the Rovsing sign and also with the Dunphy's sign (cough test) or the Markle's test (heel-drop jarring test). Another indirect sign that can replace the rebound pain is tenderness by gentle direct percussion with the fist, as a mallet, on the right lumbar area in cases of a retrocecal acute appendicitis. In order of decreasing importance the eight best predicting factors proved to be: Localized tenderness on the right lower quadrant, leukocytosis, migration of pain, shift to the left, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, anorexia or acetone in the urine and direct rebound pain. I assigned a value of 2 to each of the two of the more important factors tenderness and leukocytosis), and a value of 1 to each one of the others, for a possible total score of 10. A score of 5 or 6 is compatible with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a score of 7 or 8 indicates a probable appendicitis, and a score of 9 or 10 indicates a very probable appendicitis. To this score the clinician could subtract 2 points if the patient complains of headache because this symptom is very rare in cases of acute appendicitis. In this particular situation the patient may need further investigation to rule out a different disorder. Scores of five or six are in a grey area, and in this case, you may want to observe the patient for a short time (reevaluate every four to six hours) for 12 or 24 h and if the score stays the same consider other tests such as ultrasound or diagnostic laparoscopy. When the score is three or four, the clinician has two options: This could represent a very early stage of an acute appendicitis so the clinician could keep the patient under observation and repeat the tests, or even more, order additional tests such as an US or CT scan if they are available in that particular setting. Another option is to rely on his clinical impression because, as I already mentioned in my original article, "there is always an intangible ingredient in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. If there is any question about the diagnosis, more physical examinations and laboratory tests should be performed and the patient should be evaluated every four or six hours, preferably in the hospital". If the score remains the same or increases after this evaluation, the patient may need surgery. As we can see the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is a dynamic process that go hand to hand with the pathological changes of the disease. As we all know, medicine is a combination of science and art, both of them equally important in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, so we cannot discard one of them in favor of the other. It is for this reason that we cannot depend on the technological advances only but we should use our common sense and clinical experience to arrive to a correct diagnosis.

### Computed tomography utilization for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children decreases with a diagnostic algorithm [^73ba2185]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) is a clinical calculator used in the pediatric population to assess the likelihood of appendicitis. It is specifically designed for children and adolescents, typically between the ages of 3 and 18 years. The PAS is used to stratify the risk of appendicitis, helping clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing, observation, or surgical consultation is needed. It includes variables such as anorexia, nausea/vomiting, pain migration, tenderness over the right lower quadrant, rebound pain, elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. The PAS is not applicable to patients outside the pediatric age range or those with pre-existing abdominal conditions that could confound the diagnosis of appendicitis.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) provides a straightforward method to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in children by evaluating specific clinical signs and symptoms. This scoring system is based on user responses to a series of questions related to their symptoms. Each symptom, if present, contributes a specific number of points to the overall score.

The symptoms assessed and their corresponding scores are as follows:

- **Cough, percussion, or hopping tenderness in the right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Tenderness in right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Anorexia**: 1 point
- Fever of 38.0ºC (100.4ºF) or higher: 1 point
- **Nausea or vomiting**: 1 point
- **White blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm³**: 1 point
- **Neutrophilia with an absolute neutrophil count greater than 7,500**: 1 point
- **Migration of pain to the right lower quadrant**: 1 point

To calculate the PAS, each boolean input reflecting the presence of these symptoms is evaluated. The response indicating the presence of a symptom adds its assigned score to the total.

Interpreting the total score offers a clear understanding of the risk level for appendicitis:

- A total score of 3 or less suggests a low risk of appendicitis.
- A score ranging from 4 to 6 indicates an intermediate risk.
- A score of 7 or more signifies a high risk of appendicitis.

This scoring system allows for quick assessment and can aid in clinical decision-making regarding the need for further diagnostic evaluation or intervention.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

### A clinical decision rule to identify children at low risk for appendicitis [^63ae1da5]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Computed tomography (CT) has gained widespread acceptance in the evaluation of children with suspected appendicitis. Concern has been raised regarding the long-term effects of ionizing radiation. Other means of diagnosing appendicitis, such as clinical scores, are lacking in children. We sought to develop a clinical decision rule to predict which children with acute abdominal pain do not have appendicitis.

Methods

Prospective cohort study was conducted of children and adolescents who aged 3 to 18 years, had signs and symptoms suspicious for appendicitis, and presented to the emergency department between April 2003 and July 2004. Standardized data-collection forms were completed on eligible patients. Two low-risk clinical decision rules were created and validated using logistic regression and recursive partitioning. The sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and negative likelihood ratio of each clinical rule were compared.

Results

A total of 601 patients were enrolled. Using logistic regression, we created a 6-part score that consisted of nausea (2 points), history of focal right lower quadrant pain (2 points), migration of pain (1 point), difficulty walking (1 point), rebound tenderness/pain with percussion (2 points), and absolute neutrophil count of > 6.75 x 10(3)/microL (6 points). A score ≤ 5 had a sensitivity of 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87.5–99.0), NPV of 95.6% (95% CI: 90.8–99.0), and negative likelihood ratio of .102 (95% CI: 0.026–0.405) in the validation set. Using recursive partitioning, a second low-risk decision rule was developed consisting of absolute neutrophil count of < 6.75 x 10(3)/microL, absence of nausea, and absence of maximal tenderness in the right lower quadrant. This rule had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI: 90.1–99.9), NPV of 97.5% (95% CI: 86.8–99.9), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.058 (95% CI: 0.008–0.411) in the validation set. Theoretical application of the low-risk rules would have resulted in a 20% reduction in CT.

Conclusions

Our low-risk decision rules can predict accurately which children are at low risk for appendicitis and could be treated safely with careful observation rather than CT examination.

### A rare complication of the duodenal diverticulum [^5a054b3a]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: An 80-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe right-sided abdominal pain that had started after her last meal. Physical examination revealed fever (38.6°C) and rebound tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The laboratory studies showed a leucocyte count of 11.3×10⁹/L (normal, 3.7–8.0×10⁹/L) and a C-reactive protein level of 2.34 mg/dL (normal, < 0.03 mg/dL). There were no other significant findings. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast revealed retroperitoneal air around a duodenal diverticulum (figures 1 and 2). Figure 1Computed tomography scan of the abdomen with contrast (coronal section). A diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum (arrow) and retroperitoneal air (asterisk) are shown. Figure 2Computed tomography scan of the abdomen with contrast (axial section).

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^3ce3960c]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context of other research

Although the Alvarado score was developed in a mixed gender population, the ratio of men to woman was 1.4:1 and the score has subsequently been shown to perform poorly when applied to women of child-bearing age. It is also possible that a certain loss of diagnostic information may have occurred due to dichotomisation when the score was originally constructed in the derivation study. Abdominal pain in women is a diagnostically challenging symptom as there are more diagnostic possibilities aside from appendicitis, such as pelvic inflammatory disease and other gynaecological pathologies. Alternative risk scores or CPRs, such as Lindeberg, Eskelinen and Fenyo scores for appendicitis, have different numerical values for symptoms depending on whether the patient is male or female. The Van Way, Teicher and Arnbjornssion scores include gender as one of their components. Of note, Ohman et al. reported that the Alvarado score outperformed each of these other scores.

Distinguishing appendicitis from other causes of abdominal pain in children is also challenging, particularly in young children who cannot articulate how they feel or where the pain is. There is also a wide variation in presenting symptoms and it is often hard to elicit the classical presentation. The use of symptoms and signs to identify children who are at risk of acute appendicitis is particularly appealing as diagnostic imaging using a CT scan exposes children to ionizing radiation and the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound is still uncertain. A recent review found that "fever" in a child is the single most important sign associated with appendicitis, followed by rebound tenderness and migration of pain, suggesting that the Alvarado score may not be the most appropriate scoring system for children as double points are scored for tenderness in the right lower quadrant and leukocytosis, but only one point for each of all other signs (Figure 1). This review also reported the accuracy of clinical scoring systems, including the Alvarado score, where the likelihood ratio for cut points of 7 and 5 (based on three studies) was similar to our pooled estimates (cut point of 7, 3.1 and 3.5; cut point of 5, 0.05 and 0.02, respectively). Two of the studies in the review by Bundy et al. were included in this review.

The goal of this study was to validate Alvarado's predictive model as a diagnostic test and to assess the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) scan as a supplemental tool in the evaluation of acute appendicitis. Clinical and radiologic data of 215 patients with acute abdominal pain were evaluated. Clinical assessment was based on positive findings of migration of pain, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tenderness of the lower right quadrant, rebound tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis with a left shift. Evaluation by CT scan had a sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 94.1%. Clinical assessment based on the MANTRELS criteria had a sensitivity of 91.6% and a specificity of 84.7%. With the assistance of CT scan, sensitivity and specificity increased to 98.3% and 95.8%, respectively.

Derivation

A total of 16 out of 20 predictive variables were suggested from a univariate analysis that they might associate with appendicitis, see Table 1. These included eight symptoms (i.e. first location of pain, migration of pain, onset, progression of pain, right lower quadrant pain at presentation, nausea or vomiting, aggravation of pain by cough or movement, and fever), five signs (i.e. bowel sound, body temperature, tenderness at right lower quadrant of abdomen, rebound tenderness, and guarding), and two laboratory tests (i.e. WBC > 10,000 cell/mm 3 and neutrophil > 75%).

These variables were simultaneously included in the logit model, in which only seven variables were remained in the final model. These were three symptoms (i.e. migration of pain, progression of pain, and aggravation of pain by cough or movement), two signs (i.e. body temperature ≥ 37.8 °C and rebound tenderness), two laboratory tests (i.e. WBC > 10,000 cell/mm 3 and neutrophil > 75%), and odd ratios (OR) and 95% CI were reported, see Table 2.

### Acute abdominal pain in children: evaluation and management [^85c06970]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in the clinic and emergency department settings and accounts for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, and the diagnostic approach vary by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited. Symptoms and signs that indicate referral for surgery include pain that is severe, localized, and increases in intensity; pain preceding vomiting; bilious vomiting; hematochezia; guarding; and rigidity. Physical examination findings suggestive of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile. Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children is the preferred initial imaging modality due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation. In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can be used to help determine the patient's risk of appendicitis.

### Assessment of Alvarado criteria, ultrasound, CRP, and their combination in patients with suspected acute appendicitis: a single centre study [^68b5a980]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of emergency room visits following acute abdominal pain. The lifetime incidence rate of appendicitis is 8.6% among men and 6.7% among women and is much higher in the second decade of life. Appendicitis is an irreversible, progressive disease that eventually leads to intestinal perforation. Appendectomy is the gold standard treatment. Appendiceal perforation is associated with increased mortality compared to AA without perforation. The risk of death from non-gangrenous appendicitis is less than 0.1%, but this risk increases to 0.6% in gangrenous AA. Furthermore, perforated AA has a higher mortality rate of approximately 5%. Diagnosing AA is often challenging and requires a combination of history, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings. The symptoms of appendicitis overlap with several other conditions, especially in the early stages, making the diagnosis challenging. AA diagnostics can be improved and facilitated through clinical scoring systems, including physical exam results and inflammatory markers. Several scoring systems have been created to help in the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis, such as the Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score. These scoring systems use criteria, including common clinical and laboratory findings in patients with AA, to classify them into low, medium, or high-risk groups and can help in a timely diagnosis. However, none of these scoring systems are widely accepted.

The role of diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is another major debate.

In 1986, Alvarado devised a 10-point clinical scoring system to diagnose AA based on symptoms and diagnostic tests in suspected patients, which includes migrating pain (1 score), anorexia (1 score), nausea (1 score), tenderness in the lower right abdominal region (2 scores), rebound (1 score), temperature increase above 37.3 (1 score), leukocytosis above 10,000 (2 scores) and left shift of white blood cells (1 score). Screening and decision-making for patient management were based on the sum of the scores and were categorized as follows. Score 1 to 4 (discharge), score 5 to 6 (admission and follow-up), and score 7 to 10 (surgery).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain – suspected appendicitis [^50508d9f]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnostic imaging of patients presenting with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis may be organized according to age and gender and to the presence or absence of "classic" signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis. Among adult patients presenting with clinical signs of acute appendicitis, the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of ultrasound, with improved performance when CT is performed with intravenous contrast. The use of rectal contrast has been associated with decreased time in the emergency department. Computed tomography has also been shown to reduce cost and negative appendectomy rates. Both CT and ultrasound are also effective in the identification of causes of right lower quadrant pain unrelated to appendicitis. Among pediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression ultrasound can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation. Performing MRI after inconclusive ultrasound in pregnant patients has been associated with sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 86% and 97% to 99%, respectively. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Patient 1

A pregnant adult patient at 35 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for morbid obesity status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypothyroidism presented with nausea and diffuse, progressive abdominal pain that started several hours after arrival, with no fever or vomiting reported. She reported good fetal movement without vaginal bleeding, loss of fluid, or contractions. Vital signs and laboratory analysis were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen was significant for rebound tenderness in left lower quadrant and right lower quadrant. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an inflamed, dilated appendix with periappendiceal stranding and edema without fecalith.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^2d79cf08]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Making the clinical diagnosis

When encountering a new patient in the emergency department (ED), the surgeon first makes the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis based on history, physical exam and routine laboratory testing. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting symptom. It is typically located in the left lower quadrant; however, a redundant sigmoid colon can reach the right lower quadrant and mimic appendicitis. Localized peritoneal irritation can result in guarding and rebound tenderness. Free perforation often presents as frank peritonitis. Fever and leukocytosis are usually present and assist in making the clinical diagnosis. Nausea and vomiting are the most notable symptoms when a stricture results in an obstruction. The initial assessment should include a) an assessment of the severity of the signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and white blood cell count, b) peritonitis on physical exam and c) signs of organ dysfunctions. Patients with clinical diagnosis consistent with diverticulitis who have concerning signs of sepsis should be considered to be at high risk for complicated diverticulitis. They should have IV access obtained, be given a bolus of IV isotonic crystalloids (20 ml/kg), be administered IV antibiotics, and be admitted to the hospital.

These patients should undergo CT scanning with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis with the exception of pregnant women where ultrasound is recommended. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity in confirming the diagnosis and identifying patients who are candidates for therapeutic PCD. CT scanning also excludes other causes of left lower quadrant abdominal pain (e.g. leaking abdominal aortic aneurism or an ovarian abscess), but is not reliable in differentiating acute diverticulitis from colon malignancy.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: a tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^424d8a6a]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is a subjective synthesis of information from variables with ill-defined diagnostic value. This process could be improved by using a scoring system that includes objective variables that reflect the inflammatory response. This study describes the construction and evaluation of a new clinical appendicitis score.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively from 545 patients admitted for suspected appendicitis at four hospitals. The score was constructed from eight variables with independent diagnostic value (right-lower-quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, muscular defense, WBC count, proportion neutrophils, CRP, body temperature, and vomiting) in 316 randomly selected patients and evaluated on the remaining 229 patients. Ordered logistic regression was used to obtain a high discriminating power with focus on advanced appendicitis. Diagnostic performance was compared with the Alvarado score.

Results

The ROC area of the new score was 0.97 for advanced appendicitis and 0.93 for all appendicitis compared with 0.92 (p = 0.0027) and 0.88 (p = 0.0007), respectively, for the Alvarado score. Sixty-three percent of the patients were classified into the low- or high-probability group with an accuracy of 97.2%, leaving 37% for further investigation. Seventy-three percent of the nonappendicitis patients, 67% of the advanced appendicitis, and 37% of all appendicitis patients were correctly classified into the low- and high-probability zone, respectively.

Conclusion

This simple clinical score can correctly classify the majority of patients with suspected appendicitis, leaving the need for diagnostic imaging or diagnostic laparoscopy to the smaller group of patients with an indeterminate scoring result.

### Diagnosing appendicitis in children with abdominal pain… [^d0844d73]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Because no systematic reviews were available, the authors reviewed studies that compared diagnostic efforts with histologically proven appendicitis. The length of time that abdominal pain has been present is not clearly diagnostic of true appendicitis, but migration of the pain to the right lower quadrant increases the likelihood ratio for appendicitis. The accompanying symptom of vomiting increased the likelihood ratio for appendicitis. Physical findings more commonly associated with appendicitis include right lower quadrant rebound tenderness and, to a lesser degree, percussion tenderness. The presence of guarding and rigidity also increased the likelihood ratio of the diagnosis. Important investigations include the diagnostic reliability of rising white blood cell counts, especially a count of over 15, 000 per mm. 3 which increases the likelihood ratio of appendicitis to 7.
0. A low WBC count makes this diagnosis unlikely.

Ultrasonography appears to be useful in children with appropriate symptoms in whom the diagnosis is uncertain. It does not appear useful in children with very weak or very strong evidence of appendicitis because of the significant possibility of false-positive results. Although computed tomographic scanning is accurate in predicting the presence or absence of appendicitis, its added value in children with very strong evidence for or against appendicitis is unclear. The authors conclude that the presence of two or more characteristic predictors increases the likelihood ratio of appendicitis, with rebound tenderness increasing the likelihood ratio even more. The presence of an elevated WBC count adds to the suspicion of appendicitis. editor's note: Problems with accurate clinical diagnosis of appendicitis may be caused by an exaggerated emphasis on pain and tenderness.

Rectal tenderness is not a highly sensitive or specific predictor of appendicitis. Other characteristics prominent with proven appendicitis include an inflammatory response, vomiting, and a prolonged duration of symptoms. Unfortunately, the use of CT, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy has had an equivocal effect on the misdiagnosis of appendicitis, leading to unnecessary appendectomy. Clinical algorithms that include characteristic symptoms with clinical findings are needed. The Ohmann score is a good example of a potentially useful decision tool. Diagnostic testing is most useful in select, equivocal cases and is highly operator dependent. — r. s.

### Development of the RIPASA score: a new appendicitis scoring system for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^8be94813]. Singapore Medical Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "RIPASA score for acute appendicitis" for acute appendicitis.

The RIPASA score, or Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis score, is a clinical calculator used for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It is applicable to patients presenting with acute abdominal pain where there is a suspicion of appendicitis. The RIPASA score is designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce negative appendectomy rates, and aid in decision-making regarding the need for surgery. It incorporates a range of clinical, laboratory, and demographic factors, including symptoms, signs, and blood test results. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may be less accurate in atypical presentations of appendicitis or in patients with other abdominal conditions that mimic appendicitis.

The RIPASA score calculator evaluates the likelihood of acute appendicitis based on multiple clinical criteria. Each criterion is assigned a numerical value depending on specific user responses input into the system. The criteria include factors such as sex, age, and various symptoms. These factors are scored as follows:

- **Sex**: Female = 0.5, Male = 1
- **Age**: Less than 40 = 1, 40 or more = 0.5
- **Foreign national**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Right iliac fossa pain**: Yes = 0.5, No = 0
- **Pain migration to the right iliac fossa**: Yes = 0.5, No = 0
- **Anorexia**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Duration of symptoms**: 48 hours or less = 1, more than 48 hours = 0.5
- **RIF tenderness**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Right iliac fossa guarding**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Rebound tenderness**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Rovsing's sign**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Fever**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Elevated white blood cell count**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Negative urine analysis**: Yes = 1, No = 0

The calculator collects these responses, converts them into their respective scores, and sums them to produce a total score ranging from 1.5 to 16. The interpretation of the resulting score is straightforward: a score of 7 or less indicates that appendicitis is unlikely, while a score of more than 7 suggests that appendicitis is likely.

### Epiploic appendagitis: a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen [^61fb18db]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Two patients, a 53-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, presented at the Emergency Department of our hospital with symptoms of acute abdomen without concomitant fever. They both complained of severe acute abdominal pain localized at the right and left lower quadrants respectively, worsening during the last couple of hours, accompanied by moderate nausea. Rebound tenderness was present in the right and left lower abdominal quadrants respectively, with absence of other pathological findings on physical examination. In this setting our diagnostic thought was guided to the possibility of acute appendicitis in the first patient and acute diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or ruptured ovarian cyst in the second one. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. Both patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 1A - D), which established the diagnosis of primary epiploic appendagitis (EA). Patients were administered a single dose of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug intramuscularly with significant clinical improvement and were discharged from the Emergency Department with a short course of ibuprofen and advice to seek medical attention if symptoms worsened. Their clinical response was excellent and symptoms totally resolved three days later.

### Atypical clinical features of pediatric appendicitis [^dd932d64]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of appendicitis remains challenging in children. Delays in diagnosis, or misdiagnosis, have important medical and legal implications. The typical, or classic, presentation of pediatric appendicitis has been modeled after adult disease; however, many children present atypically with subtle findings or unusual signs.

Objectives

To determine the frequency of atypical clinical features among pediatric patients with appendicitis and to investigate which atypical features are the strongest negative predictors for appendicitis among patients being evaluated for appendicitis.

Methods

Children and adolescents with suspected appendicitis were enrolled over 20 consecutive months. Pediatric emergency physicians completed standardized data collection forms on eligible patients. Final diagnosis was determined by pathology or follow-up telephone call. Typical and atypical findings were defined strictly a priori.

Results

Seven hundred fifty-five patients were enrolled. The median age was 11.9 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 8.5, 14.9 yr); 36% of patients were diagnosed with appendicitis. Among patients with appendicitis, the most common atypical features included absence of pyrexia (83%), absence of Rovsing's sign (68%), normal or increased bowel sounds (64%), absence of rebound pain (52%), lack of migration of pain (50%), lack of guarding (47%), abrupt onset of pain (45%), lack of anorexia (40%), absence of maximal pain in the right lower quadrant (32%), and absence of percussive tenderness (31%). Forty-four percent of patients with proven appendicitis had six or more atypical characteristics. The median number of atypical features for patients with proven appendicitis was five (IQR: 4.0, 7.0). The greatest negative predictors, on the basis of likelihood ratios, were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) of < 10,000 per cubic millimeter (likelihood ratios [LR], 0.18), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of < 7,500 per cubic millimeter (LR, 0.35), lack of percussive tenderness (LR, 0.50), lack of guarding (LR, 0.63), and no nausea or emesis (LR, 0.65).

Conclusions

Appendicitis in pediatric patients is difficult to diagnose because children present with a wide variety of atypical clinical features. Forty-four percent of patients with appendicitis presented with six or more atypical features. Two atypical features are the strongest negative predictors of appendicitis in children: WBC of < 10,000 per cubic millimeter and an ANC of < 7,500 per cubic millimeter.

### A 17-year-old boy with high-functioning autism, gastrointestinal illness, and seizures [^cf49a2a0]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

A healthy 17-year-old boy with a high-functioning pervasive developmental disorder presented to the emergency department after having a 4-minute episode of seizure-like activity in the setting of presumed viral gastroenteritis. Within an hour of emergency department arrival, he developed a forehead-sparing facial droop, right-sided ptosis, and expressive aphasia, prompting stroke team assessment and urgent neuroimaging. Laboratory results later revealed a serum sodium of 119 mmol/L. Neurologic deficits self-resolved, and a full physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness in the lower abdomen with rebound tenderness in the right-lower quadrant. The patient was admitted to the PICU for electrolyte management and monitoring. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen obtained the following morning revealed the patient's final diagnosis.

### Developing and validating of ramathibodi appendicitis score (RAMA-AS) for diagnosis of appendicitis in suspected appendicitis patients [^581becca]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

The design was a cross-sectional study consisting of derivation and validation phases. Derived data were collected at Ramathibodi Hospital (RH), whereas validated data were collected at Thammasat University Hospital (TH) and Chaiyaphum Hospital (CH) from January 2013 to May 2015. The RH and TH are the Schools of Medicine, whereas CH is a provincial hospital.

The study was conducted and reported according to Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) and STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). Consecutive suspected appendicitis patients presenting with abdominal pain were included with following criteria: aged 15–60 years, right side abdominal pain within 7 days, had at least one of the following symptoms (i.e. right lower abdominal pain, migration of abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting) and signs (i.e. raised body temperature, right lower quadrant tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, and decreased bowel sound), and willing to participate and gave consent. Exclusion criteria were patients who could not give the history of illness, had myocardial infarction or terminal illness, abdominal mass, tumor or malignancy of appendix.

Outcome and predictors

The interested outcome was acute appendicitis by histopathological diagnosis for operative patients. For those patients with conservative management, telephone was made to confirm the final diagnosis 6 weeks after visiting.

Sample size

As for our literature review, a total of 8–10 variables were potentially included in the final risk prediction score. A simulation study indicated that a number of events per variable of at least 10 to 30 yielded less bias in coefficient estimation of logistic regression, which was known as a rule of thumb as per recommendation. Using a rule of thumb of at least 20 appendicitis patients per variable required 200 appendicitis patients for 10 variables. The prevalence of appendicitis in our setting was 62% from our pilot study. As a result, 355 patients were needed. Taking into account for missing data of 20%, at least 388 patients were finally required. In addition, an additional 100 subjects (i.e. about 30% of derived subjects) were enrolled from each of the external sites for external validation.

### Epiploic appendagitis: a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen [^1bac6d60]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans of the patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain (A: coronal reformat, B: axial) and the patient with left lower quadrant abdominal pain (C: coronal reformat, D: axial). CT demonstrated the presence of oval-shaped, fat density paracolonic lesions (white circles) with a high-attenuation central "dot" (white arrow), located at the antimesenteric edge of the ascending colon for the first patient (A, B) and the descending colon for the second patient (C, D), respectively. Inflammatory changes of the adjacent pericolonic fat were also detected, more prominent in the second patient

Primary EA is a benign, localized, sterile inflammation of the epiploic appendages, resulting from torsion or spontaneous venous thrombosis of a draining vein, usually involving the sigmoid colon or cecum. Secondary EA is associated with inflammation of adjacent organs (diverticulitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis). Patients present with acute abdominal pain mostly localized in the affected area with local tenderness on physical examination, while rebound tenderness may also exist, mimicking the clinical picture of acute abdomen, frequently leading to misdiagnoses such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. Notably, primary EA has been reported in 2–7% of patients in whom a clinical suspicion of diverticulitis was entertained and in 0.3–1% of patients suspected of having appendicitis. However, in EA, fever, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite and altered bowel function are usually absent, whilst inflammatory markers are usually normal or slightly elevated. CT findings are virtually pathognomonic for EA, while excluding other causes of abdominal pain. The typical finding is a 2 to 3 cm, oval-shaped, fat density, paracolic mass with thickened peritoneal lining and peri-appendageal fat stranding. A high-attenuated central dot within the inflamed appendage that corresponds to a thrombosed draining appendageal vein is occasionally evident. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of EA have not been well studied but appear to correlate with CT findings, while abdominal ultrasonography can be utilized in patients with a thin body habitus in experienced centers. Patients can be managed conservatively with or without oral anti-inflammatory medications and occasionally with a short course of opiates. Complete resolution without surgical intervention usually occurs within 3 to 14 days. Complications are extremely uncommon, including intestinal obstruction and abscess formation; hence patients should be advised to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.

### A new approach to accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^06530a8c]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

This study aimed (1) to develop a simple scoring system incorporating ultrasound (US) examination and clinical or laboratory predictors for increasing diagnostic accuracy in acute appendicitis (AA), and (2) to evaluate the performance of the scoring system as compared to that of previous models. Fifteen variables including US assessment for patients admitted with suspected AA were considered in multivariate analysis using the finding of AA at operation as the end point (internal study). The new score, together with 11 previous ones, was applied to a prospective independent population of subjects with suspected AA, and the respective performances were compared (external validation study). Among 303 patients (170 males, mean age 28.3 ± 13.3 years) of the internal study, 161 went on to surgery, and 130 had AA at operation. Four independent correlates of AA were identified and used for the derivation of the following integer-based scoring system: number of points = 6 for US demonstrating AA + 4 for tenderness in the right lower quadrant + 3 for rebound tenderness + 2 for leukocyte count > 12,000/microl. In the external study (201 subjects, 105 males, mean age 28.7 ± 11.9 years, 109 operated, 87 with AA), when the cut-off of > /or = 8 points for AA was used, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve of the proposed score were 95.4%, 97.4%, 96.5%, and 93%, respectively, exceeding noticeably the previous models. The proposed scoring system introduces a quantitative combination of the clinical evaluation with US imaging and a marker of inflammatory response, which may enhance the diagnostic accuracy for subjects with suspected AA especially in geographical areas where CT scanning is not readily available on a 24-hour basis.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease and acute appendicitis [^b0a3d35f]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old Japanese man developed fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, right lower quadrant abdominal pain and rebound tenderness. With the clinical suspicion of appendicitis, an abdominal CT scan was performed, which revealed mesenteric lymphadenitis. The patient was hospitalised and treated with antibiotics, but was ultimately found to have Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). This diagnosis was facilitated by the use of positron emission tomography scan that identified an accessible inguinal lymph node for biopsy and histopathological evaluation. Invasive abdominal surgery was thereby averted and the patient made a complete recovery on subsequent follow-up. Review of the published literature reveals that pseudoappendicitis due to KFD is a rare occurrence that has generally required abdominal surgery to establish the diagnosis, thus supporting the potential value of the approach taken here.

### Febrile neutropenia as the presenting sign of appendicitis in an adolescent with acute myelogenous leukemia [^10db2fec]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of a surgical abdomen in patients with acute leukemia is quite difficult because of the complications and treatment of disease itself. A 13-year-old boy with acute myelogenous leukemia developed 2 episodes of febrile neutropenia during induction therapy. The second one was treated with a 5-day course of parenteral antimicrobial therapy, but the patient then presented with right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed appendicitis. Conservative medical management was unsuccessful, and appendectomy was performed 5 days after appendicitis was diagnosed. The patient's clinical manifestations resolved 5 days later. The case illustrates that fever may be the first manifestation of appendicitis in a child with acute myelogenous leukaemia who is neutropenic. Surgery is acceptable as first-line treatment in such cases.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old caucasian G1P1 otherwise healthy female patient was known for a long history of diffuse right and left colonic diverticular disease, with repeated episodes of abdominal pain due to recurrent diverticulitis.

She presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain, cramping and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with localized left lower quadrant sharp tenderness, guarding and moderate rebound on examination. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed bowel wall thickening and contrast-enhancement along a 45 mm portion of the medium-to-distal sigmoid colon. A marked increase in soft tissue density was also observed within the pericolonic fat, with evidence of a 23 mm paramedian fluid collection in the pre-sacral area. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and antibiotic coverage was started together with analgesics. Symptoms resolved quickly, she was discharged home a week later with a diagnosis of self-limited diverticular microperforation, and an outpatient follow-up was scheduled for elective surgical planning.

### Emergency right hemicolectomy for inflammatory cecal masses mimicking acute appendicitis [^2e613b7b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

28 men and 20 women between ages 16–73 years (mean age 43.1) presented with right iliac fossa pain (Table 1). All patients had localized tenderness leading to a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. None of the patients applied to the surgery department at the onset of symptoms. They generally preferred self-medication and initial consultation with quacks. Based on our experience in this community, it wasn't surprising for us to find out at least 4 days between the onset of symptoms and admission to hospital (Table 2).

Table 1
Age range of patients (mean 43,1 years)

Table 2
The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital

The major presenting symptoms were pain in the right iliac fossa in 48 (100%), anorexia in 42 (87,5%), nausea and vomiting in 30 (62,5%), fever in 26 patients (54,2%) (Table 3). When we questioned the patients retrospectively; nausea and vomiting were the major onset symptoms; but the patients could endure this symptoms generally. On physical examination; all patients prefer to lie supine, with the thighs, particularly the right thigh, drawn up; while asked to move, they do so slowly and with caution. Tenderness is at or near the Mc Burney point in 44 (91,6%) patients. Direct rebound tenderness was present at the admission time in 42 patients (87,5%). In addition, referred or indirect rebound tenderness was present in 42 (87,5%) patients. There was a firm, palpable mass in the right iliac fossa in 28 patients (58,3%) (Table 4).

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^cdbf45c2]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

Appendicitis is one of the most common sources of abdominal pain in the emergency setting and is generally considered a straightforward diagnosis. However, atypical appearances, non-visualization, and inconclusive features can make these cases more complicated. The objectives of this article are to review the differential diagnoses for right lower quadrant pain, discuss the imaging characteristics of simple appendicitis on computed tomography (CT), and provide guidance for equivocal cases, complicated appendicitis, and appendicitis mimics. This review will also discuss the identification and management of neoplasms of the appendix.

### Simultaneous idiopathic segmental infarction of the great omentum and acute appendicitis: a rare association [^5d150ba5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Review

Omental Infarction, the result of impaired perfusion to the greater omentum, is a rare entity. First described by Bush in 1896, the incidence of idiopathic segmental infarction of the greater omentum is estimated to be 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen.

Even though more than 100 cases have been reported in the literature, its association with acute appendicitis has been rarely documented. More interestingly, this case also presented in a female patient, which makes the observation far more uncommon.

The purpose of this report is to describe our first experience with this condition. Even though the etiology is unknown, we highlight some of the possible theories. Analysis of some collective reviews and our experience with this patient indicate that the symptoms, clinical findings, preoperative diagnosis and management of this condition are almost identical, even in children.

A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of right lower abdominal pain of 48 hours of duration along with high fever and nausea without vomiting. The patient had no relevant previous medical history. The pain started at the right paraumbilical and subcostal region, radiating down to the right iliac fossa region.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, no fever, no abdominal distension but a tender abdomen in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No mass was palpable. Results of laboratory studies revealed leucocytocis with a WBC count of 12560/mm 3 and a CRP of 173 mg/L. Both, the plain x-rays and the ultrasonography of the abdomen showed no abnormalities. No further tests were performed, and the patient was taken to the operating room with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis after appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was administrated.

### Right upper quadrant pain: ultrasound first! [^8708bcd2]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments and outpatient medical practices, and is most commonly attributable to biliary and hepatic pathology. Ultrasound should be used as a first-line imaging modality for the diagnosis of gallstones and cholecystitis, as it allows the differentiation of medical and surgical causes of upper abdominal pathology, and in many circumstances is sufficient to guide patient management. Knowledge of strengths and limitations of ultrasound in the evaluation of RUQ is paramount in correct diagnosis. A spectrum of RUQ pathology for which a RUQ ultrasound examination should reasonably be considered as the initial imaging modality of choice will be reviewed.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^cf4c1eda]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric appendicitis — clinical and laboratory predictors are described, with combined variable scoring yielding a negative likelihood ratio of 0.058 (95% CI 0.008 to 0.41). In children presenting to the emergency department, for both an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and a left shift the positive likelihood ratio was 9.8, whereas for either an elevated WBC count or a left shift the negative likelihood ratio was 0.26; individually, an elevated WBC count (positive likelihood ratio 3.4; negative likelihood ratio 0.41) and a left shift (positive likelihood ratio 5.9; negative likelihood ratio 0.45) were not as strong. A Class III prospective study found that temperature greater than 38°C, a WBC count of 10,100/mm³ or greater, and rebound tenderness were significantly associated with pediatric appendicitis, and a resulting prediction rule had a 1% missed appendicitis rate and a 9% negative appendectomy rate. Additional retrospective data identified guarding and temperature greater than 38.4°C as predictive in girls 5 to 12 years of age, and tenderness and vomiting as predictive in boys 5 to 12 years of age.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^52ea9544]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with a periappendiceal abscess can be managed with percutaneous image-guided drainage in surgical departments with ready access to diagnostic and interventional radiology. When percutaneous drainage is not available surgery is suggested (Recommendation 1B).

In approximately 10% of patients, a periappendiceal abscess and inflammatory phlegmon is present at diagnosis. This is more frequently encountered in the situation of a delayed diagnosis. Clinical features of complicated appendicitis such as mass and abscess may include fever, tachycardia, palpation of mass, and extension of area of tenderness and rebound. Surgical management varies because a proportion of these cases will evolve into an ileocecal resection or a right-sided hemicolectomy if operated in the acute setting. In recent years, high success rates of 76–97% and low incidences of complications have been reported in patients with appendicitis associated with abscess and/or mass, after conservative management; thus, performing non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage, during the initial period have been proven to be effective and safe. However, a necessary condition for conservative management of these patients is an easy access to diagnostic and interventional radiology to perform a percutaneous drainage. When percutaneous drainage is not available, surgery is suggested.

In patients treated conservatively, interval appendectomy may be not necessary following initial non-operative treatment of complicated appendicitis. However, interval appendectomies should always be performed for patients with recurrent symptoms (Recommendation 2B).

Traditionally, an interval appendectomy has been offered to patients who initially underwent a non-operative approach to their appendiceal mass. However, the role of the interval appendectomy has been questioned, and controversy continues whether interval appendectomy is appropriate for adults with an appendiceal abscess. The main debate revolves around the recurrence rate, the complication rate of an interval appendectomy, and the potential for underlying malignancy. The results of a review by Andersonn and Petzold, based mainly on retrospective studies, supported the practice of non-surgical treatment without interval appendectomy in patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon. However, the patient should be informed about the risk of recurrence especially in the presence of appendicolith. The risk of missing another underlying condition (cancer or Crohn disease) is low, but motivates a colonoscopy in patients above the age of 40 years.

Results

Appendectomy was performed in 3130 patients with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis between January 2008 and November 2017 (2630 open surgeries and 380 laparoscopic surgeries). Perforated appendicitis in 621 (19.8%) patients, acute appendicitis in 2024 (64.6%) patients, and normal appendix (negative appendectomy) in 476 (%15.2) patients were found.

Stump appendicitis was diagnosed in five patients (0.15%). Three patients (60%) were male and two (40%) were female. The mean age was 32 (range 19–45). The appendectomies were performed 4, 5, 7, and 7 and 11 years previously using a conventional McBurney incision (open surgery). In the previous operation notes, the cases were recorded as perforated appendicitis in four patients (80%) and acute appendicitis in one patient (20%). In one of the patients who had been operated and confirmed due to perforated acute appendicitis, the localization of the appendix was recorded as retrocecal. The localization of the appendices of the other three patients was not recorded. The length of the appendices also was not recorded; the mean length of these appendices was 5.9 cm (4.9–7.2 cm) according to histopathologic reports.

The histopathological examination results were benign, and only inflammatory changes were observed in all patients.

One patient (20%) was referred to our clinic directly, and the remaining four patients (80%) were referred from other centers after an average of 2 days (range 1–3 days) of medical follow-up. During patient assessment at our clinic, three patients (60%) had classical physical examination findings consistent with acute appendicitis (tenderness and rebound in right lower abdominal quadrant) and the remaining two patients (40%) had acute abdomen (general tenderness, abdominal guarding, and rebound tenderness) and fever. An increase in the white blood cell (WBC) count was a common laboratory finding. The average WBC count was 14,300/mm³ (range 12,800–18,700/mm³).

### Adnexal torsion in adolescents: ACOG committee opinion No, 783 [^7a973a16]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Adnexal torsion in adolescents — clinical presentation and preoperative evaluation: When evaluating adolescents with suspected torsion, there are no clinical or imaging criteria sufficient to confirm the preoperative diagnosis, and patients with a clinical suspicion for adnexal torsion should undergo emergent diagnostic laparoscopy. The most common clinical symptom is sudden-onset abdominal pain that is intermittent, nonradiating, and associated with nausea and vomiting; nausea and vomiting are reported in 62% and 67% of cases, respectively. Clinical signs include abdominal tenderness, which is reported in up to 88% of patients, whereas rebound and peritoneal signs are reported in only 12–27% of patients, and a bimanual examination generally is not necessary or tolerated in pediatric and adolescent patients.

### Rectus sheath hematoma caused by non-contact strenuous exercise mimicking acute appendicitis [^815d3942]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A healthy 26-year-old man visited the Emergency Department due to right lower quadrant pain of 2 days' duration that developed after wakeboarding. There was no history of direct trauma to the abdomen. Physical examination revealed tenderness and rebound tenderness on the right lower quadrant area. There was no palpable abdominal mass. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was undertaken to discern the causes of acute abdomen, including acute appendicitis. CT revealed a small-size rectus sheath hematoma beneath the lower end of the right rectus muscle. The patient was admitted for supportive care including pain control and was discharged with improvement after 5 days. Rectus sheath hematoma can be caused by not only a direct blow but also non-contact strenuous exercise, for example, wakeboarding in this case. Although the majority of rectus sheath hematomas are self-limiting, some can cause peritoneal irritation signs, mimicking acute abdomen, and eventually lead to unnecessary laparotomy without clinical suspicion and ancillary tests including CT scan and ultrasonography.

### Venlafaxine pharmacobezoar causing intestinal ischemia requiring emergent hemicolectomy [^b98bab90]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Twenty-eight hours after ingestion, the patient began complaining of sharp abdominal pain at the right lower quadrant. At this time, she also had mild anorexia and one episode of loose liquid stool with no bright red blood per rectum. The patient's vital signs included a temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure of 130/95 mmHg, heart rate of 112 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min. On physical examination, the patient had tenderness suprapubically and diffusely across the right lower quadrant. Although she exhibited mild voluntary guarding, no rebound was noted. The patient also had active bowel sounds. Repeat laboratory testing was significant for an elevated white blood cell count of 18.8 × 10 3 cells/μL. Otherwise, a repeat basic chemistry panel was normal as well as lactate which was measured to be 1.3 mmol/L. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrasts was obtained, which revealed "extensive scalloping of the wall of the entire right colon with air in the wall" and a large mass of tablets in the cecum (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient was emergently taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, given concern for suspected right bowel ischemia.

### Toothpick ingestion complicated by cecal perforation: case report and literature review [^871b8b36]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis and carcinoma represent the most common causes of colon perforation, but other causes, like ingestion of foreign bodies, should be taken into account.

Case presentation

We report the case of a 64-year old man presenting in our Emergency Department with a 2 days history of right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and low grade fever. Physical examination evocated mild pain with positive rebound tenderness in the right lower abdominal quadrant, and positive right costovertebral angle tenderness. Routine blood tests, abdominal X-rays and CT scan were inconclusive for perforation. At explorative laparoscopy a cecal perforation with localized peritonitis was found, and a right colectomy was performed due to the suspicion of cancer. Histological examination confirmed the presence of a perforation caused by a piece of wood (toothpick) of 6 cm in length.

Conclusions

Foreign body ingestion should be taken into account in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain. A detailed patient's history may be crucial for a correct diagnosis and treatment.

### Which children could benefit from additional diagnostic tools in case of suspected appendicitis? [^26ca6472]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

New diagnostic tools such as ultrasound scan, computed tomography (CT) scan, and diagnostic laparoscopy, have become available for children with suspected appendicitis but should be reserved for equivocal cases. The aim of this study was to develop a scoring system to identify this subgroup of children.

Methods

Patients from 2 different periods (period 1, 99 consecutive children [group 1] and period 2, 62 consecutive children [group 2] with suspected appendicitis) were prospectively evaluated. Variables predicting appendicitis were obtained from group 1. By means of a regression analysis, a scoring system was created and applied to the patients of group 2. Missed appendicitis and negative appendectomy rates obtained by clinical practice were compared with the results that would have been accomplished based on the scoring system. Thereafter, the scoring system was externally validated in a group of children presented at another hospital (group 3, n = 114).

Results

The variables, leukocyte count ≥ 10.10(9)/L (2 points); rebound tenderness (2 points); and temperature ≥ 38 degrees C (1 point) correlated significantly with appendicitis. The scoring system was used to categorize patients into 3 groups: appendicitis unlikely, doubtful appendicitis, and suspected appendicitis. The specificity and sensitivity of the scoring system were, respectively, 85% and 89%. Applying the scoring system would lead to comparable negative appendectomy rates of 8% versus 6% using clinical judgement and a comparable number of performed laparoscopies (26% v 31%). However, it could lead to a lower missed appendicitis rate (1% v 6%) and a lower perforation rate (0% v 11%). External validation showed comparable performed laparoscopies (32%) and missed appendicitis (2%) rates but a higher negative appendectomy rate (19%), probably owing to a lower percentage of appendicitis in hospital (2, 47%) compared with hospital (1, 71%).

Conclusions

Children can be observed if leukocyte count is less than 10.10(9)/L and rebound tenderness is absent; a diagnostic laparoscopy should be performed if one of these is present, and if both are present one could perform an appendectomy.

### Current management of acute appendicitis in adults: what you need to know [^c51170c2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical diseases in the world today. Acute appendicitis can present with a well-recognized clinical presentation with abdominal pain which localize in the right lower quadrant. This presentation is more typical in men than in women of child baring age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can be used to increase the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis. Various imaging modalities can be used to make the diagnosis which include ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each study has well known sensitivity/specificity of positive predictive value of making the diagnosis of appendicitis. The management of acute appendicitis is based on the presentation of the patient and dividing it into uncomplicated and complicated disease. Each requires management with antibiotics and followed with timely appendectomy. Recent studies have demonstrated nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis without no fecalith that can be managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis should undergo timely surgical intervention. Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. There are certain patient populations that should be considered for surgical intervention. Pregnant patients as well as immunosuppressed patients should undergo timely surgical intervention to decrease the risk of complications. This review outlines the current principles of the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis based on the best available evidence of acute appendicitis in adults.

### Ovarian vein thrombosis mimicking acute abdomen: a case report and literature review [^f40a73c3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare, but serious condition that affects mostly postpartum women. A high index of suspicion is required in order to diagnose this unusual cause of abdominal pain.

Case Presentation

A 19-year-old woman at three days postpartum was admitted to our hospital because of severe right lower quandrant abdominal pain and fever 38.5'C. Physical examination revealed an acutely ill patient and right lower quadrant tenderness with positive rebound and Giordano signs. The patient underwent appendectomy which proved to be negative for acute appendicitis. Postoperatively fever and pain persisted and abdominal CT-scan with intravenous contrast agent demonstrated a thrombosed right ovarian vein. The patient was initiated on low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and antibiotic treatment and a month later a new abdominal CT-scan showed a patent right ovarian vein.

Discussion

Pathophysiologically, OVT is explained by Virchow's triad, because pregnancy is associated with a hypercoagulable state, venous stasis due to compression of the inferior vena cava by the uterus and endothelial trauma during delivery or from local inflammation. Common symptoms and signs of OVT include lower abdomen or flank pain, fever and leukocytosis usually within the first ten days after delivery. The reported incidence of OVT ranges 0,05–0,18% of pregnancies and in most cases the right ovarian vein is the one affected. Anticoagulation and antibiotics is the mainstay of treatment of OVT. Complications of OVT include sepsis, extension of the thrombus to the inferior vena cava and renal veins, and pulmonary embolism. The incidence of pulmonary embolism is reported to be 13.2% and represents the main source of mortality due to OVT.

Conclusions

OVT is a rare condition, usually in the postpartum period. A high index of suspicion is required for the prompt diagnosis and management especially in cases that mimic acute abdomen.

### The connection between acute otitis media and the acute abdomen [^53d633aa]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A female aged 9 years with a recent episode of acute otitis media (AOM) presented to her primary care physician with complaints of severe abdominal pain with right lower quadrant rebound tenderness, suggestive of an acute surgical abdomen. Neurological examination was normal on presentation. She was transferred to the local children's hospital for workup of appendicitis, during which she began exhibiting ataxia and slurred speech. Further evaluation revealed mastoiditis, venous sinus thrombosis and subdural empyema. Appendicitis was ruled out. We describe the first documented case of neurological complications of AOM presenting as an acute surgical abdomen without initial neurological findings.

### Necrotising fasciitis following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for ureteric stone: a rare and life-threatening complication [^ae1c40ea]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Abdominal examination

Marked tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. No palpable masses or significant rebound tenderness were noted. The patient also reported mild burning pain, though the primary complaint was localised tenderness. At initial presentation, erythematous skin changes were noted over the right lower abdomen.

Laboratory investigations. Elevated white blood cell count: 15.2×10 9 /L, with 89% neutrophilia. C-reactive protein: 250 mg/L, indicative of a severe inflammatory process. Serum lactate: 3.1 mmol/L, suggesting tissue hypoperfusion.
Radiological assessment. KUB radiograph with contrast demonstrated a ureteric stone causing right-sided hydronephrosis and proximal ureteric dilatation (figure 1). CT imaging revealed extensive retroperitoneal and right abdominal wall soft tissue involvement with fascial thickening, fluid collections and subcutaneous emphysema consistent with necrotising fasciitis. The appendix was visualised and appeared normal, excluding acute appendicitis as a potential cause(figure 2).

### The accuracy of pre-appendectomy computed tomography with histopathological correlation: a clinical audit, case discussion and evaluation of the literature [^a5b23948]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Cases 2

A 32-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of crampy abdominal pain that started on the left but migrated suprapubically and to the right iliac fossa. There was rebound tenderness and guarding, and the white cell count was 12 × 10⁹/L. On CT, there was "fluid in the pelvis, right iliac fossa (RIF), perihepatic and splenic regions, peritoneal enhancement in the RIF and right pelvic sidewall, a small air locule adjacent to an inflamed appendix and an appendicolith in the appendix" (Fig. 2a, b). There were also "dilated, prominent, fluid-filled small bowel loops" that were thought to represent localised ileus. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was suggested, and perforation could not be excluded; however, after appendectomy, the histological findings demonstrated "no ulceration, transmural inflammation or serosal exudate to indicate acute appendicitis". The second, blinded radiologist felt that the disproportionate volume of free fluid and the presence of inflamed small bowel should have suggested another pathology (e.g. enteritis) and that this was overlooked initially. This was likely to be clinically significant as an ascitic tap may have followed instead, followed by primarily conservative or medical rather than surgical management. It was, therefore, allocated a RADPEER score of 3b. The reliability of the appendicolith especially on CT is often overemphasised. Appendicoliths are present in only 23–46% of those with acute appendicitis; the presence of an appendicolith has no diagnostic significance, and it may be an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients. No research has suggested that those with an appendicolith are at increased risk of appendicitis.

Representative Cases

Case 1 is a 12 1/2-year-old boy weighing 70 kg. He was admitted to hospital primarily because of "intermittent abdominal pain for more than 5 days, vomiting for more than 4 days, and fever for more than 3 days"; the highest temperature was 41°C. On admission, he presented with convulsions (upward rolling of the eyes, bruising around the mouth, and leg weakness), with systolic blood pressure dropping to 40 to 50 mm Hg (Table 1). Physical examination showed abdominal guarding, tenderness and rebound tenderness, particularly in the right lower quadrant. B-scan ultrasonography of the abdomen showed swelling of the right lower quadrant appendix with an outer diameter of 1.2 cm, thickening of surrounding mesentery, and massive turbid free ascites in the peritoneal cavity. Blood analysis revealed an abnormal elevation in inflammatory markers (Table 2). Emergency exploratory laparotomy and appendectomy were performed under general anesthesia. During the operation, a large amount of yellow pus was found in the abdominal cavity, the intestinal tract was widely covered with pus, and the appendix was perforated. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, and the tracheal intubation was removed 5 days after the operation. He was discharged from the hospital 47 days after the surgery. Since discharge, he has been in good physical condition without complications.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^b87db431]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for approximately 9% of childhood primary care office visits. Symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of a surgical cause for pain include fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, voluntary guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. The age of the child can help focus the differential diagnosis. In infants and toddlers, clinicians should consider congenital anomalies and other causes, including malrotation, hernias, Meckel diverticulum, or intussusception. In school-aged children, constipation and infectious causes of pain, such as gastroenteritis, colitis, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections, are more common. In female adolescents, clinicians should consider pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion. Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test. Abdominal radiography can be used to diagnose constipation or obstruction. Ultrasonography is the initial choice in children for the diagnosis of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian or testicular torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy-related pathology, and appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery, with a peak incidence during adolescence. When the appendix is not clearly visible on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

### Sexually active cisgender female adolescent with red urine and abdominal pain [^2818b820]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

Day 1

A previously healthy, sexually active, cisgender female adolescent presented to urgent care for several days of bilateral, stabbing back pain. She was advised to take ibuprofen 600 MG as needed, up to three times daily (TID), and do stretching exercises.

Day 15

Two weeks later, the unaccompanied patient was evaluated in her primary care physician's (PCP) office for four days of intermittent red/orange-appearing urine, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and a sensation of incomplete voiding. She reported nausea without emesis, reduced appetite, watery diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain (worse left lower quadrant [LLQ] and suprapubic), and back pain. She had pain with vaginal intercourse in the last few days and red/brown vaginal discharge. She stated that she had sex without a barrier method with a monogamous boyfriend of eight months and had an etonogestrel implant which was placed five months prior. She reported a history of frequent, untreated episodes that she thought were urinary tract infections (UTIs) for which she never sought medical care.

On physical examination, the patient was afebrile and in no apparent distress; she had hypoactive bowel sounds, abdominal tenderness over the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and suprapubic region, no rebound tenderness or tenderness over McBurney point (despite diffuse RLQ tenderness), negative Murphy sign, and positive bilateral costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. On genitourinary examination (bimanual and speculum), she had mild cervical motion tenderness (CMT) and no thickened, discolored, or odorous vaginal discharge. Urinalysis, urine culture, HIV antigen/antibody, cervical swab for trichomonas, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and vaginal wet mount for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and yeast were all normal or negative. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was within normal levels (WNL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 27 (normal limit, 0–13 mm/h).

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^817bdff5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

An electronic search was performed on PubMed (January 1986 to 4 April 2011), EMBASE (January 1986 to 4 April 2011), Cochrane library, MEDION and DARE databases. The search strategy is presented as a flow diagram in Figure 2. A combination of keywords and MeSH terms were used; 'appendicitis' OR 'alvarado' OR, 'Mantrels', was used in combination with 26 specific terms for CPRs, including 'risk score', 'decision rule', 'predictive value', 'diagnostic score', and 'diagnostic rule'. A citation search of included articles was undertaken using Google Scholar. The references of included studies were also hand searched for relevant papers. Authors of recent papers (2001 onwards) were contacted when included studies did not report sufficient data to enable inclusion. No language restrictions were placed on the searches.

Figure 2
Flow diagram for the selection of studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

Study selection

To be included in this study, participants had to be recruited from an emergency department or a surgical ward and present with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis, including abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, nausea, vomiting or elevated temperature. Each included study assessed the performance of the Alvarado score in comparison with the histological examination of the appendix following surgery (reference standard). For those who did not undergo appendectomy and histological examination, outpatient follow-up or no repeat presentation were used as alternative outcome measures. To be included, studies had to report results in a manner that allowed data to be extracted for either the diagnostic test accuracy analysis of the Alvarado score at specific cut points or the calibration analysis. Studies that focused on pregnant patients were excluded.

Two reviewers (RO and FO'R) completed the review process. The inclusion criteria were defined a priori. They reviewed titles and abstracts independently and after discussion decided which articles should be reviewed in full. Full text articles were reviewed independently by the same reviewers and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

### Uterine torsion and subsequent rupture in a gravid bicornuate uterus associated with an elevated α-fetoprotein [^70fb139c]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1001 at 24 weeks of gestation, dated by last menstrual period consistent with 8 week ultrasound, presented to labour and delivery with 2 hours of severe, constant, right lower-quadrant pain as well as urinary retention, vomiting and syncope. She denied vaginal bleeding or amniorrhexis. She reported intermittent episodes of similar abdominal pain throughout the pregnancy, including an instance at 22 weeks where she presented to labour and delivery for sharp right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and vomiting that woke her from sleep. At that time, she had normal vital signs, fetal heart tones and bedside ultrasound. Labs were notable only for an elevated white cell count (WCC) and she was discharged with strict return precautions. Her obstetric history was significant for a bicornuate uterus diagnosed in her previous pregnancy for which she required a low transverse caesarean delivery secondary to malpresentation. Her first pregnancy was in her left uterine horn, this pregnancy was in the right.

Her prenatal course was notable for markedly elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at 20.91 multiples of the median (MoM) at 17 weeks of gestational age. At 19 6/7 weeks of gestation, a fetal anatomic ultrasound demonstrated no structural abnormalities, specifically no neural tube or abdominal wall defects. But the fetus had asymmetric growth restriction. An amniocentesis for chromosome analysis was performed, which resulted in a 46 XY karyotype. The AFP in the amniotic fluid was within normal range at 1.78 MoM and no acetylcholinesterase was detected. At 23 5/7 weeks of gestation, just 2 days prior to admission, the estimated fetal weight was 397 g, below the 10th percentile for gestational age.

At the time of arrival to the hospital, the patient was ill, appearing with rigours but afebrile and haemodynamically stable. The patient's respiratory and cardiac examinations were normal. She had right lower quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound and her vaginal examination demonstrated a long closed cervix but marked tenderness in the posterior fornix.

### Surgical management of acute right lower-quadrant pain in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^7003cd7c]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of right lower-quadrant pain in pregnant patients is a challenge in diagnosis. We discuss the surgical issues among pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain and demonstrate the method to diagnosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study with enrollment during 2 years. Pregnant patients presenting with acute right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and requiring surgical consult were included. Demographics, gestational age, symptoms, workup, operative results, and pathology were recorded.

Results

One-hundred patients were enrolled, 38 had nonspecific abdominal pain, 15 of whom were admitted. There were no differences in temperature, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift among the admitted and nonadmitted patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and had a substantially higher gestational age, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift than those who did not. Ultrasound was performed considerably more often on first-trimester patients (81.6%) compared with second- (58.1%) and third-trimester (57.9%) patients, and CT scan was used considerably less in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters, and considerably less than ultrasound for the first trimester. Sensitivity of ultrasound for appendicitis was inversely correlated to fetal gestational age, and CT scan retained high sensitivity and specificity throughout pregnancy.

Conclusions

This is one of the first prospective studies assessing diagnoses and workup of pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain. We recommend abdominal ultrasound be the first imaging modality for patients for whom surgical consultation is necessary, thereby determining if the pathology is obstetric. If inconclusive, a CT scan is necessary to guide treatment.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: ultrasound first [^eca6234d]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Why use US as first-line imaging modality?

In conclusion, the studies and reports detailed above give an overview of the persistent difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of AA in paediatric and adult patients, the usefulness of various clinical scores (which are not commonly used in routine practice) and recent developments of modern imaging techniques focusing on US imaging. To date, US imaging for suspected AA is performed world-wide by radiologists and many physicians of other medical subspecialties, with or without the support of sonographers.

Paediatric patient population: It is the opinion of the ESR working group on US that graded-compression US should be the first-line imaging modality in paediatric patients with suspected AA. Direct and indirect US signs of AA are well established, as is the examination technique itself. We recognize that US has, compared to CT and MRI, lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of AA. The 2011 ACR Appropriateness Criteria® for right lower quadrant pain — suspected appendicitis — state that "for adult patients with clinical signs of AA the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of US, but that in paediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression US can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation".

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^2e59eb47]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Cecal diverticulitis mimicking acute appendicitis: a report of 4 cases [^b2d4418e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Case 2

A 26-year-old woman was referred to our hospital after suffering from abdominal pain for four days. The progressively increasing pain started from the left hypogastric region and radiated to the lower quadrants. She had mild nausea, but no vomiting and no change in bowel habits was observed. On physical examination the bowel sounds were decreased. Upon palpation there was a muscular defense in the lower quadrants and epigastric fullness. Biochemical tests were all within the normal limits and abdominal plain X-rays revealed no abnormality. Based on the clinical findings the patient was thus considered to have acute appendicitis and underwent emergency laparotomy. At surgery, the appendix was found in the normal location with a normal appearance and a 2 × 3 cm inflamed mass was found on the anterior wall of the cecum located between the tenia libera and plica ileo-cecalis (Figure 2A). A diverticulectomy and incidental appendectomy were performed.

Case 3

30-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with a pain in right lower abdomen since the day before. The pain was continuous in nature. There was no history of vomiting, fever, and no change in bowel habits. There was a history of decreased appetite and nausea. On examination, she was well oriented with a pulse rate of 90/min and BP of 120/70 mmHg. The abdomen was soft and non-distended. There was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with a positive rebound in the right iliac fossa. Bowel sounds and rectal examination were normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a Hb of 10.4 g% and total leukocyte count of 14000. Ultrasound (USG) abdomen was negative except for probe tenderness in the right iliac fossa. In view of her history and physical examination, the patient was diagnosed as having acute appendicitis and was shifted to the theatre for an appendectomy. The vermiform appendix was absolutely normal and diverticulum was found on the posterior wall of the cecum (Figure 2B). The patient underwent an appendectomy with excision of cecal diverticulum.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^3e2313f9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

Case Report

We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^af485c8f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis is associated with worse outcomes than timely diagnosis, but clinical features associated with diagnostic delay are uncertain, and the extent to which delays are preventable is unclear.

Objective

To determine clinical features associated with delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis, assess the frequency of preventable delay, and compare delay outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This case-control study included 748 children treated at 5 pediatric emergency departments in the US between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. Participants were younger than 21 years and had a diagnosis of appendicitis.

Exposures

Individual features of appendicitis and pretest likelihood of appendicitis were measured by the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Case patients had a delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, defined as 2 emergency department visits leading to diagnosis and a case review showing the patient likely had appendicitis at the first visit. Control patients had a single emergency department visit yielding a diagnosis. Clinical features and pARC scores were compared by case-control status. Preventability of delay was assessed as unlikely, possible, or likely. The proportion of children with indicated imaging based on an evidence-based cost-effectiveness threshold was determined. Outcomes of delayed diagnosis were compared by case-control status, including hospital length of stay, perforation, and multiple surgical procedures.

Results

A total of 748 children (mean [SD] age, 10.2 [4.3] years; 392 boys [52.4%]; 427 White children [57.1%]) were included in the study; 471 (63.0%) had a delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, and 277 (37.0%) had no delay in diagnosis. Children with a delayed diagnosis were less likely to have pain with walking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.25), maximal pain in the right lower quadrant (aOR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07–0.19), and abdominal guarding (aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21–0.51), and were more likely to have a complex chronic condition (aOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.05–5.23). The pretest likelihood of appendicitis was 39% to 52% lower in children with a delayed vs timely diagnosis. Among children with a delayed diagnosis, 109 cases (23.1%) were likely to be preventable, and 247 (52.4%) were possibly preventable. Indicated imaging was performed in 104 (22.0%) to 289 (61.3%) children with delayed diagnosis, depending on the imputation method for missing data on white blood cell count. Patients with delayed diagnosis had longer hospital length of stay (mean difference between the groups, 2.8 days; 95% CI, 2.3–3.4 days) and higher perforation rates (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 5.5–11.3) and were more likely to undergo 2 or more surgical procedures (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 2.0–70.4).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this case-control study, delayed appendicitis was associated with initially milder symptoms but worse outcomes. These findings suggest that a majority of delayed diagnoses were at least possibly preventable and that many of these patients did not undergo indicated imaging, suggesting an opportunity to prevent delayed diagnosis of appendicitis in some children.

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^1e5f076d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### Primary abdominal hydatid cyst presenting in emergency as appendicular mass: a case report [^d837bc61]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 56 year old lady presented with acute right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever since five days. Abdominal examination revealed a tender firm mass in the right iliac fossa, measuring 5 cm × 3 cm, with restricted mobility. Muscle guarding was present over the lump. Straight leg rising, cough sign and rebound tenderness were positive. Further investigations were conducted to address clinical suspicion of appendicular mass.

Laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, neutrophilic leucocytosis (16,000/mm3) and marked eosinophilia (19%). Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen revealed a multiseptated cyst (5.2 cm × 2.5 cm) with honeycomb appearance in the right iliac fossa, suggestive of HD (Figure 1). Rest of the abdomen did not reveal any other hydatid cyst. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified Echinococcus antigen, positive with a titre of more than 1:128.) for hydatid was positive.

USG showing Hydatid cyst in the right iliac fossa.

At laparotomy the cyst was found to be located in the appendicular mesentry. Excision and appendectomy was performed. Other areas of the abdomen did not reveal any cysts. Recovery was uneventful and patient was discharged with Albendazole (800 mg/day) for one month. The patient is doing well after one year follow-up. Repeat abdominal USG after one year follow-up was within normal limits.

### Ovarian vein thrombosis mimicking acute abdomen: a case report and literature review [^7898b8d8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 19-year-old woman at three days postpartum was admitted to our hospital because of severe right lower quandrant abdominal pain. The pain started on postpartum day two and was accompanied with fever 38.5'C. There was no associated vaginal bleeding, but the patient complained of nausea and vomiting. She had vaginal delivery of a live born-term female, and the immediate postpartum period was uneventful. Physical examination showed an acutely ill patient. Heart rate was 110/min, blood pressure 110/75 mmHg and temperature was 38.3'C. Abdominal examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness with positive rebound and Giordano signs. There was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. Laboratory exams revealed elevated white blood cell count (WBC 18500) with neutrophilia (89%) and elevated CRP (150 mg/dl). Abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound were unremarkable and the patient underwent appendectomy which proved to be negative for acute appendicitis. On the first postoperative day the patient's temperature was 38.4'C and a CT-scan with intravenous contrast agent was obtained. The latter revealed a thrombosed right ovarian vein (Figure 1) with stratification of the surrounding fat and signs of right ureteral dilatation. The patient was initiated on low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and antibiotic treatment with cefoxitin for five days. The patient was discharged on the 6 th postoperative day after switching LMWH to asenocoumarole. A month later the patient underwent a new abdominal CT-scan showing a patent right ovarian vein and improvement on the fat stratification (Figure 2). The patient is scheduled to discontinue asenocoumarole after three months of treatment and have laboratory examination for thrombofilia, as sometimes OVT is the first manifestation of such a condition.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^d1c5efd5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) is a clinical calculator used in the evaluation of adult patients who present with suspected acute appendicitis. This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis, helping to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories based on a variety of clinical factors such as symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The AAS can help guide clinical decision-making, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary imaging or surgery in low-risk patients. It is not applicable to pediatric patients, pregnant women, or individuals with previous appendectomy. It should also not be used in patients with other clear causes of abdominal pain.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) calculator assesses the likelihood of acute appendicitis by evaluating patient symptoms and lab results. Users input data related to seven key indicators which are translated into numerical scores based on established categories. The scoring system assigns weights to patient symptoms and lab values as follows:

- **Right Lower Quadrant Pain**:
- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Pain Relocation**:
- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Right Lower Quadrant Tenderness**:
- Present, male = 3 points
- Present, female aged 16–49 years = 1 point
- Present, female aged > 50 years = 3 points
- Absent = 0 points

- **Guarding**:
- None = 0 points
- Mild = 2 points
- Moderate or severe = 4 points

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**:
- ≥ 7.2 and < 10.9 = 1 point
- ≥ 10.9 and < 14.0 = 2 points
- ≥ 14.0 = 3 points

- **Neutrophils (%)**:
- ≥ 62 and < 75 = 2 points
- ≥ 75 and < 83 = 3 points
- ≥ 83 = 4 points

- **C-Reactive Protein, mg/L (for symptoms > 24 hours)**:
- ≥ 4 and < 11 = 2 points
- ≥ 11 and < 25 = 3 points
- ≥ 25 and < 83 = 5 points
- ≥ 83 = 1 point
(alternative ranges for CRP are scored similarly based on different thresholds)

To compute the AAS score, each input response is translated into its respective point value. These scores are summed to produce a total score ranging between 4 and 23. This total score then helps provide a snapshot of appendicitis risk:

- A score of 10 or lower suggests a low risk of acute appendicitis.
- Scores from 11 to 15 indicate an intermediate risk.
- A score of 16 or higher points to a high risk of acute appendicitis.

These interpretations guide clinicians in assessing the probability of appendicitis, allowing for more informed decision-making in potential cases.

### Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis in a pregnant woman at 35 weeks of gestation: a case report and review of the literature [^193fcaa1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old primigravid woman, at 35 weeks gestation attended our obstetric department complaining of abdominal pain along with nausea and vomiting for 3 h. The woman's antenatal care was uneventful. She had no significant medical, surgical or family history and no history suggestive of thromboembolism. She had never used oral contraceptives or any other hormonal therapy.

Upon arrival, she had a temperature of 36.8 °C, pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 119/71 mmHg. A physical examination on admission showed a gravid uterus just below the xiphoid process. No abdominal tenderness or rebound tenderness were appreciated. The bowel sounds were normal and there were no signs suggestive of peritonitis. A hematologic examination revealed a leukocyte count of 13.1 × 10 9 /L (normal range 4.0 × 10 9 /L - 10.0 × 10 9 /L) with neutrophils accounting for 73.9% (normal range 50–70%), hemoglobin level of 98.6 g/L (normal range 100 g/L - 150 g/L), hematocrit of 0.317 (normal range 0.37–0.43), and platelet count of 187 × 10 9 /L (normal range 100 × 10 9 /L - 300 × 10 9 /L). Coagulation profile and biological tests were within normal limits. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a normal fetus compatible with expected gestational age. The fetal monitor showed that fetal heart rate fluctuated between 150 and 160 beats per min and the uterus contracted occasionally. Threatened preterm labor was initially suspected and magnesium sulfate was given to inhibit uterine contractions. Acute gastritis was also considered.

The second day after admission, the patient complained of more intense abdominal pain that was centered in the right lower quadrant, and she experienced increased vomiting and abdominal distention. Physical examination demonstrated right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound tenderness and a distended abdomen and weak bowel sounds. Hematologic testing revealed leukocytosis with a left shift (leucocyte count of 26.9 × 10 9 /L and neutrophils accounting for 91%) and hemoconcentration (hematocrit of 0.439). Serum amylase was normal. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed dilation and effusion of the right intestinal canals, thickening of the intestinal wall and a small amount of ascites. Abdominal plain radiography was performed and showed no dilated bowel loops and no features of obstruction or pneumoperitoneum. Obstetric ultrasound revealed demise of the fetus.

### Chronic appendicitis "syndrome" manifested by an appendicolith and thickened appendix presenting as chronic right lower abdominal pain in adults [^36e078e0]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

In this short report, we describe a small series of adult patients with chronic appendicitis presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The clinical presentation was unusual and atypical for classic appendicitis because of the absence of fever, peritoneal tenderness on focused graded compression of the abdomen, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) findings included the presence of an appendicolith and appendiceal thickening, without mesenteric infiltration, abscess, or collection. In this series, the appendicolith appeared to represent a marker rather than an actual cause of appendicitis. Focused CT scans with additional lung and bone windows proved optimal in detecting appendicoliths, which were not visible on the scout localizer scans, despite windowing modifications. Our findings suggest that chronic appendicitis may be a phenomenon unique to adults and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic right lower quadrant pain in patients seen in the emergency room setting. Surgery is curative in such patients, although expectant management is an alternative when tolerated by the patient.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and other spontaneous infections — symptoms and diagnostic criteria specify that symptoms/signs specific to SBP are abdominal pain, tenderness on palpation (with or without rebound tenderness), and ileus, yet up to one third of the patients with spontaneous infections may be entirely asymptomatic or present with only encephalopathy and/or acute kidney injury (AKI). The diagnosis of SBP or SBE is established with a fluid absolute neutrophil count greater than 250/mm3 (ascites or pleural, respectively), and spontaneous bacteremia is established with positive blood cultures.

### Clinical approach to a child with abdominal pain who might have appendicitis [^3e5a5d91]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Appendicitis can usually be diagnosed on completion of a history and physical examination (abdominal pain, vomiting, right lower quadrant tenderness and guarding), although laboratory evaluation with a urinalysis and white blood cell count can be of assistance. In the few cases where doubt remains, plain films of the chest and abdomen can be helpful. Whether and when further imaging is indicated remains controversial. We reviewed reports of studies published since 2003 in which the sensitivity and specificity of CT and sonography for diagnosing appendicitis were determined. Sonography had an average sensitivity of 87.1% and an average specificity of 89.2% in the nine studies reported during that period. The average sensitivity of CT was 90.8% in 11 studies during that period, and there was an average specificity of 94.2% in 10 studies. We also looked at data from 299 patients who underwent appendectomies at our hospital. Of the appendices removed, only 10.7% did not have appendicitis. In many cases, CT or US imaging data were available in the form of reports or images or both from outside institutions. CT and US images were also available from our institution when the diagnosis was in question. This is how patients present in the real world-with studies that might not be the best, might not have been indicated, and might not have images available for another interpretation. Among patients operated on with neither CT nor US images, 10.9% did not have appendicitis. Among those in whom US imaging had been performed, 11.1% were negative for appendicitis, and among those in whom CT had been performed, 9.7% were negative. Although these studies were necessary because they were performed in patients whose diagnosis was the most difficult, it is in every patient's best interest to have a thorough examination by a surgeon prior to having a CT scan.

### Concomitant typhlitis and Clostridium difficile colitis developed after first R-CHOP chemotherapy in a non-Hodgkin lymphoma patient [^865866d0]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Typhlitis or neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening condition that occurs in neutropenic patients. Early recognition is crucial owing to high death rate. We present a case of a 54-year-old man, diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received a first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), oncovin (vincristine), prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy 10 days prior presenting. He developed fever, mucositis, watery diarrhoea and right lower quadrant pain with rebound tenderness. He also had neutropenia, with an absolute neutrophil count of zero. CT abdomen confirmed the diagnosis of typhlitis, demonstrating characteristic terminal ileum, caecal and right-sided colon involvement. Moreover, stool PCR was also positive for toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with concomitant typhlitis and C difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). He was empirically treated with intravenous cefepime, intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin. His symptoms resolved in 10 days. This case illustrated a successful medical treatment of typhlitis in concomitance with CDAD.

### Abdominal pain in a postpartum patient [^1abfddc9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is a very common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). Making the correct diagnosis may be very complicated and difficult. It is even more difficult and complicated in the postpartum period, because other less common but important diagnoses must be considered. One of these potentially life-threatening diagnoses for which patients should be evaluated is uterine rupture.

Objectives

To discuss uncommon, but important, causes of abdominal pain that may occur in the postpartum period. To learn the clinical presentation, risk factors, evaluation, and management of uterine rupture in the postpartum patient.

Case Report

We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the ED with 2 days of abdominal pain and fever. The patient had had a caesarian section (C-section) 2 weeks before this admission. This was her fourth C-section. On examination, she had right lower quadrant tenderness. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained and it revealed uterine perforation with an adjacent abscess. The patient received intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A laparotomy was performed that confirmed the diagnosis of uterine perforation. The patient subsequently did very well.

Conclusions

Uterine perforation should be considered in any postpartum patient that presents with acute abdominal pain, especially if there are risk factors, such as previous C-sections. Appropriate evaluation, consultations, and management should be done expeditiously to avoid increased morbidity and mortality.
