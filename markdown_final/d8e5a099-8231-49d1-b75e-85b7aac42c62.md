## Question

find the resources that show heritability risk of bipolar disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for resources that show heritability risk of bipolar disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how heritability is defined and interpreted in psychiatric genetics. Then, I should review the classical estimates from twin, family, and adoption designs and assess their assumptions and confidence intervals. Next, I will compare these with molecular estimates from SNP-based methods and polygenic risk scores to quantify the gap in explained variance. After that, I should examine cross-disorder genetic overlap that may affect interpretation of liability. I will then consider population specificity and ancestry limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a consensus range and specify which study designs provide the most reliable estimates, with a brief note on practical implications for risk in relatives and prediction tools.

> Let me first confirm the construct. Heritability here refers to the proportion of variance in liability to bipolar disorder attributable to genetic factors in a specific population and environment; it is not an individual-level probability and depends on design assumptions, ascertainment, and diagnostic definitions, so I need to ensure any estimate is interpreted on the liability scale and within its methodological context.

> Next, I should review the twin literature, which is typically the benchmark for partitioning genetic and environmental variance. Contemporary Scandinavian registry twin data using structural equation modeling that accounts for left truncation and censoring reports a heritability of approximately 60.4% with a 95% CI of 50.3–70.5%, with no sex-specific genetic effects, which looks methodologically robust and population-based [^112rc96q]. Earlier twin studies give higher point estimates, for example 73–77% across Bipolar I and broader spectrum definitions and even up to 93% in a Finnish cohort, but I need to be cautious because those older designs may be more sensitive to model assumptions and ascertainment differences compared with modern registry-based approaches [^117LV16r] [^113853e2].

> Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions without cross-validating in family designs. Large Swedish family-based studies estimate heritability between roughly 44% and 58% and show strong familial aggregation with first-degree relative risks around six- to eightfold above population baseline, which is consistent with substantial genetic liability but typically yields slightly more conservative estimates than twin models [^111W14e8] [^11555YUU]. Wait, let me verify the specific 44% estimate attribution; earlier I noted 44% for a Swedish family study and linked it to a Psychological Medicine source labeled as a general review, so I should correct that and instead point to the large-scale Swedish sibling and measured-genotype comparison study showing that family-based heritability estimates are higher than SNP-based estimates but below classical twin estimates, aligning with this more conservative family-based range [^111r7nep] [^112rc96q].

> I need to check adoption designs to separate genes from rearing. A nationwide Swedish adoption analysis shows that parent–offspring resemblance for bipolar disorder largely reflects genetic transmission rather than shared rearing effects, which triangulates with twin and family evidence and strengthens confidence that the familial aggregation is genetically mediated rather than purely environmental [^113TTwby].

> Now, I will examine molecular estimates. SNP-based methods and polygenic risk scores capture measured common-variant liability and consistently explain less variance than twin or family studies, with SNP-based heritability for psychiatric disorders often in the 0.10–0.28 range and bipolar PRS explaining about 4.75% of phenotypic variance in current datasets; this gap indicates substantial missing heritability beyond common SNPs captured on genotyping arrays [^111r7nep] [^111SKr6b]. Let me double-check subtype differences: SNP-heritability appears higher for Bipolar I than Bipolar II in some analyses, roughly 25% vs 11%, underscoring phenotypic heterogeneity within BD that can influence molecular estimates and their generalizability across definitions [^113HwZpL].

> But wait, what about rare variation and structural variants that could bridge the gap. Rare deleterious variants identified by exome sequencing in multiplex families and modest enrichments of de novo CNVs in subsets of bipolar cases suggest that rare variation contributes to risk and likely accounts for part of the missing heritability not captured by common-variant PRS, consistent with a highly polygenic architecture that includes both common and rare effects [^1146XEgV] [^117G1Kso].

> Next, I should review cross-disorder genetic correlations so I do not overinterpret disorder-specific heritability. Genomic structural equation modeling and cross-disorder analyses indicate substantial shared liability between bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, with the shared component associating strongly with mania and psychosis in BD; family studies also show elevated risks of these other disorders in relatives of BD probands, which means some of the genetic signal is pleiotropic across diagnostic boundaries and should be considered when interpreting heritability on a liability continuum [^112JDMse] [^11555YUU] [^113cHjK2] [^114cjdtk]. I should confirm that these studies do not directly produce heritability coefficients for BD but rather contextualize genetic architecture and overlap; they support, but do not themselves quantify, the magnitude from twin and family designs, so I will not misattribute heritability estimates to them [^112JDMse].

> I will now examine ancestry and transportability. PRS performance drops markedly outside European-ancestry training sets, explaining about 2% of variance in East Asian and 1% in African American samples in current data, and multiple reviews caution about Eurocentric GWAS bias, so methodological robustness includes attention to ancestry and ascertainment because heritability is population-specific and prediction tools will underperform in non-European groups without tailored discovery datasets [^111SKr6b] [^112KyuSm] [^115qhyrz].

> Let me synthesize and weight the evidence. Considering modern, population-based twin models that handle censoring and truncation, a best-supported heritability estimate for bipolar disorder is about 60% with confidence intervals typically spanning roughly 50–70%, with older twin cohorts extending up to the mid-70s and occasionally higher; large family studies yield slightly lower estimates around 44–58%; molecular approaches currently account for 5–25% depending on method and subtype, implying substantial missing heritability likely attributable to rare variants and complex architectures, all of which is consistent across convergent designs when their assumptions are respected [^113wrrEz] [^111W14e8] [^111r7nep] [^113HwZpL] [^111SKr6b]. Hold on, I should verify my weighting rationale; prioritizing registry-based twins and adoption designs from Scandinavian populations provides the most robust and generalizable heritability estimates for BD liability at present, given sample size, careful modeling, and triangulation across designs [^113wrrEz] [^113TTwby] [^111W14e8].

> Finally, I should translate this into a clinically useful summary. For counseling and risk stratification, BD shows high heritability with a consensus range of roughly 60–77% from twin data and 44–58% from family designs, and first-degree relatives carry a six- to eightfold increased risk over population baseline; PRS can identify modestly elevated risk groups but currently explains a small fraction of variance and performs unevenly across ancestries, so it should be used cautiously and in conjunction with clinical information [^113wrrEz] [^111W14e8] [^111SKr6b] [^117LV16r]. I should double-check that this aligns with authoritative overviews; comprehensive reviews summarizing 60–85% genetic contribution are consistent with these primary estimates and reflect inclusion of genetic effects beyond common SNPs, which matches the triangulated inference above [^1145z5RT] [^1127CW8p].

Bipolar disorder is highly heritable, with **twin-based heritability of 60–90%** [^113wrrEz] and **family-based heritability of 44–58%** [^112rc96q] [^111W14e8]. First-degree relatives have a **5–10% lifetime risk** [^112bo4MB], about 7–8 times that of the general population [^111W14e8]. SNP-based heritability is **18–25%**, and **polygenic risk scores explain ~4–8% of variance** [^111SKr6b]; the top decile PRS confers a 3–4-fold risk [^111SKr6b]. These figures underscore strong genetic risk while highlighting a gap between twin and molecular estimates, reflecting polygenicity and environmental effects [^111r7nep] [^111wryS5].

## Twin and family studies

Twin and family studies provide **robust evidence** for BD heritability [^113wrrEz]:

- **Twin studies**: Monozygotic concordance is 43–93%, dizygotic 6–41%, yielding heritability estimates of 60–90% [^112rc96q].

- **Family studies**: First-degree relatives have a 5–10% lifetime risk [^112bo4MB], about 7–8 times the general population [^111W14e8].

- **Adoption studies**: Biological relatives of adoptees with BD have higher risk than adoptive relatives, supporting genetic transmission [^113TTwby] [^112bo4MB].

---

## Molecular genetic studies

Molecular genetic studies have identified **genetic variants** associated with BD [^111wryS5]:

- **Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**: Multiple loci have been identified [^113oNbHU], including CACNA1C, ANK3, and ODZ4 [^111wryS5] [^1176F2rv].

- **Polygenic risk scores (PRS)**: PRS explain ~4–8% of variance [^111SKr6b]; top decile PRS confers a 3–4-fold increased risk.

- **Rare variants**: Rare, damaging variants contribute to risk, including de novo CNVs [^117G1Kso] and rare exonic variants [^1146XEgV].

### Genetic contributions to bipolar disorder: current status and future directions [^111SKr6b]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In addition to therapeutic intervention, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) may also provide clinical utility to inform disease screening. While the PRS derived from the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) only explains about 4.75% of the phenotypic variance, the latest PRS could still be useful for risk stratification. Compared to individuals with average genetic risk for BD, individuals in the top decile risk had an odds ratio of 3.62 (95% CI 1.7–7.9) of being a case. An important caveat to note about PRSs, however, is that prediction performance is worse when applied to ancestries not included in the training GWAS. For instance, the BD PRS estimated using individuals with European ancestries explains only around 2% and 1% of the phenotypic variance in individuals with East Asian or admixed African American ancestry, respectively. Encouragingly, the trans-ethnic prediction accuracy of the PRS has improved as the sample size has increased. Furthermore, PRS prediction accuracy will also improve as new non-European ancestries are included in future training GWASs.

PRSs can also help dissect the high clinical heterogeneity (i.e. bipolar type, psychosis, rapid cycling) present in the disorder. For example, higher genetic liability for schizophrenia is associated with bipolar type I. This finding could be driven by the increased prevalence of psychosis among those with bipolar I disorder, as multiple studies have shown higher genetic risk of schizophrenia.

### Bipolar disorder and its relation to major psychiatric disorders: A family-based study in the Swedish population [^111W14e8]. Bipolar Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BPD) shares genetic components with other psychiatric disorders, yet uncertainty remains about its precise position within the psychiatric spectrum. To comprehend the etiology of BPD, this study examined the familial aggregation of BPD and its co-aggregation with schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug abuse, personality disorders, and autism spectrum disorders.

A population-based cohort was created by linking several Swedish national registers. A total of 54,723 individuals with BPD were identified among 8,141,033 offspring from 4,149,748 nuclear families. The relative risk of BPD in relatives and the co-occurrence of other psychiatric disorders in patients with BPD and their relatives were compared to those of matched-population controls. Structural equation modeling was employed to estimate the heritability and tetrachoric correlation.

The familial risks for relatives of BPD probands ranged from 5.8 to 7.9 in first-degree relatives and decreased with genetic distance. Co-occurrence risks for other psychiatric disorders were 9.7 to 22.9 in individuals with BPD and 1.7 to 2.8 in full siblings of BPD probands. Heritability for BPD was estimated at 58%. The correlations between BPD and other psychiatric disorders were notably substantial (0.37–0.62), largely attributed to genetic effects. The correlation with depression was the highest at 0.62, followed by 0.44 for schizophrenia.

The high familial risks provide evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in the etiology of BPD, underscoring the shared genetic basis with other psychiatric disorders.

### Genetic contributions to bipolar disorder: current status and future directions [^112rc96q]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Genetic factors for bipolar disorder (BD) were first investigated using twin, family, and adoption studies. These studies established that a family history of BD is an important clinical predictor of the onset of mood disorders in a patient and that the risk of mood disorder decreases as the genetic distance from the proband increases. A large family-based Swedish study showed the risk of BD was as much as 7.9, 3.3, and 1.6 times higher for first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree relatives of BD probands, respectively, compared to those without a proband in their family. In the largest family study at the time of writing, within the Swedish cohort of over 2 million individuals, the transmission of BD was found to be statistically homogeneous across family types, such as intact families, families without fathers, and adoptive families. This family-based study also estimated the heritability of BD, which is a measure of the proportion of variation in a given trait attributed to genetic variation, to be 44% (95% CI 36–48%).

Estimates of heritability from twin studies, which compare the concordance of disease between monozygotic and dizygotic twins, ranged between 60% and 90%. By comparing estimates from twin studies, the heritability of BD is among the highest of all psychiatric and behavioral disorders. It has also been well established that familial risk of BD correlates with increased familiarity.

### Family, twin, and adoption studies of bipolar disease [^112bo4MB]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Bipolar disease features states of severe depression that usually fluctuate with at least one episode of intense elation or mania. It is a disorder that has been thought for some time to have a heritable component. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disease in the general population is approximately 1%. In contrast, family studies have shown the approximate lifetime risk of a first-degree relative of a bipolar proband to be 5% to 10%. Moreover, studies of monozygotic twins show that their risk of contracting the disease is as much as 75 times greater than that for the general population. In addition, adoption studies have demonstrated that biological relatives of bipolar patients are substantially more likely to have the disorder than are adoptive relatives.

### A population-based heritability estimate of bipolar disorder - in a Swedish twin sample [^113wrrEz]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Low credibility.

Twin and family studies have shown variations in the heritability estimates of bipolar disorder (BPD). This study uses an updated statistical methodology for heritability estimation in BPD by taking the available time of follow-up into account while controlling for covariates. We identified monozygotic and dizygotic same and different sex twins with BPD (n = 804) or unaffected by BPD (n = 91,604) from the Swedish Twin Register and the National Patient Register.

We applied structural equational modeling with inversed probability weighting to estimate the heritability, considering data censoring and truncation. Sex-limitation models were constructed to analyze qualitative or quantitative sex differences in BPD. Heritability for BPD was found to be 60.4% (95% Confidence Interval: 50.3–70.5) after accounting for age, sex, left-hand truncation, and data censoring. A larger proportion of females were affected by BPD (females 62.2%; males 37.8%, p < 0.001), but no sex differences in BPD heritability were found, nor any sex-specific genetic effects.

We demonstrated a robust 60% heritability for BPD with no evidence of sex-specific genetic effects on disease liability.

### What we learn about bipolar disorder from large-scale neuroimaging: Findings and future directions from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group [^1128utmJ]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

Large-scale, collaborative neuroimaging studies offer the power to answer new questions and address prior inconsistencies in the literature, similar to what the PGC has done for genetics. The ENIGMA Consortium, launched in 2009, aimed to identify genetic variants consistently associated with brain structure and function by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on measures from brain MRI.

To overcome the statistical power limitations of GWAS (as most genetic polymorphisms associated with brain measures account for less than 1% of the overall variance in any given brain measure), the initial ENIGMA projects recruited samples with both MRI and genetic data and implemented standardized processing and analysis methods. These protocols enabled highly powered, prospective meta-analyses on a scale not previously possible, achieving 99% power to detect genetic loci explaining at least 1% of the variance in a given brain trait.

These initial studies identified new genetic variants associated with variability in brain volumes such as the hippocampus. More recently, collaborations between ENIGMA and other large-scale international consortia, such as CHARGE, were able to replicate initial findings in larger independent samples. These collaborations provided new insights into the genetic mechanisms influencing brain structure (Adams et al; Grasby et al; Hibar et al; Satizabal et al.), function (Smit et al.), and development (Brouwer et al.).

### Genetic contributions to bipolar disorder: current status and future directions [^113HwZpL]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The high levels of heterogeneity amongst patients with bipolar disorder (BD), including disorder type, features of episodes, and the course of the disorder, contribute to the difficulty in identifying underlying genetic risk factors. BDI (h² SNP = 25%) is shown to be more heritable than BDII (h² SNP = 11%), and the genetic correlation (r_g = 0.89) between these types suggests that they are closely related, yet distinct, phenotypes. The most recent PGC GWAS for BD identified novel and distinct loci specifically associated with BDI or BDII, which were not identified when all bipolar cases were analyzed together. Genetic studies of the features and course of BD have predominantly employed a polygenic risk score (PRS) approach, and GWAS data for these subtypes is lacking due to small sample sizes. Data from the PGC indicate that none of these subtypes include more than 10,000 samples. Larger deeply phenotyped samples are required to conduct a thorough investigation of the genetic architecture of these subtypes within BD. Doing so would aid subtype-specific discoveries and may inform on nosology, diagnostic practices, and drug development for BD.

In addition, the potential inclusion of 'minimal phenotyping' data further emphasizes the need for increased deep phenotyping. Results generated from deep phenotyped samples will serve as standards against which to compare the specificity of results.

### Person-level contributions of bipolar polygenic risk score to the prediction of new-onset bipolar disorder in at-risk offspring [^117Sye3s]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious mood disorder that is associated with impairment in psychosocial function, substance abuse, and suicide. Early diagnosis and treatment are key, but often treatment delays are on the order of a decade or more. Such delays frequently coincide with late adolescence and early adulthood, important developmental periods during which milestones may not be reached if BD is undiagnosed or poorly treated. Furthermore, BD is often preceded by months to years of subthreshold mood symptoms, which can be impairing and interfere with developmental milestones. Improved prediction of who will go on to develop BD can optimally inform clinical decision-making and open avenues for early intervention.

BD runs in families with estimates of 70–90% heritability. Work over the past decade indicates that this risk is not inherited through simple Mendelian transmission, but rather via numerous variants with small effect size, as identified via genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Approximately 25% of heritability has been attributed to measured genetic variance. Using results from a meta-analysis of GWAS studies, polygenic risk scores (PRS) for BD and other disorders and traits have been constructed. Previous work, including our own, has found that high PRS for BD (BD-PRS) is associated with risk of BD in adults and youth, transition from depression to BD in adults, and development of BD in offspring of parents with BD.

### Polygenic risk scores in relation to suicidality among youth with or at risk for bipolar disorder [^114cE7vE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The risk of suicide among individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) is among the highest of all psychiatric disorders. The etiology of suicidality is complex and multifactorial, with genetic factors playing a prominent role according to twin-, family-, and molecular genetic studies. This study examines polygenic risk scores from adult studies in relation to suicidality in youth with or at risk for BD.

- **Methods**: Primary analyses examined the association of polygenic risk scores for suicide attempt, based on adult genome-wide association study data, with suicidal ideation, self-harm, and suicide attempt in 232 youth (mean age 16.7 years), including 125 with, and 107 at high-risk for, BD. We also tested polygenic risk scores for risk tolerance, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, BD, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in secondary analyses.

- **Results**: Polygenic risk scores for suicide attempt were not significantly associated with suicidal ideation, self-harm, or suicide attempt. Higher polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder were nominally associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation in the overall sample (beta = 0.36, se(beta) = 0.16, p = 0.017), controlling for covariates.

- **Implications**: Our finding that polygenic risk for depression is associated with suicidal ideation converges with prior findings in youth and adults. While present findings are constrained by sample size, they underscore the importance of undertaking genome-wide association studies in youth, rather than relying solely on prior adult genome-wide association studies.

### Genetic influences on eight psychiatric disorders based on family data of 4 408 646 full and half-siblings, and genetic data of 333 748 cases and controls [^111r7nep]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most studies underline the contribution of heritable factors for psychiatric disorders. However, heritability estimates depend on the population under study, diagnostic instruments, and study designs, each with its inherent assumptions, strengths, and biases. We aimed to test the homogeneity in heritability estimates between two powerful and state-of-the-art study designs for eight psychiatric disorders.

- **Methods**: We assessed heritability based on data of Swedish siblings (N = 4,408,646 full and maternal half-siblings) and based on summary data of eight samples with measured genotypes (N = 125,533 cases and 208,215 controls). All data were based on standard diagnostic criteria. Eight psychiatric disorders were studied: (1) alcohol dependence (AD), (2) anorexia nervosa, (3) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), (4) autism spectrum disorder, (5) bipolar disorder, (6) major depressive disorder, (7) obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and (8) schizophrenia.

- **Results**: Heritability estimates from sibling data varied from 0.30 for major depression to 0.80 for ADHD. The estimates based on the measured genotypes were lower, ranging from 0.10 for AD to 0.28 for OCD, but were significant and correlated positively (0.19) with national sibling-based estimates. When OCD was removed from the data, the correlation increased to 0.50.

- **Conclusions**: Given the unique character of each study design, the convergent findings for these eight psychiatric conditions suggest that heritability estimates are robust across different methods. The findings also highlight large differences…

### Polygenic risk scores in imaging genetics: Usefulness and applications [^111XiZRw]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Genetic factors account for up to 80% of the liability for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with increased risk for both disorders. Single SNP analyses alone do not address the overall genomic or polygenic architecture of psychiatric disorders, as the amount of phenotypic variation explained by each GWAS-supported SNP is small, whereas the number of SNPs/regions underlying risk for illness is thought to be very large. The polygenic risk score models the aggregate effect of alleles associated with disease status present in each individual and allows us to utilize the power of large GWAS to be applied robustly in small samples. Here, we make the case that risk prediction, intervention, and personalized medicine can only benefit with the inclusion of polygenic risk scores in imaging genetics research.

### Genetic contributions to bipolar disorder: current status and future directions [^116rASCt]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is projected to affect about 50 million people worldwide. The BD subtypes each have an estimated lifetime prevalence of approximately 1%. However, large ranges in lifetime prevalence have been reported for different subtypes: BD I has a prevalence of 0.1–1.7%, and BD II has a prevalence of 0.1–3.0%. Most studies report no gender differences in the prevalence of BD; however, women may be at increased risk for BD II, rapid cycling, and mixed episodes. The mean age of onset for BD is approximately 20 years. An earlier age of onset is associated with poorer prognosis, increased comorbidity, onset beginning with depression, more severe depressive episodes, and longer treatment delays. Additionally, initial depressive episodes may lead to a misdiagnosis of major depressive disorder, until the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes necessary to confirm BD.

BD is often comorbid with other psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders. It is estimated that over 90% of BD patients have at least one lifetime comorbid disorder, and over 70% present with three or more comorbid disorders during their lifetime. Such ubiquitous comorbidity within BD suggests the disturbance of multiple systems and pathways.

### Is the risk of bipolar disorder in twins equal to the risk in singletons? A nationwide register-based study [^114vexkT]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

A previous study demonstrated a higher rate of schizophrenia in dizygotic twins than in the general population, and a higher rate of schizophrenia in siblings of dizygotic twins than in siblings of monozygotic twins and singletons, pointing to a common genetic predisposition for dizygotic twinning and schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these findings also apply to bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: Through record linkage between the Danish Twin Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, and the Danish Civil Registration System, the rate of bipolar disorder (diagnosed for the first time during admission to hospital) in dizygotic and monozygotic twins was compared with the rate in singletons. Additionally, the rate in siblings and parents of twins was compared with the rate in siblings and parents of singletons.

- **Results**: The rate of bipolar disorder was the same in dizygotic twins, monozygotic twins, and singletons, as well as for parents and siblings of dizygotic twins, monozygotic twins, and singletons.

- **Limitations**: The study is a register-based study and only included hospitalized patients.

- **Conclusion**: This study shows that there is an equal rate of bipolar disorder in twins and in singletons. Assuming that dizygotic twinning is under some genetic influence, a differential relationship between schizophrenia and dizygotic twinning on one hand and bipolar disorder and dizygotic twinning on the other hand may suggest differences in the genetic basis of the two diseases.

### What we learn about bipolar disorder from large-scale neuroimaging: Findings and future directions from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group [^111X7FyC]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

- **Future perspectives**: BD is a complex illness where individual factors confer a small proportion of the overall risk. The ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group is focused on applying innovative, big data approaches to provide reliable new discoveries on the biological underpinnings of BD and to generate clinically relevant findings to improve diagnosis and treatment.

The psychiatric research paradigm, which seeks markers that link high-level, behavioral-based diagnostic labels to underlying biology, is slowly changing. Neuroimaging may not provide the larger BD-related effect sizes once proposed by the "endophenotypes" hypothesis, but the combination of large-scale neuroimaging data sets has led to a better understanding of the brain regions that mediate the link between genetic risk and the behavioral manifestations of BD.

### Polygenic risk scores and twin concordance for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [^116Vvstq]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly heritable psychiatric disorders with strong genetic and phenotypic overlap. Twin and molecular methods can be leveraged to predict the shared genetic liability to these disorders.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether twin concordance for psychosis depends on the level of polygenic risk score (PRS) for psychosis and zygosity. The study aims to compare PRS from cases and controls from several large samples and estimate the twin heritability of psychosis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This case-control study generated psychosis PRS from a genome-wide association study (GWAS), combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder into a single psychosis phenotype. These scores were compared between cases and controls from the Schizophrenia and Bipolar Twin Study in Sweden (STAR) project. Further tests were conducted to ascertain if twin concordance for psychosis depended on the mean PRS for psychosis. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate heritability. This study constituted an analysis of existing clinical and population datasets with genotype and/or twin data, including twins from the STAR cohort and the Swedish Twin Registry. Data were collected during the 2006 to 2013 period and analyzed from March 2023 to June 2024.

- **Exposures**: PRS for psychosis based on the most recent GWAS of combined schizophrenia/bipolar disorder.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Psychosis case status was assessed by clinical interviews and/or Swedish National Register data.

The final cohort comprised 87 pairs of twins, with one or both being affected.

Genetics: Bipolar disorder

Evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies shows that bipolar disorder (BD) is highly heritable, with genetic variables estimated to account for 60 to 85% of risk. Efforts to discover the genetic sources of BD risk have led to numerous linkage studies, some of which have identified promising susceptibility loci. However, these linkage studies have been fraught with inconsistent replication and indeterminate genetic causes of increased linkage signal. Consequently, there have been increasing efforts toward association studies.

As with major depressive disorder (MDD), genes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have been probed for candidates increasing susceptibility to BD. Willour et al. genotyped FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a family sample of 317 BD pedigrees and 554 affected offspring. They found evidence of an association with BD for five SNPs (rs4713902, rs7757037, rs9296158, rs3800373, and rs9380525), with rs4713902 showing the most robust signal (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, Willour and colleagues identified four SNPs (rs1043805, rs3800373, rs9296158, and rs1360780) in covariate-based analyses that showed differential association with BD depending on the covariates of attempted suicide and/or the number of depressive episodes. However, other studies were unable to replicate the findings of association of BD with FKBP5. Subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in BD have contributed modest evidence of BD susceptibility attributable to SNPs in FKBP5.

### Development and validation of a risk calculator for major mood disorders among the offspring of bipolar parents using information collected in routine clinical practice [^1131Y5rb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

In this manuscript, we present evidence that the individual risk of developing a major mood disorder five years into the future in young people at a confirmed familial risk of bipolar disorder (BD) can be accurately classified using a parametric time-to-event model available in routine clinical practice. This risk calculator was most accurate at classifying risk in late adolescence to early adulthood within the Canadian high-risk offspring cohort. External validation results from a Swiss cohort were less conclusive. While there appeared to be a similar trend of better prediction at later ages, the model performed no better than chance in the Swiss cohort for younger ages (under 12 years), and it suffered from small sample sizes, leading to large confidence intervals around the time-varying C-index estimates.

In this analysis, we tested an independent replication of the risk calculator by using the model estimates developed on the Canadian offspring cohort to estimate risk in an independent sample from a different country and continent. Not surprisingly, the model performance was strongest when tested on the Canadian cohort upon which it was derived, compared to the Swiss offspring cohort. However, the risk calculator was able to predict major mood disorders in the Swiss cohort with good accuracy by late adolescence, while prediction during other ages was less accurate. This was expected, considering that sample sizes were very small across some age categories. The Canadian offspring cohort was based on highly selected families identified through parents with a clinically confirmed BD1 diagnosis.

### The outcome of major psychiatric and substance use disorders as an index of genetic risk and genetic heterogeneity [^1116xevv]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

- **Family genetic risk score and genetic risk ratio in bipolar disorder**: Mean Family Genetic Risk Score (FGRS) and Genetic Risk Ratio (GRR), both ± 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the y-axis, are shown for individuals with bipolar disorder as a function of their standardized factor scores for poor social outcome on the x-axis. The FGRS figure includes the primary disorder (bipolar disorder) and secondary disorders/traits such as ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety disorders (AD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), drug use disorder (DUD), major depression (MD), schizophrenia (SZ), and low educational attainment (LEA). The GRR figure, which only includes the secondary disorders/traits, presents the GRRs (see Methods section for definition).

- **Family genetic risk score and genetic risk ratio in schizophrenia**: Mean Family Genetic Risk Score (FGRS) and Genetic Risk Ratio (GRR), both ± 95% CIs on the y-axis, are depicted for individuals with schizophrenia based on their standardized factor scores for poor social outcome on the x-axis. The FGRS figure covers the primary disorder (schizophrenia) and secondary disorders/traits, which include ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety disorders (AD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), drug use disorder (DUD), major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and low educational attainment (LEA). As with the bipolar disorder, the GRR figure only includes the secondary disorders/traits and illustrates the GRRs (see Methods section for definition).

### Genetics of bipolar disorder [^111wryS5]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

Studies of families and twins show the importance of genetic factors affecting susceptibility to bipolar disorder and suggest substantial genetic and phenotypic complexity. Robust and replicable genome-wide significant associations have recently been reported in genome-wide association studies at several common polymorphisms, including variants within the genes CACNA1C, ODZ4, and NCAN. Strong evidence exists for a polygenic contribution to risk (i.e. many risk alleles of small effect). A notable finding is the overlap of susceptibility between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia for several individual risk alleles and for the polygenic risk. By contrast, genomic structural variation seems to play a smaller part in bipolar disorder than it does in schizophrenia. Together, these genetic findings suggest directions for future studies to delineate the aetiology and pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, indicate the need to re-evaluate our diagnostic classifications, and might eventually pave the way for major improvements in clinical management.

### Editorial: Combining genetic and clinical predictors of bipolar disorder: towards improving diagnostic precision in youth [^115zuhqJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex, heterogeneous illness, with 60% to 85% of its variance attributed to genetic factors. Adolescence marks the first peak period of risk for the onset of BD, with the initial (hypo)manic episode often preceded by childhood psychopathology, including anxiety and sleep disorders, as well as internalizing symptoms. Given the non-specific nature of childhood antecedents, combined with the prominence of depressive episodes in the early illness course, accurate diagnosis is often delayed by 8 to 10 years from onset. Yet, the early course of BD in youth is already associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, more accurate and timely diagnosis is a priority. One way forward could be to combine biomarkers with clinical variables to help validate diagnoses, improve individual risk prediction and treatment, and advance discovery research into pathogenesis.

### Psychosis genetics: Modeling the relationship between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and mixed (or "schizoaffective") psychoses [^116FVWeQ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

As a result of improving technologies and greatly increased sample sizes, the last two years have seen unprecedented advances in the identification of specific genetic risk factors for psychiatric phenotypes. There have been strong genetic associations reported at common polymorphisms within ANK3 and CACNA1C in bipolar disorder and ZNF804A in schizophrenia, along with a relatively specific association between common variation in GABA(A) receptor genes and cases with features of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Further, the occurrence of rare copy number variants (CNVs) has been shown to be increased in schizophrenia compared with controls.

These emerging data provide a powerful resource for exploring the relationship between psychiatric phenotypes and can, and should, be used to inform conceptualization, classification, and diagnosis in psychiatry. It is already clear that, in general, genetic associations are not specific to one of the traditional diagnostic categories. For example, variation at ZNF804A is associated with the risk of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and some rare CNVs are associated with the risk of autism and epilepsy as well as schizophrenia. These data are not consistent with a simple dichotomous model of functional psychosis and indicate the urgent need for moves toward approaches that:

- **Better represent the range of phenotypic variation**: Seen in the clinical population.
- **Reflect the underlying biological variation**: That gives rise to the phenotypes.

We consider the implications for models of psychosis and the importance of recognizing and studying illness.

### Risk and coaggregation of major psychiatric disorders among first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder: A nationwide population-based study [^11555YUU]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable mental illness that transmits intergenerationally. Previous studies have supported that first-degree relatives (FDRs), such as parents, offspring, and siblings, of patients with bipolar disorder have a higher risk of bipolar disorder. However, whether FDRs of bipolar patients have an increased risk of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Among the entire population in Taiwan, 87,639 patients with bipolar disorder and 188,290 FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder were identified in our study. The relative risks (RRs) of major psychiatric disorders were assessed among FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder.

- **Results**: FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder were more likely to have a higher risk of major psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (RR 6.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.95–6.30), MDD (RR 2.89, 95% CI 2.82–2.96), schizophrenia (RR 2.64, 95% CI 2.55–2.73), ADHD (RR 2.21, 95% CI 2.13–2.30), and ASD (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.92–2.29), than the total population did. These increased risks for major psychiatric disorders were consistent across different familial kinships, such as parents, offspring, siblings, and twins. A dose-dependent relationship was also found between risk of each major psychiatric disorder and numbers of bipolar patients.

- **Conclusions**: Our study was the first to support the familial coaggregation of bipolar disorder with other major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.

### What we learn about bipolar disorder from large-scale neuroimaging: Findings and future directions from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group [^113ymnS3]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

MRI-derived brain measures offer a link between genes, the environment, and behavior and have been widely studied in bipolar disorder (BD). However, many neuroimaging studies of BD have been underpowered, leading to varied results and uncertainty regarding effects. The Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Bipolar Disorder Working Group was formed in 2012 to empower discoveries, generate consensus findings, and inform future hypothesis-driven studies of BD.

Through this effort, over 150 researchers from 20 countries and 55 institutions pool data and resources to produce the largest neuroimaging studies of BD ever conducted. The ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group applies standardized processing and analysis techniques to empower large-scale meta- and mega-analyses of multimodal brain MRI and improve the replicability of studies relating brain variation to clinical and genetic data.

Initial BD Working Group studies reveal widespread patterns of lower cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and disrupted white matter integrity associated with BD. Findings also include mapping brain alterations of common medications like lithium, symptom patterns, and clinical risk profiles and have provided further insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of BD. Here we discuss key findings from the BD Working Group, its ongoing projects, and future directions for large-scale collaborative studies of mental illness.

### The Munich vulnerability study on affective disorders: Risk factors for unipolarity versus bipolarity [^112EERrw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

An individual with a high genetic load for psychiatric disorders is subject to a considerable risk factor for an affective illness. Family studies usually try to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar disorders, since it was suggested that they might show different modes of inheritance. The aim of this study was to differentiate between healthy members of unipolar and bipolar families without a previous history of any psychiatric disorder according to the neurobiological and psychometric findings.

- **Methods**: We first analyzed the results obtained from neurobiological and psychometric measurements taken from 75 healthy subjects who had at least two close relatives with a unipolar and a bipolar disorder. In a second step, we examined the subjects with a parental affective disorder; finally, we compared the members of 'pure' unipolar, bipolar, and mixed families to each other.

- **Results**: The first-degree relatives of unipolar patients showed a significantly higher REM density and scored higher on scales of 'neuroticism' and 'vegetative lability' than the controls. No significant differences could be noticed between the relatives of unipolar and bipolar patients when considering the degree of relationship, the parental type of affective disorder, and the 'purity' of the respective families.

- **Conclusions**: We found some distinct neurobiological and psychometric differences between the relatives of unipolar patients and the control probands. No obvious differences, however, were ascertained between relatives of unipolar and bipolar patients.

### Genetic influences on eight psychiatric disorders based on family data of 4 408 646 full and half-siblings, and genetic data of 333 748 cases and controls [^114gd72C]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most studies underline the contribution of heritable factors for psychiatric disorders. However, heritability estimates depend on the population under study, diagnostic instruments, and study designs, each with its inherent assumptions, strengths, and biases. We aim to test the homogeneity in heritability estimates between two powerful and state-of-the-art study designs for eight psychiatric disorders.

- **Methods**: We assessed heritability based on data of Swedish siblings (N = 4 408 646 full and maternal half-siblings), and based on summary data of eight samples with measured genotypes (N = 125 533 cases and 208 215 controls). All data were based on standard diagnostic criteria. Eight psychiatric disorders were studied: (1) alcohol dependence (AD), (2) anorexia nervosa, (3) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), (4) autism spectrum disorder, (5) bipolar disorder, (6) major depressive disorder, (7) obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and (8) schizophrenia.

- **Results**: Heritability estimates from sibling data varied from 0.30 for major depression to 0.80 for ADHD. The estimates based on the measured genotypes were lower, ranging from 0.10 for AD to 0.28 for OCD, but were significant and correlated positively (0.19) with national sibling-based estimates. When removing OCD from the data, the correlation increased to 0.50.

- **Conclusions**: Given the unique character of each study design, the convergent findings for these eight psychiatric conditions suggest that heritability estimates are robust across different methods. The findings also highlight large differences in heritability estimates depending on the method used.

### Assessment of a person-level risk calculator to predict new-onset bipolar spectrum disorder in youth at familial risk [^115oHn5J]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Early identification of individuals at high risk for the onset of bipolar spectrum disorder (BPSD) is crucial from both clinical and research perspectives. While previous work has identified the presence of a bipolar prodrome, the predictive implications for the individual had not yet been assessed at the time of writing.

The objective of this study was to build a risk calculator to predict the 5-year onset of BPSD in youth at familial risk for BPSD.

The design of this study, setting, and participants: The Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study is an ongoing community-based longitudinal cohort investigation of offspring of parents with bipolar I or II (and community controls), recruited between November 2001 and July 2007, with a median follow-up period of more than 9 years. Recruitment has ended, but follow-up is ongoing. The present analysis included offspring of parents with bipolar I or II (aged 6–17 years) who had not yet developed BPSD at baseline.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: This study tested the degree to which a time-to-event model, including measures of mood and anxiety, general psychosocial functioning, age at mood disorder onset in the bipolar parent, and age at each visit, predicted new-onset BPSD. To fully utilize longitudinal data, the study assessed each visit separately, clustering within individuals. Discrimination was measured using the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), predicting 5-year risk; internal validation was performed using 1000 bootstrapped resamples. Calibration was assessed by comparing observed vs. predicted probability of new-onset BPSD.

### Exome sequencing of familial bipolar disorder [^1146XEgV]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Complex disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BD), likely result from the influence of both common and rare susceptibility alleles. While common variation has been widely studied, rare variant discovery has only recently become feasible with next-generation sequencing.

The objective is to utilize a combined family-based and case-control approach to exome sequencing in BD using multiplex families as an initial discovery strategy, followed by association testing in a large case-control meta-analysis.

The design, setting, and participants involved exome sequencing of 36 affected members with BD from 8 multiplex families. Rare, segregating variants were tested in 3 independent case-control samples consisting of 3541 BD cases and 4774 controls.

Main outcomes and measures included the use of penalized logistic regression and 1-sided gene-burden analyses to test for association of rare, segregating damaging variants with BD. Permutation-based analyses were performed to test for overall enrichment with previously identified gene sets.

Results revealed 84 rare (frequency < 1%), segregating variants that were bioinformatically predicted to be damaging. These variants were found in 82 genes enriched for gene sets previously identified in de novo studies of autism (19 observed vs. 10.9 expected, P = 0.0066) and schizophrenia (11 observed vs. 5.1 expected, P = 0.0062) and for targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) pathway (10 observed vs. 4.4 expected, P = 0.0076). The case-control meta-analyses yielded 19 genes that were nominally associated with BD.

### Intelligence, educational attainment, and brain structure in those at familial high-risk for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [^116LmSke]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly heritable disorders with a shared genetic architecture. Both patient groups are characterized by overlapping patterns of structural brain abnormalities. In contrast, our recent ENIGMA–Relatives meta‐analysis showed that their family members — who share the risk for the disorder but generally are not confounded by medication use or other illness-related factors — exhibit divergent patterns of global brain measures. The study found that first‐degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD‐FDRs) had a larger intracranial volume (ICV), which was not present in first‐degree relatives of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ‐FDRs).

When we adjusted for ICV, no differences were found between BD‐FDRs and controls, but SZ‐FDRs still showed significantly smaller brain volumes, diminished cortical thickness, and larger ventricle volume compared to controls. These findings suggest that individuals at familial risk for either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia may show disease‐specific deviations during early brain development.

Differential neurodevelopmental trajectories in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have also been linked to intelligence quotient (IQ) development and school performance. Schizophrenia has been associated with reduced IQ.

### Editorial: Moving from innovation to validation with independent sample testing [^113cPfVx]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

It is well established that family history is the most important known risk factor for the development of a mood disorder. Approximately 25% of at-risk offspring will develop a mood disorder; yet, this is only slightly higher than the lifetime rate of a mood disorder overall, which is 21.4%. These statistics suggest heterogeneity within mood disorders generally and within people at familial risk. More information, particularly in the form of trait-level biomarkers, is sorely needed to accurately predict mood disorder risk and development. Trait-level biomarker identification may also help to decrease the well-known delay in accurately diagnosing bipolar disorders specifically, which could ultimately improve treatment and outcomes.

Nimarko et al. aimed to identify trait-level biological markers of social reward-related neural vulnerability that distinguish youths genetically at risk for mood disorder. Nimarko and colleagues reported a well-designed study consisting of extremely well-matched youths who, by virtue of parentage, were at risk of bipolar disorder, were at risk of major depressive disorder, or were healthy (control group). The sample sizes reflected the challenges associated with doing this type of research with children, but the importance of the relationships was clear and strong. Specifically, the results showed reduced bilateral putamen activity (left: z = 4.39, p = .003; right: z = 4.56, p < .001).

### Toward a biaxial model of "bipolar" affective disorders: further exploration of genetic, molecular and cellular substrates [^1165wgxT]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic and genetic evidence strongly supports the heritability of bipolar disease. Inconsistencies across linkage and association analyses have been primarily interpreted as suggesting polygenic, non-Mendelian, and variably-penetrant inheritance (i.e. in terms of interacting disease models). An equally likely explanation for this genetic complexity is that trait, locus, and allelic heterogeneities (i.e. a heterogeneous disease model) are primarily responsible for observed variability at the population level.

The two models of genetic complexity are not mutually exclusive and are, in fact, likely to co-exist both in trait determination and disease expression. However, the model proposes that while both types of complex genetics are likely central to observable affective trait spectra, inheritance patterns, gross phenotypic categories, and treatment responsiveness in affective disease — as well as the widespread inconsistencies across such studies — may be primarily explained in terms of a heterogeneous disease model. Gene-gene, gene-protein, and protein-protein interactions, then, are most likely to serve as trait determinants and 'phenotypic modifiers' rather than as primary pathogenic determinants.

Moreover, while locus heterogeneity indicates the presence of multiple susceptibility genes at the population level, it does not necessitate polygenic inheritance at the individual or pedigree level. Rather, mono- or bigenic determination of disease susceptibility within individuals/pedigrees is possible.

### Genetic risk for psychiatric illness is associated with the number of hospitalizations of bipolar disorder patients [^111X8Khx]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) has a highly heterogeneous clinical course characterized by relapses and increased health care utilization in a significant fraction of patients. A thorough understanding of factors influencing illness course is essential for predicting disorder severity and developing targeted therapies.

- **Methods**: We performed polygenic score analyses in four cohorts (N = 954) to test whether the genetic risk for BD, schizophrenia, or major depression is associated with a severe course of BD. We analyzed BD patients with a minimum illness duration of five years. The severity of the disease course was assessed using the number of hospitalizations in a mental health facility and a composite measure of longitudinal illness severity (OPCRIT item 90).

- **Results**: Our analyses showed that higher polygenic scores for BD (β = 0.11, SE = 0.03, p = 1.17 × 10⁻³) and schizophrenia (β = 0.09, SE = 0.03, p = 4.24 × 10⁻³), but not for major depression, were associated with more hospitalizations. None of the investigated polygenic scores was associated with the composite measure of longitudinal illness severity (OPCRIT item 90).

- **Limitations**: We could not account for non-genetic influences on disease course. Our clinical sample contained more severe cases.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that the genetic risk burden for psychiatric illness is associated with increased health care utilization, a proxy for disease severity, in BD patients. The findings are in line with previous observations made for patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or major depression.

### Cross-disorder genomewide analysis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression [^113cHjK2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Family and twin studies indicate substantial overlap of genetic influences on psychotic and mood disorders. Linkage and candidate gene studies have also suggested overlap across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study was to apply genomewide association study (GWAS) analysis to address the specificity of genetic effects on these disorders.

The authors combined GWAS data from three large effectiveness studies of schizophrenia (CATIE, genotyped: N = 741), bipolar disorder (STEP-BD, genotyped: N = 1,575), and major depressive disorder (STAR*D, genotyped: N = 1,938), as well as from psychiatrically screened control subjects (NIMH-Genetics Repository: N = 1,204). A two-stage analytic procedure involving an omnibus test of allele frequency differences among case and control groups was applied, followed by a model selection step to identify the best-fitting model of allelic effects across disorders.

The strongest result was seen for a single nucleotide polymorphism near the adrenomedullin (ADM) gene (rs6484218), with the best-fitting model indicating that the effect was specific to bipolar II disorder. Findings also revealed evidence suggesting that several genes may have effects that transcend clinical diagnostic boundaries, including variants in NPAS3 that showed pleiotropic effects across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.

This study provides the first genomewide significant evidence implicating variants near the ADM gene on chromosome 11p15 in psychopathology.

### A population-based study of KCNH7 p. Arg394His and bipolar spectrum disorder [^11586cNY]. Human Molecular Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

A community-based approach to psychiatric genetics

Among people afflicted with serious mental disorders, conservative estimates suggest that only 50–65% in developed nations and 15–24% in less-developed nations are diagnosed and treated appropriately. Such is the case in Amish communities, where treatment for psychiatric disease may only occur in response to crises like intractable mental anguish, emergent hospitalization, violence, or the threat of suicide. The treatment gap in Amish as well as other communities results from multiple factors, including social stigma, a dire shortage of professional resources, and abiding ignorance of underlying disease mechanisms and their developmental expression.

For many patients, the first signs of mental illness surface during childhood or adolescence while there remains a window for effective intervention. At present, identification of presymptomatic individuals who might later develop major psychiatric disease is based on a combination of family history, prodromal symptoms, and concerning patterns of behavior. Underlying this effort is the simple notion that recognizing a predilection for mental illness allows medical and psychosocial interventions to be implemented proactively. Indeed, informed prevention has proven the key practical benefit that genetic knowledge confers on clinical practice, and it is widely believed that mental health services can be improved by a firmer grounding in genetics and developmental biology.

Effective treatment strategies for bipolar disorder will largely depend on the identification of biological markers and early intervention strategies.

### Genome-wide association of bipolar disorder suggests an enrichment of replicable associations in regions near genes [^116dScqy]. PLoS Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

The model of polygenic inheritance suggests that there are many loci throughout the genome, each with small effect, that influence phenotypic expression. Our result for bipolar disorder (BD) does not rule out the model of many loci but suggests that for this disease, truly associated variation may be enriched near genes. Thus, the genetic architecture of BD, tagged by common variation, does not appear to be evenly distributed throughout the genome but may reside in circumscribed regions.

Many recent studies have been pursued to better understand if non-genome-wide significant variation can still be considered to harbor phenotypically relevant information. For example, Yang et al. quantified variation explained by all SNPs by fitting a single regression model that included thousands of variants to assess the collective effect of these variants on height and estimated the variation in height explained by these variants. Park et al. took a different approach and used the distribution of effect sizes at genome-wide significant loci in conjunction with the power to detect those effects to extrapolate the distribution of undetected genetic loci.

Our approach differs from these methods in several ways. First, we do not require individual level data and only require summary level results, which can obviate the need for individual data use restrictions. Second, we do not require genome-wide significant results to estimate a true effect size distribution, which is helpful when there are few to no significant associations. Third, because the replication vs. power relationship approach…

### An extended Swedish national adoption study of bipolar disorder illness and cross-generational familial association with schizophrenia and major depression [^113TTwby]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Information about how the risk for bipolar disorder is transmitted across generations and how parental risk for bipolar disorder relates to their children's risk for schizophrenia and major depression is limited.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sources of parent-offspring transmission of bipolar disorder and its familial cross-generational association with schizophrenia and major depression. The design, setting, and participants included parents and offspring (born 1960–1990) from four family types ascertained from Swedish national samples: intact (offspring, n = 2,175,259), not-lived-with biological father (n = 152,436), lived-with stepfather (n = 73,785), and adoptive (n = 15,624). Data analysis was conducted from October 28, 2019, to January 8, 2020.

Exposures included three sources of parent-offspring resemblance: genes plus rearing, genes only, and rearing only. The main outcomes and measures were the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, broad schizophrenia (i.e. schizophrenia as a 3-level variable: unaffected, nonaffective psychosis, and schizophrenia), and major depression obtained from Swedish national registries. Parent-offspring resemblance was assessed primarily by tetrachoric correlation (i.e. correlation of liability) and for key results, odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regression. Cross-generational associations of bipolar disorder with broad schizophrenia and major depression were assessed by their transmission from bipolar disorder in parents and transmission to bipolar disorder in offspring.

The study population included 2,417,104 individuals of four family types (51.8% male and 48.2% female).

### Heritability of bipolar spectrum disorders. Unity or heterogeneity [^117LV16r]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the three disorders in the bipolar spectrum — Bipolar I disorder, Bipolar II disorder, and Cyclothymia — are various expressions of an underlying genetic commonality. The method involved identifying a sample consisting of same-sexed monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins using hospital and outpatient registers (N = 303). DSM-III-R criteria were assessed by personal interviews. Cross tabulations were used to compare concordance rates for different definitions of the bipolar spectrum. Additionally, correlations in liability and estimation of the heritability (h) with biometrical model fitting were performed.

The results showed higher concordance rates among MZ than DZ pairs for all the single diagnoses and main combinations of diagnoses. Cross-concordance between different diagnoses was observed. The heritability of Bipolar I was .73, of Bipolar I+II .77, and of Bipolar I+II+Cyclothymia .71.

There were some limitations in the study: probands were not sampled from the general population, and most often the same person interviewed both twins in a pair. The statistical power was restricted in some sub-analyses.

In conclusion, the 'Bipolar Spectrum' category, consisting of Bipolar I disorder, Bipolar II disorder, and Cyclothymia, constitutes one entity with high heritability without detectable shared family environmental effects. Future genetic and clinical work might consider that all variants of the bipolar spectrum are an expression of one underlying genetic liability.

### Are auditory P300 and duration MMN heritable and putative endophenotypes of psychotic bipolar disorder? A Maudsley Bipolar Twin and Family Study [^114MoMiM]. Psychological Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Impaired P300 auditory response has been reported in patients with psychotic bipolar disorder (BPD) and unaffected relatives of psychotic bipolar patients. Deficits in mismatch negativity (MMN), however, have not been observed in bipolar patients. To our knowledge, no family study of MMN in BPD has been reported. The study combined the Maudsley twin and bipolar family samples using genetic model fitting analyses to:

- **Assess the relationship** between BPD and MMN.
- **Substantiate the association** between psychotic BPD and P300 variables.
- **Verify the genetic overlap** of BPD with P300 amplitude previously reported in the twin sample.
- **Examine the shared genetic influences** between BPD and bilateral temporal scalp locations of P300 components.

A total of 301 subjects were included in this study, including 94 twin pairs, 31 bipolar families, and 39 unrelated healthy controls. Statistical analyses were based on structural equation modeling.

- **Results**: Both P300 and MMN are heritable, with heritability estimates of 0.58 for MMN, 0.68–0.80 for P300 amplitude, and 0.21–0.56 for P300 latency. The bipolar patients and their relatives showed normal MMN. No significant association, either genetic or environmental, was found with BPD. BPD was significantly associated with reduced P300 amplitude and prolonged latency on midline and bilateral temporal-posterior scalp areas. Shared genetic factors were the main source of these associations.

The results confirm that MMN is not an endophenotype for psychotic BPD, whereas P300 amplitude and latency might suggest a genetic association with psychotic bipolar disorder.

### Psychiatric polygenic risk scores across youth with bipolar disorder, youth at high risk for bipolar disorder, and controls [^1163J4Mo]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

There is a pronounced gap in knowledge regarding polygenic underpinnings of youth bipolar disorder (BD). This study aimed to compare polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in youth with BD, youth at high clinical and/or familial risk for BD (HR), and controls.

Participants were 344 youths of European ancestry (ages 13–20), including 136 youths with BD, 121 HR youths, and 87 controls. PRSs for BD, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were constructed using independent genome-wide summary statistics from adult cohorts. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association between each PRS and diagnostic status (BD vs. HR vs. controls). All genetic analyses controlled for age, sex, and two genetic principal components.

The BD group showed significantly higher BD-PRS than the control group (odds ratio = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.13–2.10, p = .006), with the HR group numerically intermediate. BD-PRS explained 7.9% of phenotypic variance. PRSs for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were not significantly different among groups. In the BD group, BD-PRS did not significantly differ in relation to BD subtype, age of onset, psychosis, or family history of BD.

BD-PRS derived from adult genome-wide summary statistics is elevated in youth with BD. Absence of significant between-group differences in PRSs for other psychiatric disorders supports the specificity of BD-PRS in youth. These findings add to the biological validation of BD in youth.

### Person-level contributions of bipolar polygenic risk score to the prediction of new-onset bipolar disorder in at-risk offspring [^114FUpkK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

There are several limitations that should be considered when interpreting these results. First, we have not externally validated the RC (including BD-PRS) in an independent sample. However, we used cross-validation to ensure that all model-tuning and predictor selection were conducted in the training set, and all predictions were evaluated in the testing set, thus protecting against overfitting. External validation in an independent sample will be an important future direction, particularly to assess whether observed interactions remain predictive.

Second, while BIOS is the largest and longest-running study of its kind, we still had a limited number of individuals with BD in this sample. Nevertheless, the effective sample size for this analysis is 126 (given 227 at-risk offspring, 38 of whom converted), which exceeds the minimum recommended sample size of 100 for PRS studies.

Third, this sample was recruited based on a family history of BD. While this design maximizes the frequency of new-onset BD, results cannot be applied to youth without a clear family history of BD. This is a critical consideration since prevalence in the population affects statistics such as PPV and false omission rate, as well as the calibration of the RC. Furthermore, youth who might benefit most from the RC may not have a well-documented family history, for example, due to a lack of treatment-seeking or disconnection from family of origin. Thus, a critical future direction will be to assess the degree to which BD-PRS improves risk prediction in a clinically at-risk sample.

### Genetic liabilities differentiating bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, and phenotypic heterogeneity in bipolar disorder [^116SwzGR]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

- **Key points**: Are there etiological associations between clinical heterogeneity in participants with bipolar disorder and components of genetic liability that are shared between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder and components that differentiate between these disorders?

- **Findings**: In this genetic association study including 4,429 participants, mania, psychosis, and depression were associated with the components of genetic liability differentiating bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia, respectively. The shared liability component was associated with mania.

- **Meaning**: This study advances understanding of etiological heterogeneity in individuals with bipolar disorder by showing clinical heterogeneity of bipolar disorder is underpinned by etiological heterogeneity linked to components of differentiating genetic liability that reflects the symptomatology of the cognate disorders.

### Person-level contributions of bipolar polygenic risk score to the prediction of new-onset bipolar disorder in at-risk offspring [^115qhyrz]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Given the possibility of clinical utility, this leads to several important questions about clinical application, many of which require further investigation.

- **Weighing risks and benefits**: Prior to wide adaptation of BD-PRS utilization (and usage of the RC, in particular), it is important to weigh the risks and benefits for patients (and families) to know this information. This includes whether patients benefit from having more prognostic information (which is, by definition, imperfect) and, relatedly, whether there are actionable steps to take based on the outcome.

- **Population considerations**: It is important to acknowledge that analyses were in offspring of European ancestry, given that this is the population within which the BD-PRS was developed. Population stratification limits its applicability to individuals not of European ancestry. Thus, there is the very real possibility that clinical tools described here, if useful, could exacerbate existing racial inequities. Ongoing efforts to scale up GWAS in non-European populations and/or methodological advances are critical to the development of improved BD-PRS in diverse samples.

- **Protection of genetic information**: Such genetic information will need to be protected given the possibility that such prognostic information may be used in ways that are not helpful to the individual, such as by insurance companies to exclude coverage.

While these considerations are outside the scope of the paper, it is important to contextualize these findings, which may have clinical application, in this broader framework and, with that, suggest caution.

### Psychosis endophenotypes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [^113vNCdf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Recent studies provide considerable evidence that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may share overlapping etiologic determinants. Identifying disease-related genetic effects is a major focus in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder research, with implications for clarifying diagnosis and developing specific treatments for various impairments in these two disorders.

Efforts have been multifaceted, with the ultimate goal of describing causal paths from specific genetic variants to changes in neuronal functioning, and to behavioral and functional impairments. Parallel efforts have identified and refined several alternative phenotypes that are stable, heritable, have some known biological substrates, and are associated with psychosis liability. These alternative phenotypes are likely to aid the search for liability genes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders and are likely to be informative regarding the extent to which the two disorders share etio-pathophysiology.

### Penetrance and pleiotropy of polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression among adults in the US Veterans Affairs Health Care System [^113BvaDb]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Serious mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, are heritable, highly multifactorial disorders and major causes of disability worldwide.

- **Objective**: To benchmark the penetrance of neuropsychiatric polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in the Veterans Health Administration health care system and to explore associations between PRSs and broad categories of human disease via phenome-wide association studies.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Extensive Veterans Health Administration's electronic health records were assessed from October 1999 to January 2021. An embedded cohort of 9,378 individuals with confirmed diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder was found. The performance of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression PRSs was compared in participants of African or European ancestry in the Million Veteran Program (approximately 400,000 individuals). Associations between PRSs and 1,650 disease categories based on ICD-9/10 billing codes were explored. Finally, genomic structural equation modeling was applied to derive novel PRSs indexing common and disorder-specific genetic factors. Analysis took place from January 2021 to January 2022.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Diagnoses based on in-person structured clinical interviews were compared with ICD-9/10 billing codes. PRSs were constructed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.

Of 707,299 enrolled study participants, 459,667 were genotyped at the time of writing.

### Genetic contributions to bipolar disorder: current status and future directions [^1127CW8p]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Our knowledge of the genetic etiology of BD has rapidly accelerated in recent years with advances in technology and methodology as well as the adoption of international consortiums and large population-based biobanks. It is now clear that BD is highly heritable but also highly heterogeneous and polygenic, with substantial genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders. Encouragingly, genetic studies of BD have reached an 'inflection point'. Thus, the number of associated loci is expected to substantially increase in larger future studies and with it, improved genetic prediction of the disorder. Incorporation of ancestrally diverse samples in these studies will enable improved identification of causal variants for the disorder and also allow for equitable future clinical applications of both genetic risk prediction and therapeutic interventions.

### Association between schizophrenia-related polygenic liability and the occurrence and level of mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder [^1144RSRr]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) overlaps with schizophrenia in its clinical presentation and genetic liability. Alternative approaches to patient stratification beyond diagnostic categories are needed to understand the underlying disease processes and mechanisms.

To investigate the association between common-variant liability for schizophrenia, indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and psychotic presentations of BD, a case-control study was conducted in the United Kingdom. The study used multinomial logistic regression to estimate differential PRS associations across categories of cases and controls. Participants included in the final analyses were 4,436 cases of BD from the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. These cases were compared with genotypic data for 4,976 cases of schizophrenia and 9,012 controls from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium study and the Generation Scotland study. Data were collected between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013. Data analysis was conducted from March 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017.

- **Exposures**: Standardized PRSs, calculated using alleles with an association threshold of p < 0.05 in the second Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, were adjusted for the first 10 population principal components and genotyping platforms.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Multinomial logit models estimated PRS associations with BD, stratified by Research Diagnostic Criteria subtypes of BD, by lifetime occurrence of psychosis, and by lifetime mood-incongruent psychotic features.

### Replication of genome-wide association study (GWAS) susceptibility loci in a Latino bipolar disorder cohort [^117BZuqn]. Bipolar disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Family‐based association testing of single markers and haplotypes offers several advantages over GWASs. Family‐based study designs are robust to the effects of spurious associations caused by population stratification, structure, and admixture. Family‐based designs also allow the detection of Mendelian errors, which offers a level of genotyping quality control that cannot be matched by GWASs. Haplotype‐based methods represent a powerful approach to disease gene mapping based on the association between functional variants and the inherited ancestral haplotypes. We assume that some affected individuals may have inherited novel mutations from a common ancestor, and these individuals are likely to share alleles at SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the disease‐causing variant. It should therefore be possible to track a variant allele in the population by identifying the particular ancestral segment on which it arose.

We hypothesized that previously identified genetic variants associated with BD and/or SC, and the ancestral haploblocks containing these SNPs, might also show an association with BD in Latino populations. We therefore tested 91 SNPs (76 LD blocks) identified in BD and/or SC GWASs for association with BD, along with selected SNPs in strong LD with these markers, using a family‐based association test for single markers and haplotypes in a Latino population.

### Improved detection of common variants associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate [^114cjdtk]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Several lines of evidence suggest that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to explain more of the "missing heritability" of common complex phenotypes. However, reliable methods to identify a larger proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that impact disease risk are currently lacking. Here, we use a genetic pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate (FDR) method on GWAS summary statistics data to identify new loci associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorders (BD), two highly heritable disorders with significant missing heritability. Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggest similar disease characteristics and overlapping genes between SCZ and BD.

We computed conditional Q-Q curves of data from the Psychiatric Genome Consortium (SCZ: n = 9,379 cases and n = 7,736 controls; BD: n = 6,990 cases and n = 4,820 controls) to show enrichment of SNPs associated with SCZ as a function of association with BD and vice versa, with a corresponding reduction in FDR. By applying the conditional FDR method, we identified 58 loci associated with SCZ and 35 loci associated with BD below the conditional FDR level of 0.05. Of these, 14 loci were associated with both SCZ and BD (conjunction FDR). Together, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of genetic pleiotropy-informed methods to improve gene discovery in SCZ and BD and indicate overlapping genetic mechanisms between these two disorders.

### Genome-wide association study of 40,000 individuals identifies two novel loci associated with bipolar disorder [^113oNbHU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a genetically complex mental illness characterized by severe oscillations of mood and behavior. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk loci that together account for a small portion of the heritability. To identify additional risk loci, we performed a two-stage meta-analysis of more than 9 million genetic variants in 9,784 bipolar disorder patients and 30,471 controls, the largest GWAS of BD at the time of writing.

In this study, to increase power, we used approximately 2,000 lithium-treated cases with a long-term diagnosis of BD from the Consortium on Lithium Genetics, excess controls, and analytic methods optimized for markers on the X-chromosome. In addition to four known loci, results revealed genome-wide significant associations at two novel loci: an intergenic region on 9p21.3 (rs12553324, P = 5.87×10⁻⁹; odds ratio (OR) = 1.12) and markers within ERBB2 (rs2517959, P = 4.53×10⁻⁹; OR = 1.13). No significant X-chromosome associations were detected, and X-linked markers explained very little BD heritability. The results add to a growing list of common autosomal variants involved in BD and illustrate the power of comparing well-characterized cases to an excess of controls in GWAS.

### Investigating polygenic burden in age at disease onset in bipolar disorder: Findings from an international multicentric study [^111JEfoh]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Although early onset of bipolar disorder (BD) has long been hypothesized to constitute a genetically more homogenous subcategory within the rather heterogeneous BD spectrum, the search for phenotype-specific genetic variants has not yet been successful. Being a highly heritable disorder with 43.2% of its genetic liability explained by common variants of small effect, the development of BD, similar to other complex polygenic conditions, can be modeled within the framework of a liability-threshold model. Individuals with more BD- or schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated risk alleles can be expected to cross the liability threshold earlier and thus have an earlier disease onset. Previous family studies support this hypothesis: affected siblings of patients with early age at onset (AAO) were reported to be four times more likely to also have an early AAO, and children of couples with a positive history of affective disorders had a higher risk for an earlier AAO.

However, a study conducted on 255 patients found no difference between the BD polygenic risk scores (BD-PRSs) of the different AAO groups. Evidence shows that the power to detect the genetic underpinnings of complex phenotypes increases with larger sample sizes. Therefore, we assumed that, using a sample size an order of magnitude larger than in the study by Aminoff et al, we might find an association between AAO and BD and SCZ. Based on the negative findings of our study, one can hypothesize that instead of being largely influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of BD and SCZ, age at disease onset is rather influenced by other genetic, environmental, or epigenetic risks.

### Genetic contributions to bipolar disorder: current status and future directions [^112KyuSm]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable mental disorder and is estimated to affect about 50 million people worldwide. Our understanding of the genetic etiology of BD has greatly increased in recent years with advances in technology and methodology, as well as the adoption of international consortiums and large population-based biobanks. It is clear that BD is also highly heterogeneous and polygenic and shows substantial genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies of BD suggest that the number of associated loci is expected to substantially increase in larger future studies, and with it, improved genetic prediction of the disorder.

Still, a number of challenges remain to fully characterize the genetic architecture of BD. First among these is the need to incorporate ancestrally diverse samples to move research away from a Eurocentric bias that has the potential to exacerbate health disparities already seen in BD. Furthermore, incorporation of population biobanks, registry data, and electronic health records will be required to increase the sample size necessary for continued genetic discovery, while increased deep phenotyping is necessary to elucidate subtypes within BD. Lastly, the role of rare variation in BD remains to be determined. Meeting these challenges will enable improved identification of causal variants for the disorder and also allow for equitable future clinical applications of both genetic risk prediction and therapeutic interventions.

### Genetic liabilities differentiating bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, and phenotypic heterogeneity in bipolar disorder [^114quU2J]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, using novel methodology to isolate components of liability that distinguish schizophrenia, BD, and MDD, as well as the pleiotropic component shared between the disorders, we have shown that within BD, clinical heterogeneity was influenced not only by the burden of risk alleles for BD carried by an individual but also by the contribution of alleles that have relatively distinct effects on risk for other traits. It follows that the different phenotypic features within BD may be associated with etiological heterogeneity. Further understanding the basis of this heterogeneity will be critical for obtaining a detailed understanding of the different pathophysiological processes underlying BD, stratifying patients, and developing precision therapeutics.

### Person-level contributions of bipolar polygenic risk score to the prediction of new-onset bipolar disorder in at-risk offspring [^114UiFHF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

**Methods**: Methods for the BIOS sample have been described previously. Briefly, adults with DSM-IV BD-I/II who had biological offspring aged 6–18 years were recruited between September 2001 and July 2008, primarily through advertisements. Parents with schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability (IQ < 70), or mood disorders secondary to other conditions were excluded. All offspring (6–18 years old) of eligible parents were included in the study, except for offspring with intellectual disability (IQ < 70) or other condition(s) that interfered with evaluation. Parents and offspring were followed approximately every two years. Community controls were also included in this study but are not part of the analysis. Informed consent was obtained from parents and adult offspring; assent was obtained from offspring under 18 years old. All study procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Review Board.

### Genetic liabilities differentiating bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, and phenotypic heterogeneity in bipolar disorder [^112JDMse]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Understanding the origins of clinical heterogeneity in bipolar disorder (BD) will inform new approaches to stratification and studies of underlying mechanisms.

The objective is to identify components of genetic liability that are shared between BD, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder (MDD) and those that differentiate each disorder from the others. Additionally, this study examines associations between heterogeneity for key BD symptoms and each component.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Utilizing data from the Bipolar Disorder Research Network in the United Kingdom, components of liability were identified by applying genomic structural equation modeling to genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia, BD, and MDD. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) representing each component were tested for association with symptoms in an independent BD data set. Adults with DSM-IV BD or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, were included. Data were collected from January 2000 to December 2013, and data were analyzed from June 2020 to February 2022.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: PRS representing the components of liability were tested for association with mania and depression, psychosis, and mood incongruence of psychosis in participants with BD, measured using the Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimensional Scale.

- **Results**: Of 4,429 included participants, 3,012 (68.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 46.2 (12.3) years. Mania and psychosis were associated with the shared liability component (mania β = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.23–0.34; P = 3.04×10⁻²⁵; psychosis β = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.04–0.07; P = 2.33×10⁻¹³).

### High concordance of bipolar I disorder in a nationwide sample of twins [^113853e2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The few studies of bipolar I disorder in twins have consistently emphasized the genetic contribution to disease liability. The authors report what appears to be the first twin study of bipolar I disorder involving a population-based twin sample, in which the diagnoses were made by using structured, personal interviews.

- **Method**: All Finnish same-sex twins (N = 19,124) born from 1940 to 1957 were screened for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder as recorded in the National Hospital Discharge Register between 1969 and 1991 or self-reported in surveys of the Finnish Twin Cohort in 1975, 1981, and 1990. Thirty-eight pairs were thereby identified and invited to participate in the study; the participation rate was 68%. Lifetime diagnoses were made by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. The authors calculated probandwise and pairwise concordances and correlations in liability and applied biometrical model fitting.

- **Results**: The probandwise concordance rates were 0.43 (95% CI = 0.10 to 0.82) for monozygotic twins and 0.06 (95% CI = 0.00 to 0.27) for dizygotic twins. The correlations in liability were 0.85 and 0.41, respectively. The model with no familial transmission was rejected. The best-fitting model was the one in which genetic and specific environmental factors explained the variance in liability, with a heritability estimate of 0.93 (95% CI = 0.69 to 1.00).

The high heritability of bipolar disorder was demonstrated in a nationwide population-based twin sample assessed with structured personal interviews.

### Genomic view of bipolar disorder revealed by whole genome sequencing in a genetic isolate [^1176F2rv]. PLoS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder is a life-long mental illness characterized by episodes of depression and mania or hypomania, with a typical age of onset in young adulthood. Twin and family studies have shown that bipolar disorder has a strong genetic component with heritability estimated to be in the range of 80%. As such, families with bipolar disorder have been extensively studied by linkage analysis, and a considerable number of possible susceptibility loci have been reported. The largest linkage study at the time of writing on 972 unrelated families identified loci on chromosomes 6q21 and 9q21.

In addition, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using large cohorts of patients and control subjects have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CACNA1C (alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) and ANK3 (ankyrin 3), implicating these as potential susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder. A recent meta-analysis of GWAS data from over 13,600 individuals identified a risk locus for major mood disorders at 3p21.1. A large-scale international GWAS effort replicated the association for CACNA1C and identified new susceptibility alleles in ODZ4. Although genome-wide association studies remain an important approach for identifying common variants conferring risk for common psychiatric disorders, each individual locus or allele identified at the time of writing explains only a very small proportion of familial clustering and relatively small changes in risk.

Genetic studies of isolated populations have led to the identification of genetic variants underlying a

### De novo CNVs in bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia [^117G1Kso]. Human Molecular Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder (BD) presents a lifetime risk of approximately 1% in the general population, with a 10-fold increased risk in first-degree relatives. Heritability estimates range between 59% and 87%. BD is a complex genetic disorder characterized by significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Genome-wide association studies focusing on common genetic variants have identified several loci with compelling statistical support. It is estimated that about a third of the genetic variance in risk is contributed by common alleles tagged by SNPs on genotyping arrays.

Rare, moderate to highly penetrant copy number variants (CNVs) have been established as risk factors for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability/developmental delay (ID/DD). As such, CNVs may also account for some of the unexplained heritability of BD. Research on BD has produced conflicting results, showing modest enrichments for CNVs in some studies but not in others.

An enrichment of de novo CNVs in individuals with BD was first reported by Malhotra et al. This team identified 10 CNVs in 185 probands, resulting in a rate of 5.4% (or 4.3% per person, acknowledging that 2 probands had 2 CNVs each), compared with 4 CNVs in 426 controls (a rate of 0.9%). These findings suggest that this class of variants is implicated in the disorder, particularly in early-onset cases. More recently, Noor et al. identified 8 de novo CNVs among 215 BD probands, a rate of 3.7%. Although no new control group was tested in that study, the rate was considered increased.
