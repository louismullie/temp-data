## Question

Is Ammonia correlated with hepatic encephalopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ammonia is correlated with hepatic encephalopathy and how to interpret that correlation in a clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic role of ammonia in hepatic encephalopathy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about using ammonia levels diagnostically. Next, I will review the clinical evidence for correlation across settings such as chronic cirrhosis, acute liver failure, and acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. After that, I need to examine confounders that weaken correlation, including inflammation, sample handling, and interindividual variability. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with clear takeaways for diagnosis, staging, and management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation. Hyperammonemia is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy. Ammonia crosses the blood–brain barrier, is metabolized in astrocytes to glutamine, drives osmotic swelling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotransmitter dysregulation, which together produce the neuropsychiatric phenotype of HE, so there is a strong biological plausibility linking ammonia to HE pathogenesis [^112Q6MMo] [^113HAQFC] [^111tPvZf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical utility. I need to check what guidelines actually recommend. The AASLD/EASL guidance states that an elevated ammonia alone does not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in chronic liver disease, and that a normal ammonia in a patient with suspected overt HE should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis; EASL 2022 adds that in delirium/encephalopathy with liver disease, a normal ammonia level should make us question HE, reinforcing a limited, rule-out role rather than a diagnostic or staging role [^116fpXmX] [^1127WV7v] [^114zUApH] [^1159UJym].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence in chronic cirrhosis. Wait, let me verify the directionality of correlation. Some prospective studies show modest correlations between venous or arterial ammonia and West Haven grade, with Spearman coefficients around 0.5–0.6, but these relationships are inconsistent across cohorts and not strong enough for individual patient staging. Moreover, elevated ammonia is common even without encephalopathy, and lactulose dosing and clinical response do not track with ammonia levels, limiting their use in guiding therapy [^117XQRfy] [^111KhZCV] [^114a9VtD] [^113SEYzx].

> I will now examine acute liver failure, where the correlation appears stronger. In ALF, arterial ammonia correlates with severity of HE and intracranial hypertension, and thresholds such as greater than 100–124 μmol/L predict severe HE and cerebral edema, while levels above about 150–200 μmol/L that fail to decline with therapy identify patients at high risk for intracranial hypertension and may inform decisions about invasive monitoring. Pediatric data similarly link higher admission ammonia with high-grade HE and herniation risk, supporting a prognostic role in this setting [^115qTjSR] [^1177T9LH] [^112Txfat] [^115ynb5t].

> But wait, what if the liver injury is drug-induced rather than viral or ischemic. In acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, I initially thought ammonia might reliably predict encephalopathy, but I should double-check that assumption. The data show poor sensitivity and specificity of ammonia for encephalopathy in this context, with only a small positive likelihood ratio, indicating limited diagnostic performance and suggesting that mechanisms beyond ammonia predominate in many cases of drug-induced liver injury [^114Uxcq1].

> Next, I should review confounders that erode correlation. Systemic inflammation and infection amplify ammonia neurotoxicity and can independently worsen HE, so the same ammonia level may produce different clinical phenotypes depending on cytokine milieu. In parallel, ammonia levels are highly labile with protein intake and vary with sample handling, tourniquet use, and processing delays, and interindividual variability is substantial, all of which undermine the reliability of a single value for diagnosis or staging [^1179KKFt] [^113NUbX6] [^1162NBSW] [^115qC1VQ] [^115TUXNb].

> Let me consider special contexts. After TIPS, the risk of HE rises and metabolomic shifts beyond ammonia likely contribute. Ammonia levels alone do not reliably predict post-TIPS HE, reinforcing that other gut-derived neurotoxins and portosystemic flow changes modulate risk, so I should be cautious not to overinterpret ammonia in this scenario [^113AvsL7] [^117AvwJf].

> I should confirm the practical clinical implications. For diagnosis, HE remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion; a normal ammonia in a patient with altered mental status and liver disease should prompt evaluation for alternative etiologies, whereas an elevated ammonia supports but does not confirm HE. For staging, do not use ammonia to grade severity; rely on West Haven and Glasgow Coma Scale. For management, do not titrate lactulose or rifaximin to ammonia levels; treat clinically and address precipitants. For prognosis, especially in ALF or decompensated cirrhosis, persistently high or rising ammonia can signal worse outcomes and may inform ICU-level monitoring and transplant referral, but it should not dictate day-to-day therapeutic adjustments [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym] [^115KhUMC] [^116YtUCc].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is precise. Yes, ammonia correlates with hepatic encephalopathy at a population level, particularly in acute liver failure where the correlation is stronger and clinically actionable for risk stratification. However, in chronic cirrhosis the correlation is weak to moderate, inconsistent across studies, and not reliable for diagnosing, staging, or guiding therapy in individual patients, so clinical assessment remains paramount and ammonia should be used sparingly and interpreted in context [^115qTjSR] [^117XQRfy] [^111KhZCV] [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym].

---

Ammonia correlates with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) severity in acute liver failure and advanced cirrhosis, but the relationship is **inconsistent in chronic HE** due to inflammation, infection, and interindividual variability [^116YtUCc] [^1179KKFt]. Elevated ammonia is a hallmark of HE pathophysiology [^113HAQFC], yet **levels do not reliably track symptoms** or guide therapy in chronic disease [^111KhZCV] [^114a9VtD]. Guidelines advise against routine ammonia testing for diagnosis or monitoring in chronic HE; a normal level should prompt evaluation for alternative causes, while very high levels (> 150–200 μmol/L) indicate severe disease and higher risk of cerebral edema in acute liver failure [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym] [^112Txfat].

---

## Pathophysiological role of ammonia in HE

Ammonia is a **key neurotoxin** in HE, generated primarily in the gut and normally cleared by the liver via the urea cycle [^113HAQFC]. In liver failure, impaired clearance and portosystemic shunting increase systemic ammonia, which crosses the blood–brain barrier and causes astrocytic swelling, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter dysregulation, contributing to cognitive and motor deficits [^112T5iFF] [^111tPvZf].

---

## Correlation between ammonia levels and HE severity

### Acute liver failure (ALF)

In ALF, arterial ammonia correlates strongly with HE severity and intracranial hypertension; levels > 100 μmol/L predict high-grade HE, and > 200 μmol/L predict cerebral edema and mortality [^113yt2qc] [^1177T9LH]. Persistent hyperammonemia (> 122 μmol/L for ≥ 3 days) is associated with **high mortality and complications** [^115z4TDw].

---

### Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis

In chronic liver disease, the correlation between ammonia and HE is **weaker and inconsistent**: 60–69% of patients with overt HE have elevated ammonia, and levels overlap across HE grades [^111KhZCV] [^113baQqx]. Inflammation, infection, and interindividual variability weaken the correlation, limiting the utility of ammonia for staging or monitoring [^1179KKFt] [^113NUbX6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize that **ammonia alone does not diagnose, stage, or monitor HE** in chronic liver disease [^116fpXmX] [^114sczVk]. Routine testing is not recommended; a normal level should prompt evaluation for alternative causes, while very high levels indicate severe disease and higher risk of cerebral edema in acute liver failure [^115KhUMC] [^112Txfat].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors limit the **reliability of ammonia** in HE:

- **Inflammation and infection**: Systemic inflammation and infection exacerbate HE independent of ammonia levels [^1179KKFt].
- **Sample handling**: Pre-analytical errors (e.g. delayed processing, improper storage) can falsely elevate ammonia [^116g8tZj] [^1153BJM7].
- **Interindividual variability**: Baseline ammonia levels vary widely, reducing diagnostic specificity [^115TUXNb] [^116dWwkj].

## Clinical utility of ammonia measurement

| **Clinical scenario** | **Utility of ammonia measurement** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute liver failure | Strong correlation with HE severity and cerebral edema; useful for risk stratification | Measure arterial ammonia; consider invasive ICP monitoring if > 150–200 μmol/L [^115qTjSR] [^112Txfat] |
| Chronic cirrhosis | Weak correlation with HE severity; limited diagnostic utility | Do not use for routine diagnosis or monitoring; use clinical assessment [^116fpXmX] [^115KhUMC] |
| Minimal HE | Poor correlation with neuropsychometric tests; limited diagnostic utility | Do not use for routine screening or diagnosis [^116fpXmX] [^116rkSew] |

---

## Alternative biomarkers and clinical assessments

Given ammonia's limitations, **clinical assessment** using the West Haven criteria and Glasgow Coma Scale remains the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring HE [^112TBGiX] [^115KhUMC]. Inflammation markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6) and neuropsychometric tests may provide additional context but are not definitive [^1179KKFt] [^114yfQW5].

---

Ammonia correlates with HE severity in acute liver failure and advanced cirrhosis, but the relationship is **inconsistent in chronic HE** due to inflammation, infection, and variability. Ammonia is not recommended for routine diagnosis or monitoring in chronic HE; clinical assessment remains primary, while very high levels in acute liver failure indicate severe disease and higher risk of cerebral edema.

Introduction

Ammonia appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its role in guiding management is unclear. We aimed to understand the impact of ammonia levels on inpatient HE management, hypothesizing that patients with elevated ammonia levels would receive more aggressive lactulose therapy than patients with normal ammonia or no ammonia level drawn.

Methods

We examined patients with cirrhosis older than 18 years admitted for management of HE from 2005 to 2015. We additionally used propensity matching to control for confounding by the severity of underlying disease. Patients with an ammonia level taken at time of HE diagnosis were further separated into those with normal or elevated ammonia levels. The primary endpoint was the total lactulose (mL) amount (or dose) given in the first 48 hours of HE management.

Results

One thousand two hundred two admissions with HE were identified. Ammonia levels were drawn in 551 (46%) patients; 328 patients (60%) had an abnormal ammonia level (> 72 μmol/L). There were no significant differences in the Child-Pugh score, MELD, or Charlson Comorbidity Index in those with and without ammonia levels drawn. The average total lactulose dose over 48 hours was 167 and 171 mL in the no ammonia vs ammonia groups, respectively (P = 0.42). The average lactulose dose in patients with an elevated ammonia level was 161 mL, identical to the lactulose dose in patients with a normal ammonia level. There was no correlation between lactulose dose and ammonia level (R = 0.0026).

Discussion

Inpatient management of HE with lactulose was not influenced by either the presence or level of ammonia level, suggesting that ammonia levels do not guide therapy in clinical practice.

### The ongoing debate of serum ammonia levels in cirrhosis: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^113inYyR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum ammonia testing in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been long debated in the field of hepatology. Although central to the pathophysiology of HE, serum ammonia testing is fraught with complexities that can lead to challenges in laboratory collection and interpretation. Although there is some disagreement across guideline organizations regarding routine testing of ammonia in HE, all acknowledge that normal values, although possible in HE, may warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a nuanced approach to ammonia testing in HE. Serum ammonia testing provides little additional benefit in clinical scenarios with a high or low pretest probability for HE. However, if the pretest probability for HE is uncertain, a low ammonia level may reduce the posttest probability of HE. In this scenario, other etiologies of altered mental status should be explored. Future research should focus on developing a standardized approach to serum ammonia collection, processing, and interpretation.

### Zonisamide (Zonegran) [^116GXxFX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy:

Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy have been reported with the postmarketing use of zonisamide. Zonisamide treatment inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity, which may cause metabolic acidosis that is associated with an increased risk for developing hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia resulting from zonisamide can also be asymptomatic.

The risks of hyperammonemia and various manifestations of encephalopathy may be increased in patients treated with zonisamide and concomitantly taking other medications that can cause hyperammonemia, including valproic acid or topiramate (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy and this risk may be increased by zonisamide use.

Measure serum ammonia concentration if signs or symptoms (e.g., unexplained change in mental status, vomiting, or lethargy) of encephalopathy occur. Hyperammonemia resulting from zonisamide resolves when zonisamide is discontinued. Hyperammonemia from zonisamide may resolve or decrease in severity with a decrease of the daily dose.

### Severity of organ failure is an independent predictor of intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure [^116URS3X]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Ionized ammonia (NH₃) and partial pressure of the gaseous ammonia (pNH₃) are associated with hepatic encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension in patients with acute liver failure; NH₃ is also believed to contribute to extrahepatic organ failure. We investigated whether the severity of organ failure was associated with intracranial hypertension and evaluated the correlation between NH₃ and pNH₃ and grade of hepatic encephalopathy.

Methods

In 87 patients with acute liver failure admitted to the intensive care unit, we simultaneously evaluated arterial ammonia, pNH₃, clinical grade of hepatic encephalopathy, the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), and evidence of intracranial hypertension.

Results

In comparing patients with intracranial hypertension (n = 37) with patients without intracranial hypertension (n = 50), the highest NH₃ and pNH₃ levels and SOFA scores before onset of intracranial hypertension were independent predictors of intracranial hypertension (P < .001). Among patients with NH₃ levels less than 146 mumol/L, those with intracranial hypertension had a higher SOFA score than those without intracranial hypertension (median, 10 vs 5.5; p = 0.004), despite the patients' similar levels of NH₃. NH₃ (r = 0.68, P < .0001) and pNH₃ (r = 0.78, P < .0001) both correlated with grade of hepatic encephalopathy. However, in multiple regression analysis, only pNH₃ (P < .0001) was shown to be a significant independent parameter for predicting grade of hepatic encephalopathy (P = 0.27).

Conclusions

SOFA score and ammonia levels are independent predictors of intracranial hypertension. In patients with acute liver failure admitted to the intensive care unit, pNH₃ level is a better predictor of clinical grade of hepatic encephalopathy than arterial NH₃ level.

Is there any role of ammonia measurements in HE diagnosis?

It is a common practice to order ammonia levels when patients with a known history of HE get admitted. However, as per the current evidence, there seems to be no role for such practice and should best be avoided. The diagnosis of HE is entertained on the basis of clinical grounds and blood‐ammonia levels offer limited useful information in terms of diagnosis or staging. Elevated ammonia levels have been found in as many as 69% of patients with no signs or symptoms of encephalopathy, making it a nonspecific diagnostic tool. Hence, trending the ammonia to "normal levels" is of limited utility in patients with overt HE (OHE) as the efficacy of treatment is primarily based on clinical improvement alone. This becomes pertinent as the normalization of ammonia levels may lag behind the clinical improvement in HE patients. However, in cases of normal ammonia levels in patients being treated for possible OHE, alternative diagnoses should be explored. Hospitalists should be aware of the fact that some medications can also cause elevations in ammonia levels, for example, sodium valproate, which is independent of HE and can be a source of confusion. In addition, blood sample collection (e.g. using a tourniquet) and processing techniques may as well cause inaccuracies with the ammonia measurements.

### Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of glycerol phenylbutyrate in hepatic encephalopathy [^115Bjxoo]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

HE Hospitalizations

Among patients randomized to GPB, there were fewer patients hospitalized (10% versus 16%), fewer total hospitalizations (13 versus 25), and fewer total hospital days (66 versus 134; Table 2). These differences were not statistically significantly different.

Plasma Ammonia

Baseline fasting plasma ammonia levels were similar in the two study arms, assessed either as mean or the percentage of abnormal values (Table 1). However, during the study, ammonia levels were significantly lower in patients treated with GPB, assessed as TNAUC (46 versus 58 µmol/L*week; P = 0.04) or least-squares mean (38 versus 47 µmol/L; P = 0.002), as were the mean maximum postbaseline values (62 versus 76 µmol/L; P = 0.04). Ammonia values were nonsignificantly higher among patients on rifaximin than patients not on rifaximin, both at baseline (mean = 70 versus 43 µmol/L) and during the study assessed as TNAUC (Table 2). Baseline ammonia was higher among patients who subsequently experienced an HE event on study, as compared to those who did not (Fig. 4). There was a highly significant correlation between the odds of a patient experiencing an HE event and that patient's ammonia level assessed either at baseline (P = 0.01) or during the study (TNAUC; P = 0.01).

Daily Assessments

The percentage of patients with a CHESS score ≥ 3, which generally correlates with a WH score of 2, was significantly lower in the GPB arm both overall (14% versus 31%; P = 0.02) and in patients not using rifaximin at study entry (7% versus 20%; P = 0.02).

### Erythromycin versus neomycin in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis: a randomized double-blind study [^115eQSsp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In relation to applicability, our sample was formed by subjects with more severe HE than in other studies (nine patients with HE grade 2, nine with grade 3 and two with grade 4), which is an important concern in HE trials. The option of using a new drug requires a close observation of these patients and the possibility of antibiotic switch in case of infections. Also of interest are the hospitalization duration as the study endpoint and its correlations with clinical and laboratory variables. Thus, the correlation of the number of in-hospital days with HE grade, IEH, GSC and CRP showed simple clinical aspects that could to estimate the time of HE recovery during which these patients are treated with antibiotics. Since the median in-hospital stay obtained in our trial was 5.6 days, very similar to the value found in an observational North American survey, our results would be reproducible in clinical practice.

The high correlation obtained between CRP levels and the total in-hospital days corroborates the impact of the systemic inflammatory status not only at the moment of hospital arrival, but also as an indicator of HE regression during the treatment with antibiotics. This finding is new and can be used to check the response to the treatment. Another study correlates the CRP levels with encephalopathy occurrence in cirrhotic patients, and many others have described the relevance of inflammation in HE neural physiopathology. Nevertheless, this is the first time that CRP levels are correlated with the hospitalization duration. The role of inflammatory cytokines in affecting the blood–brain barrier and increasing the ammonia diffusion in astrocytes was also well described by other authors. By associating these reports with our findings, we postulate that the CRP reduction must be a clinical target during antibiotic treatment in HE when the values obtained are high.

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^113BQ3jf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hepatic encephalopathy:

- **Definition**: HE is a reversible neuropsychiatric abnormality found in patients with chronic liver disease and/or portosystemic shunting.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of HE is multifactorial and involves agents such as ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, manganese deposition in the basal ganglia, and benzodiazepine-like compounds. Fecal microbiota and aromatic amino acids also play a role.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of hospital admission for HE is approximately 30 cases per 100,000 person-years. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the prevalence of HE is up to 20%.
- **Disease course**: HE is associated with clinical manifestations of neuronal dysfunction (delirium, seizures). If untreated, severe HE may result in brain edema, coma, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital mortality of patients with HE is estimated at 14.1–15.6%. Patients with cirrhosis who develop HE have an estimated 1-year survival probability of 42% and 3-year survival probability of 23%.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^114zUApH]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy, AASLD/EASL 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that increased blood ammonia alone does not add any diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease. Reevaluate patients with a normal value.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113baQqx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of HE may be straightforward when a patient with cirrhosis presents with obvious neurological deficits such as altered consciousness, but it is much more challenging in the presence of more subtle neuropsychological or personality changes that are not uncommon in an outpatient population of cirrhotics (up to 62% in a recent report). In fact, it is recommended to search for minimal HE in patients who complain of cognitive alterations, a disturbed sleep, or are exposed to an accident risk while driving or at their work-place. As neurological deficits associated with minimal HE are clinically subtle, this complication may be underdiagnosed and may negatively impact patients' management. Accordingly, minimal HE can be accessible to medical therapy that may improve quality of life and prevent the development of clinical episodes of overt HE.

In clinical practice, the available tools for the diagnosis of HE include clinical scales to assess the mental status, such as the West-Haven scale, and a number of psychometric tests to assess the presence of congnitive deficits. Neuroradiological imaging is mostly directed at excluding other neurological disorders. Blood ammonia concentration in the context of HE is difficult to interpret, as the correlation between neurological symptoms and ammonia blood levels is variable, with a wide overlap across different stages of HE. Some, but not all studies report a closer correlation with arterial as compared to venous ammonia blood levels. The diagnosis of minimal HE is therefore challenging for the clinician who has to choose between a suboptimal biological test or a number of neuropsychological tests that may be time consuming, need to be adjusted for several parameters, and are subject to learning biases.

To improve the performance of blood ammonia for the diagnosis of minimal HE, we hypothesized that measuring ammonia in arterialized blood following oral glutamine-induced hyperammonemia and consecutive cognitive deterioration would increase the diagnostic yield of this biological test. Therefore, we explored the value of capillary blood ammonia measured at bedside following an oral glutamine challenge to unmask HE in patients with cirrhosis.

### The significance of a high plasma ammonia value [^115C2Zt2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

At a tertiary referral centre, just over 50% of patients with plasma ammonia values over 200 micro mol/l had inborn errors of metabolism. To distinguish artefactual high values from those requiring treatment, the measurement should be repeated immediately if the result is above 200 micro mol/l and at lower concentrations if the patient is encephalopathic.

### Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of glycerol phenylbutyrate in hepatic encephalopathy [^116ej8aD]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) lowers ammonia by providing an alternate pathway to urea for waste nitrogen excretion in the form of phenylacetyl glutamine, which is excreted in urine. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial enrolled 178 patients with cirrhosis, including 59 already taking rifaximin, who had experienced two or more hepatic encephalopathy (HE) events in the previous 6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HE events. Other endpoints included the time to first event, total number of events, HE hospitalizations, symptomatic days, and safety. GPB, at 6 mL orally twice-daily, significantly reduced the proportion of patients who experienced an HE event (21% versus 36%; P = 0.02), time to first event (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; P < 0.05), as well as total events (35 versus 57; P = 0.04), and was associated with fewer HE hospitalizations (13 versus 25; P = 0.06). Among patients not on rifaximin at enrollment, GPB reduced the proportion of patients with an HE event (10% versus 32%; P < 0.01), time to first event (HR = 0.29; P < 0.01), and total events (7 versus 31; P < 0.01). Plasma ammonia was significantly lower in patients on GPB and correlated with HE events when measured either at baseline or during the study. A similar proportion of patients in the GPB (79%) and placebo groups (76%) experienced adverse events. Conclusion: GPB reduced HE events as well as ammonia in patients with cirrhosis and HE and its safety profile was similar to placebo. The findings implicate ammonia in the pathogenesis of HE and suggest that GPB has therapeutic potential in this population. (, NCT00999167). (H2014;59:1073–1083)

### Prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis: a multicenter study [^113RouHF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), in particular in different subgroups, remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of MHE in different subgroups to identify patients at high risk and to pave the way for personalized screening approaches.

Methods

In this study, data of patients recruited at 10 centers across Europe and the United States were analyzed. Only patients without clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy were included. MHE was detected using the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES, cut-off < or ≤ -4 depending on local norms). Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients were assessed and analyzed.

Results

In total, 1,868 patients with cirrhosis with a median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) of 11 were analyzed (Child-Pugh [CP] stages: A 46%, B 42%, and C 12%). In the total cohort, MHE was detected by PHES in 650 patients (35%). After excluding patients with a history of overt hepatic encephalopathy, the prevalence of MHE was 29%. In subgroup analyses, the prevalence of MHE in patients with CP A was low (25%), whereas it was high in CP B or C (42% and 52%). In patients with a MELD score < 10, the prevalence of MHE was only 25%, but it was 48% in patients with a MELD score ≥ 20. Standardized ammonia levels (ammonia level/upper limit of normal of each center) correlated significantly, albeit weakly with PHES (Spearman ρ = -0.16, P < 0.001).

Discussion

The prevalence of MHE in patients with cirrhosis was high but varied substantially between diseases stages. These data may pave the way for more individualized MHE screening approaches.

### Serum ammonia in cirrhosis: clinical impact of hyperammonemia, utility of testing, and national testing trends [^112s1ueE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ammonia is central to the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis. Serum ammonia levels have prognostic value and have been implicated in sarcopenia, hepatotoxicity, and immune dysfunction. Studies indicate that clinicians frequently order serum ammonia levels in decompensated cirrhosis; however, the clinical utility of serum ammonia levels has been questioned, citing challenges in accurate measurement and interpretation. This article involves a primary review of the literature to evaluate the importance of serum ammonia in cirrhosis and examines the clinical utility of serum ammonia levels in the management of HE. In addition to the review, we conducted primary research using national claims data to investigate national trends in practitioner use of serum ammonia.

Methods

We identified all hospitalizations in a national commercial claims database with and without ammonia testing among adults with noncirrhotic chronic liver disease and cirrhosis from January 1, 2007, to September 31, 2015. We calculated the proportion of hospitalizations with ammonia testing and the number of ammonia tests per 1000 hospital-days.

Findings

Proportion of hospitalizations with ammonia testing and ammonia tests per 1000 inpatient-days increased significantly from 2007 to 2015, and particularly in 2014 and 2015, for all groups.

Implications

A review of the literature indicated that elevated serum ammonia contributes to neurotoxicity, sarcopenia, and immune dysfunction in cirrhosis. However, serum ammonia testing has not had consistent benefit in clinical diagnosis or management of HE in cirrhosis. Claims data indicated that ammonia testing increased substantially during the study period, particularly after the advent of electronic medical record systems. The rapid increase in testing may suggest that electronic health records play a crucial role in test volume by facilitating easy ordering and could be leveraged to improved value-based serum ammonia ordering. Serum ammonia levels may also benefit from standardized guidelines on collection, laboratory analysis, and interpretation.

Blood ammonia levels were measured in 40 of 43 cases of Reye's syndrome; the blood ammonia level was elevated in 32 cases. The level of blood ammonia was directly related to the level of consciousness and survival. There was no correlation between subsequent changes in the blood ammonia level and the clinical course. We conclude that ammonia intoxication contributes to the encephalopathy of Reye's syndrome, and, probably, that other factors secondary to hepatic dysfunction are also important. In the presence of encephalopathy, biochemical criteria indicating hepatic dysfunction appear to provide a rational, nonhistologic basis for the diagnosis of Reye's syndrome.

### A prospective, blinded assessment of ammonia testing demonstrates low utility among front-line clinicians [^113SEYzx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although ammonia is essential to the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), its levels cannot diagnose HE, do not correlate with the grade of HE, and are plagued by technical challenges. 1 Nevertheless, ammonia levels are routinely obtained in the evaluation of hospitalized patients. 2 We have advocated for quality improvement to limit testing. 3 However, data are lacking regarding the reasons for, context, and perceived value of ammonia testing among ordering clinicians. Additional data are needed to optimize a quality improvement intervention aiming to curb overuse.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115qC1VQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The current multicenter experience demonstrates that wide variability and lability of serum ammonia levels can confound interpretation, which highlights the unreliability of ammonia as a clinical measure. These results are consistent with American Association for Study of Liver Disease/European Association for the Study of Liver guidelines recommending against using ammonia levels alone for managing HE. This is relevant when ammonia levels are used as the major determinant of trial entry or success/failure. Variation in ammonia levels between sites additionally confounds ammonia level interpretation, particularly because it biases uniformity of the ULN. Correlation with MELD likely reflects hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Interestingly, this variation was reduced but not eliminated even with a detailed protocol for blood draw and analysis, rarely followed in routine clinical practice. Moreover, norms generated using ULN from healthy controls were largely different from those that were followed locally. This further demonstrates the need to restandardize ammonia measurements (as has been encouraged for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio) for research.

We also found a major discordance between frozen-thawed and freshly drawn ammonia samples. This poses a challenge to multicenter trials using central laboratories to analyze flash-frozen samples. These results further suggest that if ammonia levels are to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, local analytic parameters must likely be standardized.

Previous single-center HV studies have demonstrated an increase in ammonia with high protein loads (30 and 60 g), as have single-center studies with glutamine and other amino acids. Our study extends this experience of ammonia lability using a shake with only 20 g of protein, which better replicates a "real-world" experience. This result could inform studies that rely on multiple inpatient and outpatient blood draws to time ammonia sampling with respect to meals.

### Low-value levels: ammonia testing does not improve the outcomes of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116kCx7i]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis. However, many clinicians measure ammonia levels in hospitalized patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy. In this editorial, we review the results of an important study by Haj and Rockey. The authors examined the management decisions effected affected by and outcomes associated with (i) ordering an ammonia level and (ii) knowing the ammonia level. They found that ammonia level determination did not impact affect clinical decision-making or patient outcomes. These persuasive data demonstrate the limited clinical utility of ammonia levels and highlight the need for testing stewardship to dissuade unnecessary use through educational efforts and decision supports.

### Arterial ammonia and clinical risk factors for encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure [^1177T9LH]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

High circulating ammonia concentrations are common in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and are associated with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and intracranial hypertension (ICH). Other risk factors are poorly characterized. We evaluated the relation of the admission arterial ammonia concentration and other clinical variables with the development of HE and ICH. Arterial ammonia was measured on admission to the intensive care unit in 257 patients; 165 had ALF and severe HE, and there were 3 control groups: acute hepatic dysfunction without severe HE (n = 50), chronic liver disease (n = 33), and elective surgery (n = 9). Variables associated with ICH and HE were investigated with regression analysis. Ammonia was higher in ALF patients than controls. An independent risk factor for the development of severe HE and ICH, a level greater than 100 mumol/L predicted the onset of severe HE with 70% accuracy. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was also independently predictive of HE, and its combination with ammonia increased specificity and accuracy. ICH developed in 55% of ALF patients with a level greater than 200 mumol/L, although this threshold failed to identify most cases. After admission, ammonia levels remained high in those developing ICH and fell in those who did not. Youth, a requirement for vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy were additional independent risk factors.

Conclusion

Ammonia is an independent risk factor for the development of both HE and ICH. Additional MELD scoring improved the prediction of HE. Factors other than ammonia also appear important in the pathogenesis of ICH. Ammonia measurements could form part of risk stratification for HE and ICH, identifying patients for ammonia-lowering therapies and invasive monitoring.

### Correlation between systemic inflammatory response syndrome and prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy [^113hy6Kx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A serious complication of LC, overt HE carries an incidence of 30–45%. Importantly, HE is caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress and compromised blood-brain barrier integrity. Hyperammonemia has been reported to be a driver of HE, while SIRS has been considered a key factor in the induction and exacerbation of this condition. However, the relationship between HE and SIRS among LC patients remains unclear. Our findings revealed that SIRS was relatively common in hospitalized patients with LC and HE, with an incidence of 37.3%. The occurrence of SIRS was determined to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality and SIRS score significantly associated with 28-day mortality in LC patients with HE. Furthermore, patients who suffered both SIRS and MELD > 18 or infection were found to have had greater in-hospital mortality rates. However, due to the observational and retrospective design, it is difficult to definitively establish a causal relationship or the precise temporal sequence of events. SIRS could be a direct contributor to mortality, a marker of more severe underlying liver disease or systemic illness, or a consequence of other unmeasured processes that lead to death.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115TUXNb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is related to inflammation and ammonia. Although there is a statistical correlation between ammonia levels and HE grade, the overlap makes their clinical translation difficult. Careful pretrial planning and interpretation of results obtained from trials that depend on standardized ammonia levels requires evaluation of potential confounding factors. Therefore, we examined ammonia levels in cirrhotic patients (CPs) without previous overt HE. We specifically aimed to determine (i) the level and interindividual variability of fasting spot venous ammonia, (ii) impact of a standardized protein meal on the level of spot venous ammonia, and (iii) compare samples analyzed immediately or after flash freezing. We also compared the local reference range for ammonia in healthy volunteers (HVs) using standardized procedures for sampling and processing to each laboratory's routine processes.

Advances in Management of ALF

The medical management of ALF has not been extensively studied and remains poorly defined. In the absence of evidence-based clinical trials, experts from 23 centers in the United States have proposed detailed management guidelines by consensus. Since the last AASLD Position Paper, several noteworthy advances have been made in assessing the risk of developing, and managing, specific complications of ALF.

A detailed analysis of serum ammonia in patients with ALF identified a concentration of 75 μM as an important threshold below which patients rarely develop intracranial hypertension (ICH). Conversely, arterial ammonia levels of > 100 μM on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade hepatic encephalopathy, and a level of > 200 μM predicts ICH. The risk of developing ICH is decreased by raising the serum sodium to 145–155 mEq/L with hypertonic saline. Once established, however, the medical treatment of ICH must bridge patients to liver transplantation, because no treatment permanently reverses cerebral edema. In cases of ICH refractory to osmotic agents (e.g. mannitol and hypertonic saline), therapeutic hypothermia (cooling to a core temperature of 32°C-34°C) has been shown to bridge patients to transplantation, but is associated with a theoretical risk of impairing liver regeneration.

To optimize neurological recovery after ALF, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) must be raised to avoid cerebral underperfusion and anoxia. In hypotensive patients with ALF, intravascular volume should be repleted first with normal saline, and vasopressors should be administered subsequently to titrate the MAP to > 75 mmHg and CPP to 60–80 mmHg. Vasopressin, or its analog, terlipressin, is often added to norepinephrine in critically ill patients who remain hypotensive on norepinephrine, but was reported to increase intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with ALF. More recent data suggest, however, that vasopressin and analogs increase cerebral perfusion without increasing ICP and may be used safely as an adjunct to norepinephrine.

It is generally accepted that patients with ALF have a bleeding diathesis based upon elevation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Concern about the safety of inserting ICP monitors and other invasive devices has prompted the use of recombinant factor VIIa, although the practice has been associated with thrombotic complications in patients with ALF. However, a recent study has suggested that global hemostasis assessed by thromboelastography usually remains normal, suggesting that the perceived bleeding risk based upon INR may be overstated.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112T5iFF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with an impaired liver function caused by end-stage liver disease or liver failure can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Brain function is impaired in HE. Even though the precise underlying pathophysiology of HE is unclear, it is widely accepted that increased amounts of ammonia in the systemic circulation is a key factor. Ammonia is produced during the metabolism of amino acids and other compounds that contain nitrogen and in the intestine by intestinal bacterial flora. Physiologically ammonia is cleared in the liver where it is converted to urea via the urea cycle. Urea is water-soluble and is subsequently excreted via the urine. If this system is somehow compromised, systemic ammonia levels rise, with the potential to cross the blood–brain barrier and cause brain damage. When ammonia levels rise acutely, astrocytes increase the conversion of ammonia into glutamine via glutamine synthase, which causes brain edema. Second, due to the increased glutamine production, there is an increase of reactive oxygen species, which triggers inflammatory cascades. It is hypothesized that, in chronically elevated ammonia, the enzyme glutamine synthase is downregulated, resulting in lower glutamine and higher brain ammonia levels. Ammonia is also directly neurotoxic, enhancing inhibitory signaling through multiple mechanisms, including GABA and glutamate. In patients with liver disease, HE is a predictor of poor outcome, and it is associated with a 1-year mortality of up to 54% and, therefore, a serious complication. Currently, treatment for HE in hepatic failure or portosystemic shunting is directed at reducing ammonia concentrations by reducing production and absorption in the intestines, mainly through the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol, and antibiotics such as rifaximin. However, no universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of HE exist.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^113AvsL7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of advanced liver disease, with up to 30–40% of patients developing this neurological condition as their disease progresses. The phenotype of HE can vary widely from mild cognitive impairment to more serious symptoms such as disorientation and coma. While the etiology of HE is complex, the most prevalent theory of its pathophysiology is the inability of dysfunctional hepatocytes to process enteric neurotoxins that accumulate within the splanchnic circulation, allowing them to enter the systemic circulation, and precipitate cerebral inflammation and cerebral edema.

Due to the elevated pressure within the portal venous system and resultant hepatofugal flow in the cirrhotic liver, extrahepatic collateral blood vessels known as varices form to allow for portal blood return to the vena cavae and the systemic circulation. Porto-hepatic venous collaterals, or intrahepatic shunts, can also form, although efforts to characterize this phenomenon have been sparse –. The presence of these extrahepatic and intrahepatic shunts alters toxin circulation, decreases toxin metabolism in the liver, and contributes to hepatic encephalopathy.

In severe liver disease with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is a therapeutic intervention that can reduce pathologies caused by portal hypertension. With TIPS, a synthetic shunt connects the portal venous system to the hepatic venous system, such that some blood can bypass the cirrhotic liver and reduce portal hypertension and its sequelae. Although TIPS can significantly improve the morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis and increase transplant-free survival, TIPS placement is also a known risk factor for the development of HE and, thus, preexisting HE is a relative contraindication to TIPS placement. TIPS can increase the incidence of HE by 30–55% post-procedure, with 90% of affected patients developing it within the first three months –.

While the association between TIPS placement and HE exacerbation is well-documented, the mechanism is poorly understood. Ammonia level is usually associated with HE, but studies examining ammonia level and HE development are conflicting. The association is highly dependent on the chronicity of hyperammonemia and varies greatly in outcome and thus levels are not typically followed clinically –. Therefore, neurotoxic compounds beyond ammonia likely contribute to HE. Microbial products such as aromatic amino acids and bile acids (BAs) are candidate neurotoxins, but it is still unclear which microbial products or metabolites induce HE onset and how TIPS placement affects the concentration of these compounds within the systemic circulation.

### Clinical impact of arterial ammonia levels in ICU patients with different liver diseases [^1148yWx5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Increased arterial ammonia levels are associated with high mortality in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). Data on the prognostic impact of arterial ammonia is lacking in hypoxic hepatitis (HH) and scarce in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

The patient cohort comprised 72 patients with HH, 43 patients with ALF, 100 patients with liver cirrhosis and 45 patients without evidence for liver disease. Arterial ammonia concentrations were assessed on a daily basis in all patients and the results were compared among these four patient groups and between 28-day survivors and 28-day non-survivors overall and in each group.

Results

Overall 28-day mortality rates in patients with HH, ALF and cirrhosis and in the control group were 54, 30, 49 and 27%, respectively. Peak arterial ammonia levels differed significantly between transplant-free 28-day survivors and non-survivors in the HH and ALF groups (p < 0.01 for both). Multivariate regression identified peak arterial ammonia concentrations as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality or liver transplantation in patients with HH and ALF, respectively (p < 0.01). There was no association between mortality and arterial ammonia in patients with liver cirrhosis and in the control group. Admission arterial ammonia levels were independently linked to hepatic encephalopathy grades 3/4 in patients with HH (p < 0.01), ALF (p < 0.05) and cirrhosis (p < 0.05), respectively.

Conclusions

Elevated arterial ammonia levels indicate a poor prognosis in acute liver injury and are associated with advanced HE in HH, ALF and cirrhosis. Arterial ammonia levels provide additional information in the risk assessment of critically ill patients with liver disease.

### Serum endotoxin and inflammatory mediators in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy [^1156uCxd]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent observations suggest that inflammatory response may be important in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. The aim of the study was to measure arterial ammonia, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-18, and serum endotoxin levels and their correlation with different grades of hepatic encephalopathy.

Methods

120 patients with cirrhosis were enrolled: 20 patients each of cirrhosis with grades I, II, III and IV hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis with and without minimal hepatic encephalopathy and healthy controls were tested for arterial ammonia, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-18 and serum endotoxin levels.

Results

Median arterial ammonia, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-18 and serum endotoxin levels were significantly higher in patient with hepatic encephalopathy and minimal hepatic encephalopathy as compared to patients without minimal hepatic encephalopathy and healthy controls. Arterial ammonia (r = 0.72, p = 0.03), tumour necrosis factor alpha (r = 0.87, p = 0.02), Interleukin-6 (r = 0.50, p = 0.05), Interleukin-18 (r = 0.76, p = 0.02) and serum endotoxin (r = 0.91, p = 0.01) correlated with higher grades of hepatic encephalopathy.

Conclusion

In hepatic encephalopathy arterial ammonia, inflammatory mediators, and serum endotoxin are elevated and correlate with encephalopathy grade.

### Probiotics prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis: a randomized controlled trial [^115CW43h]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced liver disease. Probiotics alter the intestinal microbiota with non-urease-producing organisms that reduce production of ammonia. We investigated the efficacy of probiotics for the primary prophylaxis of HE.

Methods

We conducted a prospective trial at a tertiary care referral institute in New Delhi, India, from January 2012 through March 2013, of patients with cirrhosis without overt HE (age, 48.6 ± 11.1 y; 96 men and 64 women); 25 were Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A, 51 were CTP class B, and 84 were CTP class C. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given probiotics (1 × 10⁸ colony-forming units, 3 times daily; n = 86, 42 with minimal HE) or no test article (control, n = 74; 33 with minimal HE). All subjects underwent psychometric analyses, critical flicker fusion (CFF) threshold assessments, glucose hydrogen breath tests to identify small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and lactulose hydrogen breath tests to measure orocecal transit time (OCTT). The primary end point was the development of overt HE.

Results

At baseline, subjects in each group had comparable CTP score, model for end-stage liver disease scores, CFF assessments, psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores, and OCTT. After a mean follow-up period of 38.6 ± 8.80 weeks for patients given probiotics and 40.3 ± 9.8 weeks for controls, 6 patients given probiotics and 7 controls died (P = 0.81). Three months of probiotic administration significantly reduced levels of arterial ammonia, SIBO, and OCTT; increased psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores; and increased CFF thresholds, compared with baseline. Seven subjects in the probiotic group and 14 controls developed overt HE (P < .05; hazard ratio for controls vs probiotic group, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–6.53). Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores, CTP scores, and SIBO correlated with the development of overt HE.

Conclusions

In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, probiotics were found to be effective in preventing HE in patients with cirrhosis. Trial registration No: CTRI/2012/07/002807.

### Assessment of the spectrum of hepatic encephalopathy: a multicenter study [^117UEheu]. Liver Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major cause of morbidity in cirrhosis. However, its severity assessment is often subjective, which needs to be studied systematically. The aim was to determine how accurately trainee and nontrainee practitioners grade and manage HE patients throughout its severity. We performed a survey study using standardized simulated patient videos at 4 US and 3 Canadian centers. Participants were trainees (gastroenterology/hepatology fellows) and nontrainees (faculty, nurse practitioners, physician assistants). We determined the accuracy of HE severity identification and management options between grades < 2 or ≥ 2 HE and trainees/nontrainees. In total, 108 respondents (62 trainees, 46 nontrainees) were included. For patients with grades < 2 versus ≥ 2 HE, a higher percentage of respondents were better at correctly diagnosing grades ≥ 2 compared with grades < 2 (91% versus 64%; P < 0.001). Specialized cognitive testing was checked significantly more often in grades < 2, whereas more aggressive investigation for precipitating factors was ordered in HE grades > 2. Serum ammonia levels were ordered in almost a third of grade ≥ 2 patients. For trainees and nontrainees, HE grades were identified similarly between groups. Trainees were less likely to order serum ammonia and low-protein diets, more likely to order rifaximin, and more likely to perform a more thorough workup for precipitating factors compared with nontrainee respondents. There was excellent concordance in the classification of grade ≥ 2 HE between nontrainees versus trainees, but lower grades showed discordance. Important differences were seen regarding blood ammonia, specialized testing, and nutritional management between trainees and nontrainees. These results have important implications at the patient level, interpreting multicenter clinical trials, and in the education of practitioners. Liver Transplantation 24 587–594 2018 AASLD.

### Prognostic role of ammonia in patients with cirrhosis [^116YtUCc]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ammonia is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its prognostic role in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the relationship between ammonia levels and severity of HE and its association with organ dysfunction and short-term mortality. We identified 498 patients from two institutions as part of prospective observational studies in patients with cirrhosis. Plasma ammonia levels were measured on admission and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment criteria were used to determine the presence of organ failures. The 28-day patient survival was determined. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify the cutoff points for ammonia values, and multivariable analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The 28-day mortality was 43.4%. Plasma ammonia correlated with severity of HE (P < 0.001), was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (93 [73–121] versus 67 [55–89] µmol/L, P < 0.001), and was an independent predictor of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.009, P < 0.001). An ammonia level of 79.5 µmol/L had sensitivity of 68.1% and specificity of 67.4% for predicting 28-day mortality. An ammonia level of ≥ 79.5 µmol/L was associated with a higher frequency of organ failures (liver [P = 0.004], coagulation [P < 0.001], kidney [P = 0.004], and respiratory [P < 0.001]). Lack of improvement in baseline ammonia at day 5 was associated with high mortality (70.6%). Conclusion: Ammonia level correlates with not only the severity of HE but also the failure of other organs and is an independent risk factor for mortality; lack of improvement in ammonia level is associated with high risk of death, making it an important biomarker and a therapeutic target.

### Blood ammonia levels in liver cirrhosis: a clue for the presence of portosystemic collateral veins [^111Xu1rV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension leads to the formation of portosystemic collateral veins in liver cirrhosis. The resulting shunting is responsible for the development of portosystemic encephalopathy. Although ammonia plays a certain role in determining portosystemic encephalopathy, the venous ammonia level has not been found to correlate with the presence or severity of this entity. So, it has become partially obsolete. Realizing the need for non-invasive markers mirroring the presence of esophageal varices in order to reduce the number of endoscopy screening, we came back to determine whether there was a correlation between blood ammonia concentrations and the detection of portosystemic collateral veins, also evaluating splenomegaly, hypersplenism (thrombocytopenia) and the severity of liver cirrhosis.

Methods

One hundred and fifty three consecutive patients with hepatic cirrhosis of various etiologies were recruited to participate in endoscopic and ultrasonography screening for the presence of portosystemic collaterals mostly esophageal varices, but also portal hypertensive gastropathy and large spontaneous shunts.

Results

Based on Child-Pugh classification, the median level of blood ammonia was 45 mcM/L in 64 patients belonging to class A, 66 mcM/L in 66 patients of class B and 108 mcM/L in 23 patients of class C respectively (p < 0.001). The grade of esophageal varices was concordant with venous ammonia levels (rho 0.43, p < 0.001). The best area under the curve was given by ammonia concentrations, i, e., 0.78, when comparing areas of ammonia levels, platelet count and spleen longitudinal diameter at ultrasonography. Ammonia levels predicted hepatic decompensation and ascites presence (Odds Ratio 1.018, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Identifying cirrhotic patients with high blood ammonia concentrations could be clinically useful, as high levels would lead to suspicion of being in presence of collaterals, in clinical practice of esophageal varices, and pinpoint those patients requiring closer follow-up and endoscopic screening.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis that affects quality of life, increases the risk of accidents, and is an independent predictor of poor outcome. When neurological deficits are subtle but the neurological clinical examination is normal, a condition referred to as minimal HE, patients are exposed to a risk of developing clinical episodes of HE over time. The presence of HE in cirrhosis is a prognostic marker of severity and a valid indication for liver transplantation, although it is not considered in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score on which organ distribution is based in most liver transplant centres.

Neurological alterations observed in HE are postulated to result from the exposure of the brain to abnormally elevated concentrations of ammonia present in the general circulation in response to liver insufficiency and portosystemic collaterals. Accordingly, high ammonia levels have been associated with large portosystemic collaterals such as esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. However, ammonia determination is not currently accepted as a reliable marker to identify patients with HE. Hyperammonemia arises from the production by colonic bacteria and the small intestine through an increased intestinal glutaminase activity. Although the pathogenesis of HE is still incompletely elucidated, the ammonia hypothesis remain central and a large number of experimental data support the role of hyperammonemia in the direct and indirect alterations of brain function that characterize HE.

### Clinical implications of inflammation in patients with cirrhosis [^1179KKFt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY

It is now widely accepted that systemic inflammation, frequently accompanied by infection, acts in synergy with hyperammonemia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Systemic inflammation exacerbates hepatic encephalopathy in animal models and patients with cirrhosis (,–), with the degree of neurocognitive impairment correlating with inflammation levels, and patients with acute liver failure with greater levels of inflammation exhibit a more rapid progression in encephalopathy severity. Furthermore, studies have shown that the SIRS response, and not ammonia level, liver biochemistry nor liver disease severity, correlates with severity of hepatic encephalopathy and also survival.

In brief, circulating proinflammatory cytokines activate cerebral endothelial cells. Circulating immune cells can then adhere to the activated endothelium, be recruited by the brain parenchyma, and result in the activation of microglia and astrocytes. These resident immune cells then produce inflammatory mediators, such as proinflammatory cytokines, propagating neuroinflammation and altering neurotransmission and behavior. Systemic inflammation also disrupts tight junction protein regulation within the blood-brain barrier, increasing permeability. Activated microglia and astrocytes further contribute to blood-brain barrier dysfunction, further propagating this process resulting in clinical features of hepatic encephalopathy.

Increasing evidence also suggests that systemic inflammation resulting in central, or neuro, inflammation may, in part, explain the higher prevalence of depression in cirrhotic patients (18%–58%), compared with the general population (10%). A cohort of patients with depression exhibit systemic immune activation, with increased levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase reactants, similar to that observed in cirrhosis. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of depressed patients, and microglial activation in the brains of depressed patients postmortem, have been demonstrated. Animal models have identified 3 main cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) that facilitate peripheral to central communication in systemic inflammation through 4 pathways — neural mechanisms, cerebral endothelial cells, circumventricular organs, and peripheral immune cell-to-brain signaling. Such signals can then affect all central nervous system fields involved in the pathogenesis of depression and can act directly on the central nervous system cells implicated in depression; astrocytes and microglia.

### Hyperammonemia in the ICU [^111rBMsE]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing acute elevations of ammonia present to the ICU with encephalopathy, which may progress quickly to cerebral herniation. Patient survival requires immediate treatment of intracerebral hypertension and the reduction of ammonia levels. When hyperammonemia is not thought to be the result of liver failure, treatment for an occult disorder of metabolism must begin prior to the confirmation of an etiology. This article reviews ammonia metabolism, the effects of ammonia on the brain, the causes of hyperammonemia, and the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in adult patients.

### Do ammonia levels correlate with hepatic encephalopathy?… [^111L5xag]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver dysfunction is believed to be caused by a failure of the liver to clear toxic products from the stomach. The exact toxins that cause hepatic encephalopathy have not been established, but ammonia may be involved. Many physicians determine ammonia levels to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy and as a guide to treatment. However, studies have shown that the correlation between serum ammonia levels and severity of hepatic encephalopathy is inconsistent. A recent study suggested that the partial pressure of ammonia may correlate more closely with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy than the total plasma ammonia level. Ong and associates evaluated the correlation between plasma ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

They also determined the best of the four types of ammonia measurements for this correlation by comparing arterial total ammonia, venous total ammonia, arterial partial pressure of ammonia, and venous partial pressure of ammonia. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was established when the patients' mental status was altered and other causes of mental status changes had been excluded. After diagnosis, fasting arterial and venous blood samples were obtained, and total ammonia and partial pressure of ammonia were determined.

The 121 patients who were enrolled in the study had the following West Haven Criteria grades: 30 patients had grade zero encephalopathy; 27 patients had grade 1; 23 patients had grade 2; 28 patients had grade 3; and 13 patients had grade 4. All four measurements of ammonia increased with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The arterial total ammonia level had the highest correlation, but it was not statistically significant. Other variables that had a correlation to the severity of hepatic encephalopathy included International Normalized Ratio values, serum creatinine levels, bilirubin levels, and lactulose use. A multivariable ordered logistic regression analysis revealed that only serum ammonia levels and INR values were independently associated with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

The authors conclude that venous total ammonia levels do correlate with severity of hepatic encephalopathy and should be adequate in evaluating patients with this condition. Total arterial ammonia levels and partial pressure of ammonia levels had similar correlation but did not prove to be better markers than venous total ammonia levels.

### Primary versus secondary psychosis in a patient with congenital liver disease [^114udrD4]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling mental disorder that affects 0.5%–1% of the population worldwide that commonly presents in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterised clinically by positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations and thought disorder), negative symptoms (ie, social withdrawal, poverty of speech and anhedonia) and cognitive deficits (ie, attention, working memory and executive function).

Schizophrenia is associated with various neuroanatomical and structural brain abnormalities. For decades, the dopamine hypothesis has been the leading theory used to explain the mechanism of the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia symptoms. Over the past 20 years, however, there has been a confluence of evidence pointing to alterations in excitatory signalling, particularly involving hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), as a key contributor to the schizophrenia disease process.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological disorder that occurs as a result of liver dysfunction, particularly in cases of cirrhosis. Advanced liver disease and portosystemic shunting do not just affect the liver; they notably impact brain function, causing behavioural, cognitive and motor impairments known as portosystemic encephalopathy, now part of HE.

The neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE can include depression, mania, hallucinations and delusions. Many of these neuropsychiatric alterations are the consequence of altered neurotransmission. Hyperammonaemia is a main contributor to the alterations in neurotransmission and neurological functions in HE. However, there exists conflicting evidence regarding its utility in monitoring treatment response and predicting prognosis for patients with HE. It is evident that blood ammonia levels correlate with the severity of HE. Nonetheless, elevated ammonia levels can persist even after clinical resolution of HE. Furthermore, the association between ammonia lowering and clinical treatment response is inconsistent, and ammonia levels are not routinely used for therapeutic monitoring. Recent studies have hinted at a prognostic significance of ammonia in patients with overt HE.

Both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission are altered in animal models of HE. Other models of acute liver failure have noted increased NMDA-displaceable glutamate binding in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

Considering findings that have traced alterations of the same neurotransmitter systems in both schizophrenia and HE, there might be room to consider an association of cirrhosis in causation and exacerbation of schizophrenia in a patient diagnosed with both disorders.

In this case report, we describe the clinical history of a man with chronic liver disease who later developed psychotic illness and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. We illustrate how decompensated cirrhosis was associated with the exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, and we discuss differential diagnostic challenges as well as possible unifying neuropathogenic mechanisms.

### Predictive value of arterial ammonia for complications and outcome in acute liver failure [^115qTjSR]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

In acute liver failure (ALF), the brain is exposed to high levels of ammonia. Human studies defining the clinical significance of ammonia in ALF are lacking. This prospective study evaluated the relationship of arterial ammonia levels at admission to complications and survival among patients with ALF.

Methods

Eighty consecutive ALF patients admitted from March 2001 to December 2003 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had arterial ammonia estimation at admission (enzymatic method). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality.

Results

Forty two (52.5%) patients died. Non-survivors had significantly higher median ammonia levels than survivors (174.7 v 105.0 micromol/l; p < 0.001). An arterial ammonia level of ≥ 124 micromol/l was found to predict mortality with 78.6% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity, and had 77.5% diagnostic accuracy. Patients with higher ammonia levels also developed more complications, including deeper encephalopathy (p = 0.055), cerebral oedema (p = 0.020), need for ventilation (p < 0.001), and seizures (p = 0.006). Logistic regression analysis showed that pH, presence of cerebral oedema, and arterial ammonia at admission were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratios 6.6, 12.6, and 10.9, respectively). Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived: 2.53 + 2.91 ammonia + 2.41 oedema + 1.40 pH, where ammonia is scored as 0 (if < 124 micromol/l) or 1 (if ≥ 124 micromol/l); oedema is scored as 0 (absent) or 1(present); and pH is scored as 1 (if ≤ 7.40) or 0 (if > 7.40). Levels of partial pressure of ammonia were equally correlated with outcome.

Conclusion

Arterial ammonia at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk stratification. Ammonia lowering therapies in patients with ALF should be evaluated.

### Nitric oxide, ammonia, and CRP levels in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy: is there a connection? [^111XgQkD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Goals

Comparison of nitric oxide (NO) levels in cirrhotic patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy (HE), evaluation of possible correlation between HE and other clinical or laboratory characteristics, and estimation of utilization of NO levels in clinical practice.

Background

HE is a neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the presence of HE are not known. However, dysfunction of the NO pathway and ammonia detoxification are thought to play a major role.

Study

Sixty-seven cirrhotic patients, 36 (53.7%) without HE, and 31 (46.3%) with HE were included in the study. Eighteen healthy individuals were used as control group. Clinical and laboratory data, including ammonia and stable end products of NO using Griess reaction, were collected.

Results

NOx levels were statistically significantly higher in cirrhotic patients (225.5 μmol/L) than in control group [(67.94 μmol/L) (P = 0.000)]. NOx levels were, also, statistically significantly higher in patients with HE compared with patients without HE (324.67 μmol/L vs. 141.96 μmol/L, P = 0.000). Significant correlation between the presence of HE and NOx, ammonia, C-reactive protein, albumin, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and Child-Pugh classification revealed. NOx levels also correlated with severity of HE. NOx and ammonia are independent factors predicting HE according to regression analysis. Diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of HE using a combination of NOx and ammonia was superior compared with standalone NOx or ammonia utilization.

Conclusions

NOx levels are correlated with the presence and severity of HE. NOx levels determination, in addition to ammonia levels, could contribute in diagnosis of HE.

Hepatic encephalopathy diagnostic adjuncts — Testing for MHE and CHE could be used in patients who would most benefit from testing, such as those with impaired quality of life or implication on employment or public safety (GRADE II-2, B, 2), and increased blood ammonia alone does not add any diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value for HE in patients with CLD; a normal value calls for diagnostic reevaluation (GRADE II-3, A, 1).

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^1162NBSW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ammonia levels are used to assess hepatic encephalopathy, but their levels are highly variable in clinical practice.

Methods

We studied factors associated with variation in ammonia values in cirrhotic patients without previous hepatic encephalopathy and healthy volunteers (HVs).

Results

Ammonia increased by 12% and 18% at 1 and 2 hour, respectively, after a protein meal in 64 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). In 237 HVs, ammonia levels varied significantly between sites (P < 0.0001). New site-specific ammonia upper limits based on HV levels using a strict analysis protocol differed from routinely used values. Correlation between paired fresh samples was high (r = 0.83) but modest between fresh and frozen samples (r = 0.62).

Discussion

Sample handling, processing, and protein intake impact ammonia levels across sites.

### Acute hepatic encephalopathy: diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery findings, and correlation with plasma ammonia level and clinical outcome [^113v13fL]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In acute hepatic encephalopathy, MR imaging abnormalities have been described in the PVWM, thalami, and corticospinal tracts. We sought to determine characteristic regions of involvement on FLAIR and DWI, to evaluate their reversibility, and to correlate MR imaging extent with clinical severity.

Materials and Methods

Twenty patients who presented clinically with acute hepatic encephalopathy and MR imaging < 21 days after symptom onset were reviewed retrospectively. Two neuroradiologists recorded involved regions on FLAIR and DWI in each, measured ADC values in affected regions and NAWM, and scored the MR imaging severity/extent. The initial severity (West Haven grade), follow-up clinical severity (degree of improvement), and maximal PAL within ± 8 days of MR imaging were recorded and correlated with the MR imaging severity.

Results

On FLAIR and DWI respectively, there were abnormalities in the thalami (85%, 70%), PLIC (75%, 80%), PVWM (80%, 85%), and DBS (70%, 35%) and diffuse cortical involvement (30%, 25%). There were relatively strong significant (P < .005) correlations of FLAIR (r = 0.680, P = 0.001) and DWI severity (r = 0.690, P = 0.001) with PAL, and of PAL with the clinical outcome (r = 0.691, P = 0.001). Both FLAIR (r = 0.592, P = 0.006) and DWI (r = 0.487, P = 0.029) severity correlated moderately with the clinical outcome but were not significant at the P < .005 level after Bonferroni correction.

Conclusions

Patients with acute hepatic encephalopathy may exhibit characteristic regions of involvement on FLAIR with DWI findings that can be reversible. The MR imaging extent on FLAIR and DWI strongly correlates with the maximal PAL, and PAL correlates well with the clinical outcome. Diffuse cortical involvement has a higher potential for neurologic sequelae but can be reversible.

### Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy predicts the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^112WhTtC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

In patients with compensated liver cirrhosis the clinical repercussions of detecting subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (SHE) are unclear. We present a long-term follow-up study in cirrhotic patients to examine the relationship between SHE and subsequent episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy.

Methods

A total of 63 cirrhotic patients were studied by Number Connection Test and auditory evoked potentials. We determined glutamine, ammonia, zinc, glutamate, urea, and ratio of branched chain amino acids to aromatic amino acids, and Child-Pugh classification.

Results

Of 63 patients, 34 (53%) exhibited SHE. Nineteen out of 63 (30%) developed overt hepatic encephalopathy during follow-up. Hepatic encephalopathy in follow-up was related to alcoholic etiology, ammonia, glutamine, zinc, ratio of branched chain amino acids to aromatic amino acids, liver function, presence of esophageal varices, and detection of SHE (84% of patients who exhibited hepatic encephalopathy in follow-up showed SHE). In Cox-regression, glutamine levels, SHE, esophageal varices, and Child-Pugh class were the independent variables related to hepatic encephalopathy in follow-up.

Conclusions

SHE (defined on the basis of number connection test or auditory evoked potentials alteration) could predict a subsequent episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy. Lower glutamine levels, presence of esophageal varices, and liver dysfunction were also related to the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy.

### Magnetic resonance quantification of water and metabolites in the brain of cirrhotics following induced hyperammonaemia [^112Q6MMo]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is now thought to be caused by cerebral oedema although the precise pathogenesis is uncertain. We hypothesised that if ammonia is a key factor, induced hyperammonaemia would lead to transient changes in brain water distribution and metabolite concentration, detectable by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

Methods

Thirteen cirrhotic patients being evaluated for liver transplantation were challenged with 54 g of equal parts of threonine, serine, and glycine. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to exclude structural lesions and localise regions of interest. DTI was used to generate white matter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and proton MRS to measure brain metabolite concentrations before and after the challenge.

Results

The challenge caused a mean (± SD) rise in blood ammonia of 58 (± 41) μmol/L, which was accompanied by a significant 9% increase in ADC (p = 0.004). Increased ADC significantly correlated with blood ammonia (r = 0.58, p = 0.04). The change in ammonia levels also correlated with the increase in glutamine levels (r = 0.78, p = 0.002). Myo-inositol concentration decreased significantly by 0.7 (± 0.7)mMol/L between scans and this correlated with the mean difference in ADC (r = 0.59, p < 0.04).

Conclusions

These results show that ammonia can directly drive changes in brain water distribution as a mechanism for cerebral oedema development. Since cerebral astrocytes contain glutamine synthetase, our MRS data suggest intracerebral formation of glutamine from ammonia. The rapid decrease in myo-inositol indicates that this organic osmolyte plays a protective role in HE by release from astrocytes in order to maintain cell volume.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^1135GjUW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Induced hyperammonemia using either glutamine alone or combined with other amino acids is associated with electroencephalographic, brain magnetic resonance and biochemical alterations, the neuropsychological consequences of which are inconstant, showing either absent, partial or generalized deterioration of tests' performance. In the present study, we observed changes limited to the Trail A and B tests, both commonly used components of standard test battery for the detection of minimal HE, suggesting that visuo-spatial skills and visuo-motor coordination are affected by hyperammonemia. We also explored whether induced hyperammonemia could predict the development of overt HE during follow-up, and found that post test capillary blood ammonia was a poor predictor of events. This is in contradiction with results from the study by Romero-Gomez et al. who reported that an abnormal ammonia response after oral glutamine was predictive of the development of overt HE during follow-up. The distribution of liver disease severity in the 2 studies (Child A patients: 75% versus 17% in our study) and the absence of any treatment for HE that may influence the ammonia response following a glutamine challenge, could explain these differences.

Our study is in line with previous results which showed that determination of blood ammonia levels, either a single venous dosage or in capillary blood after induced hyperammonemia, correlates only poorly with symptoms of HE. Whether determination of ammonia in a arterialized-venous blood, as in our study, shows higher values as compared to venous blood has been proposed but not confirmed in our small subgroup of 8 patients. Thus, additional parameters such as size and extension of portosystemic shunts, hyponatremia, nutritional status, the presence of hepatitis C infection, together with the presence of a systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) that may modulate ammonia neurotoxicity at the cerebral level, are factors that influence the development of HE. We were however not able to examine all these parameters in our cohort, as values of serum creatinine, sodium, and C-reactive protein were available only in a limited number of patients.

### Role of determination of partial pressure of ammonia in cirrhotic patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy [^11118ApZ]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To compare venous, arterial and partial pressure of ammonia (pNH₃) in 27 consecutive cirrhotics with hepatic encephalopathy, 15 cirrhotics without hepatic encephalopathy and nine controls; to reevaluate all parameters after the improvement of encephalopathy.

Methods

Patients were studied by clinical examination and psychometric testing. pNH₃ was calculated from arterial ammonia and pH.

Results

In patients with encephalopathy, each form of ammonia was higher than in both controls and patients without encephalopathy. The correlation with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy was similar for venous (r = 0.72), arterial ammonia (r = 0.76) and pNH₃ (r = 0.75). The sensitivity and specificity of each variable in correctly classifying the patients as having or not having hepatic encephalopathy was also similar. Each form of ammonia decreased after the resolution or amelioration of symptoms. However, even in the 17 patients with complete resolution of hepatic encephalopathy, all three ammonia determinations resulted unchanged or increased in some patients.

Conclusions

Despite the significant correlation between pNH₃ and hepatic encephalopathy, our study suggests that neither pNH₃ nor arterial ammonia are, from a clinical point of view, more useful than venous ammonia: all three determinations being limited both for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and for the clinical management of the patients.

### Serum ammonia use: unnecessary, frequent and costly [^112hyTXn]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

While ammonia plays a role in the complex pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), serum ammonia is unreliable for both diagnosis of, and correlation with, neurological symptoms in patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to quantify ordering, cost and appropriate use of serum ammonia in a major Midwestern healthcare system.

Design/Method

Serum ammonia ordering in adult patients presenting to a large Midwestern health system was evaluated from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019.

Results

Serum ammonia ordering was prevalent, with 20338 tests ordered over 5 years. There were no differences in the number of inappropriate serum ammonia tests per 100000 admissions for chronic liver disease over time (Pearson's correlation coefficient = -0.24, p = 0.70). As a proportion of total ammonia tests ordered, inappropriate tests increased over time (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.91, p = 0.03). Inappropriate ordering was more common at community hospitals compared with the academic medical centre (99.3% vs 87.6%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Despite evidence that serum ammonia levels are unreliable for the diagnosis of HE and are not associated with severity of HE in individuals with cirrhosis, ordering remains prevalent, contributing to waste and potential harm.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115KhUMC]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in critically ill cirrhosis — brain failure characterization and workup should be guided as follows: The West Haven HE criteria and the Glasgow Coma Scale should be used to characterize brain failure, with cutoffs of Grade 3 or 4 HE and Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 indicating severe injury; consider ICU admission for patients with Grades 3 and 4 HE; investigation and treatment of potential precipitating factors and empirical therapy for suspected HE should be performed; workup should include liver-unrelated causes of altered mental status, especially if this is the first episode of confusion or if a patient does not respond to empirical therapy or the precipitating factors are not readily identified; routine brain imaging in patients with presentation similar to prior episodes of HE is not warranted, though brain imaging could be considered for a first episode of altered mental status, seizures or new focal neurological signs, or an unsatisfactory response to therapy; routine ammonia level testing in patients with cirrhosis and altered mental status is not recommended, and a low ammonia level in patients with coma or confusion should point toward etiologies other than HE.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113DgwTw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Capillary blood ammonia and hepatic encephalopathy

At baseline, patients with cirrhosis, with and without minimal HE demonstrated similar capillary blood ammonia values. 60 minutes following glutamine load, there was a trend of higher values in patients with HE as compared to those without HE, but the difference was not significant (183 [45–290] versus 144 [49–264] umol/l, respectively, p = 0.133) (see Figure 4). To further explore the diagnostic accuracy of capillary blood ammonia for minimal HE, ROC curves were constructed and the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was computed. The AUROC for making the diagnosis of minimal HE at baseline was 0.541 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.38–0.7, p = 0.6), while at 60 minutes after the test it was 0.727 (95% CI, 0.58–0.87, p < 0.006) (see Figure 5).

### Ammonia-induced stress response in liver disease progression and hepatic encephalopathy [^113HAQFC]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Ammonia levels are orchestrated by a series of complex interrelated pathways in which the urea cycle has a central role. Liver dysfunction leads to an accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic and is strongly associated with disruption of potassium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxaemia and dysregulation of neurotransmission. Hyperammonaemia is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy and has been strongly associated with liver-related outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and liver failure. In addition to the established role of ammonia as a neurotoxin in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, an increasing number of studies suggest that it can lead to hepatic fibrosis progression, sarcopenia, immune dysfunction and cancer. However, elevated systemic ammonia levels are uncommon in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. A clear causal relationship between ammonia-induced immune dysfunction and risk of infection has not yet been definitively proven. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms by which ammonia produces its diverse deleterious effects and their clinical relevance in liver diseases, the importance of measuring ammonia levels for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and liver failure, and how our knowledge of inter-organ ammonia metabolism is leading to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

### Correlation between ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy [^117XQRfy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because the correlation between ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy remains controversial, we prospectively evaluated the correlation in 121 consecutive patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was based on clinical criteria, and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy was based on the West Haven Criteria for grading of mental status. Arterial and venous blood samples were obtained from each patient. Four types of ammonia measurements were analyzed: arterial and venous total ammonia, and arterial and venous partial pressure of ammonia. Spearman rank correlations (r(s)) were calculated.

Results

Of the 121 patients, 30 (25%) had grade 0 encephalopathy (no signs or symptoms), 27 (22%) had grade 1, 23 (19%) had grade 2, 28 (23%) had grade 3, and 13 (11%) had grade 4 (the most severe signs and symptoms). Each of the four measures of ammonia increased with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy: arterial total ammonia (r(s) = 0.61, P ≤ 0.001), venous total ammonia (r(s) = 0.56, P ≤ 0.001), arterial partial pressure of ammonia (r(s) = 0.55, P ≤ 0.001), and venous partial pressure of ammonia (r(s) = 0.52, P ≤ 0.001).

Conclusion

Ammonia levels correlate with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. Venous sampling is adequate for ammonia measurement. There appears to be no additional advantage of measuring the partial pressure of ammonia compared with total ammonia levels.

### Recognition and treatment of alterations in ammonia metabolism… [^111ZxnRE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

As clinical and experimental knowledge of ammonia metabolism increases, the relationship between increased concentrations of ammonia in the blood and the clinical state of "hepatic coma" becomes apparent. The occurrence of significantly increased concentrations of ammonia in the blood of patients with "hepatic coma" and the clearing of the sensorium that follows a reduction of the blood ammonia concentration both indicate that ammonia intoxication is an important factor in the production of hepatic encephalopathies. Further confirmation of an etiologic role of ammonia in "hepatic coma" is to be found in the fact that this syndrome can be reproduced in both experimental animals and human subjects by increasing the blood ammonia, either by the administration of ammonium salts or by the feeding of high-protein diets or urea. In patients who have had vascular shunting procedures done for portal hypertension, or in patients in whom chronic liver disease is associated with gastrointestinal.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^1172SD8u]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy

Other possible etiologies of global neurologic decline should be investigated (e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, uremia, medications, delirium tremens, hypoactive delirium, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage). Elevated blood ammonia level (found in over 90% of cases) corroborates the clinical diagnosis, but correlation with the actual disease severity is poor. It should also be noted that monitoring blood ammonia levels is inferior to clinical assessment, and it is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Benzodiazepines should be avoided and replaced with haloperidol when chemical restraint is indicated.

The classic protein-restricted diet does not find support in the current literature because most patients do not tolerate high-food/calorie intake. Furthermore, malnutrition is a much more significant concern. Despite ongoing debate, branched amino acid supplementation may also be beneficial. Other adjuncts, such as cathartics and oral antibiotics, are recommended in an attempt to decrease the intestinal production of ammonia due to bacterial overgrowth.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable sugar that causes osmotic diarrhea, has been traditionally used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It acidifies the colon and promotes the conversion of ammonia to ammonium, which is not reabsorbed. Lactulose dosing should be titrated to two to three bowel movements per day. Known side effects of this therapy include electrolyte imbalances, nausea, and bloating.

Rifaximin, a semisynthetic drug derivative of rifampin, was originally employed as a second-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. In 2012, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials stated that rifaximin had similar effectiveness compared to lactulose, with fewer side effects. A more recent, larger meta-analysis has also further supported its use, although the dominant limitation remains its high cost when compared to lactulose.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Euvolemia and electrolyte homeostasis should be maintained under strict clinical and laboratory monitoring. Acute kidney injury in the absence of hemodynamic instability, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or parenchymal renal disease suggests the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Additional diagnostic criteria include no improvement in renal function after volume expansion with albumin and diuretic withdrawal. Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome requires the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, noradrenalin, or midodrine) and albumin infusion. Improved renal function has been demonstrated with medical treatment, but a mortality benefit is only ultimately achieved with liver transplantation. TIPS placement and renal and hepatic replacement therapies can be indicated as bridging strategies.

Statistical analysis

Statistical tests were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation or median value (interquartile range [IQR]) as appropriate. The results of psychometric tests were transformed into Z-scores, which allows to normalize the value to a standard distribution curve. We used the Wilcoxon-signed rank, and chi-squared test as appropriate. To test for blood ammonia changes over time, we used the one way repeated measures ANOVA test with Dunnett's test. We constructed receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves to assess for overall accuracy of capillary blood ammonia levels and to identify optimal cutoffs. To identify independent predictors of development of HE episodes during follow-up, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model. A 2-sided p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Incidence of hepatic encephalopathy during the follow-up

During follow-up, 18 patients, 9 of whom had a past history of overt HE, presented clinical episodes of HE at a median time of 59 days ([50–320]) after the oral glutamine test, 2 patients died of end-stage liver failure, and 3 patients underwent liver transplantation. Precipitating factors of progression to overt HE included excess of diuretics, gastrointestinal bleeding, use of psychoactive drugs and infections in 10 patients, while no precipitant could be identified in the remaining 8 patients.

The following variables were entered into a predictive statistical model for HE: age, MELD score, 60' post glutamine capillary blood ammonia, previous episodes of HE, the hepatic venous pressure gradient, and presence of esophageal varices. In the Cox multivariate regression analysis, only the MELD score (HR 1.122; 95% CI, 1.018–1.236) and previous episodes of HE (HR 3.2; 95% CI, 1.069–9.58), but not capillary blood ammonia, were independent predictor of development of overt HE during follow-up. Using baseline or 30' post test ammonia levels in the model did not modify the results of the analysis.

### Helicobacter pylori, gastric juice, and arterial ammonia levels in patients with cirrhosis [^112Zf7C3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori urease activity is a potential source of ammonia in the stomach of patients with cirrhosis. However, the possible role of H. pylori in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy deserves further investigations. The current study evaluates the relationship among H. pylori infection, gastric juice ammonia concentrations, and arterial ammonia levels in patients with cirrhosis. Overall, 14 patients with cirrhosis with overt hepatic encephalopathy, 19 with subclinical hepatic encephalopathy, and 13 without encephalopathy were enrolled. All patients underwent upper endoscopy, and gastric biopsy specimens were taken for H. pylori assessment (rapid urease test, histology, and culture). A gastric juice sample and an arterial blood sample were obtained for ammonia level assessment. Patients with overt encephalopathy had both higher arterial ammonia levels and a more severe hepatic impairment than the remaining patients, whereas gastric juice ammonia concentrations did not differ among the three groups. H. pylori prevalence was similar among groups. Patients with H. pylori infection had significantly higher gastric juice ammonia concentrations than those without infection (2.3 ± 1.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.6 mmol/L, respectively; p = 0.003); however, no difference in arterial ammonia levels emerged between the two groups (37.7 ± 18.6 vs. 37.6 ± 18.8 micromol/L, respectively). No significant correlation was found between gastric juice ammonia concentrations and arterial ammonia levels. The data suggest that liver impairment remains crucial in ammonia disposal in patients with cirrhosis, whereas H. pylori infection does not seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of hyperammonemia in these patients.

### Hyperammonemia in acetaminophen toxicity [^114Uxcq1]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity can result in hyperammonemia, but it is not clear if elevated ammonia concentrations predict encephalopathy.

Methods

We retrospectively studied patients with acetaminophen toxicity at a liver transplant center over 8years (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2017), who developed hepatotoxicity (AST and/or ALT > 1000IU/L) or hyperammonemia (ammonia > 40µmol/L). We recorded baseline characteristics, laboratory data, documented grade of encephalopathy, and treatments administered. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for varying ammonia concentrations.

Results

A total of 102 patient encounters were included with 75 having ammonia concentrations. On presentation, 40% (30/75) of patients had concentrations greater than 100µmol/L. However, an [ammonia] > 100µmol/L was neither sensitive (46% [95% CI: 26–67%]) nor specific (63% [48–76%]) for encephalopathy. Only an increasing ammonia concentration had a significant, but small (1.53 (95% CI: 1.06–2.20)) positive likelihood ratio for the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

Discussion

Animal models have suggested that in acetaminophen toxicity, encephalopathy may be secondary to an alternative mechanism other than hyperammonemia which may explain the lack of correlation between initial hyperammonemia and encephalopathy in this cohort. Additionally, a lack of empiric treatment for hyperammonemia did not appear to alter the course of any of the patients. None of these patients developed encephalopathy.

Conclusion

In cases of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, ammonia concentrations do not correlate with encephalopathy and empiric treatment for hyperammonemia does not appear to be beneficial.

### Hyperammonemia, bane of the brain [^114amArN]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Ammonia, normally produced from catabolism of amino acids, is a deadly neurotoxin. As such, the concentration of free ammonia in the blood is very tightly regulated and is exceeded by two orders of magnitude by its physiologic derivative, urea. The normal capacity for urea production far exceeds the rate of free ammonia production by protein catabolism under normal circumstances, such that any increase in free blood ammonia concentration is a reflection of either biochemical or pharmacologic impairment of urea cycle function or fairly extensive hepatic damage. Clinical signs of hyperammonemia occur at concentrations > 60 micromol/L and include anorexia, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, somnolence, disorientation, asterixis, cerebral edema, coma, and death; appearance of these findings is generally proportional to free ammonia concentration, is progressive, and is independent of the primary etiology. Causes of hyperammonemia include genetic defects in the urea cycle ("primary") or organic acidemias ("secondary"), as well as genetic or acquired disorders resulting in significant hepatic dysfunction. Thus, because of the neurotoxic implications of hyperammonemia and the typical absence of other specific laboratory abnormalities, appearance of the clinical signs should trigger an emergent search for elevated blood ammonia concentration.

### Pediatric acute liver failure: reexamining key clinical features, current management, and research prospects [^116g8tZj]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the nuances of determining etiology, the need for early aggressive management, and the potential need for emergent LT, patients should be cared for in pediatric LT centers as early in the disease course as possible given the rapidly progressive and unpredictable nature of disease. Patients who are transferred earlier to pediatric transplant centers, before developing hepatic encephalopathy, have better outcomes than those who are transferred later.

Physiology of multiorgan failure in

The natural course of PALF results in either recovery or death. For patients with decompensating and progressive disease, intensive care is imperative. Patients may develop cardiac dysfunction, including peripheral vasodilation with decreased systemic vascular resistance and low mean arterial blood pressure in the setting of hyperdynamic cardiac failure. Respiratory compromise can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of fluid overload, and patients may require endotracheal intubation, especially to protect the airway in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy. Acute kidney injury or even renal failure is also a commonly observed complication among the PALF population and is associated with increased mortality. Kidney injury can be attributed to intrarenal vasoconstriction and decreased renal perfusion as well as drug toxicity, hypovolemia, and sepsis. Renal function typically recovers as hepatic function improves. Patients with PALF require careful monitoring of electrolytes as they are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Persistent hypoglycemia can represent an ominous sign of complete hepatic necrosis, with an inability to maintain euglycemia in the absence of gluconeogenesis. For the most part, maintenance of normal electrolyte ranges is optimal. In the event of increased intracranial pressure, hypernatremia may be indicated, but outside of cerebral complications, normal serum Na levels ought to be maintained.

Although hyperammonemia is involved in the development of hepatic encephalopathy because of its neurotoxic nature, the degree of elevation does not always correlate with the extent of encephalopathy that a patient may exhibit. Careful and frequent neurological assessments are important as the high ammonia level can cause increased intracellular osmolarity in astrocytes, leading to enhanced water diffusion into the cells and ultimately cerebral edema. According to the PALFSG, 55% of children present with hepatic encephalopathy, usually Grade 1 or 2. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy usually require brain imaging to evaluate for any signs of intracranial hemorrhage. It is important to ensure the ammonia level is collected from a free‐flowing blood sample that is quickly placed on ice to reduce the chance of falsely elevated results.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — diagnostic differentiation from other causes: Because HE shares symptoms with concomitant disorders, differentiating HE from other causes can be difficult, and a normal blood ammonia level in a patient suspected of HE calls for consideration; none of the diagnostic measures used at present has been evaluated for their ability to differentiate HE from other causes; psychometric tests detect functional deficits but cannot differentiate causes; brain imaging results for diagnosing HE are disappointing; nevertheless, brain imaging should be done in every patient with chronic liver disease (CLD) and unexplained alteration of brain function to exclude structural lesions; in rare cases, reversibility by flumazenil may be useful.

Although ammonia is involved in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), the use of ammonia levels in clinical practice is problematic. 1–3 For example, in a study of 551 patients with overt HE (OHE) receiving lactulose who had ammonia levels tested, only 60% had an increased ammonia level (defined as > 72 μmol/L). 2 Overall, there was no correlation observed between lactulose dose and whether ammonia levels were obtained (ie, presence/absence of increased ammonia level did not guide therapy), or between time to OHE resolution and ammonia levels. 2 Additionally, there is substantial interlaboratory variability in sample handling and processing, which may affect ammonia measurements. 4.

### Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of glycerol phenylbutyrate in hepatic encephalopathy [^113X6aHe]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

See Editorial on Page 764

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) constitutes a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities ranging from confusion to coma.–It is typically reversible, although patients do not always recover to the original level of function, and it represents a major burden to patients, families, and the health care system.–

The pathophysiology of HE is incompletely understood. Though elevated blood ammonia has long been suspected as important, the evidence is largely correlative, other factors have been postulated, and evidence against ammonia has been reported.–Current treatments, including poorly absorbed disaccharides (e.g. lactulose) and antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin), may act by reducing ammonia production and/or absorption in the intestine, but are not ammonia selective.

Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB; HPN-100; Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc. South San Francisco, CA) is approved for treatment of urea cycle disorders, inherited disorders manifested by hyperammonemia,–and is under development for HE.GPB consists of three molecules of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) joined to glycerol by ester linkage and is an odorless, nearly tasteless sodium-free liquid that acts by providing an alternate pathway for ammonia removal and waste nitrogen excretion in the form of urinary phenylacetyl glutamine (PAGN).–

A 4-week open-label study indicated that 6 mL of GPB given orally twice-daily with food was well tolerated and lowered ammonia in patients with cirrhosis and HE. Therefore, we performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study to test the hypothesis that lowering ammonia using this agent in patients with HE would decrease the likelihood of patients experiencing HE events.

### Correlation between systemic inflammatory response syndrome and prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy [^112S76so]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Infection is the commonest precipitating factor for acute decompensated cirrhosis and correlates with a more severe clinical course. Infection is also a key precipitating factor or HE and SIRS. Systemic inflammation due to infection is common in LC, and the presence of SIRS is a major predictor for HE in such patients. Interestingly, SIRS itself has been suggested to affect brain ammonia levels and exacerbate both HE and liver failure. Liver derived pro-inflammatory cytokines were reported to result in intracranial hypertension and aggravate cerebral edema. In our study, a total of 84 patients suffered infection; SIRS occurred in 63.1% of infected patients with LC and HE. Among all patients, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections were most common. Infection in the setting of SIRS carried greater in-hospital mortality among LC patients with HE. However, patients with SIRS but no manifestation of infection could also lead to death in patients with HE. Inflammation can be triggered by the recognition of distinctive molecules derived from bacteria. In the absence of infection, systemic inflammation could also be activated by intracellular molecules released from injured or dying cells and peripheral inflammation can modify brain signalling and contributes to regulate the onset and severity of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis.

The limitations of our study were as follows: (1) this study was retrospectively designed and thus selection bias was inevitable; (2) this study evaluated a relatively small sample and predominantly evaluated patients with SIRS scores of 1 or 2 and few with SIRS scores of 3 or 4. Several subgroup analyses involved small numbers of patients, which could limit the statistical power and the reliability of the conclusions. The analysis about these groups can be unstable and have wide confidence intervals; (3) this single-center study had no other cohorts available for external validation. The findings' generalizability to other populations with different etiologies of liver cirrhosis, genetic backgrounds, healthcare systems, or management protocols for HE and SIRS was limited. (4) the interventions of SIRS and HE were not standardized. Variations in therapeutic choices could influence outcomes and act as confounders. The subjectivity of HE grading, which relies on clinical interpretation and could vary among physicians.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113Jt7LU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we demonstrated that determination of capillary blood ammonia after a bedside oral glutamine challenge is feasible, well tolerated and superior to basal levels for the diagnosis of minimal HE in patients with cirrhosis and moderate to severe liver failure. The increase in blood ammonia, absent in healthy subjects, correlated imperfectly with the deterioration in psychometric tests. Thus, in spite of a recognized important pathogenic role in HE, blood ammonia, even in a capillary, arterialized vascular bed, remains an approximate marker for the presence of HE. According to our data in unselected patients with cirrhosis, ammonia determination in capillary blood after an oral glutamine challenge is not a valid tool for the diagnosis of HE and a poor predictor of future clinical episodes of HE.

### Persistent hyperammonemia is associated with complications and poor outcomes in patients with acute liver failure [^115z4TDw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients admitted to the hospital with acute liver failure (ALF) and high arterial levels of ammonia are more likely to have complications and poor outcomes than patients with lower levels of ammonia. ALF is a dynamic process; ammonia levels can change over time. We investigated whether early changes (first 3 days after admission) in arterial levels of ammonia were associated with complications and outcomes and identified factors associated with persistent hyperammonemia.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational study that measured arterial ammonia levels each day for 5 days in 295 consecutive patients with ALF. We analyzed associations of changes in ammonia levels during the first 3 days with complications and outcomes.

Results

Patients with persistent arterial hyperammonemia (≥ 122 μmol/L for 3 consecutive days), compared with those with decreasing levels, had lower rates of survival (23% vs 72%; P < .001) and higher percentages of cerebral edema (71% vs 37%; P < .001), infection (67% vs 28%; p = 0.003), and seizures (41% vs 7.7%; P < .001). Patients with persistent hyperammonemia had greater mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 10.7, compared with patients with baseline levels of ammonia ≥ 122 μmol/L (OR, 2.4). Patients with persistent hyperammonemia were more likely to progress to and maintain advanced hepatic encephalopathy than those with decreasing levels. Patients with persistent, mild hyperammonemia (≥ 85 μmol/L for 3 days) were also more likely to have complications or die (P < .001) than patients with serial ammonia levels < 85 μmol/L. Infections (OR, 4.17), renal failure (OR, 2.20), and decreased arterial pH (OR, 0.003) were independent predictors of persistent hyperammonemia.

Conclusions

Patients with ALF and persistent arterial hyperammonemia for 3 days after admission are more likely to develop complications and have greater mortality than patients with decreasing levels or high baseline levels. Infection, renal failure, and decreased arterial pH are independent predictors of persistent hyperammonemia.

### Albumin dialysis improves hepatic encephalopathy and decreases circulating phenolic aromatic amino acids in patients with alcoholic hepatitis And severe liver failure [^113JKMoe]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy frequently complicates both acute liver failure and end-stage chronic liver disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms of hepatic encephalopathy are poorly understood, although alterations in both the cerebral microcirculation and neuronal function associated with an excessive amount of toxic circulating substances not metabolised by the liver have been implicated. High ammonia levels and an imbalance between aromatic and branched amino acids are some of the mechanisms involved. Thus, high levels of phenolic aromatic amino acids (tyrosine and phenylalanine) have been associated with the development of encephalopathy in patients with liver diseases. Moreover, the ratio between branched chain amino acids and phenolic aromatic amino acids has been suggested to correlate with the degree of encephalopathy.

A new 'detoxifying' method, based on albumin dialysis or Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS), has been launched in the past decade. This procedure effectively decreases hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure. However, the mechanisms responsible for this improvement, and their relationship with circulating levels of amino acids, are poorly identified. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the effect of albumin dialysis on hepatic encephalopathy and on the circulating levels of amino acids and ammonia in patients with severe liver failure.

### Ammonia and the neutrophil in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^113NUbX6]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) constitutes a neuropsychiatric syndrome which remains a major clinical problem in patients with cirrhosis. In the severest form of HE, cirrhotic patients may develop varying degrees of confusion and coma. Ammonia has been regarded as the key precipitating factor in HE, and astrocytes have been the most commonly affected cells neuropathologically. Although the evidence base supporting a pivotal role of ammonia is robust, in everyday clinical practice a consistent correlation between the concentration of ammonia in the blood and the manifest symptoms of HE is not observed. More recently the synergistic role of inflammation and infection in modulating the cerebral effects of ammonia has been shown to be important. Furthermore, it has been recognized that infection impairs brain function both in the presence and absence of liver disease. Thus it could be postulated that in the presence of ammonia, the brain is sensitized to a systemic inflammatory stimulus and is able to elicit an inflammatory response involving both proinflammatory and neurotransmitter pathways. Ammonia is not only directly toxic to astrocytes but induces neutrophil dysfunction with the release of reactive oxygen species, which contribute to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. This may further exacerbate the cerebral effects of ammonia and potentially reduce the capacity of the neutrophil to fight microbial attack, thus inducing a vicious circle. This evidence supports the neutrophil in addition to ammonia as being culpable in the pathogenesis of HE, making the neutrophil a target for future anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies in addition to ammonia lowering therapies.

Pediatric acute liver failure — ammonia levels and encephalopathy risk note clinically important thresholds and cautions: Ammonia levels of > 100 µmol/L on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade HE, and a level of > 200 µmol/L is strongly associated with cerebral herniation; medical therapy targeting ammonia reduction is often prescribed; lactulose may be favored over rifaximin given its mechanism of action and shorter time to clinical effect, however no definitive data suggests that either impact clinical outcomes; mechanisms driving HE extend beyond ammonia so reliance upon a singular ammonia value to determine the presence of HE should be avoided, with its measurement supporting the clinical assessment at the bedside.

Laboratory testing — high blood-ammonia levels alone do not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in HE with chronic liver disease (CLD); if a patient with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE is in question. For ammonia-lowering drugs, repeated ammonia measurements may be helpful to test efficacy, but logistical challenges, specimen type differences, and method variability should be considered when interpreting results.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^114PRnPL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhosis. A single determination of ammonia in venous blood correlates poorly with neurological symptoms. Thus, a better biological marker is needed.

Aim

To make a diagnosis of HE, we explored the value of ammonia in capillary blood, an equivalent to arterial blood, measured at bedside following an oral glutamine challenge.

Methods

We included 57 patients (age 56 yrs; M/F: 37/20) with cirrhosis (alcoholic = 42; MELD score 13.8 [7–29], esophageal varices = 38) and previous episodes of HE (n = 19), but without neurological deficits at time of examination, and 13 healthy controls (age 54 yrs). After psychometric tests and capillary (ear lobe) blood ammonia measurements, 20 gr of glutamine was administered orally. Tests were repeated at 60 minutes (+ blood ammonia at 30'). Minimal HE was diagnosed if values were > 1.5 SD in at least 2 psychometric tests. Follow-up lasted 12 months.

Results

The test was well tolerated (nausea = 1; dizziness = 1). Patients showed higher values of capillary blood ammonia over time as compared to controls (0'-30'-60 minutes: 75, 117, 169 versus 52, 59, 78 umol/L, p < 0.05). At baseline, 25 patients (44%) had minimal HE, while 38 patients (67%) met the criteria for HE at 60 minutes (chi2: p < 0.01). For the diagnosis of minimal HE, using the ROC curve analysis, baseline capillary blood ammonia showed an AUC of 0.541 (CI: 0.38–0.7, p = 0.6), while at 60 minutes the AUC was 0.727 (CI: 0.58–0.87, p < 0.006). During follow-up, 18 patients (31%) developed clinical episodes of HE. At multivariate analysis, the MELD score (1.12 [1.018–1.236]), previous episodes of HE (3.2[1.069–9.58]), but not capillary blood ammonia, were independent predictors of event.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis and normal neurological examination, bedside determination of ammonia in capillary blood following oral glutamine load is well tolerated and achieves a better diagnostic performance for minimal HE than basal capillary ammonia levels. However, capillary blood ammonia is a poor predictor of development of clinically overt HE.

### Ammonia levels and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with known chronic liver disease [^114tYJ6x]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ammonia is predominantly generated in the gut by intestinal bacteria and enzymes and detoxified primarily in the liver. Since the 1930s, ammonia has been identified as the principal culprit in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Many physicians utilize serum ammonia to diagnose, assess severity, and determine the resolution of HE in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) despite research showing that ammonia levels are unhelpful in all of these clinical circumstances. HE in patients with CLD is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion that should not be based on ammonia levels.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115fE9cg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Ammonia levels are used to assess hepatic encephalopathy, but their levels are highly variable in clinical practice.

Methods:

We studied factors associated with variation in ammonia values in cirrhotic patients without previous hepatic encephalopathy and healthy volunteers (HVs).

Results:

Ammonia increased by 12% and 18% at 1 and 2 hour, respectively, after a protein meal in 64 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). In 237 HVs, ammonia levels varied significantly between sites (P < 0.0001). New site-specific ammonia upper limits based on HV levels using a strict analysis protocol differed from routinely used values. Correlation between paired fresh samples was high (r = 0.83) but modest between fresh and frozen samples (r = 0.62).

Discussion:

Sample handling, processing, and protein intake impact ammonia levels across sites.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^116dWwkj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Part 1

We enrolled 64 CPs (age 59.8 ± 7.0 years, 58% male, MELD 8.43 ± 2.21) from 3 centers. All patients tolerated the protein load without any signs of HE or confusion during the postmeal period. Baseline fasted venous ammonia levels were 33.71 (SD 13.78; range 18–85) μmol/L, which increased to 37.71 (13.86; 17–80) and 39.82 (15.20; 17–96) μmol/L 1 and 2 hours postmeal, respectively. This represented a 12% and 18% increase relative to baseline (P < 0.001, Figure 1). Interindividual variability was 71% of the total variance (SD = 9.3 μmol/L), whereas intraindividual variability was 29% (SD = 5.9 μmol/L). These changes were independent of age and sex. The MELD score was correlated with ammonia levels at baseline and at all time points with an 8% increase in ammonia levels with every point MELD rise.

The etiology and treatment of HE have historically focused on ammonia homeostasis; however, ammonia levels are not universally predictive of the degree of HE and are not reliable in guiding treatment. In light of this incongruence, additional neurotoxins have been implicated, but no clinically applicable biomarker for HE severity has been validated. In this study, we used the latest methods in untargeted metabolomics with an expanded set of annotations to characterize metabolites implicated in changes post-TIPS that could lead to the development of HE. With further study, these compounds may be used as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for HE. Notably, the methods described herein are not limited to HE; they can be applied in virtually any disease process to identify involved metabolites, which can be investigated as biomarkers or targets for drug discovery.

Untargeted metabolomics allows us to compare metabolites within the peripheral and hepatic circulations before and after TIPS placement. Both peripheral and hepatic veins are important to our analysis. Whereas samples from the hepatic vein, which is much harder to access in patients, inform us of intrahepatic shunting and biochemical transformations that occur in the liver (through our ChemProp analysis), the peripheral vein samples, which are much easier to obtain, can help us determine whether specific metabolomic findings can be used as a potential biomarker of disease activity. In our study, we observed that the metabolome pre- to post-TIPS changes to a greater extent in the peripheral vein compared to the hepatic vein (Fig. 1b, c), and the metabolites contributing the most to these changes are bile acids (Fig. 1d–g and Supplementary Fig. 3). The surprisingly small differences in hepatic vein blood metabolome before and after TIPS suggests that the overall blood metabolome does not drastically change as a result of TIPS. However, participants with the greatest degree of dissimilarity in the pre- to post-TIPS hepatic vein metabolome went on to develop HE (Fig. 2d). The higher degree of metabolome dissimilarity in HE grades 1 and 2+ implicates a functional and perhaps structural difference in participants who developed HE, namely, intrahepatic shunting.

Regarding medical management for acute liver failure, more specifically with respect to management of hepatic encephalopathy, EASL 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining invasive ICP monitoring in a highly selected subgroup of patients progressed to grade 3 or 4 coma, intubated and ventilated, and deemed at high risk of intracranial hypertension based on the presence of > 1 of the following variables:

- young patients with hyperacute or acute presentations,

- ammonia level > 150–200 mcmol/L not dropping with initial treatment interventions (RRT and fluids)

- renal impairment

- vasopressor support (> 0.1 mcg/kg/min).

Introduction

Ammonia is a natural endogenous molecule. In vivo, blood ammonia primarily originates from the catabolism of amino acids and proteins by bacteria in the gut, hydrolysis of urea, and deamidation of amino acids in liver. The produced ammonia is typically metabolized in the liver through catalysis of low-toxic glutamine from NH₄⁺ by glutamine synthetaseor ammonia conversion into urea –. Under normal conditions, the liver maintains blood ammonia (lower than 50 μM in serum) at a low level of dynamic equilibrium. However, upon the metabolic function of hepatocytes decreases, excessive accumulation of ammonia in the liver is resulted, along with a rise in blood ammonia levels. Ammonia accumulation results in inflammatory necrosis of liver cells, even liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Hyperammonemia can further lead to hepatic encephalopathy –, with clinical manifestations including behavioral disorders, and even coma. Ammonia permeates the blood-brain barrier predominantly via passive diffusion in its neutral form (NH₃), while the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) traverses to a lesser extent through potassium transporter-mediated mechanisms –. Astrocytes are the only brain cells capable of metabolizing ammonia; however, excessive ammonia causes astrocyte edema –, which inhibits the possibility of neuronal repair, causing irreversible brain damage. Therefore, targeted ammonia clearance is meaningful for the hepatic encephalopathy therapy.

Ineffective hepatic clearance of excess ammonia in the form of urea, as occurs in urea cycle enzymopathies (UCDs) and in liver failure, leads to increases in circulating and tissue concentrations of glutamine and a positive correlation between brain glutamine and the severity of neurological symptoms. Studies using 1H/13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy reveal increased de novo synthesis of glutamine in the brain in acute liver failure (ALF) but increases of synthesis rates per se do not correlate with either the severity of encephalopathy or brain edema. Skeletal muscle becomes primarily responsible for removal of excess ammonia in liver failure and in UCDs, an adaptation that results from a post-translational induction of the glutamine synthetase (GS) gene. The importance of muscle in ammonia removal in hyperammonemia accounts for the resurgence of interest in maintaining adequate dietary protein and the use of agents aimed at the stimulation of muscle GS. Alternative or additional metabolic and regulatory pathways that impact on brain glutamine homeostasis in hyperammonemia include (i) glutamine deamination by the two isoforms of glutaminase, (ii) glutamine transamination leading to the production of the putative neurotoxin alpha-ketoglutaramate and (iii) alterations of high affinity astrocytic glutamine transporters (SNATs). Findings of reduced expression of the glutamine transporter SNAT-5 (responsible for glutamine clearance from the astrocyte) in ALF raise the possibility of "glutamine trapping" within these cells. Such a trapping mechanism could contribute to cytotoxic brain edema and to the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in this disorder.
