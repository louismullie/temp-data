## Question

pathophysiology in Methotrexate toxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of methotrexate toxicity, integrating mechanism, organ-specific effects, risk factors, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology and why duration of exposure drives toxicity. Then, I should verify the renal mechanisms that create a vicious cycle. Next, I will examine organ-specific toxicities, including hematologic, mucocutaneous, hepatic, pulmonary, and neurotoxicity. After that, I need to consider patient-specific and genetic risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a coherent model and extract practical management principles, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline recommendations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, depleting tetrahydrofolate and disrupting purine and thymidine synthesis, thereby impairing DNA replication and repair in rapidly dividing cells; critically, toxicity correlates more with the duration of exposure than with peak serum levels, which explains why delayed clearance is so dangerous [^114YiBUF].

> Wait, let me verify the renal pathophysiology because it is the pivot. High-dose methotrexate and its metabolite 7-hydroxy-methotrexate can precipitate in acidic tubular fluid, causing intratubular obstruction, direct tubular injury, and arteriolar vasoconstriction; this AKI further reduces clearance, creating a vicious cycle of prolonged exposure and escalating systemic toxicity, including myelosuppression and mucositis [^114YiBUF] [^111nUVrz]. I should also confirm that emerging data implicate ferroptosis via glutathione depletion and iron-driven lipid peroxidation in renal tubular cells, which mechanistically links oxidative stress to nephrotoxicity and delayed elimination [^113XtMX4].

> Hold on, I should verify the hematologic consequences next. Prolonged exposure suppresses hematopoiesis via folate pathway blockade, producing pancytopenia and especially neutropenia that predisposes to sepsis; importantly, serum MTX levels often do not correlate with the severity of cytopenias, so clinical vigilance and early folinic acid rescue are essential when toxicity is suspected [^114sAgFA] [^113QpjVR].

> Let me consider mucocutaneous toxicity. Rapidly dividing gastrointestinal epithelium and skin are early targets, leading to mucositis, stomatitis, and dermatitis; in psoriasis, the high keratinocyte turnover renders plaques uniquely vulnerable to ulceration, which can be an early herald of systemic toxicity and warrants immediate evaluation for myelosuppression [^113sqaEN] [^111VxNjf].

> I need to check hepatic mechanisms. Chronic hepatotoxicity reflects cumulative injury with fibrosis and cirrhosis in susceptible hosts, particularly those with NAFLD, diabetes, obesity, alcohol use, or viral hepatitis; acute enzyme elevations are often transient but require careful monitoring and dose interruption, with biopsy reserved for persistent abnormalities or high-risk contexts [^113fA4Bc] [^112ie2D9] [^111WeS1S].

> Next, I should review pulmonary toxicity. Methotrexate pneumonitis is a hypersensitivity interstitial pneumonitis that can be acute and potentially fatal; it is not prevented by folic acid, and symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, and fever mandate prompt drug cessation and evaluation, with risk unrelated to cumulative dose in many cases [^111rRjHp] [^115tTXEe].

> I will now examine neurotoxicity, which is multifactorial. Direct folate pathway disruption in CNS tissues, homocysteine-mediated endothelial injury, and NMDA receptor excitotoxicity contribute to stroke-like syndromes, leukoencephalopathy, and cognitive deficits; diffusion-weighted MRI often shows reversible cytotoxic edema, and dextromethorphan, an NMDA antagonist, has supportive but still limited evidence for mitigation in subacute presentations [^114wg9Cc] [^113g6GNo] [^111RQFM3].

> But wait, what about patient-specific modifiers that amplify risk. Renal impairment is paramount, and even low-dose MTX can cause life-threatening toxicity in CKD; third-space effusions prolong exposure, older age increases vulnerability, and folate deficiency worsens antifolate effects; drug interactions via renal tubular secretion competition (for example, NSAIDs, penicillins, PPIs) and protein binding displacement can raise free MTX and precipitate toxicity, so I should double-check the medication list and renal function before each dose [^116xnY8Y] [^114ax7eF] [^112kRP3z] [^112cYzgz].

> Let me think about genetic susceptibility. Polymorphisms in MTHFR, SLC19A1, ABCB1, ABCG2, and TYMS can alter folate metabolism, transport, and intracellular polyglutamation, thereby modifying both efficacy and toxicity; while not yet routine in clinic, these variants help explain interpatient variability and may guide future precision dosing [^113VuWyL] [^111DLh8U] [^115wV8pG].

> I should confirm the dose-context distinction. High-dose regimens carry immediate risks of AKI, delayed elimination, and cascading systemic toxicity, whereas low-dose weekly therapy carries cumulative risks such as hepatotoxicity and, in vulnerable patients, severe myelosuppression; importantly, acute oral overdoses are often benign due to saturable absorption, but toxicity can still occur with staggered ingestion or renal failure, so I must not falsely reassure in those scenarios [^114kQDzy] [^116E82NC] [^114sAgFA].

> Next, I should review management principles tied to pathophysiology. Early recognition of delayed elimination with serial MTX levels, aggressive hydration with urinary alkalinization, high-dose leucovorin rescue, and timely glucarpidase when thresholds are exceeded are critical; for neurotoxicity, supportive care and consideration of dextromethorphan may help, and for mucositis, infection prophylaxis and oral care are essential; for chronic hepatotoxicity risk, structured monitoring and risk-factor modification are key [^113CRyTe] [^114p9mNf] [^111RQFM3] [^111WeS1S].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical thresholds I am using. NCCN guidance supports glucarpidase when MTX levels are greater than 30 μM at 36 hours, greater than 10 μM at 42 hours, or greater than 5 μM at 48 hours in the setting of AKI or delayed clearance, ideally within 48–60 hours of infusion start; leucovorin should continue for at least 2 days after glucarpidase and be separated by 2 hours to avoid inactivation, which I need to ensure is followed precisely [^113CRyTe] [^114p9mNf].

> Let me reconsider the overarching model to ensure coherence. Methotrexate toxicity is best viewed as a pharmacokinetic-toxicodynamic loop: impaired clearance increases exposure duration, which deepens folate pathway inhibition in proliferating tissues, producing organ-specific injury; renal mechanisms are central, and patient-specific factors determine who tips into clinically significant toxicity at a given dose, explaining why identical exposures can have divergent outcomes [^114kQDzy] [^111nUVrz].

> Finally, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with clinical guidance. The emphasis on duration of exposure, renal function, early folinic acid rescue, and risk-stratified monitoring is consistent with oncology and rheumatology guidelines, and the mechanistic links to ferroptosis, homocysteine/NMDA signaling, and genetic variability provide a rational foundation for prevention, early detection, and targeted interventions in high-risk patients [^113CRyTe] [^111WeS1S] [^113XtMX4] [^114wg9Cc].

Methotrexate toxicity arises from **DHFR inhibition** and folate depletion, disrupting DNA synthesis and repair in rapidly dividing tissues. Key mechanisms include **impaired renal clearance** from tubular precipitation and direct nephrotoxicity [^114kQDzy], leading to prolonged exposure and systemic toxicity [^114YiBUF]. Additional contributors include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and homocysteine accumulation with NMDA receptor excitotoxicity [^114YiBUF] [^111RQFM3]. Risk increases with renal impairment, drug interactions, and genetic polymorphisms in folate pathways [^113VuWyL] [^112cYzgz]. Clinical manifestations include myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and pulmonary injury [^115tTXEe] [^11665qni].

---

## Primary mechanism: inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)

- **DHFR inhibition**: Methotrexate competitively inhibits DHFR, blocking conversion of DHF to THF and depleting folate cofactors required for thymidine and purine synthesis [^114YiBUF].

- **DNA synthesis disruption**: This impairs DNA replication and repair, particularly in rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, GI mucosa, skin, hair follicles) [^111YHbSp].

- **Polyglutamation**: Intracellular polyglutamation prolongs MTX retention and DHFR inhibition, amplifying toxicity [^112KURf3].

---

## Renal clearance impairment and nephrotoxicity

- **Renal excretion**: MTX is primarily renally excreted; impaired function increases exposure and toxicity [^112cYzgz].

- **Tubular precipitation**: MTX and metabolites can precipitate in renal tubules, causing obstruction, tubular injury, and AKI [^111nUVrz].

- **Direct nephrotoxicity**: MTX can cause direct tubular injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, worsening renal impairment and systemic toxicity [^114YiBUF].

---

## Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction

Oxidative stress occurs because MTX-induced folate depletion increases **reactive oxygen species**, causing cellular damage and apoptosis [^notfound]. Mitochondrial dysfunction follows, with impaired function and apoptosis contributing to **organ-specific toxicity** [^114YiBUF].

---

## Homocysteine accumulation and excitotoxicity

Homocysteine elevation results from folate pathway disruption and is **neurotoxic** [^114wg9Cc]. NMDA receptor excitotoxicity occurs when homocysteine and its metabolites activate NMDA receptors, causing neuronal injury and neurotoxicity [^111RQFM3].

---

## Risk factors for methotrexate toxicity

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced clearance increases exposure and toxicity [^112cYzgz].

- **Drug interactions**: NSAIDs, PPIs, and other drugs that impair renal function or compete for clearance increase toxicity [^112kRP3z].

- **Genetic polymorphisms**: Variants in MTHFR, SLCO1B1, and ABCC2 affect MTX metabolism and toxicity risk [^notfound].

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older age, diabetes, and liver disease increase risk [^111WeS1S].

---

## Management strategies

- **Hydration and alkalinization**: Prevent renal precipitation and enhance clearance [^111nUVrz].

- **Leucovorin rescue**: Counteracts folate depletion and reduces toxicity [^114iZXfG].

- **Glucarpidase**: Rapidly degrades MTX in cases of delayed clearance or renal failure [^114p9mNf].

- **Supportive care**: Manage complications and monitor organ function [^115tTXEe].

---

Methotrexate toxicity reflects a **multifactorial process** driven by DHFR inhibition, impaired renal clearance, oxidative stress, and homocysteine excitotoxicity, with risk modulated by renal function, drug interactions, and genetics; **management centers on hydration, alkalinization, leucovorin rescue, and glucarpidase** when indicated [^113CRyTe].

### Advances in individual prediction of methotrexate toxicity: a review [^113VuWyL]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

As the cure rates for haematological malignancies have improved, the exploration of the balance between efficacy and side effects has become a major research target. The antifolate methotrexate is widely used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. Even when given identical methotrexate doses, patients vary significantly in their response and pattern of toxicities. This diversity can, to some extent, be linked to sequence variations in genes involved in drug absorption, metabolism, excretion, cellular transport, and effector targets or target pathways. In the coming years pharmacogenomics is expected to change our approaches to individualised therapy with methotrexate. However, genetic polymorphisms affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of all the drugs a patient receive as well as the normal tissues tolerance to a given drug exposure. Thus, although high-throughput techniques will allow mapping of tens of thousands of genetic polymorphisms in one run, it will be a major challenge to dissect out which of these have the strongest impact on efficacy and toxicity and hence should be the targets for intervention. This paper discusses the pharmacology of methotrexate and reviews studies on haematological malignancies that have attempted to predict the risk of toxicity by specific clinical or genetic features.

### High-dose methotrexate nephrotoxicity [^114kQDzy]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite anticancer agent that has been used at doses ranging from 20 mg/m2 of body surface area to 33,000 mg/m2. High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), defined as doses higher than 500 mg/m2, is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, osteosarcoma, brain cancers, leptomeningeal spread of carcinomas, and other cancers. Depending on the dose and other factors, acute kidney injury occurs in 2% to 39% of HDMTX courses and severe (Acute Kidney Injury Network: AKIN grade 2 or higher) nephrotoxicity in approximately 2%, though incidence varies widely. Prompt recognition and treatment of delayed MTX elimination and renal dysfunction which includes increased hydration, high dose leucovorin, and sometimes glucarpidase, is crucial to prevent life-threatening toxicities such as myelosuppression, mucositis, renal failure and dermatitis.

Summary

In this article, we emphasize the importance of MTX pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, highlight the cellular mechanisms of MTX anti-cancer activity, review the pathophysiology of MTX-induced renal injury, and explore strategies to prevent and manage MTX nephrotoxicity.

Key Messages

Prompt recognition and effective treatment of renal and non-renal toxicities of high-dose methotrexate can improve outcomes, cancer prognosis and survival.

This article focuses on the cellular, biochemical, and molecular pharmacology of antifolates and how a basic understanding of the mechanism of action of methotrexate, its cytotoxic determinants, mechanisms of resistance, and transport into and out of cells has led to the development of a new generation of antifolates, a process that continues in the laboratory and in the clinics. New approaches to folate-based cancer chemotherapy are described based on the targeted delivery of drugs to malignant cells.

### Busting the myth of methotrexate chronic hepatotoxicity [^113fA4Bc]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Methotrexate is a key component of the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases and the mainstay of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. Hepatotoxicity has long been a concern for prescribers envisaging long-term treatment with methotrexate for their patients. However, the putative liver toxicity of methotrexate should be evaluated in the context of advances in our knowledge of the pathogenesis and natural history of liver disease, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Notably, patients with NAFLD are at increased risk for methotrexate hepatotoxicity, and methotrexate can worsen the course of NAFLD. Understanding the mechanisms of acute hepatotoxicity can facilitate the interpretation of elevated concentrations of liver enzymes in this context. Liver fibrosis and the mechanisms of fibrogenesis also need to be considered in relation to chronic exposure to methotrexate. A number of non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis are available for use in patients with rheumatic disease, in addition to liver biopsy, which can be appropriate for particular individuals. On the basis of the available evidence, practical suggestions for pretreatment screening and long-term monitoring of methotrexate therapy can be made for patients who have (or are at risk for) chronic liver disease.

### The genetic architecture of methotrexate toxicity is similar in drosophila melanogaster and humans [^114UEjJx]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

It is clear from this study that Drosophila is a powerful model system for identifying genetic variants underlying traits of human interest. In addition to showing a similar genetic basis for MTX toxicity between humans and Drosophila, we were able to identify one novel MTX toxicity human target gene, GPx. Given it is currently unclear how this gene fits into the pharmacodynamic and/or the pharmacokinetic pathway of the drug (Figure 2), an exciting avenue for future research is confirming the role of this gene in human MTX toxicity and characterizing its role in the pathway.

### How does methotrexate suppress inflammation? [^113qSmsv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methotrexate remains the most widely used agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Although introduced as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of malignancies, it is clear that, in the doses used, the mechanism of action in the suppression of inflammation differs from simply suppression of purine and pyrimidine metabolism, resulting in inhibition of proliferation. Here we review the proposed mechanisms of action of methotrexate.

Methotrexate is established as an effective treatment for inducing remission or preventing relapse in Crohn's disease. This review discusses the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics and clinical trials as well as considering the comparative efficacy between thiopurines and methotrexate. Comparisons are made with the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Its role in ulcerative colitis and potential toxicity are addressed. At present, the role of methotrexate is in the treatment of active or relapsing Crohn's disease for patients who are refractory to, or intolerant of, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^1125D2e5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Based on published reports and methotrexate's mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In pregnant women with non-malignant disease, Otrexup is contraindicated. Consider the benefits and risks of Otrexup and risks to the fetus when prescribing Otrexup to a pregnant patient. There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

### Low-dose methotrexate-induced ulcerated psoriatic plaques: a rare case [^112xhhRE]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low-dose methotrexate is an effective and safe management for extensive and severe psoriasis. It may cause adverse reactions ranging from trivial to life threatening. Among them, hepatotoxicity and pancytopenia are the common serious side effects, whereas painful ulceration of psoriatic plaques as an early cutaneous manifestation of low-dose methotrexate toxicity has rarely been reported. Here, we describe a case of psoriatic plaque ulceration induced by low-dose methotrexate and highlight the risk factors and possible mechanisms of toxicity.

### Fatal methotrexate toxicity: could it have been avoided? [^114mt8PZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate is used judiciously, only when specifically indicated. However, in this case the patient had a fatal outcome after only three doses. A young nulliparous woman diagnosed as having high-risk persistent trophoblastic disease was considered for multidrug chemotherapy. However, because of persistent low-grade fever it was decided to give only single agent, methotrexate. She developed severe toxicity which proved fatal, even before the first course could be completed. Analysing causes of this rare, unexpected outcome of methotrexate administration, suggested that estimation of serum levels can be a useful tool in monitoring patients showing hypersensitivity but this facility is rarely available especially in low-resource countries. Pharmacogenetical analysis of blood/tissue sample may be useful to help in identifying patients likely to show hypersensitivity reaction.

In pregnant women with non-malignant disease, XATMEP is contraindicated. Consider the benefits and risks of XATMEP and risks to the fetus when prescribing XATMEP to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic disease. There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies.

### The genetic architecture of methotrexate toxicity is similar in drosophila melanogaster and humans [^112tNBDf]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is among the many chemotherapeutic medications prescribed to patients that have been shown to be very toxic. MTX is an antifoltate drug used primarily to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. Its toxicity includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; central nervous system toxicity; hepatitis with increased transaminase levels; serious or life-threatening skin reactions; and decrease in the activity of the patient's immune system. Although MTX is effective in the treatment of some patients, for others, its toxicity is unbearable, and patients often are forced to change the dose or switch to a different drug; in the meantime, the disease progresses. This difference in a patient's ability to tolerate such toxic medications has often been attributed to environmental factors such as diet, medical history, and age. However, these factors do not explain all of the underlying toxicity, and there is strong evidence that, alternatively, genes in concert with the environment govern toxicity. Although it is desirable to study the underlying genetic architecture of MTX's toxicity, doing so in humans is difficult. Chemotherapy dosing often is personalized, a patient can be taking several medications, and interindividual variation in environmental factors such as age, weight, and diet makes genetic characterization of toxicity challenging.

We have previously shown that there is a strong genetic component to MTX toxicity, as quantified by the reduction in fecundity after a 3-d MTX treatment regime, in female Drosophila melanogaster. In female D. melanogaster treated orally with MTX, the observed reduction in fecundity is proportional to drug concentration and treatment length and is therefore an objective and quantitative way to measure chemotoxicity. It is not surprising that MTX affects the reproductive ability of D. melanogaster because MTX competitively inhibits difolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is needed for DNA synthesis during cell replication; therefore, MTX inhibits cell division required for reproduction of both humans and flies. With D. melanogaster, it is also possible to standardize the environment and hence maximize the power of an experiment to identify genetic factors underlying the toxicity phenotype. We have previously shown the reduction in fecundity after MTX exposure has a high heritability (99%;), suggesting it is possible to identify specific genes underlying the MTX toxicity in D. melanogaster and their human orthologs.

### Renal clearance and intracellular half-life essentially determine methotrexate toxicity: a case series [^1123Wjk6]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antirheumatic drug used worldwide in many indications of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity including psoriasis. In principle, it is safe if monitored carefully and has major cost-effective therapeutic benefits. Major adverse events for MTX are related to the folate antagonism and primarily affect highly proliferative tissues such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa. Life-threatening myelosuppression leading to sepsis with potential fatal outcome is the most serious complication of MTX treatment that may occur despite regular dose administration. By analyzing 3 cases of myelosuppression during low-dose MTX treatment with mucocutaneous manifestations, we find that impaired renal elimination to be the leading cause of MTX toxicity and identify the different durations of plasma and intracellular half-lives of MTX as the main reason for bone marrow suppression in spite of normal MTX trough levels.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^113nfw1y]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on published reports, and methotrexate's mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In pregnant women with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, Rasuvo is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Published data from cases, literature reviews, and observational studies report that methotrexate exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death. Methotrexate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and multiple adverse developmental outcomes, including skull anomalies, facial dysmorphism, central nervous system abnormalities, limb abnormalities, and sometimes cardiac anomalies and intellectual impairment. Adverse outcomes associated with exposure during second and third trimesters of pregnancy include intrauterine growth restriction and functional abnormalities. Because methotrexate is widely distributed and persists in the body for a prolonged period, there is a potential risk to the fetus from preconception methotrexate exposure.

A prospective multicenter study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in women taking methotrexate less than or equal to 30 mg/week after conception. The rate of miscarriage in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate was 42.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29.2–58.7), which was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (22.5%, 95% CI 16.8–29.7) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (17.3%, 95% CI 13–22.8). Of the live births, the rate of major birth defects in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate after conception was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8 [95% CI 0.6–5.7]) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (adjusted OR 3.1 [95% CI 1.03–9.5]) (2.9%). Major birth defects associated with pregnancies exposed to methotrexate after conception were not always consistent with methotrexate-associated adverse developmental outcomes.

### After 75 Years of methotrexate, can treatment results Be improved with appropriate folinic acid rescue? [^114iZXfG]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

After 75 years of clinical use of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, relevant pharmacological data currently important for the effective and safe use of methotrexate were reviewed to see if it is possible to improve outcomes. Specifically, to improve how high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) can be given safely, what doses of MTX (methotrexate) are adequate to achieve therapeutic levels, and what is the appropriate folinic acid (FA) dose for effective rescue. This review is based on 50 years of personal experience with the use of HD-MTX in published literature. Many pharmacologic studies were performed over 50 years ago, but are still relevant and stand up to scrutiny today. What should be considered HD-MTX and how it can be given safely and effectively without late toxicity are presented. The variables responsible for effective folinic acid rescue, especially the doses of MTX and folinic acid and the time to start of rescue, are discussed. Understanding these highlighted aspects of therapy could help to prevent acute toxicity, improve treatment results, and prevent late effects.

Methotrexate toxicity and monitoring describe common early toxicities of fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and stomatitis; mitigation includes altering dose, route, or dosing frequency (eg, from single weekly dose to three divided doses over 24-hour period) and taking with food; because treatment may increase the risk of infection and reactivation of latent tuberculosis, hepatitis, and lymphoma, regular laboratory monitoring and vigilance are emphasized, and hepatitis B and C screening and baseline tuberculosis testing should be considered depending on individual risk; a systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 studies reported 504 respiratory events among 1630 participants, found no significant increase in respiratory or noninfectious respiratory events with methotrexate (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90–1.17), and noted no pulmonary deaths.

### Metabolomic profiling reveals the mechanisms underlying the nephrotoxicity of methotrexate in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113XtMX4]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Methotrexate is widely recommended as a first-line treatment for the intensive systemic and consolidation phases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity is a severe adverse reaction, of which the mechanisms remain unclear.

Methods

An untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with delayed methotrexate excretion, with or without acute kidney injury, was performed to identify altered metabolites and metabolic pathways. An independent external validation cohort and in vitro HK-2 cell assays further verified the candidate metabolites, and explored the mechanisms underlying the nephrotoxicity of methotrexate.

Results

Four metabolites showed significant differences between normal excretion and delayed excretion, seven metabolites reflected the differences between groups with or without acute kidney injury, and six pathways were finally enriched. In particular, oxidized glutathione was confirmed as a candidate metabolite involved in the toxicity of methotrexate. We further explored the role of glutathione deprivation-induced ferroptosis on methotrexate cytotoxicity, and it was found that methotrexate overload significantly reduced cell viability, triggered reactive oxygen species and intracellular Fe 2+ accumulation, and altered the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins in HK-2 cells. These methotrexate-induced changes were alleviated or reversed by the administration of a ferroptosis inhibitor, further suggesting that ferroptosis promoted methotrexate-induced cytotoxicity in HK-2 cells.

Conclusions

Our findings revealed complex metabolomic profiles and provided novel insights into the mechanism by which ferroptosis contributes to the nephrotoxic effects of methotrexate.

### Methotrexate in dermatology [^113Yn8JB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folic acid analog pioneered for use in inflammatory diseases by dermatologists, and used successfully for over 40 years for a wide variety of cutaneous diseases. In addition to its antiproliferative properties, methotrexate has other more recently recognized anti-inflammatory properties related to its effects on adenosine. Further research concerning its mechanism of action and genetic enzymatic variations suggest future possibilities for maximizing therapy and predicting adverse events. In this review the present authors will explore methotrexate's pharmacokinetics, mode of administration, dosing guidelines, side effect profile, and medication interactions. In addition, the present authors hope to offer practical guidelines for dose initiation and adjustment, and to summarize new research on its mechanism of action and implications for future therapy.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^115xpGux]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

This study was driven by the lack of published evidence on the importance of MTX dose and route of administration on both its efficacy and various types of adverse events. We aimed to thoroughly document our clinical practice based on the treat-to-target approach in order to prove the concept that better therapeutic effect achieved with the higher dose of parenteral MTX is associated with clinically acceptable adverse effects comparable to those reported in published series using oral treatment.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^113oxUtB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: MTX-related toxicity in children is sparse, particularly isolated mucocutaneous manifestations. Underlying psoriasis may contribute to exaggerated cutaneous response - psoriatic plaques have rapid keratinocyte turnover, altered epidermal barrier function and local immune activation, which may enhance MTX uptake. Pediatric patients (Vs adults) have differing folate metabolism, and potentially greater MTX sensitivity, which may predispose to atypical toxicity patterns. Absence of marked laboratory abnormalities underscores importance of early clinical signs. Research on the physiopathology behind MTX toxicity in pediatrics is needed. This case raises broader questions about MTX's interaction with inflamed tissues, relevant in rheumatology. Consent to published had been obtained.

### Acute therapy-related toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113rM5fg]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The improved overall survival (OS) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeds today's 90% with the best contemporary treatment. However, a substantial number of patients suffer from severe, fatal, or lifelong toxic effects. As most children will be cured of their disease, trials no longer aim only to introduce more powerful antileukemic drugs, but rather focus on minimizing treatment-related toxicities. Therapy-related toxicities may involve numerous organs with various severity, may be acute or chronic, and have an impact on therapy modification, OS, and quality of life.

This review will focus on six major acute toxicities of ALL therapy, their clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, risk factors, treatment, and prevention options. These toxicities include: venous thromboembolism (VTE), osteonecrosis (ON), neurological sequelae (methotrexate [MTX] stroke-like syndrome [MTX SLS], and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRE]), MTX-related nephrotoxicity with delayed MTX elimination (DME), asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP), and toxicities of the new biological therapies (Figure 1). Despite their enormous importance, infectious toxicities deserve a separate chapter and will not be discussed here.

### Methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity in oncology: current issues for a classic drug [^11665qni]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite with immunosuppressive and antineoplastic properties extensively used in cancer treatment. It is administered through various routes, including intravenous and intrathecal. MTX inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase, thereby disrupting folic acid metabolism and impending DNA synthesis. Despite its efficacy, MTX administration can result in significant toxicity, affecting multiple organs and leading to potential side effects like myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, renal failure, mucositis and neurotoxicity. MTX-induced neurotoxicity is a critical problem, with manifestations varying from hours to years post-administration, ranging from transient and reversible to severe presentations. Several risk factors may contribute to MTX-induced neurotoxicity, including genetic predisposition, drug interactions, renal impairment and concurrent radiotherapy. Management strategies in preventing and mitigating neurotoxicity are based on supportive measures such as hydration, leucovorin rescue and the use of glucarpidase. This review focusses on the neurotoxic effects of MTX, a global health issue in the growing cancer population.

### Accumulating evidence for a drug-drug interaction between methotrexate and proton pump inhibitors [^112kRP3z]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A number of medications are known to interact with methotrexate through various mechanisms. The aim of this article is to apprise practitioners of a new labeling change based on the accumulating evidence for a possible drug-drug interaction between methotrexate (primarily at high doses) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Methods

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database of spontaneous adverse event reports and the published literature were searched for cases reporting an interaction between methotrexate and PPIs.

Results

A search of the AERS database and existing literature found several individual case reports of drug-drug interactions and three additional supportive studies that suggest potential underlying mechanisms for the interaction.

Conclusion

There is evidence to suggest that concomitant use of methotrexate (primarily at high doses) with PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole may decrease methotrexate clearance, leading to elevated serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In several case reports, no methotrexate toxicity was found when a histamine H2 blocker was substituted for a PPI. Based on the reviewed data, the FDA updated the methotrexate label to include the possible drug-drug interaction between high-dose methotrexate and PPIs. Physicians should be alerted to this potential drug-drug interaction in patients receiving concomitant high-dose methotrexate and PPIs.

Neurotoxicity

Methotrexate-induced stroke-like syndrome

Epidemiology and clinical manifestations

Methotrexate-induced stroke-like syndrome is a significant complication of ALL therapy. Clinical manifestations typically include sudden onset of neurological symptoms such as hemiparesis, aphasia, seizures, and altered mental status. The condition is termed "stroke-like" due to its resemblance to ischemic stroke. The onset of SLS usually occurs within three weeks after systemic or intrathecal (IT) MTX administration. Magnetic resonance imaging findings, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), have been instrumental in identifying characteristic changes such as focal or diffuse hyperintensity of the periventricular or subcortical white matter on T2-weighted images. Restricted diffusion on the ADC map suggests cytotoxic edema.

Pathogenesis

The pathogenesis of MTX SLS is not entirely understood, but it is thought to involve direct neurotoxic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Several mechanisms have been suggested. MTX acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which decreases tetrahydrofolate, a key factor in DNA synthesis and repair. This depletion may result in neurotoxicity, especially in rapidly dividing cells within the CNS. Elevated homocysteine levels may cause direct damage to the vascular endothelium. Moreover, homocysteine metabolites are also excitatory agonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and excessive activation of this receptor has been linked to neurotoxicity and seizure activity.

Risk factors

Specific risk factors for MTX SLS have not yet been established. However, co-administration of cytarabine and cyclophosphamide alongside intravenous (IV) high-dose MTX or IT MTX treatment may play a role. These drugs promote neurological complications in high-dose regimens. Older age was proposed as another risk factor, but this may reflect increased exposure to courses of intensive chemotherapy. Polymorphisms in genes related to MTX and folate metabolism, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, have been associated with an increased risk of adverse CNS effects. Genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants that could elevate the risk for MTX SLS in the SHMT1, ABCG2, and ABCB1 genes involved in the folate pathways and ATP-binding.

### Methotrexate – how does it really work? [^112MgmFM]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate remains a cornerstone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. Folate antagonism is known to contribute to the antiproliferative effects that are important in the action of methotrexate against malignant diseases, but concomitant administration of folic or folinic acid does not diminish the anti-inflammatory potential of this agent, which suggests that other mechanisms of action might be operative. Although no single mechanism is sufficient to account for all the anti-inflammatory activities of methotrexate, the release of adenosine from cells has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Methotrexate might also confer anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of polyamines. The biological effects on inflammation associated with adenosine release have provided insight into how methotrexate exerts its effects against inflammatory diseases and at the same time causes some of its well-known adverse effects. These activities contribute to the complex and multifaceted mechanisms that make methotrexate efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

### What can clinicians learn from therapeutic studies about the treatment of acute oral methotrexate poisoning? [^116E82NC]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-folate drug that has been utilized in both malignant and chronic inflammatory conditions. Doctors are often concerned with a potential adverse outcome when managing patients with acute oral MTX poisoning given its potential for serious adverse reactions at therapeutic doses. However, there is surprisingly little data from acute poisoning cases and more data from the therapeutic use of high-dose MTX.

Objectives

To review pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of MTX and systematically review series of acute MTX poisonings and therapeutic studies on high-dose MTX that provide pharmacokinetic or clinical data.

Methods

An Embase (1974-October 2016) and Medline (1946-October 2016) search was performed by combining "MTX" and "overdose/poison" or "MTX" and "toxicity" or "MTX" and "high-dose MTX" or "MTX" and "bioavailability" or "pharmacokinetics"; 25, 135, 109 and 365 articles were found, respectively, after duplicates were removed. There were 15 papers that provided clinical data on acute ingestion and toxicity that occurred with low-dose administration. Eighteen papers were on high-dose MTX (> 1g per m² body surface area) used as a single chemotherapy agent which provided pharmacokinetic or clinical data on MTX toxicity. Thirty papers were reviewed to determine the toxic dose, pharmacokinetics, risk factors, clinical symptoms and management of acute MTX toxicity. Given the limited acute poisoning data, a retrospective audit was performed through the consultant records of the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre from April 2004 to July 2015 to examine the clinical syndrome and toxicity of acute oral MTX poisoning. Pharmacokinetics: Reduced MTX bioavailability is a result of saturable absorption. Although maximal bioavailable absorption occurs at a dose of ∼15mgm -2, splitting the dose increases bioavailability. MTX clearance is proportional to renal function. Acute toxicity: Oncologists prescribe doses up to 12gm⁻² of MTX. Patients treated with an intravenous dose of MTX < 1gm⁻² do not require folinic acid rescue. MTX toxicity correlates better with duration and extent of exposure than peak serum concentration. Acute oral poisoning: Acute oral MTX poisoning in 177 patients did not report any severe toxicity. In the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre audit data (2004–2015), 51 cases of acute MTX poisoning were reported, of which 15 were accidental paediatric ingestions. The median reported paediatric ingestion was 50mg (IQR: 10–100; range: 10–150) with a median age of 2 years (IQR: 2–2; range: 1–4). Of the 36 patients with acute deliberate MTX poisoning, median age and dose were 47 years (IQR: 31–62; range: 10–85) and 325mg (IQR: 85–500; range: 40–1000), respectively. Of the 19 patients who had serum MTX concentrations measured, all were significantly below the concentrations used in oncology and the folinic acid rescue nomogram line and no patient reported adverse sequelae. Management of acute oral poisoning: Due to the low bioavailability of MTX, treatment is not necessary for single ingestions. Oral folinic acid may be used to lower the bioavailability further with large ingestions > 1gm -2. Oral followed by intravenous folinic acid may be used in patients with staggered ingestion > 36h or patients with acute overdose and renal impairment (eGFR < 45mL/min/1.73 m²).

Conclusions

As a consequence of saturable absorption MTXs bioavailability is so low that neither accidental paediatric MTX ingestion nor acute deliberate MTX overdose causes toxicity. An acute oral overdose will not provide a bioavailable dose even close to 1gm⁻² of parenteral MTX. Hence, no treatment is required in acute ingestion unless the patient has renal failure or staggered ingestion. There is also no need to monitor MTX concentrations in acute oral MTX poisoning.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^1135Yuk1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As long as the reliable and widely accessible system of prediction of MTX efficacy and intolerance is not available, optimal clinical approach to MTX therapy remains of upmost importance. This study brings additional evidence for the high efficacy of MTX especially in early disease and underlines importance of using the dose around 15 mg/m 2 administered parenterally in order to evaluate treatment response early in the disease course. Such a treatment strategy does not appear to increase the rate and severity of MTX adverse events when compared to oral treatment using lower doses. Limited by short duration of follow-up and relatively small patient number true significance of our findings has yet to be confirmed through the ongoing extension of the study.

### Methotrexate pharmacogenetics in rheumatoid arthritis [^115wV8pG]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory arthritis that can not only result in permanent joint damage, but is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs improve the symptoms of joint pain and swelling, but more importantly, prevent the progression of joint damage. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line DMARD in RA with over two decades worth of excellent long-term efficacy and safety. However, there is significant variability in patients' response to MTX, both in efficacy and toxicity. Recent advances in genetics, particularly pharmacogenetics, may permit the prediction, a priori, of an individual patient's response to MTX. In this review, we highlight recent published literature on the pharmacogenetics of MTX in RA. Pharmacogenetics may be a useful means of optimising MTX therapy in patients with RA.

### Acute therapy-related toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114YiBUF]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity

Epidemiology and clinical manifestations

One of the fundamental drugs included in most contemporary pediatric ALL treatment protocols is high-dose MTX (HDMTX; 1–5 g/m²), which was proven to decrease CNS relapse and improve OS. Nevertheless, up to 4% of the treated patients develop renal toxicity with severely delayed MTX elimination (DME). The risk of severe DME is highest with the first HDMTX infusion. The Ponte di Legno Toxicity Working Group (PTWG) has defined DME as an increase in plasma creatinine of > 0.3 mg/dL or of 1.5-fold above baseline, together with severely elevated plasma MTX concentrations at one of the time points after MTX initiation: 36 hours (hr) MTX > 20 μM/L, 42 hr MTX > 10 μM/L, 48 hr MTX > 5 μM/L.DME may lead to cessation of HDMTX therapy and thus may hamper the efficacy of treatment and increase the rate of relapse. Some patients can be re-challenged with HDMTX, but no evidence-based re-exposed guidelines exist. Additional symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea shortly after the MTX administration, have been reported, but most patients with DME are initially asymptomatic and present with non-oliguric renal dysfunction. An abrupt rise in serum creatinine during or shortly after MTX infusion implies the development of renal dysfunction and can result in significantly elevated plasma MTX concentrations.

Pathogenesis

Methotrexate enters the cell via the reduced folate carrier and undergoes polyglutamation which retains it inside the cell. MTX blocks methionine, thymidine, purine, and pyrimidine synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. The critical factor of MTX cytotoxicity is the duration of exposure. Prolonged exposure to MTX and its metabolite, 7-hydroxy-methotrexate (7-OH-MTX), can result in acute renal, CNS, gastrointestinal and liver toxicity, bone marrow suppression, and can even be life-threatening. The presumed etiologies of MTX-induced renal dysfunction are the precipitation of MTX and its metabolites in the renal tubules, leading to arteriolar vasoconstriction and reduced renal perfusion, or uptake of MTX into the renal tubules with direct tubular toxicity. Nephrotoxicity may result from elevated oxidative stress within the kidneys, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased apoptosis. Decreased MTX solubility or renal extraction induces prolonged exposure to high MTX levels and leads to nephrotoxicity, which in turn increases the risk of toxicities in other systems, such as myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatitis, and dermatitis.

### Consensus guideline for use of glucarpidase in patients with high-dose methotrexate induced acute kidney injury and delayed methotrexate clearance [^114p9mNf]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury due to high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is a serious, life-threatening toxicity that can occur in pediatric and adult patients. Glucarpidase is a treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for high methotrexate concentrations in the context of kidney dysfunction, but the guidelines for when to use it are unclear. An expert panel was convened to provide specific, expert consensus guidelines for the use of glucarpidase in patients who develop HDMTX-induced nephrotoxicity and delayed methotrexate excretion. The guideline provides recommendations to identify the population of patients who would benefit from glucarpidase rescue by more precisely defining the absolute methotrexate concentrations associated with risk for severe or life-threatening toxicity at several time points after the start of an HDMTX infusion. For an HDMTX infusion ≤ 24 hours, if the 36-hour concentration is above 30 µM, 42-hour concentration is above 10 µM, or 48-hour concentration is above 5 µM and the serum creatinine is significantly elevated relative to the baseline measurement (indicative of HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury), glucarpidase may be indicated. After a 36- to 42-hour HDMTX infusion, glucarpidase may be indicated when the 48-hour methotrexate concentration is above 5 µM. Administration of glucarpidase should optimally occur within 48–60 hours from the start of the HDMTX infusion, because life-threatening toxicities may not be preventable beyond this time point.

Implications For Practice

Glucarpidase is a rarely used medication that is less effective when given after more than 60 hours of exposure to high-dose methotrexate, so predicting early which patients will need it is imperative. There are no currently available consensus guidelines for the use of this medication. The indication on the label does not give specific methotrexate concentrations above which it should be used. An international group of experts was convened to develop a consensus guideline that was specific and evidence-based to identify the population of patients who would benefit from glucarpidase.

### Comparing the risk of severe oral mucositis associated with methotrexate as graft-versus host-disease prophylaxis to other immunosuppressive prophylactic agents in hematopoietic cell transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VxNjf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a procedure used to treat patients with a variety of hematological disorders, involving transplantation of stem cells or bone marrow from matched healthy siblings, or alternative donors. This procedure has demonstrated a remarkably improved overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with hematological malignancies. The preparatory regimen for these patients may include intensive chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy in order to eradicate the malignant cells prior to infusion of the graft, which can lead to serious complications. One of the most well-known and serious complication of allo-HCT is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Due to this, various prophylactic measures have been suggested to be included in the transplantation protocols. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches in reducing the incidence and severity of GVHD while preserving the graft-versus-tumor effect, they often come with the downside of causing toxicity in HCT recipients.

One of the traditional standards for GVHD prophylaxis is the combination of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX). However, a common toxic effect of this regimen is damaging the oral mucosal barrier resulting in oral mucositis. This effect has been suggested to relate to direct MTX toxicity, which has been shown to concentrate in epithelial cells and cause epithelial cell necrosis. A general pathophysiological model was suggested explaining the complexity of the development of oral mucositis, which involves a series of biological interactions between the epithelium and the submucosal connective tissue. The model suggests that the initiation stage is characterized by toxicity caused by chemo-and/or radiotherapy. These treatment modalities induce basal and suprabasal cell death either through direct DNA damage or generation of free radicals of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This primary damage leads to the second stage, which promote upregulation of several genes associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, that in turn targets connective tissue and basal epithelium. The third stage, known as signal amplification, involves production of proinflammatory cytokines, providing positive feedback, thereby enhancing cytokines production that mediates further tissue damage. The fourth stage is characterized by ulceration, during which the lesion is subjected to microbial colonization. The final stage is healing, involving epithelial proliferation and restoration of epithelial integrity.

### Does day 11 omission of methotrexate due to toxicity influence the outcome in myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant? Results from a single-center retrospective cohort study [^1164SjVn]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

It has been postulated that MTX omission may be a surrogate for other factors such as higher conditioning-related toxicity, which predispose patients to acute GVHD. Although it remains unclear whether a fourth dose of MTX is necessary in the absence of toxicities, omission of MTX due to mucositis or other organ toxicity appears to be a poor prognostic variable for non-relapse mortality. Severe mucositis in and of itself has previously been shown to be an independent variable contributing to inferior overall survival. MTX's effect on mucositis and toxicity may also be dependent on patient and donor single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene, which is involved in the metabolism of MTX, and is a further area of study.

While this study cannot definitively answer whether we can safely omit the fourth dose of MTX, it demonstrates the need for further study of MTX dosing as well as alternative regimens to MTX, given the extreme variability in dosing, toxicities and effectiveness. Until such studies are carried out, our data support the conclusion that the omission of a fourth dose of MTX in the setting of severe mucositis does not increase the risk of GVHD, but, however, may be a contributor or surrogate for worse non-relapse mortality.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^1144LbEd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last decades low-dose weekly methotrexate (MTX) has been commonly used in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). It has become an essential component of various clinical guidelines and recommendations as a first-line disease-modifying drug for disease unresponsive to nonsteroidals (NSAIDs) and/or intraarticular corticosteroids.

MTX efficacy has been reported mainly in polyarticular-course JIA, though its extent varies. Differences in drug dosing and route of administration as well as in the method of efficacy assessment hamper inter-study comparisons. Most commonly, American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACRpedi) response criteria have been used to define various levels of therapeutic effect. More recently, a composite measure of disease activity (Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Index, JADAS) and its cut-off values for various disease status have been defined. Among factors influencing inter-patient heterogeneity of treatment response, polymorphisms of genes involved in MTX metabolic pathways, disease phenotype and its previous duration and several biomarkers have been reported. Moreover, factors related to MTX absorption and kinetics have also been shown to influence treatment efficacy.

Evaluation of the presence, type and severity of drug adverse events forms a natural part of therapeutic monitoring. Low-dose MTX has a variety of adverse effects. These include features of MTX antiproliferative effect which are mostly related to its post-dose concentrations. MTX affects rapidly dividing cells of gastrointestinal (GI) tract causing nausea and/or vomiting and bone marrow leading to cytopenia. Mechanisms of hepatic and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity are more complex and include elevation of liver enzymes, headaches and behavioral changes. In addition to post-treatment complaints anticipatory and associative symptoms have been described. Patients report presence of gastrointestinal symptoms or behavioral changes (cry, irritation, refusal to take the drug) already before or at the time of MTX administration (anticipatory intolerance) or even when just thinking about it (associative intolerance). They appear to be more commonly associated with parenteral route of MTX administration and often lead to precautious termination of otherwise safe and effective treatement. Therefore monitoring of MTX adverse events requires not only regular blood tests for hepatic and marrow toxicity, but also directed questioning to detect subjective complaints.

### Mechanism of action of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, and the search for biomarkers [^117EcEK3]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

The treatment and outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been transformed over the past two decades. Low disease activity and remission are now frequently achieved, and this success is largely the result of the evolution of treatment paradigms and the introduction of new therapeutic agents. Despite the rapid pace of change, the most commonly used drug in RA remains methotrexate, which is considered the anchor drug for this condition. In this Review, we describe the known pharmacokinetic properties and putative mechanisms of action of methotrexate. Consideration of the pharmacodynamic perspective could inform the development of biomarkers of responsiveness to methotrexate, enabling therapy to be targeted to specific groups of patients. Such biomarkers could revolutionize the management of RA.

### Preventing and managing toxicities of high-dose methotrexate [^111nUVrz]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), defined as a dose higher than 500 mg/m², is used to treat a range of adult and childhood cancers. Although HDMTX is safely administered to most patients, it can cause significant toxicity, including acute kidney injury (AKI) in 2%-12% of patients. Nephrotoxicity results from crystallization of methotrexate in the renal tubular lumen, leading to tubular toxicity. AKI and other toxicities of high-dose methotrexate can lead to significant morbidity, treatment delays, and diminished renal function. Risk factors for methotrexate-associated toxicity include a history of renal dysfunction, volume depletion, acidic urine, and drug interactions. Renal toxicity leads to impaired methotrexate clearance and prolonged exposure to toxic concentrations, which further worsen renal function and exacerbate nonrenal adverse events, including myelosuppression, mucositis, dermatologic toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Serum creatinine, urine output, and serum methotrexate concentration are monitored to assess renal clearance, with concurrent hydration, urinary alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue to prevent and mitigate AKI and subsequent toxicity. When delayed methotrexate excretion or AKI occurs despite preventive strategies, increased hydration, high-dose leucovorin, and glucarpidase are usually sufficient to allow renal recovery without the need for dialysis. Prompt recognition and effective treatment of AKI and associated toxicities mitigate further toxicity, facilitate renal recovery, and permit patients to receive other chemotherapy or resume HDMTX therapy when additional courses are indicated.

Implications For Practice

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), defined as a dose higher than 500 mg/m², is used for a range of cancers. Although HDMTX is safely administered to most patients, it can cause significant toxicity, including acute kidney injury (AKI), attributable to crystallization of methotrexate in the renal tubular lumen, leading to tubular toxicity. When AKI occurs despite preventive strategies, increased hydration, high-dose leucovorin, and glucarpidase allow renal recovery without the need for dialysis. This article, based on a review of the current associated literature, provides comprehensive recommendations for prevention of toxicity and, when necessary, detailed treatment guidance to mitigate AKI and subsequent toxicity.

Table 7 — key clinical questions requiring further research are cataloged across methotrexate administration, treat-to-target (TTT), comparative effectiveness and safety, and comorbidities. Examples include: At what dose and route of administration should methotrexate be started? What is the efficacy of TTT in different patient populations (early versus late, bDMARD- or tsDMARD-exposed, elderly-onset, comorbidities)? What is the comparative effectiveness/safety between bDMARDs and tsDMARDs, and between adding bDMARDs or tsDMARDs to methotrexate versus switching to bDMARD or tsDMARD monotherapy? Questions also address tapering/discontinuation, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and malignancy scenarios (including skin cancer), with abbreviations defined on-page.

### Use of methotrexate in patients with psoriasis [^115XyXse]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is considered to be a polygenetically influenced, immune-mediated, organ-specific disease of dysregulated inflammation that is triggered by environmental factors such as infections, medications, and physical and/or emotional stress. It is recognised as one of the most prevalent skin diseases, affecting 2% to 3% of Caucasian populations. Major advances in understanding of disease pathogenesis indicate that patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. A wide range of systemic drugs have been developed in recent years for treatment of psoriasis and comorbidities. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is one of the classical agents and is still one of the most frequently used systemic treatments for psoriasis worldwide. Low-dose MTX is also effective in treatment of psoriatic arthritis. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but MTX is suggested to act primarily as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drug. A favourable efficacy and safety profile has been established for MTX in a large number of clinical trials, as well as in common practice. This review summarises the nature of the disease and our present knowledge about MTX in the treatment of psoriasis, including combination therapies.

Exemplar anticancer drugs

Methotrexate

Methotrexate is an anticancer drug administered via several routes (orally and parenterally) and used in the management of multiple malignancies including those requiring high plasma concentrations to achieve adequate tumour cell kill. Methotrexate has a wide dosing range and is associated with high variability in interpatient pharmacokinetics. The adverse event profile depends on the dosing (and consequential drug exposure), and high doses (≥ 500 mg/m²) can cause serious adverse events including acute kidney injury (AKI).

Existing guidelines propose methotrexate dose adjustments in reduced kidney function (Table 1); however, there are notable inconsistencies such as the kidney function threshold for discontinuation (varies between creatinine clearance [CrCl] or glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 10–30 mL/min). Furthermore, there is little information on how tumour type, intent of treatment or dosing levels should influence dose recommendations.

Methotrexate hepatotoxicity monitoring in patients with risk factors advises stricter measures: "Consider the use of a different systemic agent", "Consider delayed baseline liver biopsy (after 2–6 mo of therapy to establish medication efficacy and tolerability)", and "Repeated liver biopsies after approximately 1–1.5 g of methotrexate". The text notes "Patients with one or more risk factors for hepatotoxicity need be followed up with the more stringent guidelines (Table IV)", and if methotrexate is still used, "this patient should have a liver biopsy performed at or near the beginning of methotrexate therapy", though "As some patients will discontinue methotrexate within 2 to 6 months because of adverse effects or lack of clinical effectiveness, it is sensible to postpone the early treatment liver biopsy until after this initial period". For ongoing risk, "a repeated biopsy should be performed at a cumulative dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g", "a liver biopsy is also indicated" for "persistent significant abnormalities in liver chemistry values", and biopsy "should be repeated with every additional 1.0 to 1.5 g of methotrexate".

Methotrexate safety monitoring — liver and hepatotoxicity: Liver function test monitoring is recommended every 3 to 6 months when results are normal, and abnormal elevations should prompt a repeat laboratory check in 2 to 4 weeks. For persistent elevations, a gastrointestinal (GI) referral is recommended. For patients with risk factors for hepatotoxicity, it may be reasonable to consider an alternative therapy to methotrexate; if methotrexate is chosen, recommended hepatotoxicity monitoring is similar to that in low-risk individuals, except noninvasive hepatic specific serology should be performed at baseline and annually thereafter, irrespective of total cumulative dose.

Methotrexate — pulmonary toxicity and monitoring: Pulmonary toxicity is well described with methotrexate treatment and pulmonary toxicities are not prevented by folic acid administration, with patterns including pneumonitis, bronchitis with airways hyperreactivity, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage. The most commonly reported manifestation is hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and the incidence has been reported between 1% and 5%. Prolonged methotrexate treatment was not associated with chronic ILD, and routine high-resolution CT and serial pulmonary function tests were not useful in monitoring patients.

### Review of dextromethorphan administration in 18 patients with subacute methotrexate central nervous system toxicity [^1156jbo2]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The pathogenesis of methotrexate central nervous system toxicity is multifactorial, but it is likely related to central nervous system folate homeostasis. The use of folinate rescue has been described to decrease toxicity in patients who had received intrathecal methotrexate. It has also been described in previous studies that there is an elevated level of homocysteine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients who had received intrathecal methotrexate. Homocysteine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist. The use of dextromethorphan, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor receptor antagonist, has been used in the treatment of sudden onset of neurological dysfunction associated with methotrexate toxicity. It remains unclear whether the dextromethorphan impacted the speed of recovery, and its use remains controversial. This study reviews the use of dextromethorphan in the setting of subacute methotrexate central nervous system toxicity.

Methods

Charts of 18 patients who had sudden onset of neurological impairments after receiving methotrexate and were treated with dextromethorphan were reviewed.

Result

The use of dextromethorphan in most of our patients resulted in symptomatic improvement. In this patient population, earlier administration of dextromethorphan resulted in faster improvement of impairments and led to prevention of recurrence of seizure activity induced by methotrexate central nervous system toxicity.

Conclusions

Our study provides support for the use of dextromethorphan in patients with subacute methotrexate central nervous system toxicity.

### How long can folinic acid rescue be delayed after high-dose methotrexate without toxicity? [^111k3v5N]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal time of folinic acid rescue after methotrexate (MTX) treatment in patients with ALL, we selected and evaluated relevant studies that included doses, rescue delay, and side effects. Rescue at 42–48 hours resulted in considerable toxicity, except when low doses of MTX were used (1 g/m²) or serum MTX levels remained consistently low at 24, 30, and 36 hours. Rescue started at 30–36 hours was safe. In the absence of evidence that later rescue improves prognosis, we suggest that folinic acid rescue (105 mg/m²) be started no later than 36 hours from the start of MTX (5–6 g/m²).

### Renal clearance and intracellular half-life essentially determine methotrexate toxicity: a case series [^113sqaEN]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians treating psoriasis should be aware of the typical warning signs of incipient MTX toxicity that our cases describe, as they may indicate MTX-induced myelosuppression. Ulcerations of the oral mucosa and necrotizing gingivitis can herald pancytopenia. This finding may be caused by reduced mucosal proliferation and increased virulence of oral microbiota resulting from granulocytopenia. Epidermal necrosis in existing psoriasis plaques is a clinical symptom of MTX toxicity reserved for psoriasis patients. Typically, all psoriasis plaques are affected simultaneously with monomorphic erosions. Although the skin is usually not a primary target for MTX overdosage, because of a moderate proliferation rate, the increased epidermal turnover in psoriatic plaques may render keratinocytes particularly susceptible to MTX-induced necrosis. Although erosions of psoriasis plaques caused by MTX cannot be dismissed but may be misinterpreted, they are not mentioned in recent guidelines.

Our 3 cases illustrate that impaired renal MTX elimination of different causes is a significant reason for toxicity with therapeutic MTX doses. It increases the time of MTX exposure and cellular uptake, thereby increasing intracellular MTX concentrations and promoting toxic MTX effects caused by intracellular MTX accumulation despite normal serum MTX levels. Physicians need to be aware of the direct relationship between the duration of plasma half-life and intracellular MTX accumulation and consider any condition that impairs renal elimination of MTX as a relative contraindication for MTX treatment. Warning signs that may herald MTX toxicity with myelosuppression and agranulocytosis may occur in highly proliferative tissues and include necrotizing gingivitis and angina, purpura from thrombocytopenia, and monomorphic erosions of psoriasis plaques. Appropriate interpretation of these early clinical symptoms by both patients and physicians is vital for a timely diagnosis of myelosuppression and for preventing fatal outcomes through sepsis.

### Delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke-like presentation in chemotherapy recipients [^113g6GNo]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia. Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration.

Methods

We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded.

Results

We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 21/27 patients). Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1–4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities. However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities.

Conclusions

Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed. DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.

Methotrexate — dosing interval and clearance considerations: The duration of exposure to methotrexate likely accounts for a substantial proportion of its toxicity; therefore, once-weekly regimens are favored and lead to fewer side effects. Delayed clearance because of renal insufficiency, third-space effusions, or GI obstruction leads to prolonged circulating methotrexate with increased risk of toxicity, and accumulation in ascites and pleural effusions can lead to prolonged exposure.

### Dextromethorphan is effective in the treatment of subacute methotrexate neurotoxicity [^111RQFM3]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity (MTX-Ntox) is a frequent complication of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for patients with both malignant and inflammatory diseases. MTX-Ntox can occur after intrathecal MTX or after low-, intermediate-, or high-dose systemic administration. Symptoms can present in the acute, subacute, or late setting form, and can range from affective disorders, malaise, and headaches, to somnolence, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures. While the pathogenesis of MTX-Ntox is likely multifactorial, one potential biochemical pathway leading from MTX to neurotoxicity involves the folate dependent remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy). MTX therapy is known to cause elevations of both plasma and CSF Hcy. Hcy is directly toxic to vascular endothelium and it and its metabolites are excitatory agonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Competitive or noncompetitive antagonists might afford protection from or reversal of MTX-Ntox. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with coulometric electrochemical detection, the authors measured CSF Hcy in sequential patients with severe subacute MTX-Ntox. CSF Hcy was higher in these patients (n = 9, median = 0.93 microM) than in asymptomatic patients (n = 11, median 0.2 microM, p < .01). Five patients with severe subacute MTX-Ntox (most with dysarthria and/or hemiplegia) were treated with 1–2 mg/kg oral dextromethorphan (DM), a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-1-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. All five had resolution of symptoms. These data provide additional clinical support for elevated CSF Hcy in the induction of MTX-Ntox through activation of the NMDA-receptor. These data provide support for a placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the ability of DM to prevent or alleviate MTX-Ntox.

NCCN B-cell lymphomas — management of methotrexate toxicity states that if a patient receiving high-dose methotrexate experiences delayed elimination due to renal impairment, glucarpidase is strongly recommended when plasma methotrexate concentrations are two standard deviations above the mean expected plasma concentration as determined by MTXPK.org, or when plasma methotrexate level is > 30 μM at 36 hours, > 10 μM at 42 hours, or > 5 μM at 48 hours. Optimal administration of glucarpidase is within 48 to 60 hours from the start of methotrexate infusion, and leucovorin should be continued for at least 2 days following glucarpidase administration and should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after the dose of glucarpidase.

### Association of erythrocyte methotrexate-polyglutamate levels with the efficacy and hepatotoxicity of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a 76-week prospective study [^112KURf3]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methotrexate (MTX) is the mainstay of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. It is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its marked efficacy and acceptable side effect profile. However, a number of patients have a poor response despite dose escalation, or experience adverse events resulting in dose restriction or treatment cessation. At present, the mechanisms and risk factors underlying the interpatient variability in the response to MTX have not been established. However, the amount of MTX or MTX metabolites in the body could be a major determinant of its effect.

MTX is transported into cells via a reduced folate carrier, where it is converted by folylpolyglutamate synthase into glutamate-chained MTX. It is retained within the cells for a period of time after its elimination from the plasma. Depending on the number of conjugated glutamates, MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) can be present as MTX-PG1 through 5. MTX-PGs inside the cells increase the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis and promote the accumulation of adenosine, thereby exerting immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects.

Plasma MTX concentrations fall below pharmacologically effective levels rapidly. Therefore, they are unreliable for predicting the efficacy or toxicity of MTX in patients with RA. In contrast, MTX-PG concentrations in erythrocytes have been identified as a potentially promising biomarker associated with response to MTX in patients with RA and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, the majority of these studies employed a cross-sectional design, and reported conflicting results on the efficacy and limited findings on the safety of MTX in relation to MTX-PG concentrations.

The aim of this long-term multicentre prospective study was to clarify the association between the dynamics of intraerythrocyte MTX-PG concentrations and the efficacy and adverse effects of MTX in patients with RA.

5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on published reports and methotrexate's mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman. In pregnant women with non-malignant diseases, methotrexate is contraindicated. Consider the benefits and risks of XATMEP and risks to the fetus when prescribing XATMEP to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic disease. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after the final methotrexate dose [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

5.10 Ineffective Immunization and Risks Associated with Live Vaccines

Immunization may be ineffective when given during XATMEP therapy.

Immunization with live virus vaccines is not recommended. There have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunization in patients receiving methotrexate therapy.

5.11 Effects on Reproduction

Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction. It is not known if the infertility is reversible in affected patients. Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.12 Increased Toxicity Due to Third-Space Accumulation

### The pharmacogenetics of methotrexate [^114XLsqd]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone of therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not universally effective and up to one-third of patients fail to respond to treatment, either because of inefficacy or adverse events, although at present it is not possible to predict therapy response accurately. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variability in drug response due to heredity. MTX has a complex intracellular metabolism and acts via a number of key enzymes. This review critically appraises the studies of MTX pharmacogenetics and highlights the need for further work in this area.

Methotrexate — toxicity profile and risk mitigation: "Common and generally minor toxicities of methotrexate include nausea, anorexia, stomatitis, and fatigue that most often occur at the time of methotrexate administration". These effects "may be minimized by administering methotrexate by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, splitting the dose, folate supplementation, or by administering the dose with food or at bedtime". Major toxicities are "myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis". In reported fatalities, "Of 164 possible methotrexate-associated fatalities, 67 were caused by myelosuppression, 30 were caused by pulmonary fibrosis, and 8 were caused by hepatotoxicity". Pulmonary fibrosis is noted as severe and "much less common in patients with psoriasis than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis". Additional reported risks include "Hepatitis, reactivation of tuberculosis (TB), and lymphoma, especially the B-cell type that is commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection", and "These observations suggest that practitioners need to maintain a high index of suspicion for these infections in patients being treated with methotrexate".

### Acute central nervous system toxicity during treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: phenotypes, risk factors and genotypes [^114sGE8L]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Therapeutic advances in recent decades have greatly improved the outcome of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with a current survival rate above 90%. However, severe acute adverse events involving the central nervous system (CNS), from here on referred to as CNS toxicities, still have an incidence of up to 18.4% with significant morbidity and mortality and remain a significant challenge in ALL treatment. Certain chemotherapy regimens, individual patients' vulnerability, underlying co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, and the distribution and tumor load of the ALL itself may predispose patients to CNS toxicities, while the role of CNS leukemia in CNS toxicities is still unclear. Accumulating data on pharmacogenetic associations with CNS toxicities and the genetic background of neurological diseases, such as seizures and epilepsy, support possible existence of genetic susceptibility to CNS toxicities during ALL treatment. Recent research has used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) related to methotrexate-induced leukoencephalopathy in pediatric ALL. Mateos et al. identified SNP in genes regulating neuronal growth, differentiation, and cytoskeletal organization at a significance level of P < 1.0 × 10⁻⁶.

In this study, we explored the phenotypes, outcome, clinical and genetic risk factors for all severe acute CNS toxicities in pediatric patients with ALL. We applied both GWAS and candidate SNP analyses to identify genotypes associated with CNS toxicities. We hypothesized that genetic variants that predispose healthy children to epilepsy may also predispose them to seizures during ALL treatment and studied multi-SNP genetic risk scores for the risk of seizures in ALL patients. We collaborated with an independent Australian research group to test whether our most significant findings would be validated in a cohort of pediatric ALL patients in whom two phenotype groups, diverse CNS toxicities and methotrexate-related CNS toxicity, were studied.

### Risk stratified monitoring for methotrexate toxicity in immune mediated inflammatory diseases: prognostic model development and validation using primary care data from the UK [^112SRLAW]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We developed and externally validated a prognostic model for predicting the likelihood of methotrexate discontinuation owing to abnormal blood test results that utilises disease and demographic factors ascertained during routine clinic visits in either primary or secondary care. Our prognostic model performed well in predicting outcomes by five years and did so in clinically relevant subgroups defined by age group, type of immune mediated inflammatory disease, methotrexate dose, and route of administration. Strong independent predictors were cytopenia or raised liver enzyme levels, or both, in the six months before start of follow-up, chronic kidney disease stage 3, and diabetes. The last two associations could be related to reduced methotrexate clearance in patients with chronic kidney disease and to drug induced liver injury and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in people with diabetes.

Psoriasis systemic therapy — methotrexate (MTX) is "the most commonly used systemic agent worldwide for moderate to severe psoriasis", with dosing "designed to maintain the minimal effective dose" and attention to "side effects such as nausea or fatigue, and alterations in the blood cell count or liver enzymes". For this patient, being "overweight, and likely has steatohepatitis" makes MTX "a less attractive option", and "moderate alcohol intake and current medications may also increase the likelihood of liver toxicity"; moreover, "MTX is a pregnancy category X drug and contraception must be practiced at all times". Although these are "relative but not absolute contraindications", they render MTX "an unattractive option".

### The biological intersection between chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease [^111VU3JP]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, white matter damage, myelin loss/dysfunction, and altered oligodendrogenesis are recognized alterations in AD and CRCI, with emerging data supporting a key role of these pathways in the pathophysiology and cognitive decline of AD and CRCI. Future studies are needed to determine if myelin-damaging chemotherapeutic agents increase amyloid deposition in AD models and if up-regulating BDNF signaling is neuroprotective in this context. Drugs such as methotrexate and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea that are associated with chemotherapy-induced toxic leukoencephalopathy would be promising chemotherapeutics to test initially. It would also be important to understand if chemotherapy exposure synergistically impairs oligodendrogenesis in AD model systems.

### Methotrexate-related central neurotoxicity: clinical characteristics, risk factors and genome-wide association study in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^117KEmk2]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methotrexate-related central neurotoxicity (MTX neurotoxicity) occurs in 3–7% of children treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)and is characterized by seizures, stroke-like symptoms, speech disturbances and encephalopathy. Although commonly encountered during clinical practice, questions remain relating to risk factors, choice of further intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy following MTX neurotoxicity and longterm neurological outcomes, which are not well defined.

Previously described risk factors for symptomatic MTX neurotoxicity include older age, and an interaction with cytarabine and cyclophosphamide treatment blocks. Upon re-exposure to MTX in children with ALL, MTX neurotoxicity recurs in 7–24% of cases. However, there is a paucity of data on central nervous system (CNS) relapse rates if CNS-directed therapy is modified following MTX neurotoxicity. Genomic risk predictors may relate to neuronal development, MTX clearance or folate metabolism by-products such as homocysteine.

Here we sought to analyze clinical and germline DNA factors that may predict susceptibility to MTX neurotoxicity during treatment for childhood ALL. Additionally, we assessed the incidence of neurological sequelae following an episode of MTX neurotoxicity, and, the impact that changes made to therapy following MTX neurotoxicity had on subsequent relapse risk.

### Neurosarcoidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114pfnf2]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute Treatment

Glucocorticoids are widely considered to be first-line therapy for NS and work rapidly in most patients. Patients with severe presentations may require pulse-dose IV methylprednisolone, 1 g daily for 3–5 days followed by a prolonged oral glucocorticoid taper. For less severe presentations, prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/d or bioequivalent doses in other glucocorticoid formulations may be effective. For patients with mild or moderate presentations, monotherapy with prednisone may be sufficient and when the clinical and imaging response is adequate, prednisone can be tapered gradually over several months. Care should be taken to consider and evaluate for recurrence or worsening when tapering glucocorticoids in NS.

A meta-analysis from 2016 noted a favorable outcome with glucocorticoids in 71% of patients with NS. However, a significant portion of patients with NS will be refractory to glucocorticoids or will experience recurrence of disease activity when attempting to taper to more tolerable or safer doses. Glucocorticoid doses required to achieve and maintain remission can also sometimes be prohibitive due to steroid toxicity. Therefore, steroid-sparing agents should generally be given to patients with NS with moderate to severe presentations or in patients who are unable to achieve treatment goals balanced against risks with oral steroids.

Steroid-Sparing Agents

A number of steroid-sparing agents have been used in the treatment of NS, including azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, and TNF inhibitors. Choosing among these options is based on clinical judgment, comorbidities, and the available literature, including observations from treatment of systemic sarcoidosis. A 2016 retrospective study of 40 patients with NS suggested greater efficacy of methotrexate over mycophenolate. e1 Another retrospective study of 234 patients with NS in 2017 noted lower risk for relapse among patients treated with methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or infliximab and greater relapse risk with mycophenolate. Agents like azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil can take several months to achieve full immunosuppressive effects clinically, during which time it may be helpful to continue oral glucocorticoids. Close clinical and radiologic follow-up is important when tapering glucocorticoids given frequent recurrence of disease activity on steroid withdrawal.

Methotrexate in psoriasis — mechanism and regulatory context are summarized: Methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, decreasing the synthesis of folate cofactors needed to produce nucleic acids, and there is significant inhibition of proliferation of lymphoid tissue at concentrations typically achieved with low-dose weekly methotrexate; these findings support that the therapeutic effect of low-dose methotrexate in psoriasis is a result of its effects on the immune system. Methotrexate was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1972 for the treatment of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis, and because it was introduced before the acceptance of randomized clinical trials as the standard by which to judge drug efficacy, there are no large high-quality studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy, with clinical experience much greater than documentation from clinical studies.

### An update on methotrexate [^116Xrk4u]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Methotrexate (MTX) has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for about three decades now. MTX is one of the most effective and commonly used medicines to treat various forms of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions. MTX was shown to improve signs and symptoms of RA, disease activity and function, to a similar degree as the tumor necrosis factor blockers, and it inhibits radiographic progression to a smaller degree than the antitumor necrosis factor agents. MTX is considered as the anchor drug among the disease-modifying antirheumatic agents, and it is internationally accepted as the first choice in the management of RA. This review was performed on the basis of a PubMed literature search looking at all publications on MTX and arthritis in 2008.

Recent Findings

MTX seems to even prolong the life span of patients who tolerate the drug and have clinical benefit from this therapy; this may partly be explained by beneficial effects on cardiovascular mortality. The reason for this may well be the suppression of inflammation, but direct atheroprotective effects of MTX may also play a role. MTX is used as monotherapy and in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic agents or biologic agents such as the antitumor necrosis factor agents. The 'early' use of MTX within 5 years after disease onset is clearly associated with improved outcomes. The management of RA should include an early strong suppression of inflammation and continuously a tight control strategy. The pharmacodynamics and kinetics of MTX are still incompletely understood.

Summary

In this review, we especially cover the following themes: new clinical studies on the use of MTX in RA, the use of MTX in other rheumatic conditions, prediction of response to MTX, optimal dosage, MTX use in the elderly, the mechanism of action, the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacogenetics of MTX, the prevention of side effects, and the overall long-term safety.

### Prediction of methotrexate efficacy and adverse events in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic literature review [^111vFeqg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood rheumatologic disorder, with a prevalence of 16–150 per 100,000 children. It is characterised by chronic arthritis of unknown aetiology, lasting at least 6 weeks, with an onset before 16 years of age. JIA is a heterogeneous group of disorders, whose manifestations range from relatively mild inflammation of a single joint, to severe involvement of multiple joints lasting into adulthood and leading to structural joint damage and incapacity. These long-term sequelae should be avoided and it is thought that early and effective therapy in the so-called window of opportunity is crucial in doing so.

The most widely used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of JIA is methotrexate (MTX), which has been used for more than 25 years. It is an inexpensive and safe drug and is beneficial in around 70% of JIA patients. Other treatment options include intra-articular joint injections or the more potent biologicals for MTX or corticosteroid resistant cases. It is still impossible to predict the individual prognosis and hence the treatment requirements at the onset of the disease, leading to the current step-up approach of starting MTX and adding a biological if the patient does not respond sufficiently well to MTX monotherapy. However, given the abovementioned goal to start effective treatment immediately in order to prevent joint damage and the fact that MTX monotherapy is completely ineffective in around 30% of patients, it is essential to know beforehand who is going to respond well to MTX and who is not. The latter group may then be prescribed a biological from the outset.

Next to drug effectiveness, its side effects should be taken into account. It has been shown previously that MTX despite being safe frequently causes transient elevation of liver enzymes and potentially also cytopenias, for which periodic evaluation of blood counts and liver function tests are advised. Perhaps more importantly, gastrointestinal side effects and MTX intolerance occur frequently. MTX intolerance has been shown to influence the quality of life of patients negatively. Furthermore, these adverse effects potentially cause non-compliance and hence ineffectiveness of an otherwise effective drug, interfering with the goal to induce early disease remission. To avoid this problem, the risk of occurrence of these adverse effects should be known early, in order for the physician to intervene timely.

Therefore, to optimise treatment of JIA patients, it is necessary to predict the probability of response as well as the risk of developing adverse events. This systematic literature review aims to find and summarise studies, which assessed factors capable of doing so.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112ie2D9]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — hepatic toxicity, risk factors, and monitoring: One prospective study in rheumatoid arthritis reported stopping methotrexate because of hepatotoxicity in 5% of cases, and a large series identified severe liver failure and cirrhosis in 24 patients with a 5-year cumulative incidence of one per 1,000 patients. A meta-analysis of 636 patients across 15 studies found that 28% progressed at least one histologic grade, with 5% having advanced liver disease (grade IIIB or IV), and major risk factors included cumulative methotrexate dose, heavy alcohol use, and underlying psoriasis. Patients had a 6.7% chance of progressive liver damage for each cumulative gram of methotrexate, and these data have led to the recommendation that liver biopsy be considered after each 1 to 1.5 g of methotrexate. Routine liver function testing usually is performed every 4 to 12 weeks while receiving the drug; liver biopsy samples are no longer recommended by the American College of Rheumatology, which instead recommends monitoring transaminase levels, and only if transaminase levels are elevated in more than one-half of the testing in the prior year does the American College of Rheumatology recommend a biopsy. In sarcoidosis, hepatotoxicity has been reported in up to 15% of cases, and increased alcohol consumption has led to increased methotrexate toxicity in some studies; patients with hepatitis C are at increased risk for methotrexate hepatotoxicity.

### Methotrexate sodium (methotrexate) [^116VE1b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on published reports and its mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity, including fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman.

Methotrexate for Injection is contraindicated for use in pregnant women with non-neoplastic diseases. Advise pregnant women with neoplastic diseases of the potential risk to a fetus. The preservative benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta; when possible, use the preservative-free formulation when Methotrexate for Injection is needed during pregnancy to treat a neoplastic disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during Methotrexate for Injection treatment and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during Methotrexate for Injection treatment and for 3 months after the final dose [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3, 8.4)].

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur with methotrexate [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or any other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue Methotrexate for Injection and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4)].

### Progression of brain injuries associated with methotrexate chemotherapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^11532TZ1]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Brain bases and progression of methotrexate-associated neurotoxicity and cognitive disturbances remain unknown. We tested whether brain abnormalities worsen in proportion to intrathecal methotrexate(IT-MTX) doses.

Methods

In this prospective, longitudinal study, we recruited 19 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia 4-to-20 years of age and 20 matched controls. We collected MRI and neuropsychological assessments at a pre-methotrexate baseline and at week 9, week 22, and year 1 during treatment.

Results

Patients had baseline abnormalities in cortical and subcortical gray matter(GM), white matter(WM) volumes and microstructure, regional cerebral blood flow, and neuronal density. Abnormalities of GM, blood flow, and metabolites worsened in direct proportions to IT-MTX doses. WM abnormalities persisted until week 22 but normalized by year 1. Brain injuries were localized to dorsal and ventral attentional and frontoparietal cognitive networks. Patients had cognitive deficits at baseline that persisted at 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Baseline abnormalities are likely a consequence of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Baseline abnormalities in WM microstructure and volumes, and blood flow persisted until week 22 but normalized by year 1, likely due to treatment and its effects on reducing inflammation. The cytotoxic effects of IT-MTX, however, likely contributed to continued, progressive cortical thinning and reductions in neuronal density, thereby contributing to enduring cognitive deficits.

Impact

Brain abnormalities at a pre-methotrexate baseline likely are due to acute illness. The cytotoxic effects of intrathecal MTX contribute to progressive cortical thinning, reductions in neuronal density, and enduring cognitive deficits.
Baseline white matter abnormalities may have normalized via methotrexate treatment and decreasing neuroinflammation. Corticosteroid and leucovorin conferred neuroprotective effects.
Our findings suggest that the administration of neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents should be considered even earlier than they are currently administered. The neuroprotective effects of leucovorin suggest that strategies may be developed that extend the duration of this intervention or adapt it for use in standard risk patients.

### Toxic and metabolic leukoencephalopathies in emergency department patients: a primer for the radiologist [^116bP1Fo]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common chief complaints in the emergency department (ED) is altered mental status (AMS). Imaging plays a critical role in triaging patients and identifying the etiology of AMS. Toxic and metabolic etiologies are one of the primary differential categories for AMS, leading to toxic leukoencephalopathies. Toxic leukoencephalopathies are white matter disorders that result from either exogenous or endogenous sources. Common exogeneous causes of toxic leukoencephalopathy include drugs of abuse (heroin and cocaine), alcohol, inhaled gases (carbon monoxide), industrial agents (pesticides, toluene, ethylene glycol), and neurotoxic medications (methotrexate, metronidazole, vigabatrine, etc.); endogenous causes include hyper- and hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, hyponatremia, and uremia. The imaging findings of toxic leukoencephalopathies manifest through a combination of vasogenic and cytotoxic edema, resulting in white matter patterns. These white matter patterns have been found to be pathognomonic. In the ED setting, it is imperative to develop a diagnosis based off of the imaging due to the lack of history and context that is typically provided with a chief complaint of altered mental status (AMS). To offer expeditious and accurate diagnosis, we present the classic imaging features of toxic leukoencephalopathies and correlate these imaging findings with pathophysiology.

### Genetic markers in methotrexate treatments [^111DLh8U]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX), a structural analog of folic acid, is widely employed in the treatment of different cancers and autoimmune diseases. Despite the successful results observed, the main disadvantage lies in interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. In particular, adverse events and toxicities induced by MTX are a matter of concern and can be the cause of dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Among the different approaches to reduce MTX therapeutic limitations, pharmacogenomics contributes by considering the effect of inherited genetic differences on those parameters. This review provides an update on MTX pharmacogenomics. It reports the contribution of main gene polymorphisms involved in the influx, efflux, cellular effect, and elimination on MTX toxicity and efficacy, on all the diseases treated with this drug. From the analysis of the data presented in this review, we concluded that only gene polymorphisms MTHFR rs1801133, SLC19A1 rs1051266, and TYMS rs34743033 could influence clinical decision-making.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^113e9QTH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — management of abnormal liver tests and hepatotoxic co-medications states that monitoring is also indicated when the dosage is increased or if the patient is taking concomitant hepatotoxic medications. If a significant persistent abnormality in liver chemistry develops, methotrexate therapy should be withheld for 1 to 2 weeks and then liver chemistry tests should be repeated, with liver chemistry values likely to return to normal in 1 to 2 weeks. If significantly abnormal liver chemistry values persist for 2 to 3 months, a liver biopsy should be considered if continuation of methotrexate therapy is desired. The extent of fibrosis on liver biopsy specimen dictates whether methotrexate may be continued, it is prudent to discontinue methotrexate if a patient refuses to undergo a liver biopsy, and more frequent monitoring of both laboratory studies and liver histology is necessary if other hepatotoxic medications are used along with methotrexate.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^112bXvJA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — hematologic toxicity risk factors and test dosing in psoriasis are outlined, stating that risk factors include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, methotrexate dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake. The test dose is typically 2.5 or 5 mg with a complete blood cell (CBC) count evaluated 5 to 6 days later, and although the use of a test dose does not guarantee that patients will not experience myelosuppression, it is mandatory in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or other significant risk factors for hematologic toxicity. Pancytopenia can rarely occur with the use of low-dose weekly methotrexate, even after single doses, and as pancytopenia may occur as long as 4 to 6 weeks after increasing the methotrexate dosage, more frequent monitoring is suggested with dosage increases. The literature suggests that significant myelosuppression is rare in appropriately monitored patients with psoriasis who have no risk factors for hematologic toxicity.

Psoriasis — methotrexate laboratory monitoring and toxicity management specify that ongoing studies should include a complete blood count (CBC) every 2 to 4 weeks for the first few months, then every 1 to 3 months; some suggest testing on the fifth to sixth day of the weekly methotrexate cycle because liver chemistry values may be elevated 1 to 2 days after a dose; a significant reduction in leukocyte or platelet counts necessitates reduction or temporary discontinuation of methotrexate; for overdose or cytopenias, folinic acid (leucovorin) at 10 mg m2 should be administered and given immediately with subsequent doses every 6 hours; renal monitoring includes serum urea nitrogen and creatinine at 2- to 3-month intervals, and liver chemistries should be performed every 4 weeks with more frequent monitoring for hepatic risk factors.

### Adverse effects of low-dose methotrexate: a randomized trial [^111GBAwd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-dose methotrexate (LD-MTX) is the most commonly used drug for systemic rheumatic diseases worldwide and is the recommended first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Despite extensive clinical use for more than 30 years, few data on adverse event (AE) rates derive from randomized, placebo-controlled trials, where both causality and magnitude of risk can be inferred.

Objective

To investigate AE rates, risk, and risk differences comparing LD-MTX versus placebo.

Design

Prespecified secondary analyses of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01594333).

Setting

North America.

Participants

Adults with known cardiovascular disease and diabetes or metabolic syndrome.

Intervention

Random allocation to LD-MTX (≤ 20 mg/wk) or placebo. All participants received folic acid, 1 mg/d, 6 days per week.

Measurements

Risks for specific AEs of interest, as well as for all AEs, were compared across treatment groups after blinded adjudication.

Results

After an active run-in period, 6158 patients were enrolled and 4786 randomly assigned to a group; median follow-up was 23 months and median dosage 15 mg/wk. Among the randomly assigned participants, 81.2% were male, median age was 65.7 years, and median body mass index was 31.5 kg/m2. Of 2391 participants assigned to LD-MTX, 2080 (87.0%) had an AE of interest, compared with 1951 of 2395 (81.5%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.25]). The relative hazards of gastrointestinal (HR, 1.91 [CI, 1.75 to 2.10]), pulmonary (HR, 1.52 [CI, 1.16 to 1.98]), infectious (HR, 1.15 [CI, 1.01 to 1.30]), and hematologic (HR, 1.15 [CI, 1.07 to 1.23]) AEs were elevated for LD-MTX versus placebo. With the exception of increased risk for skin cancer (HR, 2.05 [CI, 1.28 to 3.28]), the treatment groups did not differ in risk for other cancer or mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, or musculoskeletal AEs. Renal AEs were reduced in the LD-MTX group (HR, 0.85 [CI, 0.78 to 0.93]).

Limitation

The trial was done in patients without rheumatic disease who tolerated LD-MTX during an active run-in period.

Conclusion

Use of LD-MTX was associated with small to moderate elevations in risks for skin cancer and gastrointestinal, infectious, pulmonary, and hematologic AEs, whereas renal AEs were decreased.

### Connectivity of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway in survivors of childhood leukemia treated with chemotherapy only [^11645PWo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treatment with contemporary chemotherapy-only protocols, which include high doses of methotrexate and glucocorticoids (ie, prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone), is associated with increased risk for neurocognitive impairment. Previously, we examined supratentorial connectivity in survivors of ALL treated with chemotherapy only and found that poor network segregation and specialization of brain regions were associated with increased numbers of triple-therapy (ie, methotrexate, glucocorticoid, and cytarabine) intrathecal administrations and executive dysfunction. Additionally, among survivors of childhood ALL, female sex has been associated with higher frequency of executive dysfunction. The pathophysiology underlying this association remains unclear.

Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and methotrexate is associated with blocking or depleting key enzymes in the glutathione antioxidant pathway via direct or indirect action. Glucocorticoids are associated with decreased activity of glutathione peroxidase in the antioxidant pathway, which is associated with decreased cellular ability to clear oxidants. Glucocorticoids are indirectly associated with increased sensitivity of brain cells to glutamate toxicity via presynaptic glutamate release. Excess glutamate is associated with inhibition among cystine/glutamate transporters, which is associated with decreased levels of glutathione and accumulation of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species. Methotrexate is associated with decreased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the pentose phosphate cycle and glutathione reductase activity, which is important for preventing intracellular accumulation of peroxide. This double hit, in glucocorticoid receptor–rich brain regions, may be associated with antioxidant/oxidant imbalance and accumulation of peroxide. Consistent with our model, we previously reported the association of increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of oxidized phosphatidylcholine (a marker associated with oxidative stress) with induction treatment and consolidation among survivors of ALL treated with chemotherapy only. These increased levels were associated with neurocognitive deficits in working memory, organization, and attention. We suggested that neural networks rich in glucocorticoid receptors may be particularly at risk of damage from methotrexate and glucocorticoid exposure in survivors of ALL.

Methotrexate — male fertility notes that methotrexate is not mutagenic but spermatogenesis studies in rats suggest that it may be toxic to cells undergoing division, and in human beings there is controversy regarding the effect of methotrexate on spermatogenesis while teratogenicity in fetuses fathered by men on methotrexate is unclear because of a lack of data. Although some studies suggest severe, yet reversible, oligospermia despite normal hormone levels and other studies reveal no changes in spermatogenesis and sperm counts, one cycle of spermatogenesis requires 74 days and it is appropriate for male patients to wait 3 months after discontinuing methotrexate before attempting to conceive a child to allow for the methotrexate effects to be eliminated.

Methotrexate — pulmonary uses, evidence base, and toxicity: Methotrexate is approved in the United States for use in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and several malignancies, and in pulmonary diseases it has been described most often for use either in sarcoidosis as a steroid-sparing agent or for disease unresponsive to corticosteroids; besides sarcoidosis, RCTs have suggested a role for methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent in chronic asthma. The document notes scope of evidence with Table 33 summarizes 15 RCTs and Table 34 summarizes 14 open-label trials in which methotrexate was studied for pulmonary diseases and where information regarding toxicity was presented. Major toxicities with methotrexate include liver damage, pneumonitis, and cytopenias, other common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, rash, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and alopecia, and most large RCTs have monitored subjective complaints for 1 to 2 years.

### Risk stratified monitoring for methotrexate toxicity in immune mediated inflammatory diseases: prognostic model development and validation using primary care data from the UK [^115rQjYi]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Low dose methotrexate, administered weekly, is the first line glucocorticoid sparing drug used to treat immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and cutaneous psoriasis resistant to topical treatment or phototherapy. Methotrexate is also used in the treatment of steroid dependent inflammatory bowel disease and is often combined with biological medicines to optimise efficacy and prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies. Methotrexate use has increased in the era of biologics, with only a few patients (about 3%) with rheumatoid arthritis or with psoriasis with or without arthritis prescribed biologics in European countries.

Although effective and well tolerated, methotrexate can cause cytopenia, raised liver enzyme levels, and acute kidney injury, mostly during the first few months of treatment. Concern about these side effects has led to the recommendation to perform blood tests every two to four weeks to monitor patients for full blood count, liver function, and urea electrolytes and creatinine during the initial few months of treatment, followed thereafter by tests every three months for everyone. However, no evidence base supports the use of three monthly blood tests in the early detection of liver, blood, or kidney toxicity during long term methotrexate treatment.

We previously reported that clinically significant cytopenia, raised liver enzyme levels, and acute kidney injury that required methotrexate discontinuation were infrequent after the first year of methotrexate treatment. Indeed, many abnormalities detected during the monitoring of blood tests for long term methotrexate treatment are subsequently found to be due to an intercurrent illness or its treatment. Nevertheless, the detection of these abnormalities causes anxiety, requires repeat testing, and may result in treatment interruption that results in a disease flare-up. Unnecessary blood tests waste patient's time and healthcare resources, including the time of general practitioners and phlebotomists.

It would be beneficial to predict the risk of clinically significant abnormal blood test results during long term methotrexate treatment to inform the frequency of testing for individuals. To better understand this risk, we developed and validated a prognostic model for estimating the probability of clinically significant methotrexate toxicity during long term treatment and stratifying those at greatest and least risk.

### Methotrexate (Xatmep) [^112cYzgz]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Excretion

Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With IV administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed.

Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in patients at doses between 7.5 mg and 30 mg. Impaired renal function, as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion, can markedly increase methotrexate serum levels.

Methotrexate clearance decreases at higher doses. Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity. When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function, a third-space effusion, or other causes, methotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112QmbQM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) — general use, adverse effects, and hypersensitivity states that MTX is an antifolate chemotherapy and immunosuppressant agent used for the management of osteosarcoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and rheumatoid arthritis, along with other autoimmune diseases in adults and children, and that it inhibits the activity of dihydrofolate reductase, which is needed for de novo purine synthesis. Adverse effects, more commonly seen with high doses used in cancer therapy, include abdominal cramping, malaise, mucositis, myelosuppression, and renal and hepatic toxicity, and MTX pneumonitis that can progress to interstitial fibrosis has also been reported. Although the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction is unknown, it is likely rare, and case reports of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been described.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors for low dose methotrexate toxicity: a cohort of 28 patients [^114sAgFA]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Low dose (10–25 mg/week) methotrexate is widely used for the management of systemic inflammatory diseases, and is considered to be relatively safe. Toxicity due to low dose MTX has been reported but is poorly characterized. We describe the clinical features, risk factors, and outcomes of low dose MTX toxicity in a large case series at our center.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective case series of all adult (> 18 years) patients hospitalized at Sheba Medical Center, between 2005 and 2012 for low dose MTX toxicity.

Results

We identified 28 patients (age: 70.4 ± 13.7 years, range: 33–88; 20 (71%) females) hospitalized for low dose MTX toxicity. Indications for MTX therapy included: rheumatoid arthritis (39.2%), psoriasis ± arthritis (21.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica (10.8%) and other inflammatory conditions (28.5%). Pancytopenia was the most common manifestation of low dose MTX toxicity detected in 78.5% of the patients. Potential risk factors included acute renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, concurrent use of drugs known to interact with MTX, and dose errors. Serum MTX concentrations (n = 20, mean 0.04 ± 0.07 μg/mL range: 0–0.3) did not correlate with the degree of either neutropenia (r = -0.36; p = 0.18) or thrombocytopenia (r = 0.44; p = 0.10). Seven (25%) patients died, all from pancytopenia followed by sepsis. Serum MTX concentrations did not differ between the patients who died from MTX toxicity (n = 6; mean: 0.05 ± 0.04 μg/mL) and those who survived the toxicity (n = 14 mean 0.04 ± 0.08; p = 0.45).

Conclusions

Low-dose MTX toxicity can be life threatening, mainly due to myelosuppression. There is no rationale for MTX therapeutic drug monitoring in the setting of low-dose toxicity.

### Low-dose methotrexate and serious adverse events among older adults with chronic kidney disease [^11587ZQ9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there a higher 90-day risk of serious adverse events among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who start low-dose methotrexate vs hydroxychloroquine?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 4618 propensity-matched adults with CKD, the 90-day risk of serious adverse events among those who started low-dose methotrexate vs hydroxychloroquine was 3.55% vs 1.73%, a statistically significant difference.

Meaning

In this study, adults with CKD who started low-dose methotrexate had a higher 90-day risk of serious adverse events compared with those who started hydroxychloroquine.

### Evaluation of toxicity after acute accidental methotrexate ingestions in children under 6 years old: a 16-year multi-center review [^114tyoPf]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

There is little data on the frequency of adverse events following acute methotrexate ingestions in pediatric patients. Likewise, recommendations for observation length, site and management strategies in this population are not well established. Therefore, most recommendations are modeled after management of chronic overdose in patients with underlying medical conditions.

Objective

The primary objective of this study is to determine the frequency of acute toxicity after acute methotrexate accidental unsupervised ingestions in patients less than six years. In addition, we describe the frequency of late toxicity and characterize the management site and approaches.

This is a retrospective cohort study of pediatric accidental unsupervised methotrexate ingestions reported to six poison centers in the United States over a 16 year period. Demographic information, exposure details, signs, symptoms, treatments, length and location of observation and outcomes were collected.

Results

103 patients met inclusion criteria. Methotrexate dose was reported in 86 patients (84%) and ranged from 1.3mg-75mg. The majority of cases (97%) ingested a dose ≤ 20mg. The significant majority of cases experienced no clinical effects (99 of 103 cases; 96%). Three children experienced minor outcome (3%). There were no patients with a major outcome or death.

Conclusions

The incidence of toxicity from pediatric single, acute ingestions of methotrexate is rare and when it occurs is generally limited to no or only minimally concerning effects. Because concentrations from single ingestions were consistent with low subtoxic exposures, we believe that home monitoring without hospital referral and without methotrexate specific therapy is reasonable in those with acute ingestions up to 20mg.

### Maintenance of clinical remission in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^116vmTPe]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

A fundamental change in management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis in the past 10 years is the early focussed use of aggressive immunosuppression, using regimens comprised of widely available medications. Using a clinical framework to quantify morbidity, we can induce remission in most patients within 3–6 months using glucocorticoids plus methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or rituximab, with additional plasmapheresis when indicated. Difficulty in maintaining remission probably relates to the difference between true pathophysiological remission and the absence of clinical, serological or radiological evidence of disease activity. For surviving patients, the cumulative problems of relapse, burden of disease, or its treatment are coupled with pre-existing diseases or new conditions arising since diagnosis. Initial early control should reduce subsequent damage, but what effect it will have on relapse is not clear. In the absence of a cure, future trials should focus on reducing toxicity and comorbidity as well as controlling disease.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^115tTXEe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SEVERE TOXIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY AND DEATH

Rasuvo should be used only by physicians whose knowledge and experience include the use of antimetabolite therapy. Because of the possibility of serious toxic reactions (which can be fatal), Rasuvo should be used only in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis with severe, recalcitrant, disabling disease which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy. Deaths have been reported with the use of methotrexate in the treatment of malignancy, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Patients should be closely monitored for bone marrow, liver, lung, skin, and kidney toxicities. Patients should be informed by their physician of the risks involved and be under a physician's care throughout therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity, including fetal death. Use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with Rasuvo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Contraindications (4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal functions, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Rasuvo administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia, and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions(7.1)].
Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. Liver biopsy after sustained use often shows histologic changes, and fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported; these latter lesions may not be preceded by symptoms or abnormal liver function tests in the psoriasis population. For this reason, periodic liver biopsies are usually recommended for psoriatic patients who are under long-term treatment. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Methotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses. It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy: otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue Rasuvo first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce "tumor lysis syndrome" in patients with rapidly growing tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Low-dose methotrexate-induced ulcerated psoriatic plaques: a rare case [^113Jd6bW]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Methotrexate, an analog of folate that competitively and irreversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, is eliminated primarily by the kidneys, with 60% to 95% excreted unchanged. Therefore, the potential factors in the development of toxicity might include folate deficiency, drugs that impair folate absorption (eg, barbiturates, nitrofurantoin), drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ethanol) or decrease glomerular filtration (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or drugs that lower tubular secretion (eg, aspirin, penicillin, sulfonamides, colchicine). Also, approximately 50% of methotrexate within the blood is protein bound. Low serum albumin and medications that displace methotrexate from albumin (eg, phenytoin, tetracycline, sulfonamides, barbiturates, probenecid, salicylates, chloramphenicol, sulfonylureas) are likely to induce methotrexate toxicity. Other risk factors include alteration in dose (initiation, re-initiation, escalation in dose), advanced age, infections, diabetes mellitus, and psoriatic flares.

Methotrexate prescriptions

In the United Kingdom, the initial prescription for methotrexate and dose escalation occurs in hospital out-patient clinics. During this period, hospital specialists organise the monitoring of blood tests and respond to abnormal results. Once a patient's treatment is established — that is, a stable, well tolerated, and effective methotrexate dose is reached, typically about six months after the start of treatment, GPs take on the responsibility of prescribing for and monitoring patients with periodic blood tests according to NHS shared care protocols. During shared care prescribing, GPs seek advice about side effects from hospital specialists, including abnormal blood test results, and the hospital specialists direct changes to treatment.

Start of follow-up

Patients were followed-up from 180 days after their first prescription for methotrexate in primary care to the earliest of outcome, drug discontinuation for any reason, leaving the practice, last data collection from the practice, death, five years, or 31 December 2019.

Outcome

The outcome of interest was methotrexate toxicity associated drug discontinuation, defined as a prescription gap of ≥ 90 days with either an abnormal blood test result or a diagnostic code for an abnormal blood test result within ± 60 days of the last prescription date. The thresholds for abnormal blood test results were: total leucocyte count < 3.5×10⁹/L, neutrophil count < 1.6×10⁹/L, platelet count < 140×10⁹/L, alanine transaminase and/or aspartate transaminase > 100 IU/mL, and decline in kidney function, defined as either progression of chronic kidney disease based on medical codes recorded by the GP, or > 26 μmol/L increase in creatinine concentration, the threshold for consideration of acute kidney injury. In our previous validation study, only 5.4% of abnormal blood test results in this time window were potentially explained by another illness.

### Recent insights in the pharmacological actions of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^114pgbkb]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

This review presents recent data supporting the methotrexate (MTX) mechanisms of action, which are likely to account for its anti-proliferative and immunosuppressive effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The effects of MTX in vivo may be mediated by reducing cell proliferation, increasing the rate of apoptosis of T cells, increasing endogenous adenosine release, altering the expression of cellular adhesion molecules, influencing production of cytokines, humoral responses and bone formation. Several reports indicate that the effects of MTX are influenced by genetic variants, specific dynamic processes and micro-environmental elements such as nucleotide deprivation or glutathione levels. The challenge for the future will be linking biological and genetic markers relevant to the response to MTX in RA.

### Fatal low-dose methotrexate toxicity: a case report and literature review [^116xnY8Y]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent that acts primarily by inhibiting the folic acid cycle. In addition to its application for treating malignancies, MTX is also used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. Adverse effects have been reported even at low doses (up to 25mg/week), and there is risk of toxicity in the form of myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, or pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we report a case of a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, mucositis, and mucocutaneous ulcers and erosions. The patient was taking methotrexate 10mg weekly without folic acid supplementation and was found to be pancytopenic. Despite treatment, the patient developed multiorgan failure and passed away after 16days of hospitalization. Myelosuppression is considered the most serious side effect with the highest risk of mortality. Risk factors for toxicity include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, drug interactions, and medication errors. Importantly, serum levels of MTX do not correlate with toxicity; therefore, folinic acid rescue therapy should be started as soon as MTX toxicity is suspected. MTX toxicity is rare with low dose, proper dose scheduling, and adherence to the recommended guidelines. It is imperative that physicians considering therapy with low dose MTX for dermatologic indications take into consideration a patient's risk factors for toxicity and monitor appropriately.

### Patient characteristics associated with high-risk methotrexate concentrations and toxicity… [^113hgAwo]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Following high-dose methotrexate treatment, delayed MTX elimination is an important problem because it necessitates increased leucovorin rescue and additional hospitalization for hydration and urinary alkalinization. Our purpose was to identify factors associated with high-risk MTX plasma concentrations and with toxicity. Patients and Methods Variables associated with MTX concentrations and toxicity were assessed in 134 children treated with one to five courses of HD-MTX for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Results High-risk MTX concentrations, toxicity, and delay in resuming continuation chemotherapy occurred in 106, 123, and 66 of 481 courses, respectively.

Using a mixed effects model for repeated measures, high-risk MTX concentrations were significantly associated with a higher MTX area-under-the-concentration-time curve, low urine pH, emesis, low MTX clearance, low urine output relative to intake, use of antiemetics during the MTX infusion, and concurrent intrathecal therapy. Clinical toxicities and delay in resumption of continuation chemotherapy due to myelosuppression were more common in those with high 42-hour MTX concentrations, despite increased leucovorin rescue for all patients with high-risk MTX concentrations. However, with individualized rescue, no patient developed life-threatening toxicity. A more aggressive hydration and alkalinization regimen for subsequent courses reduced the frequency of high-risk MTX concentrations to 7% of courses, and the frequency of toxicity decreased to 11% of courses.

Conclusion This study identified several clinical variables that influence MTX disposition that, when modified, can reduce the frequency of high-risk MTX concentrations and toxicity.

### Methotrexate-induced renal impairment: clinical studies and rescue from systemic toxicity with high-dose leucovorin and thymidine… [^114L2tcZ]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Four separate groups of patients have been studied: The effect of high-dose methotrexate administration on glomerular filtration rate was determined by pre- and posttreatment inulin and creatinine clearances in nine patients. Measurements were made prior to and 24–40 hr after drug administration. Inulin and creatinine clearances both decreased a mean of 43%. No signs of systemic toxicity occurred. Three other patients given high-dose courses of MTX developed MTX toxicity. Their creatinine clearance decreased an average of 61%. In a separate group of five patients undergoing weekly MTX treatment, comparison of serum MTX pharmacokinetics with and without alkalinization of the urine demonstrated no significant difference in peak serum MTX levels or serum MTX decay.

Eight additional patients with severe renal dysfunction secondary to MTX were treated with increased doses of leucovorin and a continuous infusion of thymidine once renal failure was recognized. When high-dose leucovorin and thymidine were begun 48–72 hr after the MTX infusion, severe toxicity in the form of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse mucositis, stomatitis, or skin rash was averted. We concluded the following: high-dose MTX causes a subclinical decrease in glomerular filtration rate with each administration, even in nontoxic courses; alkalinization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate does not alter plasma MTX decay, while volume expansion is maintained constant; and rigorous monitoring of serum creatinine and serum MTX levels 24–48 hr after MTX administration allows for the institution of rescue measures, including leucovorin and thymidine, which will abort the systemic toxicity that accompanies MTX-induced renal failure.
