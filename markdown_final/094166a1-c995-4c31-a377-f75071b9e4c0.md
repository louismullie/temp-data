## Question

test e vs testosterone cypionate dosing equivalents

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dosing equivalence between testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate and how to switch between them safely and accurately. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing ranges for each ester. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic differences that might justify a conversion factor. Next, I will examine clinical trial and practice data on weekly and biweekly regimens. After that, I need to consider molecular-weight differences and whether they meaningfully alter testosterone delivery per milligram. Finally, I will synthesize practical switching guidance with appropriate monitoring and safety considerations, making sure I confirm each step against the labels and peer-reviewed data.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-approved dosing language, because if the labels align, that strongly suggests dose equivalence at a population level. For adult male hypogonadism, testosterone enanthate is labeled 50–400 mg intramuscularly every 2–4 weeks, and the product narrative notes prolonged action supporting that interval, which is consistent with standard practice patterns [^112qXEzx] [^111bQ6Xt]. I should double-check cypionate next; the FDA labeling also specifies 50–400 mg intramuscularly every 2–4 weeks, mirroring enanthate, and the SPL reiterates the same range, which supports parallel labeled dosing for both esters [^114kkr5h] [^115SqbcH].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic descriptors to see if one ester requires a systematic conversion. The enanthate label emphasizes slow absorption from the lipid phase and allows 2–4 week spacing but does not specify a numeric elimination half-life, describing it as prolonged, which pragmatically supports longer dosing intervals without mandating a unique schedule compared to cypionate [^111bQ6Xt]. In contrast, the cypionate label lists an approximate intramuscular half-life of about 8 days and also endorses 2–4 week dosing intervals, suggesting both esters function as long-acting depots suitable for identical schedules in practice [^115BPfjx] [^114kkr5h]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; similar intervals do not automatically prove milligram-for-milligram equivalence, so I should examine real-world regimens next.

> I will now examine clinical dosing regimens that clinicians actually use. A comparative cohort treated cypionate 100 mg IM weekly versus an enanthate subcutaneous autoinjector 100 mg weekly with similar trough total testosterone responses, implying no need for a milligram conversion at that weekly dose level between the two commonly used preparations and routes in practice [^115zm9sV]. Let me cross-check with the enanthate autoinjector pivotal data; those programs frequently initiated 75 mg SC weekly and titrated to 50–100 mg weekly to a trough target of roughly 350–650 ng/dL, again consistent with weekly 100 mg as a standard anchor dose for steady maintenance, and indirectly supportive of parallel weekly dosing amounts with cypionate in common practice [^112m6UVh]. A randomized trial using intramuscular cypionate 200 mg every 2 weeks further reflects a widely used "200 mg Q2W" regimen that aligns with the upper end of the labeled interval, reinforcing shared schedules across esters [^112b87mw].

> Hmm, wait a minute — do molecular-weight differences undermine a 1:1 milligram approach. Testosterone cypionate has a molecular weight of about 412.6 g/mol, while testosterone enanthate is about 400.6 g/mol, meaning that per milligram of the ester, cypionate contains slightly more ester mass and therefore slightly less free testosterone than enanthate after hydrolysis, not more — I almost misstated that, so I should correct myself here to be precise [^115uBHNc] [^115mdiQ9]. Hold on, I should verify whether any label or trial provides a formal conversion factor; I do not see any mandated conversion in labels or high-credibility sources, suggesting that the magnitude of this molecular difference is clinically negligible for routine dosing and monitoring in adult hypogonadism [^112qXEzx] [^114kkr5h].

> Let me think about practical switching. I should confirm whether a dose adjustment is required when converting from enanthate to cypionate (or vice versa). No FDA label language requires a conversion factor, and the literature using parallel milligram dosing regimens supports a pragmatic 1:1 milligram switch at the same interval, with subsequent titration to clinical response and serum testosterone goals, which is consistent with label guidance to individualize dosing by response and adverse effects rather than by strict formulaic conversion [^112qXEzx] [^114kkr5h]. But wait, what if the patient is on weekly dosing; the comparative study using 100 mg weekly across modalities supports maintaining the same weekly milligram amount and then rechecking troughs to fine-tune the dose, which I should emphasize as best practice [^115zm9sV].

> Next, I should review how and when to monitor to ensure equivalence after switching. I need to check typical targets and timing; while labels do not prescribe a single universal target level, concentration-guided titration using a trough sample is standard, and subcutaneous enanthate programs have operationalized trough targets of approximately 350–650 ng/dL with weekly dosing, providing a reasonable framework for adjusting either ester after a 1:1 switch based on troughs and symptoms [^112m6UVh] [^115L1TUM]. I should double-check that trough timing is consistent; for weekly regimens, sampling just before the next injection is appropriate, while for biweekly schedules, a mid- to late-interval sample can help detect nadirs and peak–trough variability to inform adjustments, consistent with label direction to tailor dose and interval to the patient's response [^112qXEzx] [^114kkr5h].

> I will now examine safety considerations that might differ by regimen even if doses are equivalent. Intramuscular short-acting esters such as cypionate or enanthate can produce higher peak-to-trough swings that associate with greater hematocrit increases compared with some alternative delivery systems, so when switching but maintaining the same milligram dose, I should still monitor hematocrit and consider interval adjustments to smooth peaks if needed, which is supported by network meta-analysis and comparative data against intranasal or subcutaneous approaches [^113AVqwA] [^112b87mw]. Hold on, I should verify the broader cardiovascular context; meta-analyses have not shown significant cardiovascular risk with intramuscular routes compared with placebo when routes are pooled, whereas oral formulations may carry higher risk, though individual patient risk assessment remains essential during testosterone therapy [^114DeEjX].

> Let me reconsider whether any credible source contradicts a 1:1 mg approach. I should confirm that neither label warns against interchangeability of enanthate and cypionate at equivalent milligram doses; I see no such warning, and in fact both labels emphasize adjusting dose by clinical and biochemical response, which implicitly accommodates a same-milligram switch with planned follow-up labs to verify equivalence for the individual patient [^112qXEzx] [^114kkr5h]. If anything, practice-based data using identical weekly milligram amounts across esters and routes reinforces that approach, provided we verify outcomes with trough testosterone and safety labs after the switch [^115zm9sV] [^112m6UVh].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure my synthesis is precise. For adult hypogonadism, testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate share the same FDA-labeled intramuscular dosing range of 50–400 mg every 2–4 weeks, and clinicians commonly use the same milligram regimens for both esters, such as 100 mg weekly or 200 mg every 2 weeks, without a mandated conversion factor; a 1:1 milligram switch is reasonable, followed by titration to trough testosterone and clinical response with standard safety monitoring including hematocrit and blood pressure checks, and interval adjustments if peak–trough variability is problematic [^112qXEzx] [^114kkr5h] [^115zm9sV] [^112b87mw] [^113AVqwA].

Testosterone enanthate and cypionate are **clinically interchangeable** for TRT, with **equivalent dosing** because their pharmacokinetics and clinical effects are nearly identical. Both are dosed at 50–400 mg IM every 2–4 weeks [^112qXEzx], with typical maintenance of 100–200 mg every 1–2 weeks. Small differences in half-life (enanthate ~4.5 days [^1179nr16], cypionate ~8 days [^115BPfjx]) are not clinically significant, so **no dose adjustment is needed** when switching between them. Dosing should be individualized to maintain mid-normal testosterone levels, with regular monitoring of testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA.

### Testosterone enanthate [^112qXEzx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating testosterone enanthate injection, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

Dosage and duration of therapy with testosterone enanthate injection will depend on age, sex, diagnosis, patient's response to treatment, and the appearance of adverse effects. When properly administered, injections of testosterone enanthate are well tolerated. Care should be taken to slowly inject the preparation deeply into the gluteal muscle, being sure to follow the usual precautions for intramuscular administration, such as the avoidance of intravascular injection [see PRECAUTIONS].

In general, total doses above 400 mg per month are not required because of the prolonged action of the preparation. Injections more frequently than every two weeks are rarely indicated. Note: Use of a wet needle or wet syringe may cause the solution to become cloudy; however, this does not affect the potency of the material. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Testosterone enanthate injection is a clear, colorless to pale yellow oily solution.

- **Male hypogonadism**: As replacement therapy, i.e. for eunuchism, the suggested dosage is 50 to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks.

### Testosterone cypionate [^115BPfjx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. When testosterone esters in oil are injected intramuscularly, they are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase. Consequently, testosterone cypionate can be administered at intervals of two to four weeks. Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, and about 2 percent is free. Generally, the concentration of this sex-hormone binding globulin in plasma determines the distribution of testosterone between the free and bound forms, influencing its half-life.

Approximately 90 percent of a testosterone dose is excreted in urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites. About 6 percent is excreted in feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone primarily occurs in the liver, where it is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The half-life of testosterone cypionate, when injected intramuscularly, is approximately eight days.

In many tissues, the activity of testosterone depends on its reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is then transported to the nucleus, initiating transcription events and cellular changes associated with androgen action.

### Testosterone cypionate [^114kkr5h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

Prior to initiating testosterone cypionate, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range. Testosterone cypionate injection is for intramuscular use only. It should not be given intravenously; intramuscular injections should be given deep in the gluteal muscle.

The suggested dosage for testosterone cypionate injection varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance of adverse reactions. Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males. Some experts have advocated lower dosages initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes, and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose.

For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage at temperature.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^1179nr16]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for male hypogonadism involves several medicines. Androgenic drugs are among the most frequently used formulations in adolescents, including testosterone esters such as enanthate, cypionate, and propionate. These are available as oil-based compounds intended for slow-release intramuscular (IM) injections. Testosterone enanthate is offered in 200- or 250-mg ampoules or ready-to-use syringes. It has a half-life of 4.5 days and is cleared 90% through the kidneys and 10% through the bile. Testosterone cypionate is available in 100-mg or 200-mg vials, with a half-life of 4 days. A mixture of 100 mg decanoate, 60 mg isocaproate, 60 mg phenylpropionate, and 30 mg propionate is provided in 250-mg ampoules. IM testosterone undecanoate has not been used in pediatric patients due to its long-acting period.

In adolescents over 12 years old, the anabolic as well as androgenic effects induced by replacement therapy are expected to mimic the timing and tempo observed during normal pubertal development. That is, androgen supplementation should begin at low doses with progressive increases, aiming to attain adult testosterone serum levels in 2 to 3 years. This progression, approximately one Tanner stage annually, helps avoid a premature early closure of the epiphyses. The most commonly used protocols with testosterone enanthate or cypionate start with an initial dose of 50–100 mg every 4 weeks. Due to the pharmacokinetics of these formulations, circulating testosterone reaches supraphysiological levels in the first week after IM injection and subphysiological levels in the fourth week.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^114G6eEa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Two approaches were taken to determine the optimal time for assessing circulating testosterone based on a single blood sample after the morning oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) dose. This was aimed at providing dosing guidance for oral TU in real-world clinical settings, where testosterone response to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is determined from a single blood sample.

First, extensive simulation and modeling of pharmacokinetic (PK) data were used to identify a discrete blood sampling range (e.g. 4 to 6 hours after oral TU) that would consistently yield a testosterone value closely matching the actual testosterone average concentration based on serial PK samples. The population PK of testosterone following oral TU dosing was modeled using a one-compartment model with first order absorption following a time lag, a central volume of distribution, and first order clearance. Inter-subject and inter-occasion variability were incorporated into the time-lag, absorption, volume, and clearance parameters. Testing of each candidate blood sample collection time and choice of cut-off thresholds utilized 1,000 simulated patients who were run through the protocol-designated TU dose titration schedule and maintenance treatment period. The aforementioned sources of inter-occasion variability introduced random variability among the multiple testosterone concentration assessments made for each simulated subject.

Second, concordance analysis was performed to identify the best post-dose testosterone assay time-point to guide any necessary dose-adjustments in oral TU patients. Concordance is defined herein to describe the extent of agreement between a decision-making process and the observed data.

### Testosterone cypionate [^113Sk1sn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy may develop acute urethral obstruction. Priapism or excessive sexual stimulation may occur. Oligospermia may result from prolonged administration or excessive dosage. If any of these effects appear, the androgen should be stopped, and if restarted, a lower dosage should be utilized. Testosterone cypionate should not be used interchangeably with testosterone propionate due to differences in duration of action. Additionally, testosterone cypionate is not for intravenous use.

Patients should be instructed to report any occurrence of nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, ankle swelling, or frequent and persistent erections. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be periodically checked in patients receiving long-term androgen administration to detect polycythemia. Serum cholesterol may increase during androgen therapy.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. The dosage of the anticoagulant may require reduction to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia.
	- Concomitant administration of oxyphenbutazone as well as androgens may elevate serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
	- In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements.

- **Drug/laboratory test interferences**:
	- Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged.

### Adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in men during testosterone treatment: an individual patient and aggregate data meta-analysis [^116CaR55]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Testosterone is the standard treatment for male hypogonadism. However, there is uncertainty about its cardiovascular safety due to inconsistent findings. We aimed to provide the most extensive individual participant dataset (IPD) of testosterone trials available, to analyze subtypes of all cardiovascular events observed during treatment, and to investigate the effect of incorporating data from trials that did not provide IPD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials including IPD. A comprehensive search was performed in databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Review of Effects, covering literature from 1992 onwards (search conducted on August 27, 2018). The following inclusion criteria were applied:
	1. Men aged 18 years and older with a screening testosterone concentration of 12 nmol/L (350 ng/dL) or less.
	2. The intervention of interest was treatment with any testosterone formulation, dose frequency, and route of administration, for a minimum duration of 3 months.
	3. A comparator of placebo treatment.
	4. Studies assessing the pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes of interest.

Details of study design, interventions, participants, and outcome measures were extracted from published articles, and anonymized IPD was requested from investigators of all identified trials. The primary outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events at any time during follow-up.

### Randomized cross-over clinical trial of injectable vs. implantable depot testosterone for maintenance of testosterone replacement therapy in androgen deficient men [^1153Kc1o]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Life-long testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for younger men with organic androgen deficiency is best provided by depot testosterone (T) products. This study directly compared the two long-acting depot T products: subdermal T implants (TI) and injectable T undecanoate (TU) for maintenance of TRT.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Men with organic androgen deficiency (n = 38) undergoing regular TRT at an academic andrology center were recruited for a two-period, randomized sequence, cross-over clinical trial without an intervening wash-out period of TRT maintenance.

- **Outcomes**: For both depot T products, their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were evaluated using a range of androgen-sensitive clinical, laboratory, and quality of life measures as well as preference for ongoing treatment after experience with both products.

- **Results**: The two depot T products had distinct pharmacokinetics and were not bioequivalent. However, there were no consistent clinical differences in a comprehensive range of pharmacodynamic measures reflecting androgen effects on biochemistry, hematology, muscle mass and strength, quality of life, mood, and sexual function. The majority (91%) of participants chose TU over TI at study completion.

- **Conclusion**: Despite significant pharmacokinetic differences, the two depot T products are clinically interchangeable, allowing for choice dependent on patient and physician delivery preference in practice, but most patients preferred the injectable over the implantable form.

### Long vs short acting testosterone treatments: A look at the risks [^112UZF2p]. Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Prescriptions for testosterone therapy (TT) to treat testosterone deficiency have increased in recent years. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the risks of several treatment modalities to better counsel patients. Both short-acting and long-acting TT have been shown to restore normal serum testosterone levels and improve symptoms of testosterone deficiency. Short-acting pharmacology mimics normal physiology more closely than long-acting TT but requires multiple doses per day. Long-acting TT has a higher rate of patient adherence but is more likely to create supraphysiologic serum testosterone and pathologic sequelae.

### The effect of route of testosterone on changes in hematocrit: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113AVqwA]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Low credibility.

We sought to compare testosterone formulations and determine the degree to which hematocrit increases vary by testosterone therapy formulation. As head-to-head trials are rare, network meta-analysis of contemporary studies is the only way to compare hematocrit changes by testosterone type, including topical gels and patches, injectables (both short-acting and long-acting), and oral tablets.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a thorough search of listed publications in Scopus®, PubMed®, Embase®, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 29 placebo-controlled randomized trials (3,393 men) met the inclusion criteria for analysis of mean hematocrit change after testosterone therapy. Randomized controlled trial data for the following formulations of testosterone were pooled via network meta-analysis: gel, patch, oral testosterone undecanoate, intramuscular testosterone undecanoate, and intramuscular testosterone enanthate/cypionate.

- **Results**: All types of testosterone therapies resulted in statistically significant increases in mean hematocrit when compared with placebo. Meta-analysis revealed all formulations, including gel (3.0%, 95% CI 1.8–4.3), oral testosterone undecanoate (4.3%, 0.7–8.0), patch (1.4%, 0.2–2.6), intramuscular testosterone enanthate/cypionate (4.0%, 2.9–5.1), and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate (1.6%, 0.3–3.0), resulted in statistically significant increases in mean hematocrit when compared with placebo. When comparing all formulations against one another, intramuscular testosterone cypionate/enanthate was associated with a significantly higher increase in mean hematocrit.

### Safety of a new subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector: Results of a 26-week study [^112m6UVh]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with testosterone deficiency (TD) can be treated with exogenous testosterone (T) to achieve and maintain physiologic T levels and prevent negative clinical symptoms. With many testosterone replacement therapies currently available, this registration safety study was conducted to further characterize the clinical profile of chronically administered, concentration-guided subcutaneous testosterone enanthate (TE) dosing.

- **Aim**: The purpose of this study was to confirm the safety and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the subcutaneous TE auto-injector (SCTE-AI) in adult men with TD.

- **Methods**: In this phase III, 26-week study, 133 men aged 18–75 years with symptomatic TD self-administered SCTE-AI 75 mg once weekly for 6 weeks from July 2015 to June 2016. Dosing was adjusted when indicated to 50 mg or 100 mg to maintain T trough levels between 350 and 650 ng/dL (12.1–22.5 nmol/L). PK data were collected from a subgroup of patients receiving 75 mg SCTE-AI through week 12. Safety, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), lipid levels, adverse drug reactions, and PK were assessed.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes were the documentation of the reproducibility of trough concentration-guided exposure to SCTE, 6-month safety profile, and PK data for the 75 mg dose SCTE.

- **Results**: In total, 34 patients (25.6%) experienced adverse drug reactions. The most frequently reported were increased hematocrit (≥ 52%) in 10 patients (7.5%), injection-site hemorrhage in 6 patients (4.5%), and injection-site bruising in 4 patients (3.0%).

### Longitudinal changes in liver enzyme levels among transgender people receiving gender affirming hormone therapy [^1131J9HG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Four US-based studies and one study from Belgium evaluated the effects of shorter-acting testosterone esters given as weekly or biweekly injections at doses ranging from 25 to 300 mg. All but one of these studies relied on retrospective chart review. The only study with prospective follow-up was based on a relatively small cohort (n = 12) of patients who received masculinizing GAHT at a clinical center in Boston, MA. The average ALT levels in that study increased from 19 IU/L at baseline to 24 IU/L after 12 months of treatment with 50–125 mg of testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate injected every two weeks. The corresponding increase for AST was from 21 to 25 IU/L; however, none of the observed differences were statistically significant due to the small sample size. Statistically significant upward trends in ALT and AST concentrations following weekly or biweekly testosterone injections were also reported in a study from Ghent, Belgium, and in a recent study from Dallas, TX. By contrast, two other US-based studies found no evidence that testosterone was associated with higher levels of either enzyme.

### Testosterone therapy with subcutaneous injections: A safe, practical, and reasonable option [^117F6xua]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Injections with intramuscular (IM) testosterone esters have been available for almost eight decades. They result in predictable serum testosterone levels and are the most inexpensive modality. However, IM injections are difficult to self-administer and may cause some discomfort. Recently, subcutaneous (SC) administration of testosterone esters has gained popularity because self-administration is easier with this route. Available data, though limited, support the feasibility of this method. This study reviews the pharmacokinetics and safety of SC testosterone therapy with both long- and ultralong-acting testosterone esters. Additionally, it provides guidance for clinicians on how to counsel and manage their patients who opt for the SC route.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Systematic review of available literature on SC testosterone administration, including clinical trials, case series, and case reports. The pharmacology of testosterone absorption after SC administration is also reviewed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Available evidence, though limited, suggests that SC testosterone therapy in doses similar to those given via the IM route results in comparable pharmacokinetics and mean serum testosterone levels. With appropriate training, patients should be able to safely self-administer testosterone esters SC with relative ease and less discomfort compared to the IM route.

- **Conclusion**: Although studies directly comparing the safety of SC versus IM administration of testosterone esters are desirable, clinicians should consider discussing the SC route with their patients because it is easier to self-administer.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^116ymx14]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean testosterone concentration (C avg) after two dose-adjustment cycles, with the objective being to demonstrate that at least 75% (with a lower 95% CI of 65%) of patients treated with oral TU (JATENZO ®) achieved a testosterone concentration average (C avg) in the eugonadal range of 252 to 907 ng/dL (9 to 31 nmol/L) for blood collected in NaF-EDTA tubes. A topical testosterone solution (i.e. Axiron ®) was used as the active testosterone comparator.

Peak testosterone concentrations (C max) were also measured over 24 hours at several points during the study and formed the basis of a secondary efficacy assessment based on FDA criteria. Specifically, testosterone-replacement products must yield a C max response that is in close alignment with the following targets: ≥ 85% of patients with a C max ≤ 2500 ng/dL (87 nmol/L). These C max categories were ostensibly based on the upper eugonadal limit in serum of 1000 ng/dL (35 nmol/L). However, the eugonadal testosterone range in NaF-EDTA plasma when assayed by LC/MS-MS only extended to 907 ng/dL. Therefore, C max was also evaluated (post hoc) in light of a second set of C max categories based on testosterone assays in this matrix, namely, ≥ 85% of patients with a C max ≤ 1361 ng/dL (47 nmol/L); ≤ 5% of patients with C max between 1633–2268 ng/dL (57–79 nmol/L); and no patients with a C max > 2268 ng/dL (79 nmol/L).

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^116kf7ge]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Transdermal testosterone formulations are the most frequently used in adults, but like IM formulations, they have not yet been approved for use in pediatric patients. Only a few studies are reported in the literature in prepubertal boys.

While the initial oral androgen formulations showed hepatotoxicity, testosterone undecanoate capsules avoid hepatic metabolism, and pilot studies have been reported in adolescents. Mucoadhesive tablets, designed to provide sustained testosterone release as they hydrate after inner cheek adhesion, have not been used in children or adolescents. Similarly, no experience exists in pediatric patients with a testosterone gel for intranasal administration, which features easy delivery and a low risk of transference.

Side effects commonly described for androgenic drugs used for long periods include erythrocytosis, irritability, acne, persistent erections, and gynecomastia due to aromatization to estrogens. One particular concern in pediatric ages is the potential acceleration of bone age, which compromises adult height. Early pubarche can also be observed.

### Circulating testosterone as the hormonal basis of sex differences in athletic performance [^112JeQc1]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Studies examining the ergogenic effects of supraphysiological concentrations of circulating testosterone necessitate research administering graded doses of exogenous testosterone over several months. Due to ethical concerns regarding the risks of unwanted virilization and hormone-dependent cancers, few studies have administered supraphysiological testosterone doses to healthy women.

One well-designed, randomized placebo-controlled study of postmenopausal women investigated different testosterone doses on muscle mass, performance, and physical function. Sixty-two women (mean age, 53 years) all received a standard estrogen-replacement dose during a 12-week run-in period (eliminating any hypothetical confounding effects of estrogen deficiency), after which they were randomized into one of five groups. These groups received weekly injections of testosterone enanthate in doses of 0, 3 mg, 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, and 25 mg, respectively, for 24 weeks.

The increasing testosterone doses produced an expected dose-response in serum testosterone concentrations (measured by LC-MS), with the highest dose (25 mg/week) resulting in a mean nadir concentration of 7.3 nmol/L. Women whose testosterone concentrations were increased to 7.3 nmol/L experienced significant increases in muscle mass and strength, ranging from 4.4% for muscle (lean) mass to between 12% and 26% for measures of muscle strength, including chest and leg presses and loaded stair climbs. As muscle strength measurement is effort-dependent, the placebo-controlled design of the Huang et al. study supports further interpretation that the observed effects were attributable to testosterone administration.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^114Aftya]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

As noted previously, in order to monitor testosterone (T) levels in patients receiving oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) using standard blood collection techniques (i.e. plain tube for serum T assay), it was necessary to derive a conversion factor that accounted for TU-to-T conversion in serum from blood that had clotted at room temperature versus NaF-EDTA blood collection tubes held on ice, which prevented this conversion (i.e. blood collection method as used in Phase 3 clinical trial). We have shown previously that the amount of T generated due to TU-to-T conversion is, in part, a function of TU concentration and that NaF directly decreased T levels assayed by LC/MS-MS when blood was collected into NaF-containing tubes.

Thus, we were able to calculate a conversion factor based on the regression equations or the estimated TU concentration 6 hours post-dose, namely, 52 ng/mL (obtained from a non-published study).

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^115yTexP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

There was no clinically significant difference in dose-normalized T \(C_{\text{avg}}\) among the meal types, indicating that dose titration based on post-AM blood samples was not significantly impacted by the AM meal fat composition between 15 to 45 g fat (see Fig. 5). There was also no significant effect of food on peak T (\(C_{\text{max}}\)) concentrations. These data demonstrate the reproducibility of pharmacokinetic (PK) responses of patients on a particular diet (i.e. with respect to fat content) over the PK visits, regardless of their oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) dose. Dose normalization compensates for any dose titration changes between PK visits. The PK patterns were similar with both the AM and PM doses, and even though the high fat and very low fat patients had the most variability in the between-visit PK values, they were not substantially different between visits, nor substantially different from patients on diets with other fat content.

- **Figure 5**: Dose-normalized mean average T concentration (\(C_{\text{avg}}\)) at PK visits for oral TU patients (stratified by mean dietary fat content).

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^113VpEAL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation results for circulating testosterone (T) confirmed that dose titration decisions based on a single blood sample taken 3–5 hours, or specifically at 4 hours after the morning oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) dose, were effective for guiding dose adjustments to achieve and maintain T concentrations in the eugonadal range.

As shown in Table 4, and regardless of the three measures used to determine the need to adjust the oral TU dose (i.e. Cavg based on serial PK blood sampling, a single blood sample 4 hours after the morning dose, or a single sample taken any time between 3 to 5 hours after oral TU), efficacy was high with 95% of patients achieving a mean T concentration in the eugonadal range and less than 5% of patients with a mean T level below normal.

Concordance analysis of the results from the first and second dose-titration visits showed that total concordance was 88% and 93%, respectively, when a single blood sample for T assay was collected 4 hours after the oral TU dose. When total concordance was analyzed on the basis of a single T concentration at 6 hours after oral TU at the first and second PK visits, total concordance was 98% and 96%, respectively [tabular concordance data are available in Dryad Digital Repository].

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^116Apomu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Oral delivery of testosterone (T) is simple, convenient, and should foster improved patient adherence — a well-described problem with topical T products. In addition, oral T administration avoids the potentially painful injection of T-esters (including TU) and eliminates all risk of T transference to women and children, which is associated with topical gel/solution products. Oral TU was not associated with liver toxicity in the present study, nor in prior clinical studies of this oral TU formulation where men were treated with oral TU at higher dosages for up to 2 years (ClinTrials.gov: NCT01403116 and NCT01699178). The new oral TU product has not been observed to have an overall different safety profile from T replacement products as a class, with the possible exception of effects on blood pressure (BP). However, the magnitude of oral TU's effect on BP was observed to be the same as that for a weekly injected (subcutaneously) T-enanthate formulation when BP was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

Our study has several strengths and weaknesses. This is the first published study of oral TU in hypogonadal men to demonstrate pharmacokinetic efficacy in line with U.S. regulatory approval standards. Second, we have demonstrated through two different but related analyses that a single blood sample can be collected about 4–6 hours after the morning oral TU dose to assess the approximate average concentration of T over the dosing interval to reliably guide needed dose adjustments. Third, it has been shown that the dose titration scheme prospectively evaluated in this study is robust based on the overall percentage of men who achieve…

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^115ZWYe5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Mean and median changes in PSA were small and comparable between the treatment groups. In addition, a statistically significant difference was not observed between the treatment groups for the proportion of patients with PSA values > 4 ng/mL or with a change from baseline > 1.4 ng/mL at the end of the study (1.9% oral TU; 3.8% topical T). Consistent with the PSA data, only minimal and clinically insignificant effects were observed in both treatment groups for urinary symptoms measured by I-PSS.

The cosyntropin stimulation sub-study was included to evaluate the effect of oral TU on cortisol production due to findings of adrenal cortex atrophy and reduced cortisol levels in dogs treated with high doses of oral TU. Although the oral TU group had a significantly lower proportion of patients who had a post-cosyntropin stimulation cortisol value ≥ 18 µg/dL than the topical T group (79% vs. 100%), the differences between Day 1 and the final study day for maximum cortisol concentrations post-injection and changes in cortisol concentrations from pre-injection showed no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. Four oral TU patients had cortisol values after cosyntropin stimulation that were slightly below the response cutoff level of 18 µg/dL; however, these responses in cortisol levels (range: 16.5 to 17.6 µg/dL) were not consistent with adrenal insufficiency and not considered clinically significant. Notably, during T treatments (and similar to SHBG levels), cortisol binding globulin levels were suppressed in the oral TU group compared to the topical T group.

### Cardiovascular risks and elevation of serum DHT vary by route of testosterone administration: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114viqzC]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Two expert authors conducted the study selection process, agreeing upon eligibility and extracting information from the selected trials. A systematic search was executed in PubMed until 31 May 2014, using two strategies: 1) "testosterone" or "androgen" combined with "random" and "trial", and 2) "testosterone" and "clinical trials". The inclusion criteria comprised studies of men, published in English, supplemented by the World Health Organization trial registry and manual searches of identified studies' bibliographies. To identify studies on serum testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) elevation following testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), a supplementary search was conducted using terms such as "injection", "gel", "patch", or "oral" to cover all TRT clinical trials in men due to the limited reporting of DHT concentrations before and after TRT.

- **Study selection**: We included only placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRT that reported cardiovascular (CV) related events for both the TRT and placebo arms. Trials were excluded if testosterone secretion was experimentally suppressed prior to TRT initiation, as these lack a true placebo group. To focus on long-term effects, only trials lasting 12 weeks or more were included. Initially, it was intended to exclude RCTs that only reported adverse events necessitating study withdrawal.

### Single-dose testosterone administration increases men's preference for status goods [^116ANTFu]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Second, to increase the ecological validity of our pharmacological treatment, we administered testosterone using a widely prescribed gel at a typical daily dose (100 mg) that leads to elevated serum testosterone levels within the normal male physiological range. This design choice might have led to effects that are moderate in size (task 1: d = 0.18; task 2: d = 0.28), though sufficiently large for detection in our study. Future research should explore whether dose, timing of exposure (i.e. the lag between testosterone administration and the behavioral task), and delivery type (e.g. topical, oral) might lead to different effects on behavior.

Third, the causal connection between testosterone and status appears to be bi-directional. We find that changes in testosterone causally promote attitudes toward status-enhancing goods, and other studies have shown that consumption of such goods changes testosterone levels. This relationship suggests a testosterone-mediated process in which status consumption and testosterone level might reinforce each other, calling for further investigations of the mutual influence of testosterone and status consumption over time. Moreover, given that a reliable association between baseline testosterone levels and consumer preferences emerged only in the first task, and that this is the first study testing this relationship, more research is needed to establish the robustness and variation of a dispositional effect of testosterone on consumer preferences.

Furthermore, while the effects reported here were robust when controlling for mood, beliefs about treatment, and levels of other hormones that might have influenced behavior, we cannot entirely rule out that the effects of

### Effects of oral androstenedione administration on serum testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women [^114JfQwB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Androstenedione is a steroid hormone and an intermediate in the synthetic pathway of both testosterone and estradiol in men and women. It is available without prescription and is taken with the expectation that it may have beneficial effects on strength, general well-being, libido, and quality of life. Although studies have shown that oral androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estradiol levels in men, the hormonal effects of androstenedione in postmenopausal women are unknown.

We randomly assigned 30 healthy postmenopausal women to receive 0, 50, or 100 mg of androstenedione as a single oral dose. After androstenedione administration, we collected hourly measurements of serum androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone concentrations during 12 hours of frequent blood sampling.

- **Androstenedione area under the curve (AUC)**: The mean change (± SD) in serum androstenedione AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (79 ± 39%) and 100-mg dose groups (242 ± 184%) than in the control group (-29 ± 28%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum androstenedione AUC was also greater in the 100-mg than in the 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0026).

- **Estrone area under the curve (AUC)**: The mean change in serum estrone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (108 ± 72%) and 100-mg dose groups (116 ± 119%) than in the control group (-5 ± 19%), although the control vs. 100-mg group comparison did not quite meet statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group, P = 0.0631 for controls vs. 100-mg group).

- **Estradiol area under the curve (AUC)**: The mean change in serum estradiol AUC remained stable after supplementation in all groups.

### Effects of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate on body composition and bone mineral density in female-to-male transsexuals [^114jkV6o]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The most common treatment regimen in female-to-male transsexuals is the administration of short-acting testosterone esters intramuscularly every 2 weeks.

- **Aim**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-acting intramuscular testosterone undecanoate on body composition and bone mineral density during cross-sex hormone therapy in female-to-male transsexuals.

- **Methods**: Forty-five female-to-male transsexuals (FtMs) were treated with injections of testosterone undecanoate 1,000 mg intramuscularly every 12 weeks over 24 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Body composition, bone mineral density, hormone parameters, and lipids were compared after 12 months and after 24 months with baseline values. Sonographic findings in the ovaries and endometrium, as well as clinical and adverse effects during the study period, were recorded.

- **Results**: There was a significant increase in lean mass in the FtMs during the study period compared with baseline values, whereas no change in BMI, fat mass, and bone mineral density was observed. There was a significant decline in gonadotropins, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, sex hormone-binding globulin, and high-density lipoprotein, while testosterone and triglyceride levels increased significantly after 12 and 24 months. Ovaries remained unchanged, and no noticeable endometrial pathology was observed. No mortality or morbidity was noted during the study period. We observed a cessation of menstrual bleeding, an increase in clitoral growth, libido, body and beard hair growth, deepened voices, and a decline in breast size.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^1156Q4kg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The Phase 3 clinical trial detailed herein was approved by a central or site-specific Institutional Review Board before study initiation at each clinical site. It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all relevant federal regulations, including Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from trial participants before any study-related procedures were conducted (CLAR-15012; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02722278).

This trial was an open-label, repeat-dose, dose-titration study in hypogonadal men to assess the safety and efficacy of oral TU administered for approximately 3–4 months, with a minimum of 90–105 days treatment prior to the final PK visit. The Screening Phase was followed by a Titration Phase, offering two opportunities for dose titration based on T C avg calculated from a 24-hour serial pharmacokinetics (PK) evaluation. This was succeeded by a 35-day Maintenance Phase, and an end-of-study PK visit.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to either oral TU or a 2% topical T solution. The starting dose for oral TU was 237 mg TU (150 mg of unesterified T equivalents), twice-daily (BID), administered immediately prior to breakfast and dinner meals, approximately 12 hours apart. The starting dose for the topical T was 60 mg once daily (QD) in the morning. For dose titrations, serial PK samples over 24 hours were obtained around Days 21 and 56 to determine C avg for dose titrations occurring about 14 days after the PK visits. Based on the T C avg, oral TU doses could be adjusted.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^115APBbx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Although the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) therapies in the U.S. is based solely on testosterone pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the clinical benefit is better assessed using patient-reported outcomes such as the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (PDQ). This questionnaire assesses the patient's sexual health across several domains. In the Testosterone Trials, question four of the PDQ questionnaire was one of the primary endpoints, and clinically meaningful score change was determined using data from this study. In the present study, there were statistically significant improvements in all domains of the questionnaire in both treatment groups. Of particular note, oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) was associated with a significant increase, both statistically and clinically, in the sexual activity domain — a finding consistent with that observed with topical testosterone in this study and in the Testosterone Trial in older men.

Oral TU was associated with a small but significant increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) versus topical testosterone. The observed increase in systolic BP in some oral TU patients is consistent with effects reported for a new parenteral (subcutaneous) form of testosterone enanthate now marketed in the US, an older formulation of TU available outside the U.S. [Andriol®], and an oral TU product in phase 3 development [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT No. 03868059]. In an effort to determine the etiology of elevated BP, we explored the potential relationship between the rise in BP and numerous other factors, including oral TU dose, total and free testosterone, estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations, and changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin (as a surrogate for viscosity and increase in).

### Comparison of outcomes for hypogonadal men treated with intramuscular testosterone cypionate versus subcutaneous testosterone enanthate [^115zm9sV]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Intramuscular testosterone cypionate (IM-TC) is known to cause significant rises in estradiol (E2), hematocrit (HCT), and prostate specific antigen (PSA) due to its supraphysiological testosterone peaks, whereas a novel subcutaneous testosterone enanthate autoinjector (SCTE-AI) was designed with a lower testosterone peak-to-trough ratio to mitigate these reactions. This study compares the total testosterone (TT), E2, HCT, and PSA response to treatment with IM-TC versus SCTE-AI.

A total of 234 hypogonadal men were treated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) via IM-TC 100 mg weekly or SCTE-AI 100 mg weekly. TT, E2, HCT, and PSA levels were obtained at baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment. Significant differences in baseline and post-treatment levels were identified by univariate analysis. Linear regression models determined whether treatment modality was independently associated with post-TRT levels of TT, E2, HCT, and PSA.

Post-TRT, both cohorts had significant increases in trough TT compared to their baseline levels (IM-TC: 313.6 ng/dL to 536.4 ng/dL, p < 0.001; SCTE-AI: 246.6 ng/dL to 552.8 ng/dL, p < 0.001). After linear regression, type of TRT modality was not found to be associated with TT levels (p = 0.057). SCTE-AI was independently associated with lower post-therapy E2 (p < 0.001) and HCT (p < 0.001). Neither TRT modality was associated with significant post-therapy elevation of PSA (p = 0.965).

While IM-TC and SCTE-AI provide a significant increase in TT levels, SCTE-AI is associated with lower levels of post-therapy HCT.

### Cardiovascular risks and elevation of serum DHT vary by route of testosterone administration: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114DeEjX]. BMC Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Potential cardiovascular (CV) risks of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) are currently a topic of intense interest. However, no studies have addressed CV risk as a function of the route of administration of TRT.

- **Methods**: Two meta-analyses were conducted. The first assessed CV adverse events (AEs) in 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRT lasting 12 weeks or more. The second analyzed 32 studies reporting the effect of TRT on serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

- **Results**:
	- *CV risks of TRT*: Of 2,313 studies identified, 35 were eligible and included 3,703 mostly older men who experienced 218 CV-related AEs. No significant risk for CV AEs was present when all TRT administration routes were grouped (relative risk [RR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76 to 2.13, P = 0.34).
		- When analyzed separately, oral TRT produced significant CV risk (RR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.45 to 3.55, P = 0.015), while neither intramuscular (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.28 to 1.56, P = 0.32) nor transdermal (gel or patch) TRT (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.62 to 2.62, P = 0.48) significantly altered CV risk.
	- *Serum testosterone/DHT following TRT*: Of 419 studies identified, 32 were eligible, including 1,152 men receiving TRT. No significant difference in the elevation of serum testosterone was present between intramuscular or transdermal TRT. However, transdermal TRT elevated serum DHT (5.46-fold, 95% CI: 4.51 to 6.60) to a greater magnitude than intramuscular TRT (2.20-fold, 95% CI: 1.74 to 2.77).

- **Conclusions**: Oral TRT produces significant CV risk, while no significant effects on CV risk were observed for other routes.

### Testosterone cypionate [^117XTtY2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may occur in immobilized patients. If this occurs, the drug should be discontinued.

Prolonged use of high doses of androgens (principally the 17-α alkyl-androgens) has been associated with the development of hepatic adenomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and peliosis hepatis — all potentially life-threatening complications.

Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk of developing prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma, although conclusive evidence to support this concept is lacking.

There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone cypionate. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth, and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone cypionate and initiate appropriate workup and management.

Long-term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. At the time of writing, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive in determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with the use of testosterone.

Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone who have sexual dysfunction and wish to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^1159FYNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Male hypogonadism, or androgen deficiency, is diagnosed when there are unequivocally low serum testosterone (T) levels [typically < 300 ng/dL (~10 nmol/L)] along with consistent signs and symptoms. Regardless of the etiology, several signs and symptoms can often be managed with exogenous T replacement.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is administered through various delivery routes, including transdermal gels and lotions, intramuscular and subcutaneous injections, surgically implanted pellets, dermal patches, intranasal gels, and oral capsules and tablets (methyltestosterone). Each delivery route is associated with drawbacks well known to healthcare practitioners (HCP) and their patients, such as pain of injection, dermal irritation, T transference, and liver toxicity (oral methyltestosterone).

What has been absent from the HCP's armamentarium of TRT products in the U.S. is an oral T formulation that meets regulatory standards for safety and efficacy. For example, the FDA requires average serum T concentrations in the eugonadal range of 300–1000 ng/dL (10–35 nmol/L) for at least 75% of treated men, with peak T concentrations largely below 1500 ng/dL (52 nmol/L). Historically, efforts to administer oral T have taken two primary paths: - Alkylation of T at the C-17 position to create T analogs resistant to first-pass hepatic metabolism, exemplified by methyltestosterone, first synthesized and used clinically by Ruzicka in 1935.

- Fatty acid esterification of T to create a T-ester, exemplified by T-undecanoate (TU), absorbed via the intestinal lymph.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label, with women using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus position statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This position statement was developed by consensus between the participating organizations to inform healthcare professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance on which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support prescribing testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Patient satisfaction with testosterone replacement therapies: The reasons behind the choices [^116EA6b1]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for male hypogonadism is rapidly gaining popularity and acceptance. Options include gels, injections, and implantable subcutaneous pellets.

- **Aims**: The aim of this study was to determine rates of patient satisfaction and reasons for patient preferences in hypogonadal men on TRT.

- **Methods**: An anonymous, prospective survey was distributed to men presenting for TRT at an academic urology clinic. The survey was organized into multiple domains including patient satisfaction and treatment motivation.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patient satisfaction responses were obtained via an anonymous survey.

- **Results**: The average patient age was 49 ± 0.7 years (n = 382). Injectable testosterone was chosen by 53%, gel-based regimens by 31%, and pellets by 17%. Overall, 70% of patients were satisfied with their TRT, and 14% reported dissatisfaction. Satisfaction rates were similar between gels (68%), injections (73%), and implantable pellets (70%). Doctor recommendation was the sole significant reason for patients preferring gel-based TRT (66% vs. 37% injection users vs. 31% pellet users). Injectable TRT was favored because of lower cost (35% vs. 21% gel users vs. 19% pellet users). Pellets were favored for ease of use (64% vs. 44% injection users vs. 43% gel users) and convenience (58% vs. 26% injection users vs. 19% gel users). Pellets had increased rates of satisfaction within the first 12 months. Improvements in concentration and mood occurred at higher percentages in satisfied patients.

- **Conclusions**: Patients are satisfied with TRT. Lower costs are important.

### Comparison of hematocrit change in testosterone-deficient men treated with intranasal testosterone gel vs intramuscular testosterone cypionate: A randomized clinical trial [^112b87mw]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

The primary aim of this study was to compare changes in hematocrit in testosterone-deficient men treated with intranasal testosterone gel versus intramuscular testosterone cypionate. This 2-arm, open-label, randomized trial recruited men with testosterone deficiency at the University of Miami between August 2020 and October 2022. Men, aged 18–75 years, with two total testosterone levels less than 350 ng/dL and exhibiting hypogonadal symptoms, were randomly assigned to receive either 11 mg of intranasal testosterone gel three times daily or 200 mg of intramuscular testosterone cypionate every two weeks. The primary outcome was the change in hematocrit after four months of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in serum testosterone, estradiol, prostate-specific antigen, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and the 6-item International Index of Erectile Function.

Of the 81 men randomized, 54 completed treatment (intranasal n = 23; intramuscular n = 31). The mean age was 47.5 versus 49.5 years, with mean baseline testosterone of 244.6 versus 240.7 ng/dL and mean hematocrit of 44.4% versus 42.7% in the intranasal versus intramuscular groups, respectively. Men who received intramuscular injections showed a significant increase in mean hematocrit after four months of treatment from 42.7% to 46.6% (P < .0001), whereas no significant change was observed in men who received intranasal gel (P = .233). Serum testosterone levels significantly increased in both groups throughout the study period, with a larger increase observed in men treated with intramuscular injections (mean change of 511 vs 283, P = .025).

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^115Jh6UV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

As the primary intervention for evaluation in this review, we will consider androgens, including testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), treatment of all formulations, doses, and routes of administration, either alone or in combination with another active treatment. Such treatments may include estrogens, progestogens, or low-dose antidepressants. Testosterone and DHEA are currently used in clinical practice to treat peri- and postmenopausal women, and numerous randomized controlled trials have been conducted to assess their effectiveness and risks. In future updates of this review, we plan to include new interventions as clinical trials emerge, such as phytopharmaceuticals, complementary therapies, and steroids.

The timing of the intervention is between peri-menopause and post-menopause, which corresponds to the period when ovarian follicular activity declines, typically between 45 and 55 years of age. The duration of the intervention is usually between 4 and 24 weeks, during which clinically significant effects can be achieved.

We will include studies that compare these two types of androgen therapy (testosterone or DHEA) versus placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment, such as estrogens, progestogens, or low-dose antidepressants. We will categorize the studies we find into the following comparisons:

- **Androgens alone**: Regardless of formulation, dose, or route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention.

- **Androgens in combination with estrogen**: Regardless of formulation, dose, or route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention.

### Cardiovascular risks and elevation of serum DHT vary by route of testosterone administration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115A26fD]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Potential cardiovascular (CV) risks of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) are currently a topic of intense interest. However, no studies have addressed CV risk as a function of the route of administration of TRT.

- **Methods**: Two meta-analyses were conducted, one of CV adverse events (AEs) in 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRT lasting 12 weeks or more, and one of 32 studies reporting the effect of TRT on serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

- **Results**:

- **CV risks of TRT**: Of 2,313 studies identified, 35 were eligible and included 3,703 mostly older men who experienced 218 CV-related AEs. No significant risk for CV AEs was present when all TRT administration routes were grouped (relative risk (RR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76 to 2.13, P = 0.34). When analyzed separately, oral TRT produced significant CV risk (RR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.45 to 3.55, P = 0.015), while neither intramuscular (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.28 to 1.56, P = 0.32) nor transdermal (gel or patch) TRT (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.62 to 2.62, P = 0.48) significantly altered CV risk.

- **Serum testosterone/DHT following TRT**: Of 419 studies identified, 32 were eligible which included 1,152 men receiving TRT. No significant difference in the elevation of serum testosterone was present between intramuscular or transdermal TRT. However, transdermal TRT elevated serum DHT (5.46-fold, 95% CI: 4.51 to 6.60) to a greater magnitude than intramuscular TRT (2.20-fold, 95% CI: 1.74 to 2.77).

- **Conclusions**: Oral TRT produces significant CV risk. While no significant effects on CV risk were observed.

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in men: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^113esc8W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past two decades.

- **Purpose**: To assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

- **Data sources**: Conducted in English-language searches of multiple electronic databases from January 1980 to May 2019, including reference lists from systematic reviews.

- **Study selection**: A total of 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least six months' duration were selected. These trials evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment while reporting prespecified patient-centered outcomes. Additionally, the study included 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels reporting harms information.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was carried out by a single investigator and confirmed by a second. Two investigators assessed risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: The studies predominantly enrolled older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy was found to improve sexual functioning and quality of life among men with low testosterone levels, although the effect sizes were small, ranging from low- to moderate-certainty evidence. Testosterone therapy showed little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. The evidence concerning harms, as reported in trials, was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were adequately powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk.

### SPL drug information for testosterone cypionate [^113uRoLt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of testosterone cypionate IM:

- **Bacillary peliosis hepatis, liver cancer, cholestatic jaundice**: Use caution in patients on prolonged high doses of testosterone cypionate.

- **Decreased serum total T4**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate may decrease TBG concentrations.

- **Decreased sperm concentration**: Use caution in patients on large doses of testosterone cypionate, as it may suppress spermatogenesis and reduce sperm count. If this occurs, interrupt therapy and resume at a lower dose.

- **Dependence and withdrawal reactions**: Use caution with testosterone cypionate outside approved dosages or indications, as abuse may lead to dependence, addiction, and withdrawal symptoms.

- **Depression, suicidal ideation**: Use caution in patients with depression.

- **Drug abuse**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate is often abused at higher-than-recommended doses and in combination with other anabolic steroids, leading to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects. Counsel patients on these risks. If abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone levels, noting they may appear normal or subnormal in men using synthetic derivatives, and consider abuse in patients with severe cardiovascular or psychiatric symptoms.

- **Dyslipidemia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate is associated with a risk of dyslipidemia. Periodically monitor the lipid profile, particularly at the start of therapy.

- **Erythrocytosis, polycythemia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate is associated with these conditions.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111oCKzH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and breast health**: Testosterone therapy does not increase mammographic breast density (Level I, Grade A). Available data suggest that short-term transdermal testosterone therapy does not impact breast cancer risk (Level I, Grade A). Data from RCTs are insufficient to assess long-term breast cancer risk (insufficient data). There are no data to support the use of testosterone therapy to prevent breast cancer (insufficient data). Women with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded from the randomized trials for HSDD. Caution is recommended for testosterone use in women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer (expert opinion).

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and serious adverse events**: Testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is not associated with serious adverse events (Level I, Grade A). Because RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk, and most have included women taking concurrent estrogen therapy, recommendation 10(a) is not generalizable to a more "at-risk" population (expert opinion). Safety data for testosterone in physiologic doses are not available beyond 24 months of treatment (Level I, Grade A).

### Pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of absorbed testosterone after administration of a 1.62% testosterone gel to different application sites in men with hypogonadism [^112yahmq]. Endocrine Practice (2011). High credibility.

To determine the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and safety of a new formulation (1.62%) of testosterone gel that produces eugonadal serum testosterone levels with the use of a lower amount of gel than the currently available 1% gels, an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study was conducted. Thirty-six male patients with hypogonadism applied 5 g of 1.62% testosterone gel (81 mg of testosterone) once daily to the abdomen, upper arms/shoulders, or alternated between both sites per an established schedule for 7 days. Serum levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol were measured to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the three treatments.

- **Results**: Each application method produced average serum testosterone concentrations within the eugonadal range (300 to 1,000 ng/dL). Steady-state testosterone concentrations were achieved after 2 days of gel application to either the abdomen or the upper arms/shoulders. When applied to the abdomen, approximately 30% to 40% lower bioavailability (based on the area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours) was observed compared to application to the upper arms/shoulders. The 1.62% testosterone gel was found to be safe and well-tolerated in men with hypogonadism.

- **Conclusion**: Although lower testosterone bioavailability was observed after abdominal application of the 1.62% testosterone gel compared to application to the upper arms/shoulders, application to either site yielded eugonadal levels of serum testosterone.

### Testosterone enanthate [^111bQ6Xt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. When injected intramuscularly, testosterone esters in oil are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase. Therefore, testosterone enanthate can be administered at intervals of two to four weeks.

Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, with about two percent free. Generally, the concentration of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in plasma determines the distribution between free and bound forms, while the free testosterone concentration influences its half-life.

Approximately 90 percent of a testosterone dose is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites. Around six percent of a dose is excreted in feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone mainly occurs in the liver, where it is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. There are notable variations in the half-life of testosterone reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes.

In responsive tissues, the activity of testosterone appears dependent on its reduction to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. This steroid-receptor complex is then transported to the nucleus, where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action.

### A 52-week study of dose adjusted subcutaneous testosterone enanthate in oil self-administered via disposable auto-injector [^115L1TUM]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

In this open-label, single-arm, dose-blinded 52-week registration phase study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector administered weekly to men with hypogonadism.

A total of 150 patients were initiated on a 75 mg subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector, self-administered weekly. Dose adjustments were made at week 7 to 50, 75, or 100 mg testosterone enanthate based on the week 6 total testosterone trough concentration. If required, dose adjustments continued through the extended treatment phase. Pharmacokinetic and clinical laboratory parameters, treatment-emergent adverse events, and injection site reactions were captured.

The primary endpoint was met since 92.7% of patients achieved an average total testosterone concentration of 300 to 1,100 ng/dl (mean ± SD 553.3 ± 127.29) at week 12. A maximum concentration of less than 1,500 ng/dl was achieved by 91.3% of patients, and no patient had a level greater than 1,800 ng/dl at week 12. The mean total testosterone trough concentration was 487.2 ± 153.33 ng/dl at week 52. More than 95% of patients reported no injection-related pain. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were increased hematocrit, hypertension, and increased prostate-specific antigen, which led to discontinuation in 30 men. There were no study drug-related serious adverse events.

The dose-adjusted subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector demonstrated a steady serum total testosterone pharmacokinetic profile.
