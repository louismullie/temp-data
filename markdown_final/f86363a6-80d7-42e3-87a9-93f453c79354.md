## Question

What time of day to measure atch

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal time of day to measure ACTH and related adrenal tests, and how timing affects interpretation across clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the circadian physiology of ACTH and cortisol and why morning sampling matters. Then, I should verify guideline-backed recommendations for morning sampling windows. Next, I will examine exceptions where non-morning sampling is appropriate or required. After that, I need to check how timing influences dynamic tests like cosyntropin stimulation and dexamethasone suppression. Finally, I will consider special populations and monitoring strategies, and synthesize a practical, scenario-based recommendation with safety checks and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the circadian physiology, because that drives the timing advice. ACTH and cortisol exhibit a robust diurnal rhythm with a nadir around midnight and a peak between roughly 6 and 9 AM, which means morning values best reflect maximal physiologic activity and provide the most informative baseline for assessing HPA axis function [^113ejWEN] [^112hy7cT].

> I should confirm the guideline-backed morning window. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on sampling morning serum cortisol and, when relevant, ACTH between 8:00 and 9:00 AM to maximize diagnostic yield and comparability; this timing is recommended for initial evaluation of suspected adrenal insufficiency and for assessing HPA axis recovery after glucocorticoid therapy, and it is also the standard window for dexamethasone suppression testing in Cushing's evaluation [^111XaNxD] [^112evbvj] [^112evbvj] [^114NbWBh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using random cortisol or ACTH. I need to ensure we avoid non-morning sampling for screening because random cortisol has poor diagnostic performance; guidelines explicitly recommend against using random cortisol to diagnose adrenal insufficiency, and they endorse morning sampling as first-line for central adrenal insufficiency and for recovery assessment after glucocorticoid exposure [^111XaNxD] [^115ZMPwz].

> Next, I should review how timing affects dynamic testing, because that changes the sampling cadence. For the standard 250 mcg cosyntropin test, cortisol should be measured at baseline and again at 30 and 60 minutes; while the test can be performed at various times, many centers align it with the morning to standardize interpretation and facilitate logistics, even though the pharmacologic stimulus itself blunts diurnal variation to some extent [^1152153f] [^114aoQnR]. Wait, let me verify the low-dose test nuances: in older children, peaks are often at 30 minutes, but in neonates the majority peak at 60 minutes, so sampling at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes improves sensitivity; again, timing the start in the morning is reasonable for consistency, though the pharmacologic ACTH drive dominates the response profile [^112d7tnr] [^113oANU8].

> I will now examine Cushing's-related testing, where timing is protocolized. For the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, dexamethasone is given at 11 PM to midnight and serum cortisol is measured at 8:00 to 9:00 AM the next morning. This leverages circadian physiology to unmask autonomous cortisol secretion, and the same morning sampling principle applies to postoperative assessment of remission after Cushing's surgery, where early morning cortisol is used to judge success [^114NbWBh] [^112LdR1r].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is different, like congenital adrenal hyperplasia monitoring. I should double-check that CAH biomarkers are best assessed in the early morning before the first hydrocortisone dose, typically around 8 AM, to capture overnight androgen production and avoid post-dose suppression artifacts; this timing improves comparability across visits and better reflects disease control dynamics [^111W7wT6] [^113ct7GG]. Let me reconsider the pharmacokinetics: hydrocortisone's short half-life means that even a few hours after dosing, precursors like 17OHP can rebound, reinforcing the value of pre-dose morning sampling for monitoring [^113CGoxS].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In neonates undergoing low-dose ACTH testing, peaks frequently occur at 60 minutes, so extending sampling to 60 minutes and including a 30-minute sample improves diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, older children more often peak at 30 minutes, though adding 15- and 60-minute samples still reduces false positives, so I need to tailor the sampling grid to age while keeping the test start standardized in the morning when feasible [^113oANU8] [^112d7tnr]. For perioperative and post-pituitary surgery settings, early postoperative morning cortisol is used to assess remission or recovery, and in suspected glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol after holding exogenous steroids for at least 24 hours is the recommended first test to evaluate HPA recovery [^116T9Pvz] [^1155kHPq].

> I need to ensure I account for confounders that can distort morning interpretation. Estrogen therapy elevates cortisol-binding globulin and can artifactually raise total serum cortisol, so in women on oral contraceptives, salivary cortisol or careful interpretation is prudent. Similarly, assay differences and lack of standardization can shift cutoffs, so dynamic test interpretation should be assay-calibrated locally when possible [^1169XALz] [^111jyfek]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize a continuum for morning cortisol rather than rigid cutoffs; values above about 300 nmol/L (10 mcg/dL) suggest recovery, 150–300 nmol/L is intermediate, and below 150 nmol/L suggests persistent insufficiency, with clinical context guiding next steps [^1155kHPq].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For initial evaluation of suspected adrenal insufficiency, obtain morning serum cortisol and, when indicated, ACTH between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding glucocorticoids for an appropriate washout period, and proceed to cosyntropin stimulation if results are indeterminate. For Cushing's evaluation, use the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone test with an 8–9 AM cortisol draw. For CAH monitoring, measure 17OHP and androstenedione in the early morning before the first hydrocortisone dose. And for dynamic testing, align the start with the morning when possible for consistency, while ensuring the correct sampling intervals for the chosen protocol and patient age [^111XaNxD] [^114NbWBh] [^113ct7GG] [^1152153f].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and follow-up. If morning cortisol is very low, dynamic testing may not add value and empiric physiologic replacement with planned reassessment is reasonable. If values are intermediate, repeat morning cortisol in weeks to months or consider dynamic testing. And if recovery is suggested, taper glucocorticoids cautiously with clear stress-dosing instructions and close clinical monitoring to mitigate the risk of adrenal crisis during withdrawal [^1155kHPq] [^112evbvj].

The best time to measure ACTH is **8–9 AM** [^111XaNxD] to capture the morning peak and improve diagnostic accuracy [^1155kHPq]. Avoid **evening or random sampling** because ACTH and cortisol are low and variable, increasing the risk of false positives/negatives [^112hy7cT]. For dynamic testing, use the **standard 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test** with cortisol sampling at 0, 30, and 60 minutes [^114aoQnR]; in neonates, peaks often occur at 60 minutes, so include a 60-minute sample [^113oANU8]. For glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, measure morning cortisol after holding glucocorticoids for ≥ 24 hours [^114Pxsdc] and interpret results as a continuum [^112evbvj].

---

## Physiological basis for timing ACTH measurement

ACTH secretion follows a **circadian rhythm**, with peak levels in the early morning (approximately 6–8 AM) and a nadir at midnight [^115ZMPwz]. This rhythm drives cortisol secretion, which peaks in the morning and declines through the day [^113ejWEN]. Thus, **morning sampling** captures peak ACTH and cortisol, improving diagnostic accuracy for adrenal insufficiency and related disorders [^112hy7cT].

---

## Clinical guidelines for timing ACTH measurement

Current guidelines recommend **morning sampling** for ACTH and cortisol:

- **Morning cortisol**: 8–9 AM [^111XaNxD] is the first-line test for suspected adrenal insufficiency [^111L5ei8].
- **Random cortisol**: not recommended for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency due to variability and low specificity [^112hy7cT].
- **Dynamic testing**: use the standard 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test [^1152153f] with cortisol at 0, 30, and 60 minutes [^114aoQnR].

---

## Impact of circadian rhythm on ACTH levels

Circadian variation significantly affects ACTH and cortisol, with morning peaks and evening nadirs [^115ZMPwz]. Evening or random sampling can misclassify patients because low values may reflect **circadian physiology** rather than true adrenal insufficiency [^112hy7cT]. Morning sampling aligns with this rhythm and improves diagnostic accuracy [^1155kHPq].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommended timing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary adrenal insufficiency | Morning (8–9 AM) | Captures peak ACTH/cortisol; improves diagnostic accuracy [^112hy7cT] |
| Secondary adrenal insufficiency | Morning (8–9 AM) | First-line test; random cortisol unreliable [^111L5ei8] |
| Cushing's syndrome | Morning (8–9 AM) | Baseline ACTH/cortisol before suppression tests [^112KfWjM] |
| Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency | Morning (8–9 AM) after ≥ 24 h off glucocorticoids | Assesses HPA recovery; interpret as continuum [^114Pxsdc] |
| Neonatal adrenal insufficiency | Standard ACTH test with 60-minute sampling | Neonates peak later; 60-minute sample essential [^113oANU8] |

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Neonates**: Peaks often occur at 60 minutes; include a 60-minute sample [^113oANU8].
- **Shift workers**: Circadian misalignment may require individualized timing or repeated measures [^114T4oH5].
- **Medications**: Long-acting glucocorticoids can suppress ACTH; use short-acting agents and morning sampling when possible [^111Ve9bU].

---

## Practical implications of timing on clinical decision-making

Morning **ACTH/cortisol testing** improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces false positives/negatives, and guides appropriate therapy [^111XaNxD]. Evening or random sampling can misclassify patients, leading to **inappropriate treatment or missed diagnoses** [^112hy7cT]. Consistent morning sampling also enables **reliable longitudinal monitoring** and comparison [^1155kHPq].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Morning sampling (**8–9 AM**) is the optimal time to measure ACTH, aligning with circadian physiology and maximizing diagnostic accuracy [^115ZMPwz]. Avoid evening or random sampling due to low, variable ACTH/cortisol levels [^112hy7cT]. Use the standard ACTH stimulation test with 0, 30, and 60-minute cortisol sampling [^114aoQnR], and include a 60-minute sample in neonates [^113oANU8]. For glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, measure morning cortisol after ≥ 24 hours off glucocorticoids and interpret results as a continuum [^114Pxsdc].

Perioperative adrenal insufficiency risk and postoperative glucocorticoid management — general surgery: Early postoperative adrenal insufficiency (AI) morbidity ranged from 0.96–12.90% with an overall 5.55%, and clinicians start stress doses of glucocorticoids (GC) before surgery in patients with preoperative AI, taper after surgery, and discontinue if repeat testing shows a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; in patients with normal preoperative adrenal function, GC are often prescribed in the immediate postoperative period until the HPA axis can be evaluated. A postoperative morning cortisol level higher than 15 μg/dL may mitigate the requirement for postoperative GC treatment, and a morning cortisol measurement might be useful even after intraoperative administration of dexamethasone.

Alternative Sample Collection Schemes

The current challenge in monitoring hormonal control in response to glucocorticoid therapy is that clinicians must rely on serum measurements of 17OHP and A4 obtained at clinic visits every 3 to 6 months. These measurements only provide assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and disease control at a single point in time and do not provide information about the state of the HPA axis over the course of the day, during the preceding 3 to 6 months, or even during the preceding few days. Adding to the challenge is that the timing of laboratory assessments vary during clinic visits in relation to the patient's last hydrocortisone dose, which lead to highly variable 17OHP and A4 concentrations that can confound interpretation of the HPA axis control. Figure 1 illustrates that even within a 2-hour time frame after the morning hydrocortisone dose, 17OHP and A4 concentrations can change > 60% from 1 to 3 hours post-morning dose. Although it will not provide a complete picture, recording both the dose and the timing of the dose prior to measurement of adrenal steroid concentrations can help with the interpretation of the patient's adrenal pharmacodynamic (PD) response to glucocorticoid therapy, at least within that point in time.

Initial treatment protocol and further examination

Methyldopa was prescribed to control the patient's blood pressure according to the 2013 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines, starting with a small dose (250 mg two times a day) then increasing to a large dose (1 g two times a day). This treatment failed to reduce the patient's blood pressure to a safe level, and her blood pressure was persistently elevated before the 20th week of gestation. The hypertension was not controlled by 2 g methyldopa per day. In addition, we found the patient had developed hypokalemia (baseline serum potassium was 3.14 moml/L) and preeclampsia in the early second trimester. All of the observed clinical features were not explained by primary or gestational hypertension, so our department measured other endocrine hormones, including catecholamines, hydrocortisone, 24 h UFC, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ATCH) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones. Catecholamines, including norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine, were normal in both plasma and urine samples. Plasma renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were all in the normal range and the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) was 1.94 ng/dl:ng/ml/h. The 24 h UFC was 1684.3 μg/24 h (normal range: 20.26–127.55 μg/24 h). The ATCH level was < 1.00 ng/L in three measurements (normal range: 5–78 ng/L). There was a lack of circadian rhythm for plasma cortisol levels (866.3 nmol/L at 8:00 am, 794.8 nmol/L at 4:00 pm, 806.4 nmol/L at midnight). Ultrasonography demonstrated a mass (2.9 cm × 2.8 cm) with a weak echo and clear boundary in the right side of the adrenal gland. Color doppler ultrasound showed no blood flow signal in the adrenal gland mass (Fig. 2). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast showed a mass of 3.2 cm in diameter in the right adrenal gland, and T1 weighted (T1W) and T2 weighted (T2W) images both provided mixed signals. The signal of mass in the T1W image in phase was lower than that in the T1W opposed phase, which indicated the tumor was rich in lipid and conformed to pathological characteristics of an adenoma (Fig. 3).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117MAvkT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid replacement strategies in PAI have persistent limitations and evolving circadian-mimicking options: despite optimal steroid replacement including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens, a significant number of patients continue to have objective and subjective complaints. Current replacement strategies do not restore the physiological feedback regulation and circadian and pulsatile hormone secretion is not normalized, with impairment of adrenomedullary function including regulation of catecholamines and neuropeptides. Modified and delayed-release hydrocortisone formulations aim to mimic the cortisol circadian rhythm, and dual and slow-release formulations may better mimic circadian release but do not mimic the physiological pulsatile release of cortisol. Continuous subcutaneous infusion using insulin pumps provides a similar circadian rhythm with early morning increase in cortisol and was associated with improvement of HRQoL in an open crossover study, whereas in a smaller double-blind study no impact on HRQoL was seen. Pump treatment is more cumbersome than conventional treatment and should be reserved for patients who encounter major difficulties with conventional treatment. Because the late night nadir and early morning rise in cortisol is attained, ACTH levels can be used as a biomarker to assess correct dosing. Feasibility of pulsatile subcutaneous cortisol replacement was studied in healthy dexamethasone-suppressed individuals, and there is a great need for large, randomized clinical trials to increase the evidence base on the best glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

Discussion

This is the first randomized, controlled trial of glucocorticoid treatment in patients with 21-OHD-CAH. Patients who received MR-HC had superior hormonal control during the morning and early afternoon compared to those receiving standard therapy, and this was sustained over 18 months of follow-up. Morning hormonal control is important in 21-OHD-CAH because failure to control the overnight increase in adrenal androgens results in excess glucocorticoid exposure and poor health outcomes. The trial failed its primary end point because the difference between the 2 groups in the morning did not translate into a difference over 24 hours at 24 weeks. The primary outcome was based on a phase 2 trial; however, the analysis was unhelpful in the phase 3 randomized trial because the SDS analysis overemphasized scores below the midpoint of the reference range, and the logarithmic transformation and use of a mean score over 24 hours obscured the impact of MR-HC in the morning and early afternoon. The raw data showed significant improvement of the clinically relevant end point of morning biochemical control, with reduced AUC and 17OHP amplitude in patients receiving MR-HC. The improvement in biochemical control was maintained at 18 months, with 80% displaying good control for 17OHP and 96% for androstenedione vs 52% and 45% at baseline, despite reduction of the hydrocortisone dose by 33%, to doses regularly used for adrenal replacement therapy.

MR-HC replicates the physiological overnight increase in cortisol, thereby preventing ACTH-driven excess production of adrenal androgens. MR-HC given twice daily replicates both the early morning increase in cortisol as well as daytime cortisol levels. There is some evidence that cortisol clearance may vary over 24 hours, possibly related to a circadian rhythm in cortisol-binding protein; however, the amplitude of this variation is small and does not appear clinically significant. Biochemical control was better on MR-HC compared to standard glucocorticoid at 4 weeks (ie, prior to dose titration) when patients were receiving MR-HC at an equivalent daily dose to baseline treatment. At 24 weeks, following dose titration, morning control was better on MR-HC than standard glucocorticoids, 91% in control vs 71%, respectively, with little fluctuation in 17OHP and no morning increase in the MR-HC–treated patients, similar to the profile of 17OHP in normal physiology. These findings are important because it is the high excursions in 17OHP that drive production of androstenedione and androgens that affect growth, puberty, and fertility.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^115aLgVt]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency and drug or toxin evaluation — Adrenal insufficiency, congenital or acquired, may manifest with hypoglycemia; simultaneous measurement of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol is recommended if primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test may be needed for suspected secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. The possibility of drug administration (accidental or surreptitious) or a toxin may need to be considered, and specimens of plasma and urine obtained at the time of an acute episode may be informative. High plasma insulin level but low C-peptide level during hypoglycemia suggest exogenous insulin administration, and the drugs most commonly associated with hypoglycemia include insulin, sulphonylureas, alcohol.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012? [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock and this rhythm is a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression and insulin resistance. A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations; however, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm and patients still have an increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-h cortisol production rate with hydrocortisone given twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning. Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is that there is no established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that an understanding of the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice daily, weight-related, dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm is associated with ill health, and the few studies that have compared different treatment regimens. Further studies are required to definitively test the benefits of replacing the cortisol circadian rhythm in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity or renin mass/concentration as follows:

- in the morning after the patient has been ambulatory (sitting, standing, or walking) for at least 2 hours

- patients seated for 5–15 minutes before the blood draw

- with corrected hypokalemia and liberalized sodium intake

- withdraw agents markedly affecting the results (aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing and -wasting diuretics) at least 4–6 weeks before testing

- repeat testing 2 weeks after withdrawing medications likely to interfere with test accuracy (β-blockers, centrally acting α-2 agonists, ARBs, ACEis, directly acting renin inhibitors, and dihydropyridine CCBs), if the results are not diagnostic, and if hypertension can be controlled with medications less likely to affect testing (slow-release verapamil, diltiazem, hydralazine, prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin)

- recognize that false positive results might occur with direct renin mass/concentration if the patient is a female using an oral contraceptives; discontinue oral contraceptives for 1 month before testing if possible, or alternately, measure plasma renin activity instead.

### Interpretation of steroid biomarkers in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and their use in disease management [^113CGoxS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydrocortisone, adrenal biomarkers, and challenges in therapy and monitoring in children with classic 21OHD

The current 21OHD consensus guidelines recommend treating children with oral hydrocortisone, a short acting GC, at a dose of 10 to 15 mg/m²/day divided in 3 doses. The daily hydrocortisone dose given tends to be higher than the endogenous production rate because of its short half-life and partial destruction by both gastric acidity and first-pass metabolism. Long-acting GCs (dexamethasone, prednisone, prednisolone) are not recommended in growing children as they can negatively impact growth. The GC serves 2 purposes: to replace the cortisol deficiency and to exert negative feedback on the HPA axis, which lowers ACTH and the production of adrenal-derived androgens and cortisol precursors.

Because of these dual purposes, optimizing GC therapy remains a challenge, as children can still experience adverse outcomes during childhood related to the disease and/or treatment that can carry over into adulthood. One of the primary issues is hydrocortisone's rapid half-life, which is even shorter in children with 21OHD (median elimination half-life of 58 minutes, range: 41–105 minutes). In part, intermittent increases in adrenal sex steroids throughout the day can alter the activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzymes and other enzymes that participate in cortisol metabolism and determine half-life. For these reasons, the recommended 3 times a day dosing schedule can be inadequate, leading to rapid swings in cortisol, 17OHP, and adrenal androgens. Children are inevitably exposed to alternating periods of hyper- and hypocortisolemia with resultant hyperandrogenemia throughout the day, thereby incurring risk for the deleterious effects of both these states. Figure 5 shows the magnitude and the time over 24 hours that cortisol, 17OHP, and A4 concentrations remain above or below a target threshold, especially during the early morning hours, in a child with classic 21OHD treated with hydrocortisone. Therefore, unless a dose is administered around 3 Am, most of the evening hydrocortisone dose, which is typically administered around 8 Pm to 10 Pm in children with classic 21OHD, is cleared overnight, resulting in unopposed ACTH-stimulated adrenal androgen production and significant androgen exposure in the early morning hours when ACTH peaks (∼6 Am). Cortisol pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have shown that even while hydrocortisone given 4 times a day provides better adrenal biomarker profiles than 3 times a day, children with classic 21OHD still experience hypocortisolemia and resultant hyperandrogenemia, since most of a hydrocortisone dose is cleared within 4 to 5 hours, which leads to rebounding of 17OHP and A4 to predose concentrations (Fig. 6).

### Evaluating the low-dose ACTH stimulation test in children: ideal times for cortisol measurement [^112d7tnr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Central adrenal insufficiency (AI) can be diagnosed with the low-dose ACTH stimulation test (LDST). Protocols determining timing of cortisol sampling vary, with 30 minutes after stimulation being most common.

Objectives

To determine optimal times to draw cortisol levels and factors predicting timing of peak cortisol levels in children undergoing LDST.

Design

Retrospective chart review of LDSTs between February 2014 and September 2017.

Setting

The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.

Patients

Patients 3 months to 20 years who underwent LDSTs.

Intervention

LDSTs were performed with cortisol levels at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after 1 μg cosyntropin. Cortisol values < 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) determined AI.

Main Outcome Measures

The incremental value of testing cortisol at 15 or 60 minutes, in addition to the standard 30-minute sample, was estimated.

Results

A total of 221 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 9.7 years, and 32% were female. Peak cortisol levels were 19%, 67%, and 14% at 15, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. One false positive LDST result would be prevented for every 24 (95% CI, 13 to 46) or 55 (95% CI, 22 to 141) patients tested at 15 or 60 minutes in addition to the standard 30-minute test. Of the 122 patients who passed the LDST, discontinuing the 15- and 60-minute samples would have misdiagnosed 12 patients (9.8%). Glucocorticoid exposure, age, and body mass index z scores were independent predictors of peak cortisol timing.

Conclusion

Although the majority of patients peak 30 minutes after cosyntropin administration, testing cortisol levels at 15 and 60 minutes reduces the risk of false positive LDSTs.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111L5ei8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — central adrenal insufficiency diagnosis: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central adrenal insufficiency and we recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level < 3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level > 15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL; peak cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at least 18–24 hours after the last hydrocortisone dose or longer for synthetic glucocorticoids.

### High-resolution daily profiles of tissue adrenal steroids by portable automated collection [^11742zSk]. Science Translational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rhythms are intrinsic to endocrine systems, and disruption of these hormone oscillations occurs at very early stages of the disease. Because adrenal hormones are secreted with both circadian and ultradian periods, conventional single-time point measurements provide limited information about rhythmicity and, crucially, do not provide information during sleep, when many hormones fluctuate from nadir to peak concentrations. If blood sampling is attempted overnight, then this necessitates admission to a clinical research unit, can be stressful, and disturbs sleep. To overcome this problem and to measure free hormones within their target tissues, we used microdialysis, an ambulatory fraction collector, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to obtain high-resolution profiles of tissue adrenal steroids over 24 hours in 214 healthy volunteers. For validation, we compared tissue against plasma measurements in a further seven healthy volunteers. Sample collection from subcutaneous tissue was safe, well tolerated, and allowed most normal activities to continue. In addition to cortisol, we identified daily and ultradian variation in free cortisone, corticosterone, 18-hydroxycortisol, aldosterone, tetrahydrocortisol and allo-tetrahydrocortisol, and the presence of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. We used mathematical and computational methods to quantify the interindividual variability of hormones at different times of the day and develop "dynamic markers" of normality in healthy individuals stratified by sex, age, and body mass index. Our results provide insight into the dynamics of adrenal steroids in tissue in real-world settings and may serve as a normative reference for biomarkers of endocrine disorders (ULTRADIAN, NCT02934399).

Defining surgical success

The criteria for determining immediate remission following surgery are not standardized and vary widely across centers. Variability occurs in the types of biochemical parameters used to evaluate success, the assays used, limitations of the assays, and the timing of measurements. Furthermore, results can be confounded by other factors, such as peri-operative administration of glucocorticoids and pre-operative treatment with steroidogenesis inhibitors.

Biochemical indication of remission

Early morning serum cortisol measured between 8 and 10 a.m. is the most commonly utilized measure of immediate remission following surgery. Cortisol secretion normally follows a diurnal pattern with highest levels between 7–9 a.m. that decline to lowest levels around 10–11 p.m. In patients with CD, the circadian rhythm is aberrant and cortisol levels remain consistently elevated. The goals of pituitary surgery are to extract the ACTH-secreting adenoma and subsequently reduce cortisol levels, leading to improvements in the signs and symptoms of CD.

Surgical success is confirmed by subnormal levels of early morning serum cortisol measured within a few days of surgery. Typically, early morning serum cortisol levels of either < 2 µg/dL (~50 nmol/L) or < 5 µg/dL within a few days after surgery are considered to be indicative of remission. However, reported results are mixed and difficult to interpret since some studies measure basal serum cortisol levels while others use serum cortisol following dexamethasone suppression, or some combination of these measures. While clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for testing in the context of initial diagnosis of CD, there is no expert consensus with regard to post-operative testing for surgical success.

The timing of biochemical measurements differs among treatment centers and can vary considerably within the same center. Intervals between surgery and biochemical measurement range from 1 to 2 days, up to several weeks, and even months. As a result, the definition of post-surgical remission is unclear.

### Serial analysis of multiple serum cytokine responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy in patients with west syndrome [^115UPH8w]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy is effective for West syndrome; however, the underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. This study explored this mechanism in 5 Japanese patients with West syndrome, injected with ACTH for 28 days. Serum samples were obtained before and 30, 120, and 720 minutes after ACTH injection divided into an "early" (1–4 days) and a "late" (10–28 days) group. Responses to ACTH over time were analyzed by measuring the levels of 27 cytokines. In the early group, serum levels of interleukins-5, -9, and -17, basic fibroblast growth factor, interferon (IFN-γ), IFN-γ-inducible protein 10, chemokine ligand (CCL) 3 and 4, and platelet-derived growth factor were higher in all patients before ACTH administration than in the 720-minute time point. In the late group, no definite trend was observed except for decreased CCL2 levels after ACTH administration. These changes may correlate with mechanisms underlying the anticonvulsant effects of ACTH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115SMFd6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — glucocorticoid replacement in adults is recommended as follows: We recommend glucocorticoid therapy in all patients with confirmed PAI. We suggest using hydrocortisone (15–25 mg) or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg) in two or three divided oral doses per day; the highest dose should be given in the morning at awakening, the next either in the early afternoon (2 h after lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and afternoon (three-dose regimen). Higher frequency regimens and size-based dosing may be beneficial in individual cases. As an alternative to hydrocortisone, we suggest using prednisone (3–5 mg/d), administered orally once or twice daily, especially in patients with reduced compliance. We suggest against using dexamethasone for the treatment of PAI because of risk of Cushingoid side effects due to difficulties in dose titration. We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement using clinical assessment including body weight, postural blood pressure, energy levels, signs of frank glucocorticoid excess, and we suggest against hormonal monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement and to adjust treatment only based on clinical response.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115y2ude]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid dosing and regimen evidence — dose targets, monitoring, and circadian considerations — indicates that daily physiological cortisol production in healthy individuals is about 5–10 mg per square meter of body surface area, corresponding to a replacement dose of approximately 15–20 mg, and because no reliable marker to determine exact GC needs is available, initial dose requirements are largely estimated. For assessment, a cortisol day curve has little value for routine clinical use; urine-free cortisol measurements have wide inter- and intra-variability and thus are rarely useful; however, for suspected malabsorption or increased steroid metabolic clearance, serial measurements of blood cortisol might be useful. Stress doses of GC replacement for intercurrent illnesses and minor stresses are similar to those used in primary AI. Cortisol secretion shows a distinct circadian rhythm, and no currently available GC treatment regimen is capable of accurately simulating the normal cortisol circadian rhythm; clinicians prescribe either weight-based dosing or multiple fixed doses two or three times per day, with weight-adjusted, three-times-daily dosing using HC reducing GC overexposure but not replicating the normal rhythm; clinicians also frequently prescribe single daily HC doses in patients with central AI. Regarding agent selection, HC is the most common GC used for replacement; 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 converts cortisone acetate to biologically active cortisol; and comparing GCs by calculating HC equivalence based on anti-inflammatory effects can overestimate the calculation of a replacement dose.

At 3.5 months, he was noted to have failure to thrive (weight z-score −0.91 and height z-score −1.5). Follow-up serum 17OHP and A4 concentrations revealed oversuppression of the HPA axis, and PRA was not elevated (Table 1). His hydrocortisone dose formulation was switched from suspension to tablet at a dose of 0.83 mg administered every 8 hours at 7 Am, 3 Pm, and 11 Pm for a total daily dose of 7.1 mg/m²/day. The manipulation of a 5 mg tablet to achieve the 0.83 mg dose was to split in half a scored 5 mg tablet and then further divide the 2.5 mg half-tablet into 3 more pieces. Multiple manipulations of the hydrocortisone tablet made it highly unlikely that accurate dosing was being achieved. Growth failure continued despite reversal of HPA axis oversuppression (Fig. 1), as evidenced by markedly increased 17OHP concentration (Table 1). Hydrocortisone regimen was changed to a quarter tablet (1.25 mg) 3 times a day for a total daily dose 9.3 mg/m²/day. At 14 months of age, parents reported he had random and frequent episodes of lethargy and irritability associated with blood glucose < 60 mg/dL (< 3.3 mmol/L) determined by glucometer, which his mother treated with 1.25 mg additional doses of hydrocortisone. 17OHP, A4, and PRA remained well controlled, and evaluation for other causes of hypoglycemia was unrevealing.

At 15 months of age, he presented for a second opinion due to continued growth failure and hypoglycemia. At that time, his height was at the 1st percentile (z-score −2.3), and weight was at the 5th percentile (z-score −1.7). Initial evaluation showed elevated 17OHP, prepubertal testosterone, and undetectable A4 concentrations (Table 1).

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112KfWjM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to evaluation for Cushing's syndrome, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to administer 1 mg dexamethasone PO at 23:00 to 24:00 for the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and measure serum cortisol at 08:00 to 09:00 the following morning; recognize that a serum cortisol level > 1.8 mcg/dL (50 nmol/L) suggests autonomous cortisol secretion. Consider measuring plasma metanephrine during adrenal venous sampling in patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion to help lateralize both aldosterone and cortisol secretion; recognize the importance of measuring early morning cortisol following adrenal surgery and prepare for a period of possible glucocorticoid insufficiency.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^113tPh2q]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute effects of spring transition to daylight saving time (DST) — the 1-hour time shift reduces sleep and induces circadian misalignment with physiologic consequences. The 1-hour time shift in the spring results in the loss of 1 hour of sleep opportunity, and this sleep loss accrues daily, resulting in ongoing sleep debt; later-evening light and morning darkness delay the circadian clock. The major acute effect of the time change in the spring is reduced sleep, with additional effects including lower vagal tone with higher heart rate and blood pressure, immune system alterations, and cellular derangements such as altered myocyte gene expression, epigenetic and transcriptional profile of core clock genes, and increased inflammatory markers, all observed with the 1-hour spring time shift.

If L‑T4 is not started preoperatively or continued postoperatively, clinicians should evaluate for CH by measuring fT4 levels 6–8 weeks after surgery because the serum half-life of T4 is 7 days.

### Serum cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone interrelation in classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency: is current replacement therapy satisfactory? [^1173mt4K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

One of the main aims in the management of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is to achieve adequate suppression of the adrenal cortex with the smallest possible dose of glucocorticoid substitution. To evaluate the administration schedule of current replacement therapy regimens, we investigated the cortisol-17-hydroxyprogesterone interrelation in 36 patients (13 males and 23 females; median age, 12.3 yr; range, 6.1–18.8 yr) with salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia. As sufficient variation in 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations was required to allow analysis of the cortisol-17-hydroxyprogesterone interrelation, patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the adequacy of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. The first group consisted of 17 patients with suppressed 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations (group 1), and the second group consisted of 19 patients with nonsuppressed 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations (group 2). We determined serum cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations at 20-min intervals for a total of 24 h while patients were receiving their usual replacement treatment with hydrocortisone and 9alpha-fludrocortisone. We also determined the lowest dose of dexamethasone required to suppress the 0800 h serum ACTH concentrations when administered as a single dose (0.3 or 0.5 mg/m²) the night before. Mean 24-h cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations were 3.9 microg/dl (SD = 2.1) and 66.2 ng/dl (SD = 92.7), respectively, in group 1 and 4.1 microg/dl (SD = 2.5) and 4865.7 ng/dl (SD = 6951) in group 2. The 24-h 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations demonstrated circadian variation, with peak values observed between 0400–0900 h. In group 2, 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations decreased gradually in response to the rise in cortisol concentrations during the day, but remained low during the night despite the almost undetectable cortisol concentrations between 1600–2000 h. Mean 0800 h androstenedione concentrations correlated strongly with integrated 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations (r = 0.81; P < 0.0001), but not with integrated cortisol concentrations. There was a significant negative correlation between cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone at lag time 0 min (r = -0.187; P < 0.0001), peaking at lag time 60 min (r = -0.302; P < 0.0001), with cortisol leading 17-hydroxyprogesterone by these time intervals. Finally, 0800 h serum ACTH concentrations were sufficiently suppressed after a dexamethasone dose of 0.3 mg/m² in all but three patients. These findings indicate that in classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, hydrocortisone should be administered during the period of increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, between 0400–1600 h, with the biggest dose given in the morning. Blood investigations performed as part of monitoring of congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients should include androstenedione and 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations determined in the morning before the administration of hydrocortisone. It should also be emphasized that blood investigations are only complementary to the overall assessment of these patients, which is primarily based on the evaluation of growth and pubertal progress.

(2|⊕⊕○○); evidence notes that the stimulated increase of cortisol after 30 or 60 minutes in healthy individuals is comparable for both low-dose (1 μg) and high-dose (250 μg) corticotropin tests, resulting in a lower cutoff threshold (mean −2SD) of 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL), that stimulated serum cortisol concentrations differ considerably at 60 minutes between both conditions, with a further rise in the high-dose test and a decrease of cortisol in the low-dose test, and that cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels are slightly higher at 60 vs 30 minutes although the 30-minute time point has been validated against the insulin tolerance test; overall, the low-dose and high-dose corticotropin stimulation tests yield comparable results in the diagnostic workup of PAI and the low-dose test adds no further sensitivity or specificity over the high-dose test.

### Optimizing the timing of highest hydrocortisone dose in children and adolescents with 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^113yq7oG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Hydrocortisone treatment of young patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is given thrice daily, but there is debate about the optimal timing of the highest hydrocortisone dose, either mimicking the physiological diurnal rhythm (morning), or optimally suppressing androgen activity (evening).

Objective

We aimed to compare 2 standard hydrocortisone timing strategies, either highest dosage in the morning or evening, with respect to hormonal status throughout the day, nocturnal blood pressure (BP), and sleep and activity scores.

Methods

This 6-week crossover study included 39 patients (aged 4–19 years) with 21OHD. Patients were treated for 3 weeks with the highest hydrocortisone dose in the morning, followed by 3 weeks with the highest dose in the evening (n = 21), or vice versa (n = 18). Androstenedione (A4) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) levels were quantified in saliva collected at 5 am; 7 am; 3 pm; and 11 pm during the last 2 days of each treatment period. The main outcome measure was comparison of saliva 17OHP and A4 levels between the 2 treatment strategies.

Results

Administration of the highest dose in the evening resulted in significantly lower 17OHP levels at 5 am, whereas the highest dose in the morning resulted in significantly lower 17OHP and A4 levels in the afternoon. The 2 treatment dose regimens were comparable with respect to averaged daily hormone levels, nocturnal BP, and activity and sleep scores.

Conclusion

No clear benefit for either treatment schedule was established. Given the variation in individual responses, we recommend individually optimizing dose distribution and monitoring disease control at multiple time points.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: consensus statements from an international task force by the American college of critical care medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

Participants

A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. In addition, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

Design/Methods

The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) based on factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.

Results

The task force coined the term critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occurs during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency together with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents, particularly in the setting of sepsis. At this time, the diagnosis of tissue corticosteroid resistance remains problematic. Adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients is best made by a delta total serum cortisol of < 9 microg/dL after adrenocorticotrophic hormone (250 microg) administration or a random total cortisol of < 10 microg/dL. The benefit of treatment with glucocorticoids at this time seems to be limited to patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock and patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 of < 200 and within 14 days of onset). The adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test should not be used to identify those patients with septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome who should receive glucocorticoids. Hydrocortisone in a dose of 200 mg/day in four divided doses or as a continuous infusion in a dose of 240 mg/day (10 mg/hr) for ≥ 7 days is recommended for septic shock. Methylprednisolone in a dose of 1 mg × kg⁻¹ × day⁻¹ for ≥ 14 days is recommended in patients with severe early acute respiratory distress syndrome. Glucocorticoids should be weaned and not stopped abruptly. Reinstitution of treatment should be considered with recurrence of signs of sepsis, hypotension, or worsening oxygenation. Dexamethasone is not recommended to treat critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. The role of glucocorticoids in the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, liver failure, pancreatitis, those undergoing cardiac surgery, and other groups of critically ill patients requires further investigation.

Conclusion

Evidence-linked consensus statements with regard to the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid deficiency in critically ill patients have been developed by a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force.

### Perioperative management of patients treated with glucocorticoids [^116TqjQm]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

HPA suppression is a common consequence of glucocorticoid therapy, whereas overt secondary adrenal insufficiency is a rare but life-threatening condition. Prolonged hypotension and a response to adequate doses of a glucocorticoid agent are not reliable ways to assess adrenocortical function. One must also demonstrate plasma cortisol levels that are inappropriately low for the clinical situation. Hypotension in patients previously treated with glucocorticoids is caused by loss of the permissive effect of glucocorticoids on vascular tone, which may be related in turn to enhanced PGI2 production in the absence of glucocorticoids. It is not caused by mineralocorticoid deficiency. Recurrent problems of study design and interpretation have plagued this area of investigation. Any patient who has received a glucocorticoid in doses equivalent to at least 20 mg a day of prednisone for more than 5 days is at risk for HPA suppression. If the doses are closer to but above the physiologic range, 1 month is probably the minimal interval. Recovery from prolonged exposure to high doses of glucocorticoids may take up to 1 year. Pituitary function returns before adrenocortical function. Recovery from short courses of treatment (e.g., 5 days) occurs more rapidly, in about 5 days. Recovery is time-dependent and spontaneous. The rate of recovery is a function of the dose and duration of therapy before tapering is started and while the dose is being reduced. ACTH therapy does not cause adrenocortical suppression but offers no advantage over glucocorticoids, has several disadvantages, and should no longer be used. Patients on alternate day glucocorticoid therapy have some suppression of basal cortisol levels but have normal or nearly normal responses to provocative tests of adrenocortical function. The standard short ACTH stimulation test is a reliable means of assessing adrenocortical function preoperatively. The low dose (1 microgram) short ACTH test is promising but has not been sufficiently well characterized, requires serial dilutions and cannot be recommended at this time. Studies of the physiologic adrenocortical response to surgical stress provide a basis for revised dose recommendations for perioperative coverage in the patient with known or suspected HPA suppression. Recommendations of a multidisciplinary group are presented.

### Dexamethasone (decadron) [^114NbWBh]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral administration: DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

The initial dosage varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. In less severe diseases doses lower than 0.75 mg may suffice, while in severe diseases doses higher than 9 mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient's response is satisfactory. If satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue DECADRON®Elixir and transfer the patient to other therapy.

After a favorable initial response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial dosage in small amounts to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response.

Patients should be observed closely for signs that might require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g., surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase dosage temporarily.

If the drug is to be stopped after more than a few days of treatment, it usually should be withdrawn gradually.

The following milligram equivalents facilitate changing to DECADRON®Elixir from other glucocorticoids:

Transitional care after childhood growth hormone (GH) treatment — We recommend that patients with multiple (≥ 3) pituitary hormone deficiencies or growth hormone deficiency (GHD) with a documented causal genetic mutation or specific pituitary/hypothalamic structural defect except ectopic posterior pituitary be diagnosed with persistent GHD, and we recommend re-evaluation of the somatotropic axis for persistent GHD in persons with GHD and deficiency of only one additional pituitary hormone, idiopathic isolated GHD (IGHD), IGHD with or without a small pituitary/ectopic posterior pituitary, and in patients after irradiation; testing can be performed after a trial of at least 1 month off GH treatment. We suggest that measurement of the serum IGF- I concentration be the initial test of the somatotropic axis if re-evaluation is clinically indicated, and we recommend GH provocative testing to evaluate the function of the somatotropic axis in the transition period in adolescents who have low IGF-I levels. We suggest that GH treatment be offered to individuals with persistent GHD in the transition period, though while there is evidence of benefit the specifics of the patient population that benefits, the optimal time to re-initiate treatment, and the optimal dose are not clear; the transition period is the time from late puberty to establishment of adult muscle and bone composition, and encompasses attainment of AH.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticotropin stimulation test, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the standard dose test over other existing tests (250 mcg for adults and children ≥ 2 years of age, 15 mcg/kg for infants, and 125 mcg for other children < 2 years of age). Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114Pxsdc]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — morning serum cortisol testing is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy, obtained as a morning serum cortisol level measured between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours and only after reaching a physiologic equivalent daily dose such as prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose. Given assay variability, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency; in patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible and we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs, and if cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered. Supporting data include that in suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity, and in patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crises.

Sometimes in order to determine PD response to a hydrocortisone dose, patients may be instructed to schedule a blood draw for A4 and 17OHP measurements at 3 to 4 hours post-dose, which is the time of maximal suppression in response to the preceding hydrocortisone dose. Alternatively, to gauge a patient's length of adrenal androgen response to a hydrocortisone dose, measurement of 17OHP and A4 concentrations may be taken at least 6 hours post-dose, when hydrocortisone exposure wanes due to its short half-life, and adrenal steroid production in most patients rebounds as seen in Figure 6. Measuring A4 and 17OHP concentrations at 8 Am to 9 Am, prior to the morning hydrocortisone dose, can reliably assess the HPA axis for oversuppression, as undetectable or very low adrenal biomarker concentrations 10 to 12 hours post-evening hydrocortisone dose suggests overtreatment and oversuppression of the HPA axis. Figure 7 depicts the wide variability of cortisol, 17OHP, and A4, even within a 2-hour time frame, in a patient who underwent a 6-hour serial sampling following the usual morning oral hydrocortisone dose. This variability illustrates why a random single, untimed measurement does not provide comprehensive assessment of a child's disease control.

### Changes in steroid concentrations with the timing of corticotropin stimulation testing in participants with adrenal sufficiency [^112kcViD]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the time of day at which corticotropin stimulation testing is performed influences the steroid concentrations observed in persons with normal adrenal function.

Methods

In this retrospective, secondary analysis, participants with normal adrenal function were studied to determine whether the time of corticotropin stimulation testing influenced results. Participants consisted of 2 groups: healthy volunteers who were not suspected of having adrenal insufficiency and patients being tested for adrenal insufficiency as part of their standard of care who were subsequently shown to have normal adrenal function on the basis of a peak cortisol value of at least 20 μg/dL. A high-dose corticotropin stimulation test was performed in all participants. Baseline, peak, and delta steroid concentrations were documented after corticotropin injection. Steroid concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry. Multivariate analyses adjusted for patient age, sex, and baseline steroid concentrations.

Results

With progression through the day for the time of testing, the baseline cortisol concentration decreased, while the peak and delta cortisol concentration increased (P values: < .001, .007, .007, respectively). For 11-deoxycortisol, the baseline decreased, while peak and delta values increased with later testing (P values: .017, .012, .02, respectively). Peak aldosterone concentrations increased according to their baseline values (P < .001), but were unaffected by time. Peak and delta dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations increased with time (P = 0.015 and .021, respectively). Referring to the various criteria for adequate steroid responses to corticotropin available in the literature, the time-related differences in this small group of patients were insufficient to draw different conclusions about results of testing.

Conclusions

Cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone values were most influenced by testing times. In patients with borderline adrenal function who are tested at different times of the day, the modest differences we observed may be sufficient to affect conclusions about whether adrenal insufficiency is present.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113nCEc6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication adjustment and monitoring evidence in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) — mineralocorticoid (MC) sensitivity naturally increases in the first year of life, and in a prospective study of 33 individuals with classic CAH diagnosed by newborn screening, more than half experienced hypertension in the first 18 months of life; in a population-based study of children (n = 716; age range, 3 to 18 years), the dose of fludrocortisone was associated with blood pressure, and children with regularly measured PRA had lower blood pressure than did those without PRA documentation. Bone age is a lagging indicator of past inadequate adrenal suppression and should be used judiciously, and bone age x-rays are not helpful before the age of 2 years; if bone age advances to a pubertal level at an inappropriately early age, testing for secondary centralGnRH-dependent precocious puberty is warranted. Serum 17OHP and androstenedione are traditional indicators of adequacy of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, metabolites such as 21-deoxycortisol and 11-oxosteroids may provide more direct evidence of adrenal androgen precursor production, steroids can be measured in blood, saliva, urine, or dried filter-paper blood samples, LC-MS/MS is the gold standard for blood and saliva measurement, whereas gas chromatography–mass spectrometry is the recommended method for urinary measurements, and circadian rhythm and the timing of GC intake influence steroid measurement.

### Dexamethasone (baycadron) [^113SpdWW]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral administration

DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

The initial dosage varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. In less severe diseases doses lower than 0.75 mg may suffice, while in severe diseases doses higher than 9 mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient's response is satisfactory. If satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue Baycadron™ Elixir and transfer the patient to other therapy.

After a favorable initial response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial dosage in small amounts to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response.

Patients should be observed closely for signs that might require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g., surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase dosage temporarily.

If the drug is to be stopped after more than a few days of treatment, it usually should be withdrawn gradually.

The following milligram equivalents facilitate changing to Baycadron™ Elixir from other glucocorticoids:

### Salivary cortisol response to ACTH stimulation is a reliable alternative to serum cortisol in evaluating hypoadrenalism [^1169XALz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Estrogen exerts a profound stimulatory effect on CBG production. Early-morning serum cortisol values in women using ethinyl estradiol contraception (reference interval: 284–994 nmol/L) are thus significantly greater than in nonusers (159–569 nmol/L). Similarly, we found a marked elevation in mean serum cortisol among estrogen users in our study, likely as a result of the anticipated increase in CBG concentrations. In contrast, as others have also demonstrated, stimulated salivary cortisol values were not different in oral contraceptive pill users and nonusers. These observations have potentially significant clinical value since patients are currently advised to discontinue estrogen therapy for up to 6 weeks in order to obtain a reliable assessment of serum cortisol responses to dynamic testing. We did find a significant elevation in basal salivary cortisol values in women taking estrogen, although this contrasts with previous studies and is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

To our knowledge, very few previous studies have tested the performance of salivary cortisol responses to ACTH stimulation in a cohort of patients undergoing evaluation for potential adrenal insufficiency in a routine clinical setting. Applying the 2.5th percentile for salivary cortisol responses to establish a cut-off, we compared the diagnostic utility of salivary and serum responses using immunoassay serum cortisol "cut-offs" that we had established previously. We found excellent diagnostic performance of salivary cortisol, especially in patients with high or low pretest probability of adrenal insufficiency. Even in the intermediate probability group, discordance in serum and salivary measures was largely due to minor differences around the respective lower reference limits, some of which could be explained by assay precision (with coefficients of variation of 5.4% for the Abbott assay at a cortisol concentration of 549 nmol/L and 3.0% for salivary cortisol at a concentration of 15.1 nmol/L). Perogamvros and colleagues similarly confirmed excellent sensitivity and specificity of salivary cortisol responses to high-dose ACTH stimulation in their study of 78 patients undergoing dynamic testing, albeit key differences from our study were a significantly higher pretest probability of disease (since testing was largely confined to patients who had undergone pituitary or adrenal surgery, had congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or had a history of previous glucocorticoid exposure) and establishment of a normative salivary response based on serum responses in their patient population rather than in healthy volunteers. They also measured serum cortisol by immunoassay and defined an adequate serum cortisol response as a concentration of > 500 nmol/L at 30 minutes, a value we have shown is heavily assay-dependent and significantly higher than when measured by either mass spectrometry or contemporary immunoassays.

### Circadian hormone profiles and insulin sensitivity in patients with Addison's disease: a comparison of continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion with conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy [^1166EPwM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy in patients with Addison's disease (AD) is unphysiological with possible adverse effects on mortality, morbidity and quality of life. The diurnal cortisol profile can likely be restored by continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI).

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare circadian hormone rhythms and insulin sensitivity in conventional thrice-daily regimen of glucocorticoid replacement therapy with CSHI treatment in patients with AD.

Design and Setting

An open, randomized, two-period, 12-week crossover multicentre trial in Norway and Sweden.

Patients

Ten Norwegian patients were admitted for 24-h sampling of hormone profiles. Fifteen Swedish patients underwent euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp.

Intervention

Thrice-daily regimen of oral hydrocortisone (OHC) and CSHI treatment.

Main Outcome Measure

We measured the circadian rhythm of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1, (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), glucose, insulin and triglycerides during OHC and CSHI treatment. Euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp was used to assess insulin sensitivity.

Results

Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion provided a more physiological circadian cortisol curve including a late-night cortisol surge. ACTH levels showed a near normal circadian variation for CSHI. CSHI prevented a continuous decrease in glucose during the night. No difference in insulin sensitivity was observed between the two treatment arms.

Conclusion

Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion replacement re-established a circadian cortisol rhythm and normalized the ACTH levels. Patients with CSHI replacement had a more stable night-time glucose level compared with OHC without compromising insulin sensitivity. Thus, restoring night-time cortisol levels might be advantageous for patients with AD.

### Neuroendocrine (HPA axis) and clinical correlates during fluvoxamine and amitriptyline treatment [^1154x5fC]. Psychiatry Research (2005). Low credibility.

The effect of amitriptyline on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity was compared with that of fluvoxamine in 38 patients suffering from DMS-IV major depressive disorder. Basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels were determined in the so-called "observation window" of an hour (08:00–09:00 h), and cortisol levels were determined again at 20:00 h. Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before therapy (T0), at day 14 (T14), and at day 42 (T42) of the course of antidepressant treatment. At T0, neuroendocrine parameters did not differ in patients from those in controls, except for the ratio between cortisol levels at 20:00 h and the mean level of the "window" (ratio F20/F8), which was significantly higher, suggesting a dysregulation of the circadian pattern of cortisol. Although a decrease in the ratio F20/F8 was already apparent at T14 of both treatments, the repeated measures analysis of variance failed to demonstrate a significant variation with time (T0, T14, and T42) and with treatment (amitriptyline and fluvoxamine) for any hormonal measure. At T42, both treated groups showed a similar level of clinical improvement. Our results did not demonstrate any effect of antidepressant therapy on the cortisol circadian rhythm abnormality.

### Evaluating the low-dose ACTH stimulation test in neonates: ideal times for cortisol measurement [^113oANU8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing (LDST) can be used to diagnose central adrenal insufficiency. However, uncertainty remains over optimal times to draw serum cortisol levels.

Objective

To determine optimal times to draw serum cortisol levels for the LDST in neonates.

Design

A retrospective chart review of LDSTs performed on neonates from January 1, 2009 to September 30, 2017.

Setting

Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), a tertiary-care outborn pediatric center.

Patients

Forty-nine patients were included: 23 (46.9%) born at term, 12 (24.5%) born very preterm to late preterm, and 14 (28.6%) born extremely preterm.

Intervention

Cortisol levels were drawn at baseline and 15, 30, and 60 minutes following administration of Cortrosyn 1 mcg/kg (maximum dose 1 mcg).

Main Outcome Measure

Timing of peak cortisol level and marginal value of drawing a second and third cortisol sample at 15, 30, or 60 minutes was determined.

Results

Cortisol peaked at 15-, 30-, and 60-minute sampling times for 4%, 27%, and 69% of patients, respectively. The probability that a failed LDST changes to a pass by adding a 15- or 30-minute sample to the superior 60 minute sample is 5.6% (1% to 25.8%) and 11% (3.1% to 32.6%), respectively, for a cortisol pass threshold of 18.1mcg/dL (500 nmol/L).

Conclusions

In contrast to studies of older children, we found that the majority of neonatal LDST cortisol peaks occurred at the 60-minute sampling time with the addition of a 30-minute sample providing substantial benefit. It is questionable if a 15-minute sample provides any benefit, making a case to revise LDST protocols to sample cortisol later for neonates.

### Ambulatory fludrocortisone suppression test in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism: safety, accuracy and cost-effectiveness [^113CbNmi]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 Local protocol for FST amb

Patients eligible for the FST were planned to perform the test as an outpatient test in all four centres. Antihypertensive medications were adjusted as required before the test. Fludrocortisone tablets 0.1 mg were administered four times daily (at 08.00, 12.00, 16.00 and 20.00) over 5 days, starting at 12.00 on Day 1 and finishing at 08.00 on Day 5. Sodium chloride capsules 500 mg (three capsules qid) were administered together with fludrocortisone. Slow‐release potassium chloride tablets of 750 mg were distributed according to potassium concentration. All patients received oral and written instructions. If needed, the patients had the opportunity to contact the outpatient clinic during office hours. Plasma potassium concentration was controlled once a day at all sites on Days 1, 2, 5 and at two sites also on Days 3 and 4. The dosage of slow‐release potassium chloride tablets was adjusted and communicated to each patient at the visit to the investigating site on Days 1 and 5, and by telephone contact with an endocrine nurse on Days 2, 3 and 4. Blood pressure and heart rate were registered on Days 1 and 5.

On Days 1 and 5, the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma renin concentration (PRC) and serum cortisol concentration were controlled in a recumbent posture after 20min of rest and after 2 h in a seated posture. The patients were instructed to collect urine from the day before Day 1 of the FST amb and from Day 4 to the morning of Day 5 of the FST amb for the analysis of 24‐h urinary aldosterone, sodium and potassium.

The FST was considered indicative of PA if PAC in the seated posture was over 220 pmol/L on Day 5 if PRC was inappropriately low and serum cortisol concentration was lower than the value obtained at 08.00 (to exclude a confounding ACTH effect) and/or if the 24‐h urinary aldosterone was over 35 mmol/24 h. This cut‐off was used in consensus with the local guidelines. A 24‐h urinary sodium concentration at the end of the FST was used to determine if salt loading was adequate. A cut‐off of 200 mmol/24 h for urinary sodium was considered acceptable.

The protocol for the FST in included the same laboratory tests on Days 1 and 5. The difference was that the plasma potassium concentration was controlled one or more times daily, permitting more free adjustments of slow‐released potassium tablets.

### Fluctuations in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration may predict the onset of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypophysitis [^1169bNNB]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

ACTH-level elevation could occur prior to ICI-RH onset. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics between the ACTH-elevated and non-elevated groups. However, these two groups may have entirely different pathogenic mechanisms. We cannot rule out the possibility that the duration of elevated ACTH levels was extremely short and could not have been measured at the time of blood collection. Na and K levels did not change at the time of peak ACTH levels. Moreover, Na and K levels at the peak were similar between the ACTH-increased and non-increased groups. The significance of ACTH-level elevation needs to be evaluated in future studies.

Three patients with elevated eosinophil fractions did not have elevated ACTH levels. In these cases, the time from ACTH peak levels to ICI-RH onset seemed to be shorter. ACTH secretion may have been impaired when ACTH and cortisol levels were measured at the peak ACTH levels in these cases. After a transient rise in ACTH, ICI-RH onset occurs at a median of 70 days, but the time to onset varies widely. When this phenomenon is observed, attention to adrenal insufficiency symptoms may prevent adrenal crisis.

This study has some limitations. First, it is a retrospective study with a small number of cases. The follow-up period after initiation of ICI tended to be slightly longer in the ICI-RH group than in the non-ICI-RH group, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.082). The fact that there was no significant difference in the follow-up duration may suggest that the number of cases in this study is small, given the better prognosis in ICI-RH-onset cases in previous reports. In addition, we could not collect a detailed history of steroid use at other institutions. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the transient elevations in ACTH levels were associated with steroid withdrawal. As for the lack of increase in cortisol levels, changes in cortisol levels could have been identified by more sensitive methods such as nocturnal cortisol or urinary cortisol measurements.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115DHpmT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid replacement, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/day PO, divided in two or three doses daily) or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg PO, divided in two or three doses daily) as initial therapy. The highest dose should be given in the morning at awakening, the next either in the early afternoon (2 hours after lunch; two-dose regimen); or at lunch and afternoon (three-dose regimen).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115gGkrN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid replacement dosing in primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is guided by small comparative studies, with split-dose hydrocortisone schedules such as "10 mg hydrocortisone on awakening, 5 mg at lunchtime, and 5 mg in the early evening" described. In single-dose morning studies, hydrocortisone adjusted by body surface area "(5.5 mg/m²) or by weight (0.12 mg/kg) produced integrated cortisol levels over 6 hours reliably within the healthy control 95% confidence intervals, whereas fixed dosing at 10 mg hydrocortisone did not", and therefore "dose adjustment by weight or body surface area may produce more physiological cortisol levels in PAI patients than fixed dose regimens". Additional comparisons report thrice-daily cortisone acetate "gave 24-hour cortisol curves more similar to the endogenous cortisol rhythm compared with a two-dose regimen", and a crossover study found pharmacokinetics "more physiological on the four-dose regimen", although "participating patients preferred this regimen".

For any timing biomarker to be successful, measurements should be precise and scalable. Passively collected data using scalable approaches with minimal participant burden should be prioritized. Complementing eating timing information with sleep and physical activity and endogenous rhythms would provide the most comprehensive understanding of circadian alignment/misalignment. However, it is important to distinguish whether cyclical data reflect endogenous circadian rhythms or 24‐hour diurnal behavioral rhythms. The ideal length of the assessment period also remains to be determined to reliably capture habitual food timing, various diurnal rhythms, and their variability. Whereas 7 days of data provide information on all days of the week, 14 days of data are often preferred to measure behavioral rhythms. There is a need for consensus on what is the optimal duration of data collection for free‐living assessment of interdaily variability in behavioral rhythms.

### Profile, mean residence time of ACTH and cortisol responses after low and standard ACTH tests in healthy volunteers [^115Z13SP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

No consensus exists until now about the suitable dose of tetracosactin in the ACTH stimulation test for detecting adrenal insufficiency. Our aim was to characterize both the ACTH(1–24) and the cortisol profiles after standard high-dose test (250 microg) (HDT) and low-dose test (1 microg) (LDT) in healthy subjects in order to provide a deeper knowledge about the relationship between stimulus and response.

Design and Patients

ACTH tests were performed in 10 healthy volunteers (five men, five women) with at least 1 week of difference.

Measurements

Plasma ACTH(1–24) and ACTH(1–39) and serum cortisol were measured before tetracosactin i.v. injection and at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min after stimulus. Area under the curve (AUC) of ACTH(1–24) and cortisol, as well as mean residence time (MRT) for ACTH(1–24) were calculated in both tests.

Results

Elimination of ACTH(1–24) was faster in HDT than in LDT (MRTs of 0.14 vs 0.37, respectively, P = 0.008), but plasma concentrations were higher up to 60 min cortisol production in HDT reaching a higher maximum concentration (Cmax: 1144 vs 960 nmol/l) but delayed in time (75 vs 52.5 min). No significant relationship was observed between AUC or Cmax of ACTH(1–24) and AUC, Cmax and increment of cortisol in any of the tests. However, a negative correlation of basal cortisol values was observed with relative cortisol increment (HDT: r = 0.77 P = 0.009; LDT: r = 0.94 P < 0.0001), but not so with Cmax (HDT: r = 0.22 P = 0.55; LDT: r = 0.57 P = 0.09).

Conclusions

The elimination rate of ACTH in healthy volunteers was significantly lower in LDT than in HDT, but cortisol production rate appears to be identical in both tests, so that a maximum adrenal stimulation seems to exist. The use of LDT may be more adequate, although data from patients need studying.

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^1128cG4y]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Testosterone

Testosterone Diurnal Rhythm

Testosterone (T) exhibits a diurnal pattern (Fig. 1A), presenting a peak around 8and a progressive decline with nadir in the late afternoon and early evening. Nocturnal rises in T are related to REM sleep and responsible for sleep-related erections. This pattern, blunted in hypogonadal males, depends on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) SCN-driven pulsatile release, and on cyclical variation of the testicular sensitivity to LH. In particular, different LH pulse amplitudes and frequencies regulate testosterone rhythm. Although such rhythm cannot be attributed to an endogenous circadian regulation, as it mostly associates with the sleep/wake cycle and not the time of the day, LH pulses somewhat show a circadian variation, with lower pulse frequency and higher pulse amplitude at night. With aging, this rhythm becomes less apparent, due to smaller and more frequent LH pulses secreted at night with respect to younger males, altered T feedback on gonadotropin production, as well as decreased testicular responsiveness and defect in Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Night-shift workers with sleep disorders have increased hypogonadal symptoms, with a significant impairment of erectile function and semen parameters. Given the role of T in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, disruption in diurnal rhythm and reduced level of T may contribute to adverse metabolic outcomes, such as reduced insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome, and body composition changes, particularly a reduction in lean body mass and an increase in visceral fat mass. This last shift enhances the aromatase activity in adipocytes, converting T into estradiol, which further exacerbates T deficiency by suppressing GnRH secretion, perpetuating a self-reinforcing cycle and amplifying metabolic dysfunction in hypogonadal males.

Day-to-day and 3-month measurements of total T, free T, and bioavailable T demonstrated that significant intra-individual ultradian variation exists, brought on by pulsatile release, especially for LH, making it difficult to rely on one measurement only. Moreover, compared to nonfasting levels, fasting men have significantly higher serum T levels, raising an important issue with regard to the optimal conditions under which T should be assessed in men ie, in fasting state, around 8 to 10, in 2 separate blood samples, as recommended by the most recent guidelines on hypogonadism (Table 1).

### Consensus-driven in-hospital cortisol assessment after ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma resection [^116T9Pvz]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Remission from Cushing disease (CD) after pituitary adenoma resection may be predicted by a postoperative reduction in serum cortisol level. A 2008 consensus statement recommends assessing morning cortisol levels during the first postoperative week, and replacing glucocorticoid (GC) if cortisol nadir of < 2 or < 5 µg/dL is achieved. We sought to evaluate adherence to consensus recommendations following adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma resection at our tertiary medical center, and assess time to cortisol nadir to better define the window for assessment and intervention.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed data extracted from in-hospital electronic medical records for CD surgeries between January 1991 and September 2015. We compared cortisol levels and collection times, ACTH measurement, and postoperative and discharge GC treatment before and after consensus statement publication in July 2008.

Results

107 surgeries were performed in 92 patients with CD. After 2008, more surgeries had at least one cortisol value assessed (67.9% before vs. 91.3% after, p = 0.033), with median initial cortisol measurement at 14 h post-surgery. However, ACTH measurement remained unchanged (42.9% vs. 43.5%; p > 0.99). Cortisol collection during GC treatment tended to increase (32.7% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.068). Of surgeries performed without prior GC treatment, 31.7 and 55.0% had a cortisol nadir of < 2 and < 5 µg/dL, respectively, within 72 h postoperative.

Conclusions

Our physicians were more diligent in measuring in-hospital postoperative cortisol levels consistent with 2008 consensus recommendations. Better management of cortisol measurements and their timing is an opportunity for improvement.

### Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test during high-dose glucocorticoid therapy [^112hE555]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the effective time frame of adequate serum cortisol response to the short standard 250-microg adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test (ACTH-ST) after initiation of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy in order to assist in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

Methods

We performed an ACTH-ST at 4 different times in hospitalized patients, who had a documented intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and were receiving high-dose dexamethasone therapy for nonendocrine diseases, to determine the time until the serum cortisol response is compromised. The ACTH-ST was performed at the following time intervals after initiation of dexamethasone therapy - 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. The outcome measures were cortisol levels measured at 0, 30, and 60 minutes after administration of 250 microg of cosyntropin.

Results

Of the overall group of 11 study patients, all those (n = 8) tested within the first 72 hours after initiation of dexamethasone therapy had an adequate response (serum cortisol level at 60 minutes, ≥ 18 microg/dL). Two of the 3 patients tested at 96 hours after initiation of dexamethasone therapy had a suppressed cortisol response at 60 minutes. At 30 minutes, all cortisol levels except 1 were inadequate (< 18 micro/dL).

Conclusion

This study suggests indirectly that the ACTH-ST may be used for the diagnosis of suspected adrenal insufficiency within the first 3 days after initiation of empiric glucocorticoid therapy. An inadequate response of serum cortisol at 60 minutes to the ACTH-ST may be indicative of adrenal insufficiency in this setting. Additional studies with more patients in each therapy time point are needed to confirm these initial results.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically (Table 1).

Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even in physiologic daily dose equivalent, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible in the setting of continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime, when they can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend changing to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids, eg, inhaled steroids, in whom there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids or no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements, thus potentially enabling HPA axis to recover. For replacement of adrenal insufficiency, prednisone is usually provided as single morning dose, whereas due to shorter half-life hydrocortisone and cortisone acetate are divided into 2–3 doses with higher doses given in the morning and subsequent doses given at lunch and late afternoon if applicable.

R 2.7 — Morning serum cortisol for hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovery specifies that "we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test", with sampling as "morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00 AM)". The guideline states "The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum" with "suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context", and provides, "As a guide: 1. we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely"; and also "we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL", defining an intermediate range. When "adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges", and "Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7, and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery".

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.

Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

Glucocorticoid physiology and dose equivalence — Glucocorticoids are secreted in a pulsatile and circadian rhythm with a morning peak and a nadir around midnight. Mean cortisol production is about 5–8 mg/m²/d, which is equivalent to an oral replacement with 15–25 mg/d of hydrocortisone or 20–35 mg of cortisone acetate in adults. In most industrialized countries, hydrocortisone is the preferred pharmacological replacement agent, but cortisone acetate is also in widespread use, and in a number of countries only prednisolone is available. Because of the short plasma half-life of hydrocortisone (approximately 90 min), multiple dosing is recommended; the first and largest dose is suggested upon awakening, the second after lunch, and, with a three-dose regimen, the last and smallest dose not later than 4–6 hours before bedtime.

ADT®(Alternate Day Therapy)

Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.

The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for reestablishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day.

A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenal cortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenal cortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to confirmation of recovery, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain morning serum cortisol testing if confirmation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery is desired. Recognize that the value of morning serum cortisol is a continuum, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.

Limitations and future directions

There are methodological limitations to the current retrospective analysis that may limit the generalizability of the findings. Because this was a retrospective analysis, there is no control group to compare prevalence of GHD with other populations, which would have minimized the potential for bias and allowed us to rule out other factors, such as injury severity that may have contributed to our findings. In addition, peak cortisol levels were not measured during the GST and would have provided more accurate information regarding cortisol levels in our patient population.

Hormone levels were only obtained at one time point. This did not allow for measuring recovery of pituitary function across time. It is highly unlikely, however, that pituitary function would have resolved across time unless hormone replacement had been initiated. As stated previously, most transient hormone deficiencies resolve by 6 months post-TBI, and these patients were 1 year post-TBI. Functional outcome measures were measured within a few days of blood sampling. It is likely that patients' scores on functional outcome assessments would improve across time, because all patients were engaged in intense rehabilitation. It is unknown, however, whether GHD hindered recovery. Other studies have suggested that although overall recovery occurs, the trajectory of recovery is affected by hormonal deficiencies. In other words, hormone deficiencies may not impede recovery, but may influence the rate of recovery.

### Relative adrenal insufficiency as a predictor of disease severity, mortality, and beneficial effects of corticosteroid treatment in septic shock [^115Evfsy]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the concept of relative adrenal insufficiency necessitating corticosteroid therapy in septic shock.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

We studied 218 consecutive patients with septic shock in a 3-yr period who underwent a short 250-microg adrenocorticotropic hormone test because of > 6 hrs of hypotension requiring repeated fluid challenges and/or vasopressor/inotropic treatment.

Interventions

The test was performed by intravenously injecting 250 mug of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone and measuring cortisol immediately before and 30 and 60 mins postinjection.

Measurements and Main Results

Intensive care unit mortality until day 28 was 22%. Nonsurvivors had greater disease severity, as exemplified by higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, on the day of adrenocorticotropic hormone testing. Cortisol levels directly correlated with albumin levels. Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score increased with higher strata of baseline cortisol/albumin or lower cortisol increases/albumin ratios as measures of free cortisol. Baseline cortisol, cortisol increases, and albumin levels did not independently contribute to mortality prediction by disease severity and absence of corticosteroid (hydrocortisone) treatment in a Cox proportional hazard model, although adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced cortisol increase < 100 nmol/L (n = 53) predicted mortality (p = .007). Posttest treatment by corticosteroids (n = 161, 74%) was associated with higher survival in patients with cortisol increase < 100 nmol/L (p = .0296).

Conclusions

In intensive care unit patients with septic shock, the cortisol response to adrenocorticotropic hormone inversely relates to disease severity, independent of blood cortisol binding. An adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced cortisol increase < 100 nmol/L predicts mortality and beneficial effects of corticosteroid treatment. The data favor relative adrenal insufficiency.

### Optimal response criteria for the human CRH test in the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome [^114tUcN8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The CRH test is in widespread use for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome (CS). Despite the greater availability worldwide of human-sequence CRH (hCRH), there are no large series reporting the response criteria that best discriminate between Cushing's disease (CD) and the ectopic ACTH syndrome (EC) when using hCRH, rather than ovine-sequence CRH. We have, therefore, analyzed retrospectively the serum cortisol and plasma ACTH responses to hCRH in patients with ACTH-dependent CS, to develop response criteria that best discriminate between CD and EC. One hundred fifteen consecutive patients with proven ACTH-dependent CS were studied: 101 with CD (78 females; mean age, 40 yr; range, 10–73) and 14 with EC (7 females; mean age, 46 yr; range, 32–69). The response to hCRH was also studied in 30 normal volunteers (NVs; mean age, 29 yr; range, 20–44) with no clinical evidence of CS, and the results were compared. Following basal sampling at -15 and 0 min, hCRH (100 microg iv) was administered via an indwelling forearm cannula at 0900 h and serum cortisol and ACTH were measured at 15-min intervals for 2 h. The mean basal, peak, incremental, and percentage change in the serum cortisol and ACTH at all time points, and combination of time points, were calculated and analyzed to establish the best criteria to discriminate between CD and EC, and also between CD and NVs. The mean serum cortisol concentration in samples obtained at 15 and 30 min after CRH increased by at least 14% above the mean basal in 85 of 100 patients with CD, but in none with EC, giving a sensitivity of 85% at a specificity set at 100%. In contrast, the best plasma ACTH response of a rise of 105%, calculated from the maximal rise, gave only 70% sensitivity at 100% specificity. In the NVs, the maximum cortisol at the mean 15+30 min time point was 615 nmol/liter. Using the 15 and 30 min time points as the reference point, 71 of 100 patients with CD had a rise of serum cortisol greater than 14% and also showed an absolute cortisol level more than 615 nmol/liter. Serum cortisol responses to hCRH can be used to suggest the diagnosis of CD in the majority of patients with this condition, but it should only be used in conjunction with other biochemical and imaging modalities in establishing this important diagnosis. The measurement of plasma ACTH was less helpful in making this distinction, although it may have additional value in excluding ACTH-independent causes of CS. Although we believe that bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling remains the single most useful test in discriminating CD from EC in patients with ACTH-dependent CS, hCRH offers rapid diagnostic information and is a useful adjunctive test in establishing the presence of a possible ectopic source.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1125wX9J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) glucocorticoid replacement — We recommend glucocorticoid therapy in all patients with confirmed PAI. We suggest using hydrocortisone (15–25 mg) or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg) in two or three divided oral doses per day; the highest dose should be given in the morning at awakening, the next either in the early afternoon (2 h after lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and afternoon (three-dose regimen). As an alternative to hydrocortisone, we suggest using prednisolone (3–5 mg/d), administered orally once or twice daily, especially in patients with reduced compliance. We suggest against using dexamethasone for the treatment of PAI because of risk of Cushingoid side effects due to difficulties in dose titration. We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement using clinical assessment including body weight, postural blood pressure, energy levels, signs of frank glucocorticoid excess. We suggest against hormonal monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement and to adjust treatment only based on clinical response.

### Utility of adrenocorticotropic hormone in assessing the response to transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease [^117GnsAL]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol dynamics in subjects with Cushing's disease (CD) following transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) and to determine the value of early postoperative ACTH levels in predicting subsequent hypocortisolemia.

Methods

Following TSS for CD, serum cortisol and plasma ACTH were measured every 6 hours in the absence of empiric glucocorticoid coverage.

Results

A total of 26 subjects (25 female) underwent 28 operations. Hypocortisolemia was achieved in 21 (81%) subjects after the initial TSS. Repeat TSS was performed in 2 subjects, resulting in hypocortisolemia in 1. Subjects who achieved hypocortisolemia had significantly lower ACTH levels by 19 hours postoperatively (P = 0.007). Plasma ACTH fell to < 30 pg/mL in 86% and < 20 pg/mL in 82% of subjects who subsequently achieved hypocortisolemia. Plasma ACTH declined to < 30 pg/mL by a mean of 10 hours and to < 20 pg/mL by 13 hours prior to hypocortisolemia. Follow-up data were available on 25 patients for a median of 23 months. Three subjects who achieved initial surgical remission had disease recurrence at 19, 24, and 36 months; all of these subjects had a postoperative nadir serum cortisol levels < 3 μg/dL and plasma ACTH < 20 pg/mL.

Conclusion

Following TSS for CD, plasma ACTH declined prior to achievement of hypocortisolemia in most subjects. In the majority, the ACTH level reached a nadir of < 20 pg/mL. Low early postoperative ACTH levels predict early hypocortisolemia but may not accurately predict long-term remission.

### Plasma leptin concentrations are highly correlated to emotional States throughout the day [^111ookqB]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

It has been widely observed that food intake, body weight and mood are associated in humans. Alterations in food intake and body weight are cardinal diagnostic features of mood disorders such as major depression. The mechanisms underlying the interactions between body weight, food intake and mood have not been elucidated. Leptin, an adipose tissue hormone, acts on hypothalamic receptors to inhibit food intake and stimulate thermogenesis, thereby regulating energy balance and body weight. Plasma leptin concentrations reflect fat mass; however, within individuals leptin levels fluctuate throughout the day in a pulsatile and circadian manner. We hypothesized that leptin might affect mood acting as a link between the body's adipose mass and the brain. Here we show that during the course of the day fluctuations in the plasma leptin level are highly correlated with psychological measures of mood, social stress and food (carbohydrate) craving.

Despite the well-established effects of leptin administration in animals to reduce food consumption and decrease body weight, meals do not immediately influence leptin levels in humans. In a study investigating the circadian patterns of secretion of leptin, meal ingestion and meal-induced increases in plasma insulin and glucose did not influence changes in leptin concentrations during the 24-h period. Furthermore, when appetite ratings and leptin levels were compared, subjective feelings of hunger were not affected by postprandial plasma leptin concentrations in healthy volunteers. Those data indicate that leptin influences energy metabolism but that it does not act as an immediate satiety factor. In addition to its effect on eating behavior, leptin may have a role in the body's hormonal response to stress. We have shown that human leptin levels are highly and inversely correlated to the stress hormones cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Our group and others have conducted studies supporting the concept that leptin might modulate the bioactivity of neuropeptides, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a neurohormone that regulates the biological and behavioral responses to stress.,

Whereas several studies have included single hormone or cytokine measures as they relate to symptoms, including leptin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), we have previously shown that both leptin and IL-6 fluctuate substantially throughout the day. Clinical symptoms likewise fluctuate from hour to hour. Single time point measurements are therefore very limited, as they cannot be temporally related to diurnal fluctuations in psychometric variables.

The experiment described here tests the hypothesis that fluctuations in plasma leptin concentrations throughout the day are highly associated with simultaneous fluctuations in psychometric variables such as mood, stress-related behaviors and appetite.

### Plasma aldosterone response to the low-dose adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH 1–24) stimulation test [^115jTYks]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Endocrine tests for adrenal insufficiency use pharmacological doses of stimulant such as ACTH. More physiological tests have often used high-dose protocols for sampling frequency.

Aims

To evaluate the response of plasma aldosterone concentration to low doses (125, 250 and 500 ng/m(2) body surface area) of synthetic ACTH.

Design

A randomised trial in six normal adult males aged 18–27 years.

Materials and Methods

Aldosterone concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay in serum from blood samples taken at 10 min intervals for 90 min.

Results

All three doses produced a significant rise in plasma aldosterone concentration (125 ng/m(2), P = 0.003; 250 ng/m(2), P < 0.001; 500 ng/m(2), P < 0.001) but there was no effect of dose on either the peak or incremental plasma aldosterone concentration. Mean time to peak was similar between the doses and the two higher doses were associated with a longer secretory profile (125 ng/m(2) 56 (26 SD) mins, 250 ng/m(2) 74 (19) mins, 500 ng/m(2) 77 (21) mins; F = 3.39; P = 0.04). Peaks of 100% were detected within 30 min of drug administration and peak response was associated with the prestimulation plasma aldosterone concentration (r = 0.45; P = 0.003). The between- and within-individual coefficients of variation for prestimulation concentrations were 37.0% and 32.8%, and for the peak response were 27.2% and 27.2%, respectively.

Conclusions

The response of plasma aldosterone concentrations to low-dose ACTH administration requires a blood sampling protocol of 0, 10, 20 and 30 min to capture concentrations near the peak response. The high-dose protocol would have missed the response. Over the dose range studied no dose-response was observed so the selection of dose should be based on the dose effective to release steroids in the glucocorticoid pathway if this study is to be used in conjunction with such evaluation.

### Intraoperative dexmedetomidine attenuates norepinephrine levels in patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1139DvVY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, we evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant under the standard anesthetic regimen of our center (propofol-remifentanil). Therefore, it may be difficult to interpret the true effect of dexmedetomidine owing to study design. In addition, we planned to adjust the maintenance dose of dexmedetomidine, which may impact on the stress response to surgery. However, the loading dose of dexmedetomidine accounts for over 50% of the total dose during surgery. Therefore, we considered the effect of adjustable maintenance dose would be minimal. Second, baseline stress hormone levels were measured immediately after tracheal intubation, which was one of the most important noxious stimuli during surgery. Therefore, these measured values may not reflect the actual reference value. However, since stress hormone levels were measured at the same time point between the two groups, the differences between the two time points could be interpreted as demonstrating the effect of dexmedetomidine. Nevertheless, it would have been better to measure stress hormone levels before the induction of general anesthesia. Third, we measured two types of hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine) at two time points. The selection of the time points was based on judgment and our experience, but they may not be optimal. The overall effect of dexmedetomidine on surgery could be measured, but the effects of stress intensity, dose, and time of administration could not be measured. Moreover, it would have been better to measure cortisol, a more suitable marker for stress response to evaluate stress response. Further study is needed for the serial measurement of the effects of dexmedetomidine at various stages of surgery, as is the incorporation of other stress responses markers, such as cortisol, glucagon, plasma interleukin-6, to establish more accurate responses to the administration of dexmedetomidine.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^111jyfek]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

However, studies looking at the outcome in patients who pass the SST and therefore were not given glucocorticoid replacement are reassuring. In a study of 148 hypothalamic-pituitary patients who passed the SST and were not treated with hydrocortisone, only 2 patients subsequently developed adrenal insufficiency, one with suspected evolving hypopituitarism and one who had a borderline response. These results confirmed those of another similar study. Therefore, when time-related clinical outcome is taken as the "gold standard" the SST rarely misses clinically significant adrenal insufficiency provided sufficient time has lapsed between the pituitary insult and testing.

For the SST, the cut-off for normality has been shown to be assay dependent, and therefore should be determined in each unit based on responses in healthy controls. In our institution, we use 500 nmol/l as cutoff for normal cortisol response, with peak levels of 500–550 nmol/L interpreted to be safe for the purpose of withholding routine glucocorticoid therapy but these patients are prescribed stress dose glucocorticoids in times of intercurrent illness.

Dynamic tests assess ACTH/cortisol reserves rather than the adequacy of cortisol production from day-to-day under normal physiological conditions. Hence patients with partial or borderline responses may not need day-to-day glucocorticoid replacement as they have been shown to have normal cortisol production under unstressed physiological conditions. As a precaution they should receive sick days glucocorticoid therapy.

Borderline results are often difficult to interpret. The ITT and the SST are not mutually exclusive and in some cases both tests can be used to rule in or rule out adrenal insufficiency when one test alone is borderline or when the test result does not support the clinical context. For example a patient with a pituitary tumour or after pituitary surgery with healthy morning cortisol level but a sub-optimal cortisol response to hypoglycaemia and otherwise normal anterior pituitary function is unlikely to have adrenal insufficiency and therefore a SST can be useful to verify or vice versa.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114aoQnR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Dynamic tests for diagnosing suspected hypopituitarism — adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) axis assessment includes insulin tolerance and corticotropin (ACTH 1–24, cosyntropin) stimulation with assay-dependent cortisol cutoffs. In insulin tolerance testing, administer insulin, 0.05–0.15 U/kg iv, with the expected normal response that glucose should drop < 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) and peak cortisol should be > 500–550 nmol/L (> 18.1–20 µg/dL) depending on assay. For the standard-dose corticotropin test, administer ACTH 1–24 (cosyntropin), 250 µg im or iv with cortisol sampled at 0, 30, and 60 min, and cortisol should be at 30 or 60 min > 500–550 nmol/L (> 18.1–20 µg/dL) depending on assay. For the low-dose corticotropin test, administer ACTH 1–24 (cosyntropin), 1 µg iv with samples at 0 and 30 min, and cortisol should be at 30 min > 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dL) depending on assay.

### Role of endogenous glucocorticoid metabolism in human acute pancreatitis [^117BMfcP]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to observe how levels of total cortisol, calculated free cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone change during the early course of human acute pancreatitis and to describe how these changes affect the development of pancreatic necrosis.

Design and Patients

In a total of 109 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis (74 with edematous pancreatitis, 35 with necrotizing pancreatitis), serial daily blood monitoring of total and free cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosteroid-binding globulin was done after hospital admission, up to day 6 after the onset of pain; 30 healthy individuals served as controls.

Measurements

Corticosteroid-binding globulin and total cortisol were measured by immunoassays, and free cortisol was calculated according to Coolens et al. The adrenocorticotropic hormone was measured with an enzyme-linked immunoassay.

Results

Initially, highly elevated levels of calculated free cortisol (median, 86.2 ng/mL; quartile ranges, 50.6–106.7 ng/mL) and total cortisol (41.2 microg/dL, 30.4–51.1 microg/dL) and depressed levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (0.2 pg/mL, 0.1–2.0 pg/mL) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (30.6 microg/mL, 24.1–35.5 microg/mL) were observed. Further, daily measurements revealed increasing adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, whereas cortisol levels decreased.

Conclusions

Although an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels is suggested to increase corresponding cortisol levels, cortisol levels decreased during the development of necrotizing acute pancreatitis. This phenomenon, along with the continuously decreasing corticosteroid-binding globulin levels, brings up the hypothesis of a relative adrenal insufficiency, which favors acinar cell apoptosis and hence may trigger the development of necrosis in the initial vulnerable phase of acute pancreatitis.

Long-acting growth hormone (LAGH) dosing and monitoring — biomarkers and titration — emphasize that "Serum IGF-I remains the best currently available biomarker for GH action and will be used to monitor therapy with LAGH preparations", although "the optimal timing of measurement of serum IGF-I levels in relation to the medication injection is unclear". There is general agreement that serum IGF-I levels "should not be supraphysiologic for a prolonged period of time", weekly administration means levels "will inevitably show more variability and changes across the days between injections", and "It remains to be determined whether a dose of LAGH preparation should be titrated based on the nadir, peak, or mean values of serum IGF-I levels during treatment". The page adds that "there remains an unmet need for better biomarkers for monitoring rhGH therapy with the expected introduction of LAGH preparations", that a workshop "concluded that these compounds will offer convenience and may have the potential for increased adherence and improved outcomes", advised long-term surveillance after approvals, and "It is suggested that endocrinologists monitor developments in this field as FDA submission(s) may occur in the next few years".

Importance of nocturnal BP assessment in relation with outcome

Assessing nocturnal BP is important because of its major impact on cardiovascular outcome, including stroke, in treated hypertensive individuals. Its accurate and repeated assessment may contribute to better and smoother 24 h BP control and to cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction.

Dipping vs. nocturnal hypertension

1 Both average night-time BP levels and the day-night BP dip are robust and partly independent predictors of cardiovascular risk, although nocturnal BP level appears to be superior in this regard.
2 The clinical utility of BP dip classification remains uncertain, also due to its low reproducibility, especially in patients reporting significantly disturbed sleep during monitoring.
3 Therefore, the clinical interpretation of nondipping should take into account sleep quality and repeated ABPM should be considered to confirm abnormal nocturnal BP patterns.

Special populations in which nocturnal BP assessment is indicated because of high prevalence of nocturnal BP alterations

1 Neurological disorders associated with autonomic neuropathy.
2 Sleep disorders characterized by alterations in sleep duration and quality, including sleep disordered breathing.
3 Kidney disorders.
4 Metabolic and endocrine disorders, including overweight and obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, increased aldosterone secretion, Cushing's syndrome, pheocromocytoma.

Therapeutic aspects

1 Controversial evidence on usefulness of chronotherapy.
2 Available hypertension management guidelines do not recommend systematic evening antihypertensive drug administration, unless there is a specific need to focus on nocturnal BP.
3 Use of long-lasting antihypertensive drugs, better if in combination, administered at a time which guarantees the best adherence in individual patients is recommended.
4 Evening administration of short acting antihypertensive drugs may be useful in patients with isolated nocturnal BP elevation, accompanied by daytime hypotension, associated with autonomic dysfunction.
5 Renal denervation reduces nocturnal hypertension, with night-time BP, along with its variability, representing a valuable marker for predicting responses to renal denervation.
6 Improvement of sleep quality and duration has a favourable impact on nocturnal BP and on outcome.
7 Treatment of sleep apnoea is associated with a reduction of an elevated nocturnal BP.

### Prednisone (Deltasone) [^111rQiHE]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of alternate day therapy should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
Alternate day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate day therapy. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to alternate day therapy and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of alternate day therapy, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on alternate day therapy may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using alternate day therapy it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of alternate day therapy will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.

### Circadian and diurnal regulation of cerebral blood flow [^112JsdRT]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Before waking, the SCN-dependent release of hormones such as growth hormone and prolactin and the arousal and postural shift–driven increase in sympathomimetic hormones, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, increase the sympathetic drive to blood vessels. This results in a sharp increase in vasomotor tone, coincident with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output, resulting in a surge in blood pressure and elevated blood pressure through the morning until lunchtime. Despite this elevation in blood pressure, CBF in humans appears not to increase until lunchtime, and this likely reflects concurrent increases in cerebrovascular tone that increases cerebrovascular resistance and reduces CBF. It is unclear whether this is part of the systemic drive to increase blood pressure to meet the demands of daytime mobility or a myogenic vasoconstrictive response secondary to the systemic rise in blood pressure.

Following the morning surge in blood pressure, there is usually a postprandial lunchtime dip in blood pressure, at a time when CBF increases, endothelial function improves, and there may be an improvement in autoregulatory capacity, after which there is on average a rise in blood pressure in the evening, which may explain the evening peak in stroke risk in some studies, before the nocturnal decline in heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. However, direct measures of CBF and cerebrovascular function at this time of day are limited.

This model of the relationship between hemodynamic changes and diurnal variation in risk and recovery supposes an increased risk of hypoperfusion at night and an increased risk of hyperperfusion in the morning, explaining the morning excess risk of embolic and hemorrhagic stroke. Such a relationship between blood pressure and cerebral perfusion at specific times of day raises the possibility of chronotherapy. This provides a hypothesis that can be tested to understand the mechanism of these strokes and their outcome, subdivided by etiology. However, most studies have had inadequate phenotyping at the individual patient level of both the etiological subtype of stroke and the blood pressure phenotype (nondipping versus reverse dipping versus extreme dipping), including chronotherapy trials that did not account for relationships between individual blood pressure behavior and chronotherapy. Furthermore, some antihypertensive treatments may be better than others at normalizing maladaptive blood pressure phenotypes such as nondipping. Finally, in the acute setting of large vessel occlusion at times of increased risk of a poor outcome, maintenance of cerebral perfusion by limiting nocturnal blood pressure decline could be beneficial although the magnitude of any effect is likely to be far less than the benefit of reperfusion.

### Optimizing the timing of highest hydrocortisone dose in children and adolescents with 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^1147TftU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study addresses the same research question as the study by German et al, but there are important differences between the present study and the study by German and colleagues. As stated by the authors, the primary end points of German et al were sleep and activity, which resulted in a relatively small sample size for hormonal analysis (n = 15). Importantly, we have quantified hormone levels at multiple time points per day, which better reflected hormonal status throughout the day. By including the 5and 3measurements, we were able to show that the HE regimen actually resulted in stronger suppression of 17OHP (ie, HPA axis suppression) in the early morning, and that an HM regimen resulted in stronger suppression in the afternoon.

Despite progress in the development of modified-release glucocorticoid substitutions, these are not yet available for pediatric patients with 21OHD. Therefore, until these formulations become available, we recommend that the dose distribution be individually optimized for each patient. Although overall, as a group, no treatment regimen was found to be superior, individual patients may benefit from one or the other dosing strategy. To optimize treatment, hormonal control should be monitored at multiple time points a day, preferably before taking the medication, because single measurements indicate hormonal control only at a specific time point and provide limited information on the patient's overall disease control. The addition of an early morning salivary measurement is considered beneficial because it informs whether a higher evening dose results in better suppression of the early-morning surge in that patient. Nonetheless, it should be noted that, as the rise in ACTH starts between 2 and 4 in the morning, benefit from the HE dose in the early morning may not always be captured by the 5measurement. In other words, while no difference in 17OHP and A4 levels may be evident from the 5measurement, the HE dose may result in a period of higher androgen suppression before 5. If, for a patient, the HM and HE treatment regimens result in indistinguishable total androgen exposure, it can be argued that a physiological pattern of HC intake is preferable.

### Dynamic pituitary-adrenal interactions in response to cardiac surgery [^1133DmKU]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize the dynamics of the pituitary-adrenal interaction during the course of coronary artery bypass grafting both on and off pump. Since our data pointed to a major change in adrenal responsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone, we used a reverse translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this change in a rat model of critical illness.

Clinical Studies

Prospective observational study.

Animal Studies

Controlled experimental study.

Clinical Studies

Cardiac surgery operating rooms and critical care units.

Animal Studies

University research laboratory.

Clinical Studies

Twenty, male patients.

Animal Studies

Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats.

Clinical Studies

Coronary artery bypass graft-both on and off pump.

Animal Studies

Injection of either lipopolysaccharide or saline (controls) via a jugular vein cannula.

Clinical Studies

Blood samples were taken for 24 hours from placement of the first venous access. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone were measured every 10 and 60 minutes, respectively, and corticosteroid-binding globulin was measured at the beginning and end of the 24-hour period and at the end of operation. There was an initial rise in both levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol to supranormal values at around the end of surgery. Adrenocorticotropic hormone levels then returned toward preoperative values. Ultradian pulsatility of both adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol was maintained throughout the perioperative period in all individuals. The sensitivity of the adrenal gland to adrenocorticotropic hormone increased markedly at around 8 hours after surgery maintaining very high levels of cortisol in the face of "basal" levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone. This sensitivity began to return toward preoperative values at the end of the 24-hour sampling period.

Animal Studies

Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given either lipopolysaccharide or sterile saline via a jugular vein cannula. Hourly blood samples were subsequently collected for adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone measurement. Rats were killed 6 hours after the injection, and the adrenal glands were collected for measurement of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, steroidogenic factor 1, and dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1 messenger RNAs and protein using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western immunoblotting, respectively. Adrenal levels of the adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (melanocortin type 2 receptor) messenger RNA and its accessory protein (melanocortin type 2 receptor accessory protein) were also measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In response to lipopolysaccharide, rats showed a pattern of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone that was similar to patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. We were also able to demonstrate increased intra-adrenal corticosterone levels and an increase in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, steroidogenic factor 1, and melanocortin type 2 receptor accessory protein messenger RNAs and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and a reduction in dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1 and melanocortin type 2 receptor messenger RNAs, 6 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection.

Conclusions

Severe inflammatory stimuli activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis resulting in increased steroidogenic activity in the adrenal cortex and an elevation of cortisol levels in the blood. Following coronary artery bypass grafting, there is a massive increase in both adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol secretion. Despite a subsequent fall of adrenocorticotropic hormone to basal levels, cortisol remains elevated and coordinated adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol pulsatility is maintained. This suggested that there is an increase in adrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone, which we confirmed in our animal model of immune activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Using this model, we were able to show that this increased adrenal sensitivity results from changes in the regulation of both stimulatory and inhibitory intra-adrenal signaling pathways. Increased understanding of the dynamics of normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to major surgery will provide us with a more rational approach to glucocorticoid therapy in critically ill patients.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to morning cortisol, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using a morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, if a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible.

### Modified-release hydrocortisone in congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^111ztvyo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The evidence that an adrenal replacement dose of hydrocortisone has better health outcomes than the higher doses more commonly used in CAH comes from the literature examining hydrocortisone replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency. In large retrospective studies of patients on glucocorticoids, a hydrocortisone equivalent dose greater than 20 mg per day was associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile, and a daily dose of hydrocortisone greater than 25 mg per day was associated with increased mortality. Similarly, higher replacement doses of hydrocortisone have been associated with lower QoL in patients with adrenal insufficiency, and lower psychological well-being. In a large longitudinal historical cohort study in pediatric patients, the dose of hydrocortisone in patients with CAH was negatively associated with final height, with each 1 mg/m 2 /day of hydrocortisone equating to a loss of 0.37 cm in height.

Currently there is no consensus on monitoring glucocorticoid therapy in CAH. Clinicians measure biomarkers before and after dosing, and aim for 17OHP levels above the reference range and androstenedione within the reference range for good control, with normal 17OHP indicating overtreatment and high androstenedione indicating undertreatment. In 21-OHD-CAH, the physiological pathway to androstenedione biosynthesis from 17-hydroxypregenolone via DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is downregulated, and androstenedione biosynthesis primarily occurs through conversion of excess 17OHP. With MR-HC treatment, we observed near normalization of 17OHP and concurrently low androstenedione, despite a median daily MR-HC dose of 20 mg, suggesting that the low androstenedione is not explained by glucocorticoid-mediated suppression. Thus, you cannot keep downtitrating the glucocorticoid dose based on a low A4 because you will go below adrenal replacement doses and risk adrenal insufficiency. The mode of action of MR-HC flattens the 24-hour 17OHP profile, similar to that seen in healthy individuals, and provides the rationale for a monitoring and titration schedule whereby the morning 17OHP reflects the evening dose and the afternoon 17OHP the morning dose of MR-HC. Thus, in the extension study, patients have been titrated using a sample measured at 0900h and 1300h, which are times suitable for the clinic. Two samples are required and could potentially be provided remotely if suitable validated assays for saliva and blood spot are available. MR-HC provides a potential simplified paradigm for the treatment and monitoring of CAH with dosing at bedtime and waking, and hormonal measurements at 0900h to judge the nighttime dose and around midday to judge the morning dose.

### The effect of music on the neurohormonal stress response to surgery under general anesthesia [^116zYCSv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Several pharmacological interventions reduce perioperative stress hormone release during surgery under general anesthesia. Listening to music and therapeutic suggestions were also studied, but mostly in awake patients, and these have a positive effect on postoperative recovery and the need for analgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of listening to music under general anesthesia on the neurohormonal response to surgical stress as measured by epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) blood levels. Thirty female patients scheduled for abdominal gynecological procedures were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: group NM (no music) and group M (music). In group M, music was played from after the induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. In the NM group, the patients wore the headphones but no music was played. We established three sample times for hormonal dosage during the procedure and one in the recovery room. Hemodynamic data were recorded at all times, and postoperative consumption of morphine in the first 24 h was noted. There was no group difference at any sample time or in the postoperative period in terms of mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, isoflurane end-tidal concentration, time of the day at which the surgery was performed, bispectral index (BIS) value, doses of fentanyl, or consumption of postoperative morphine. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to plasmatic levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, or ACTH at any sample time, although the blood level of these hormones significantly increased in each group with surgical stimulation. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a significant effect of intraoperative music on surgical stress when used under general anesthesia.

Implications

Listening to music under general anesthesia did not reduce perioperative stress hormone release or opioid consumption in patients undergoing gynecological surgery.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111XaNxD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central adrenal insufficiency — initial biochemical evaluation is as follows: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central AI. We recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level < 3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level > 15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL to diagnose AI. Peak cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the HPA axis at least 18–24 hours after the last HC dose or longer for synthetic GCs.

### Basal cortisol in relation to metyrapone confirmation in predicting adrenal insufficiency after pituitary surgery [^1157wqMw]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

It has also been debated whether a 100% sensitivity should be the ultimate goal or whether a lower cut-off with close monitoring for symptoms of adrenal insufficiency can also be used. Such a strategy would further reduce hydrocortisone prescriptions. Inder et al. proposed an algorithm in which only patients with a cortisol < 250 nmol/L would receive daily hydrocortisone replacement and patients with cortisol concentrations between 250 and 450 would only receive stress instructions followed by definitive dynamic testing later. Application of a cut-off value of 250 nmol in our study would have spared 61% of patients from receiving a replacement dose of hydrocortisone at the cost of a reduced sensitivity of 57%. In this case a potential life-threatening adrenal crisis could occur, for which close patient monitoring would be indicated. Based on the low sensitivity in our study we do not advocate the implementation of such a strategy. However, the implementation of multiple early morning (6–9 AM) cortisol measurements would increase sensitivity.

While our study shows that we can reduce unnecessary hydrocortisone prescription in a significant proportion of patients, even with the new cut-off value of 357 nmol/L, 72% of patients would still receive medication unnecessarily for a restricted time period, in our current protocol for 3 months. This raises the questions whether it is justifiable to treat a great number patients to protect the few who develop clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency. Some centers opt for lower cut-off values combined with providing clear stress instructions on when to take medication. Using such an approach, fewer patients will take hydrocortisone on a daily basis, but the patients will be exposed to a small, but greater risk of symptomatic adrenal insufficiency compared to patients following our treatment regimen. We, however, believe that the potential risk of missing adrenal insufficiency by far outweighs the possible risks and burden that are associated with temporary hydrocortisone replacement. New studies evaluating the incidence of symptomatic adrenal insufficiency in patients at risk for postoperative adrenal insufficiency who are not routinely taking hydrocortisone that also include patient reported outcomes on general well-being are urgently needed.

### Optimizing the timing of highest hydrocortisone dose in children and adolescents with 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^115iLciA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive diseases caused by mutations affecting adrenal steroid biosynthesis. In most cases (> 90%), CAH is caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), resulting in impaired cortisol and, in the most severe cases, decreased aldosterone production. Owing to the diminished cortisol production, negative feedback toward the hypothalamus and pituitary gland is decreased, resulting in increased production of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and consequently overproduction of adrenal precursor steroids and adrenal androgens.

Treatment of patients with classic CAH consists of chronic glucocorticoid and, when necessary, mineralocorticoid administration, aiming to replace the relative glucocorticoid deficiency and to suppress the ACTH-mediated hyperandrogenemia. Usually, supraphysiological doses are required to inhibit ACTH and consequently androgen production. Yet, it is recommended not to completely suppress adrenal steroid production to prevent the adverse effects of glucocorticoid overtreatment. Overtreatment is, among other things, associated with cardiovascular complications, whereas undertreatment results in signs of chronic hyperandrogenism, and may result in the development or progression of testicular adrenal rest tumors in men. Therefore, the balance between overtreatment and undertreatment is a challenge for every health care provider taking care of CAH patients, and often patients may experience both periods of overtreatment and undertreatment during the day. Adequacy of treatment can be monitored by salivary levels of the precursor steroid 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) and the adrenal androgen androstenedione (A4). For children with 21OHD, hydrocortisone (HC) treatment is recommended on a thrice-daily schedule. However, insufficient data exist regarding the best timing of the highest HC doses. In healthy individuals, cortisol levels follow a circadian rhythm with nadir cortisol levels at night, which start to rise between 2and 4, peak around 7, and gradually decline during the day. One of the treatment strategies is to give the highest dose of glucocorticoids in the morning, mimicking this physiological circadian cortisol rhythm. An alternative treatment strategy is to give the highest dose in the evening, which is suggested to inhibit the increase of androgens in the early morning, when androgen levels are highest, more effectively. A high dose of HC in the evening, however, may negatively influence sleep and nocturnal blood pressure (BP). Normally, BP drops during the night, but children and adolescents with 21OHD may experience an absence of this nocturnal dip and can have nocturnal hypertension. This may be attributed to the high evening HC dose treatment regimen. Several studies have focused on the number of daily doses, or on the choice of synthetic glucocorticoid, but studies on the best timing of highest glucocorticoid dose are limited, despite both treatment regimens being widely used. German et al evaluated morning vs evening administration of a high HC dose with respect to disease control, sleep pattern, and daytime activity in children with CAH in a 4-week crossover study. No difference in basal hormone levels and sleep or activity measures between the 2 treatment regimens were detected. However, hormone levels were measured only at 8, which does not adequately reflect the hormonal status throughout the day.

### Comprehensive and continuous nursing strategies in perioperative management of upper urinary tract stones treated with holmium laser lithotripsy [^117Doyoi]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Perioperative inflammatory factors

Blood samples for inflammatory markers were taken at three different times: pre-operative baseline, post-operative day 1 (POD1), and post-operative day 3 (POD3). Figure 3 demonstrates that both groups saw increased values for IL-10, CRP, and WBC, and both groups peaked on POD1, returning towards preoperative levels by POD3. The experimental group had a significantly lower positive incremental change from pre-operative baseline to POD1 and POD3, respectively to the control group (p < 0.05), indicating there was better inflammatory control with the comprehensive nursing intervention.

Perioperative oxidative stress parameters

MDA and SOD levels were measured at baseline, POD1, and POD3. The postoperative measures showed a temporary increase in MDA and decrease in SOD in both groups, with normalization over time (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, the experimental group had significantly lower MDA and higher SOD levels at all timepoints ((p < 0.05)), indicating less oxidative damage and better antioxidant defense in the intervention protocol.

Perioperative stress hormones

Serum levels of COR, ACTH, and NE were evaluated at baseline (preoperatively), POD1, and POD3 in both groups. In both intervention groups, levels of all stress hormones were markedly elevated immediately following surgery. Stress hormone levels peaked on POD1 and declined on POD3 (Fig. 5). However, the experimental group had significantly lower levels of CON, ACTH, and NE at each time point (p < 0.05), suggesting that the intervention of continuous nursing was more effective at reducing excessive stress responses.

### Blood levels of copeptin on admission predict outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic hypothermia [^117McPeG]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The major finding of the present study was that the copeptin level, assessed at hospital admission, can predict neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors. A cutoff value ≤ 217.9 pmol/l was determined by ROC curve analysis; patients with a copeptin level < 217.9 pmol/l were more likely to survive to 30 days without significant neurological dysfunction compared with patients with a copeptin level > 217.9 pmol/l. Early outcome prediction is challenging in cardiac arrest survivors, and the optimal timing as well as the methods used for prognostication remain controversial. Several approaches have been shown to have a prognostic value several days after cardiac arrest, such as assessment of serum markers of brain injury (neuron-specific enolase, S-100B), electroencephalography, somatosensory evoked potentials, and neuroimaging. At the present time, however, only a very limited number of parameters can be used for prognosis prediction at the time of hospital admission after cardiac arrest. In this respect, including the measurement of copeptin levels among the screening laboratory investigations in these patients, using a widely available commercial assay may offer a relatively simple prognostication method.

The results of the present study are in agreement with other studies describing the prognostic value of copeptin levels in several other acute and/or critical conditions. Copeptin levels have been recently shown to correlate with outcomes in the following conditions: acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and even in patients presenting to the emergency department with nonspecific complaints. Moreover, Jarai and colleagues reported that preoperative copeptin concentrations predict postoperative outcome after major vascular surgery. Our observations are also in good agreement with the study by Kim and colleagues, in which they described that cardiac arrest survivors with relative adrenal insufficiency, higher blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and vasopressin have poor outcomes.

The present study, however, has several limitations mostly attributable to its limited sample size. Furthermore, all of the patients in our group were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who were treated with mild endovascular hypothermia, and it remains uncertain whether our results can be generalized to all cardiac arrest survivors, including patients who experience in-hospital arrest and those undergoing different cooling methods. Another possible limitation is that patients with chronic diseases that are known to be associated with elevation of copeptin such as heart or renal failure were not excluded.

### Estimation of maximal cortisol secretion rate in healthy humans [^116nCU2W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Cortisol secretion is related to ACTH concentration by a sigmoidal dose-response curve, in which high ACTH concentrations drive maximal cortisol secretion rates (CSR(max)).

Objective

We sought to estimate CSR(max) and free cortisol half-life in healthy humans (n = 21) using numerical methods applied to data acquired during cosyntropin (250 μg) stimulation. We also evaluated the effect of overnight dexamethasone (DEX; 1 mg) vs. placebo on estimates of CSR(max) and free cortisol half-life.

Design

This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized order of overnight DEX vs. placebo, cosyntropin (250 μg) stimulation with frequent serum cortisol sampling and computer-assisted numerical analysis.

Setting

The study was conducted at a single academic medical center.

Participants

Twenty-one healthy adult subjects (15 females and six males), mean aged 46 yr, participated in the study.

Intervention

Intervention in the study included DEX vs. placebo pretreatment, cosyntropin (250 μg) iv with frequent cortisol sampling.

Main Outcome Measures

CSR(max) and free cortisol half-life estimates, R² for goodness of fit, were measured.

Results

Mean ± sd CSR(max) was 0.44 ± 0.13 nm/second, with free cortisol half-life of 2.2 ± 1.1 min. DEX did not significantly affect estimates of CSR(max) or free cortisol half-life. Our model accounts for most of the variability of measured cortisol concentrations (overall R² = 90.9 ± 11.0%) and was more accurate (P = 0.004) during DEX suppression (R² = 94.6 ± 4.6%) compared with placebo (R² = 87.2 ± 8.7%).

Conclusions

Application of a mass-action model under conditions of cosyntropin stimulation provides a relatively simple method for estimation CSR(max) that accurately predicts measured cortisol concentrations. DEX administration did not significantly affect estimates of CSR(max) or free cortisol half-life.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1115FA5f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid replacement and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovery — We recommend glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone, 10–12 mg/m²/d in divided doses, either twice or thrice daily, with the first dose taken as soon as possible after waking; although some practitioners prescribe supraphysiological doses (eg, hydrocortisone 20 mg two to three times daily) in the immediate postoperative period, there are no controlled studies that address whether this minimizes glucocorticoid withdrawal, and clinicians can assess HPA axis recovery with a morning cortisol obtained every 3 months, initiating ACTH stimulation testing when the level is 7.4 μg/dL (200 nmol/L) or more, considering the axis recovered if the baseline or stimulated level is approximately 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) or greater, while patients with cortisol levels below 5 μg/dL (138 nmol/L) should remain on glucocorticoids until retested in 3–6 months.

### Optimizing the timing of highest hydrocortisone dose in children and adolescents with 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^116fhoKq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study we measured steroids in saliva, because saliva collection is less stressful for children compared to venous blood sampling and, therefore, the steroid levels are less likely to be affected by specimen sampling. Levels of 17OHP and A4 have been reported to highly correlate between saliva and plasma samples. Moreover, because androgens were measured in saliva, and BP was measured using an ambulatory BP monitor, no hospitalization was required for this study design, which minimized the burden for participants. This does, however, mean that compliance to treatment is not controlled. Yet, these patients were highly motivated and explicitly instructed to adhere to treatment administration at specific time points.

We do acknowledge several limitations in this study. Although the incorporation of multiple time points of androgen measurement over the day is a strength of this study, continuous monitoring (eg, 20-minute or 1-hour interval) throughout the day or the collection of 24-hour urine might have been even more informative because it would have allowed us to compare total androgen exposure between treatment regimens. Also, whether for example a higher morning dose adjusted the morning 17OHP and A4 levels faster or better was not determined here because steroid levels were quantified only before HC administration. However, the patients' load would have been much higher and would most likely have resulted in a much lower number of participants.

In conclusion, the HM dose and HE dose regimens were comparable with respect to averaged daily 17OHP and A4 levels, activity scores, sleeping scores, and nocturnal BP although they resulted in different exposure patterns to 17OHP and A4 throughout the day. We recommend individually determining the best timing of the highest HC dose based on levels of 17OHP and A4 at multiple time points during the day.

Adrenal insufficiency checklist

This questionnaire should be used to determine whether symptoms of underreplacement or overreplacement of glucocorticoids have occurred in the preceding 4 weeks. Please ask participant: Have you experienced any of the following symptoms more than once per week in the last 4 weeks? Date of assessment (mm/dd/yyyy).

the 5 samples between 01:00 to 09:00h were considered to reflect glucocorticoids given in the evening/night time;
the 5 samples between 11:00 and 19:00h to reflect glucocorticoids given in the morning;
if 3 or more of these 5 samples were out of range, dose adjustments would be made, unless the adrenal insufficiency symptom questionnaire was in conflict with the biochemical findings; and
if 17OHP and androstenedione were inconsistent then the androstenedione results were to take precedence.

Target ranges for titration were the optimal range for 17OHP and reference range for androstenedione as follows:

17OHP 40 to 1200 ng/dL (range, 1.2–36.4 nmol/L);
androstenedione (males) 40 to 150 ng/dL (range, 1.4–5.2 nmol/L); and
androstenedione (females) 30 to 200 ng/dL (range, 1.0–7.0 nmol/L).

Local investigators and patients were aware of the trial-group assignment but were otherwise blinded. After 6 months, patients who had enrolled in the phase 3 and the previous phase 2 studies were invited to enroll in the extension study. The initial dose of MR-HC was the hydrocortisone dose equivalent to their dose at time of enrollment in the extension study. Dose titration was performed by the local investigators according to hormone results and symptoms of overreplacement or underreplacement. Hydrocortisone stress dosing and fludrocortisone dose adjustment occurred as medically indicated.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112hy7cT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — interim morning cortisol strategy when corticotropin stimulation is not feasible: We suggest using a morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency; this suggestion is only applicable in acute situations when waiting for the corticotropin stimulation would unnecessarily delay appropriate therapy and should not be used for community-based screening. In the absence of exogenous glucocorticoids, a basal cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) drawn in the morning (6 to 10 AM) is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, although the choice of a morning cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency with 100% sensitivity is controversial, with studies arguing levels from > 285 nmol/L (10.3 μg/dL) to > 480 nmol/L (17 μg/dL), and there is no evidence to support the use of random cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency. The cortisol of 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) is typically below or near the lower limit of normal (6 to 10 AM) in reference populations for assays in contemporary clinical laboratories: 113–131 nmol/L (4.1–4.7 μg/dL).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111hsJH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112evbvj]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Morning serum cortisol thresholds for recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: If confirmation of recovery is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test and consider values as a continuum. As a guide, we suggest recovery if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol when results are between 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL; and we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol after a few months when results are < 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL.
