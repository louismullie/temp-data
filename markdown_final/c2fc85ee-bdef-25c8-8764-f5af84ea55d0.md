## Question

Groin pain post catheter ablation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing groin pain after catheter ablation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why groin pain is common after ablation. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and the red flags that mandate urgent evaluation. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including when to use ultrasound versus CT and what labs to obtain. After that, I need to outline management strategies by complication type, including hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and retroperitoneal hematoma. Finally, I should consider prevention, follow-up, and special scenarios like infection or nerve injury, and close with a concise decision algorithm that aligns with consensus statements and contemporary practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why groin pain matters here. Groin pain after catheter ablation is common because most procedures rely on femoral venous access with large-bore sheaths and continuous anticoagulation, which together increase the risk of hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and retroperitoneal bleeding; vascular complications are among the most frequent adverse events after AF ablation, with significant complications in roughly 0.2–1.5% of cases in contemporary series, and consensus statements advise that persistent or worsening groin pain beyond 7 days should trigger evaluation for these entities [^111hsycM] [^111732to] [^114qqX5d] [^113dMRYK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the differential and the red flags. The key causes of post-ablation groin pain include hematoma, femoral pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, retroperitoneal hematoma, infection, and less commonly nerve injury or compartment syndrome; persistent pain beyond 7 days, a pulsatile mass, bruit, expanding ecchymosis, severe pain with hypotension or anemia, or neurologic deficits should prompt urgent imaging and hematology evaluation, whereas mild tenderness with a stable bruise in the first week is often benign but still warrants close follow-up [^111hsycM] [^111732to] [^112h9mwH] [^111TTsGK].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach next. For suspected vascular complications at the groin, duplex ultrasound is the first-line test to evaluate for pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, hematoma, and arterial patency; if ultrasound is negative or the clinical picture suggests retroperitoneal bleeding or deep pelvic pathology, contrast-enhanced CT angiography provides comprehensive delineation of bleeding, false aneurysm, fistula, or thrombosis and is appropriate when pain is severe, there is systemic instability, or suspicion remains high despite a negative ultrasound [^112JzC64] [^1161kCGL] [^11481iMY] [^112f2Tka].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory workup. A complete blood count helps detect bleeding or infection, and a falling hematocrit supports ongoing hemorrhage; in patients with suspected retroperitoneal hematoma or systemic instability, serial hemoglobin measurements are essential, and coagulation parameters may be relevant if anticoagulation management is implicated; these labs should be interpreted alongside the clinical exam and imaging to guide escalation [^111hsycM] [^111732to].

> Now, I will examine management by complication, starting with hematoma. Most groin hematomas are managed conservatively with rest, compression, and analgesia, but I should confirm size and progression with ultrasound; large or expanding hematomas may require transfusion, and rare cases with compartment physiology need surgical consultation, so I need to ensure close observation and reassessment if pain worsens or the leg becomes tense [^notfound] [^113dMRYK].

> Next, I should review pseudoaneurysm. Ultrasound-guided compression or thrombin injection is first-line for small, uncomplicated pseudoaneurysms, with high success and low morbidity; larger, complex, or rapidly expanding lesions, or those with skin compromise, may require stent-graft exclusion or surgical repair, and I should double-check that the anatomy is suitable for endovascular therapy before proceeding [^1169eBYx] [^111xiQiV] [^114ncaC3].

> Let me consider arteriovenous fistula. Small, asymptomatic AV fistulas may close spontaneously, but persistent or symptomatic fistulas warrant endovascular closure with covered stents or plugs; I should confirm the fistulous tract and adjacent arterial anatomy with ultrasound or CT to plan the approach and anticipate any branch-vessel compromise [^114ncaC3] [^11481iMY].

> I will now examine retroperitoneal hematoma, because missing this is dangerous. Severe back or flank pain, hypotension, or a falling hematocrit after femoral access should trigger emergent contrast-enhanced CT to localize and quantify bleeding; management includes resuscitation, reversal of anticoagulation when safe, and either conservative care or angiographic embolization or surgery depending on stability and active extravasation, so I need to ensure rapid escalation and multidisciplinary involvement if unstable [^115LYtPA] [^11481iMY] [^112omKLQ].

> But wait, what if the pain is neuropathic or there is concern for infection. Nerve injury from hematoma compression or direct trauma can cause persistent burning or dysesthesia; if neuropathic pain is suspected, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically and consider gabapentinoids or regional techniques, recognizing that evidence is limited and management is individualized; for suspected infection, I should obtain inflammatory markers and consider imaging for abscess, and if a closure device was used, I must maintain a high index of suspicion for device-related infection and involve infectious diseases early [^115LYtPA] [^11481iMY] [^113Ybd8W].

> Next, I should review prevention, because reducing incidence changes the post-test probabilities. Routine ultrasound guidance for femoral venous access reduces vascular complications and postprocedural pain, and many operators favor figure-of-eight or purse-string sutures for venous hemostasis to shorten immobilization and discomfort; minimizing arterial access when feasible and using meticulous anticoagulation protocols also mitigate risk, and I need to ensure these steps are embedded in the lab workflow [^115ZK174] [^1156EkTM] [^1122VGLE] [^112ZhffP].

> Let me think about follow-up and thresholds for action. Patients should be counseled to report new bruising, expanding swelling, severe pain, fever, or neurologic symptoms promptly; persistent groin pain beyond 7 days or any new pulsatile mass warrants same-day vascular ultrasound, and a low threshold for CT angiography is appropriate when pain is disproportionate, systemic features emerge, or ultrasound is nondiagnostic; I should confirm that this plan is communicated clearly at discharge [^111hsycM] [^111732to] [^112h9mwH].

> I should double-check special scenarios. In patients with multiple groin accesses, large-bore sheaths, or prolonged procedures, the pretest probability of vascular complications is higher, so I should lower my threshold for imaging and consider overnight observation if pain is significant; conversely, a single transseptal approach with one groin access may reduce hemostasis-related discomfort without compromising safety in experienced hands, though this does not eliminate vascular risk entirely [^1126Cf3e] [^1122jzwE] [^112zgejj].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, time-based approach: in the first week, most groin pain is expected, but I should screen for expanding hematoma or early pseudoaneurysm; after 7 days, any persistent or worsening pain mandates duplex ultrasound to exclude pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, or occult hematoma, with CT angiography if ultrasound is negative and suspicion remains high; management is complication-specific, ranging from conservative care to thrombin injection, stent-grafting, or surgery, and prevention hinges on ultrasound-guided access and careful anticoagulation management; aligning with consensus statements, this strategy balances timely diagnosis with judicious use of imaging and interventions [^111hsycM] [^111732to] [^112h9mwH] [^112JzC64] [^1161kCGL].

Groin pain after catheter ablation is most often due to **femoral access complications** (hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula) [^111hsycM] or **nerve injury** (ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral) [^114zqfNP]. Persistent or worsening pain beyond 7 days [^111hsycM] should prompt **duplex ultrasound** [^112JzC64] to evaluate for vascular injury; if ultrasound is inconclusive, obtain CT angiography [^11481iMY]. Management is **complication-specific**: hematomas are managed conservatively, pseudoaneurysms or AV fistulas may need thrombin injection or endovascular repair [^1169eBYx] [^111xiQiV], and neuropathic pain may respond to nerve blocks or ablation [^114zqfNP]. Ultrasound-guided access [^115ZK174] and meticulous hemostasis reduce risk [^1156EkTM].

## Etiology of groin pain after catheter ablation

Groin pain after catheter ablation arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Etiology** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hematoma | Common at femoral access; typically self-limited but can cause significant pain and delayed mobility [^115LYtPA] [^112aAU8M] |
| Pseudoaneurysm | Arterial wall defect with contained extravasation; presents with pulsatile mass, bruit, and pain [^111hsycM] [^114ncaC3] |
| Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) | Abnormal arterial-venous communication; may cause pain, swelling, and bruit [^111hsycM] [^114ncaC3] |
| Nerve injury | Ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, or genitofemoral neuropathy from direct trauma or compression; causes burning or shooting pain [^114zqfNP] [^111TTsGK] |
| Infection | Rare at access site; presents with erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain [^11481iMY] [^113Ybd8W] |
| Retroperitoneal hematoma | Rare but serious; severe back/flank pain, hypotension, anemia [^115LYtPA] [^112omKLQ] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured evaluation** is essential:

- **History**: onset, duration, character, severity, radiation, associated symptoms (swelling, bruising, pulsatile mass, fever, neurologic symptoms) [^111hsycM].
- **Physical examination**: inspection for ecchymosis, swelling, pulsatile mass, bruit; palpation for tenderness, warmth; neurologic assessment of sensory and motor function [^115LYtPA].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC for anemia or infection; coagulation profile if anticoagulation-related bleeding is suspected [^111hsycM].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is critical to identify the cause of persistent groin pain:

- **Duplex ultrasound**: first-line for hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, AVF, and arterial patency [^112JzC64] [^1161kCGL].
- **CT angiography**: indicated if ultrasound is inconclusive or suspicion for retroperitoneal hematoma, complex vascular injury, or infection remains high [^11481iMY] [^112f2Tka].
- **MRI**: useful for soft tissue assessment, particularly if nerve injury is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **identified etiology**:

| **Complication** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Hematoma | Conservative management with rest, compression, analgesia; observe for expansion or compartment syndrome [^115LYtPA] [^113dMRYK] |
| Pseudoaneurysm | Ultrasound-guided compression or thrombin injection; surgical or endovascular repair if persistent or large [^1169eBYx] [^111xiQiV] |
| AV fistula | Endovascular closure with covered stent or coil embolization; surgical repair if endovascular therapy fails [^114ncaC3] [^112aAU8M] |
| Nerve injury | Conservative management with analgesics, gabapentinoids; nerve blocks or radiofrequency ablation if persistent [^114zqfNP] [^111TTsGK] |
| Infection | Antibiotics; surgical drainage if abscess or septic thrombophlebitis [^11481iMY] [^112f2Tka] |
| Retroperitoneal hematoma | Immediate resuscitation, reversal of anticoagulation, surgical or endovascular intervention [^115LYtPA] [^112omKLQ] |

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing groin pain centers on **ultrasound-guided vascular access** [^115ZK174] to reduce vascular complications and postprocedural pain, and on **meticulous hemostasis** — using manual compression or vascular closure devices [^1122VGLE] — to minimize hematoma and pseudoaneurysm. Limiting sheath size and number of access sites also lowers complication risk [^112zgejj].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate management. Most hematomas resolve within weeks, pseudoaneurysms and AV fistulas are successfully treated with minimally invasive techniques, and nerve injuries often improve over months; persistent neuropathic pain may require interventional pain management [^114zqfNP] [^111TTsGK].

---

Groin pain after catheter ablation is most often due to **femoral access complications** or **nerve injury**. Persistent or worsening pain beyond 7 days should trigger **duplex ultrasound**; if inconclusive, obtain CT angiography. Management is **complication-specific**, and prevention relies on ultrasound-guided access and meticulous hemostasis.

Post–AF ablation evaluation — early symptoms and thresholds — states that a complete blood count should be performed to exclude bleeding or infection, infectious sources should be excluded if fever occurs early, fever might be the first marker of an impending atrial esophageal fistula (AEF), and chest imaging should be considered if fever persists without another source. Neurological symptoms shortly after ablation should be taken seriously with brain imaging to exclude embolic events, and AEF must be considered in the differential of postablation neurological presentations. Symptoms of pericarditis typically persist up to a week after ablation; if symptoms persist for > 1 week or are associated with lightheadedness or shortness of breath, further evaluation is warranted. Groin pain that persists past 7 days or is getting worse should prompt a physical exam and vascular ultrasound to exclude femoral access complications. A persistent nagging dry cough might be observed for up to 6 weeks after ablation and is more common with CB than with RF ablation.

Symptoms of pericarditis typically persist up to a week after ablation (Table 5). If symptoms persist for > 1 week or are associated with lightheadedness or shortness of breath, further evaluation is warranted. Groin pain that persists past 7 days or is getting worse should prompt a physical exam and vascular ultrasound to exclude femoral access complications. A persistent nagging dry cough might also be observed for up to 6 weeks after ablation. This complication is more common with CB than with RF ablation and is likely related to direct bronchial or lung injury. This type of cough is generally treated with antitussives and will typically subside over 4–6 weeks.

Some patients, particularly those with a history of migraines, might experience migraine headaches in the first few weeks after ablation. These headaches might be related to the residual ASD present after transseptal puncture and will typically improve over several weeks. Hemoptysis is rare but might result from pneumonia or pulmonary infarction due to an occluded PV, typically occurring 3–6 months after ablation. Dysphagia in the first days after ablation is most likely related to irritation from transesophageal echocardiography or intubation. If dysphagia persists, then imaging (chest CT or MRI) should be performed to exclude an AEF (see late complications). The differential diagnosis of dyspnea occurring early after ablation should include volume overload, pneumonia, or PN injury as outlined above. A chest roentgenogram should be obtained. If symptoms persist with a normal chest roentgenogram, we should also consider PV stenosis (see late symptoms, below). Vagal denervation of the esophagus or stomach can occur after ablation due to ablation lesions placed in the vicinity of the esophagus, particularly if extensive ablation is performed along the LA posterior wall. Symptoms can include nausea and early satiety. Patients should be advised to eat small, frequent meals. Symptoms will typically improve over 4–6 weeks. If symptoms are profound or persist, a gastric emptying study can be diagnostic. Pain at the site of sheath insertion can result from an pseudoaneurysm, an AV fistula, or a hematoma. Evaluation usually starts with a vascular ultrasound. Bloodwork and a CT scan might be appropriate.

10.2.6. Vascular Injury

The incidence of vascular injury after VT ablation ranges from 0% to 8.6% and is the most common major complication reported after VT ablation procedures. Vascular complications after VT ablation are typically related to vascular access and include hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and dissection or occlusion of the artery accessed. Prior to sheath deployment, confirmation that the guide wire used for arterial access is indeed in the lumen and not in the arterial wall is important to avoid retrograde dissection of the iliac artery and aorta. This can be accomplished with techniques such as ultrasound or angiography. Furthermore, longer sheaths are preferable in the setting of tortuous peripheral vessels to avoid damage of the vessel wall with the catheter tip. Imaging of the aortic arch (with transesophageal echocardiography or CT) prior to ablation using a retrograde approach could help to identify patients at risk for thromboembolic events in the presence of mobile atheromas or thick plaque material. ICE can also be beneficial to identify plaque material in the ascending aorta prior to a planned retrograde approach. Many electrophysiologists curve the ablation catheter to a "J" shape in the descending aorta to minimize trauma to the aortic valve when mapping the LV with a retrograde approach. The catheter is then prolapsed into the LV.

In higher-risk patients, such as those with high body mass index, body surface area < 1.6 m², hypertension, age > 70 years, baseline anemia, and known peripheral vascular disease, ultrasound-guided percutaneous access and careful management of anticoagulation status should be strongly considered. Reversal of heparin with protamine before sheath removal can also be useful to prevent groin hematoma. There are no conclusive data demonstrating that the use of vascular closure devices decreases this complication compared with manual compression.

Large hematomas after sheath removal are the most common complication and are usually self-limited, but they can be large enough to result in blood transfusion. When femoral arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistulas are suspected, ultrasound Doppler or CT scan are useful imaging tools for diagnosis. A CT scan can also be useful in patients with back pain and acute anemia after ablation to evaluate for retroperitoneal hematoma. Percutaneous thrombin injection, surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula, and surgical evacuation of large hematomas are possible interventions for these vascular complications.

4.3 Reduction of postprocedural discomfort after theapproach

AF ablation is a complex procedure that requires multiple catheter positioning and a relatively long procedure time, and continuous intra‐ and peri‐procedural anticoagulation. The advantage of ST puncture is that it uses a single groin, which could reduce the time of hemostasis. A previous report compared the safety and feasibility of UG‐ST ablation with those of BG‐DT ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF. 16 A survey regarding patient discomfort showed that UG‐ST reduced the discomfort with respect to postprocedural hemostasis compared with BG‐DT. When both groins are used, patients usually experience discomfort with back and leg pain during postprocedural hemostasis because of immobility for at least 6 h because of the possibility of bleeding. In patients in the ST group, a single groin was used during the procedure, allowing them to move the other leg immediately after the procedure, thus reducing the discomfort during hemostasis.

Hospital stay after RFCA was significantly reduced in ST group compared to DT group. Reducing patient's discomfort during hemostasis might be helpful to reduce hospital stay after RFCA.

4.4 Potential complications of theapproach

In the ST approach, the risk of stroke might increase because catheters are exchanged several times during the procedure. Therefore, we always irrigated the sheath with saline before catheter exchange to remove clots and air. However, in the current analysis, no cases of stroke occurred in the ST group and three cases of stroke occurred in the DT group. In the DT group, the operator could monitor the PV signals simultaneously during ablation. Therefore, a concern regarding an increased risk of AF recurrence may exist in the ST group because of the higher possibility of missing the gap along the PV antral lesions. However, our results showed no difference in the rate of AF recurrence between the two groups. Also, our results showed no difference in the number of PV reconnection when we performed redo‐RFCA. Additionally, the rates of AF recurrence were slightly lower in the ST group than in the DT group after excluding patients using AADs. However, it is difficult to conclude that the ST approach is more effective than the DT approach in the current setting, and further studies would be needed to clarify this issue.

AF ablation — vascular access site complications and evaluation include common local tenderness and hematomas, with specific imaging triggers for serious bleeding. Tenderness at the vascular access sites is common; hematomas present after sheath removal will typically extend inferiorly and might result in extensive ecchymosis. Prompt ultrasound Doppler investigation should be performed if an AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm is suspected. Worsening of back or buttock pain is common from positioning, but more severe back pain or flank ecchymosis should prompt evaluation for retroperitoneal hematoma using CT imaging. Significant bleeding into the leg can also result in compartment syndrome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Catheter ablation is effective in rhythm control of atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintaining sinus rhythm. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 After a study identified triggers of paroxysmal AF in the pulmonary veins (PVs), catheter ablation of AF has become a more common treatment method. 6, 7 Complete PV isolation is a well‐proven endpoint for catheter ablation by encircling the PVs. 8, 9 To approach the PVs via the left atrium (LA) during AF ablation, transseptal puncture is performed. 10 Although some complications have been reported, such as cardiac tamponade, stroke, and persistence of the septal defect after transseptal puncture, 11, 12, 13 several reports have shown the safety of transseptal puncture. 14, 15 During PV isolation, most operators use the double transseptal (DT) approach for simultaneous PV potential monitoring and ablation.

We have previously compared unilateral groin (UG) puncture‐single transseptal (ST) ablation with the conventional bilateral groin (BG) puncture‐double transseptal (DT) ablation in a prospective randomized trial. 16 No differences in clinical outcome and complications were found between the two groups. However, patient's discomfort about hemostasis was reduced in the UG‐ST group than the BG‐DT group. The number of patients in our previous prospective study was relatively small. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of ST ablation compared to those of DT ablation in patients with AF in real‐world clinical practice.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^114CLXVL]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Tenderness at the vascular access sites is common; hematomas present after sheath removal will typically extend inferiorly (due to gravity) and might result in extensive ecchymosis after ablation. Prompt ultrasound Doppler investigation should be performed if an AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm is suspected. Worsening of back or buttock pain is also common from prolonged supine positioning during the procedure. However, more severe back pain or flank ecchymosis should prompt an evaluation for retroperitoneal hematoma with CT imaging. Significant bleeding into the leg can also result in compartment syndrome.

Shortness of breath soon after ablation might have several causes. The patient should be examined after ablation for evidence of volume overload related to irrigated ablation and diuresed as necessary. Volume overload can be observed in patients with normal or reduced cardiac function, perhaps due to atrial stunning. If dyspnea persists or occurs in the absence of volume overload, a chest X-ray should be obtained to exclude an infectious process or elevation of the respective hemi-diaphragm. PN injury most commonly occurs after balloon-based ablation, but can also occur after RF ablation. Lack of diaphragmatic movement during inspiration under fluoroscopy (the sniff test) is diagnostic of PN injury. Right PN injury is much more common after AF ablation and is due to ablation near the RSPV or SVC (Figure 1). Left PN injury less commonly occurs when ablating near the LAA. Although most cases of phrenic injury recover with reinnervation over a 6–12 month period after ablation, permanent diaphragmatic paralysis has been reported.

Chest pain is common after ablation; the causes include pericarditis, coronary ischemia, and musculoskeletal pain. Symptoms of pericarditis (pleuritic chest pain) are the most common (> 75% of patients) and typically persist for up to a week postablation. In the absence of evidence of hemodynamic compromise, an ECG is of little value. It is important to recognize that nearly all patients will demonstrate a small pericardial effusion following AF ablation as a result of edema. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are recommended for symptom control. Colchicine can also be used to treat pericardial symptoms. Oral steroids should be avoided after catheter ablation unless pericardial symptoms persist or are recurrent. Chest pain that is associated with ECG changes or that occurs with exertion should prompt evaluation of coronary ischemia. In particular, if ablation has been performed inside the CS to target the epicardial portion of the mitral isthmus, or for isolation of a CS tachycardia, circumflex artery stenosis should be considered.

2.4 Follow‐up

Directly after the ablation procedure and 24 h after the ablation a neurological examination was conducted. Additionally, within 24 h after the ablation procedure the access sites were clinically examined. In case of suspect local findings (hematoma, occurrence of new bruits, painful groin) a doppler ultrasound examination of the access site was performed to rule out pseudoaneurysm or AV‐fistula. Further, a transthoracic echocardiography to rule out a pericardial effusion was carried out.

2.5 Statistical analysis

Data were tested for normal distribution. Results of continuous variables are expressed as means ± standard deviation. Statistical analyses were done using the 2 tailed, unpaired Student's t test. Level of significance was set to p < 0.05. Categorical variables are presented as total number with comparison using chi‐square statistics and Fisher exact test. If more than 2 groups were analyzed, a one‐way ANOVA test was performed. Post hoc analyses have been applied using Bonferroni method. Significance level was set to p < 0.05.

Vascular complications after venous cannulation and interventions

Following endovascular interventions performed via femoral venous access, haemorrhage (Fig. 3 D-F) occurs rarely (0.3–1% of all procedures) compared to transarterial ones. Conversely, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is relatively common (reported in up to 21% of patients) and often asymptomatic. In the electrophysiology setting, the incidence of DVT is lower (0.33% versus 2.38%) following treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) compared to non-AF procedures, due to routine periprocedural anticoagulation. Albeit most instances are initially diagnosed using CDUS, using an appropriate CT-venography technique with delayed post-CM acquisition, multidetector CT effectively detects DVT in iliac and femoral veins with the usual appearance as luminal non-opacification and filling defects, causing variable degrees of venous enlargement. A peculiar form of DVT is endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT), which represents the most feared complication (1% incidence within 72 h) of endovenous laser ablation (ELA), and requires anticoagulation to prevent development of pulmonary embolism. ELA is a minimally invasive treatment for lower-extremity venous insufficiency, which achieves venous obliteration by heat-induced irreversible damage to the vein lining, followed by fibrotic sealing of the lumen. CT allows for a comprehensive evaluation of EHIT proximal extension, which is categorised as grade 1 (thrombosis below the saphenous-femoral junction), 2, 3 and 4 respectively corresponding to thrombus occupying < 50%, > 50% or occluding the femoral vein diameter (Fig. 9).

### Improving safety in catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: a prospective study of the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access [^115ZK174]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The most frequent complications of AF ablation (AFA) are related to vascular access, but there is little evidence as to how these can be minimized.

Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing AFA at a high-volume center received either standard care (Group S) or routine ultrasound-guided vascular access (Group U). Vascular complications were assessed before hospital discharge and by means of postal questionnaire 1 month later. Outcome measures were BARC 2+ bleeding complications, postprocedural pain, and prolonged bruising.

Results

Patients in Group S (n = 146) and U (n = 163) were well matched at baseline. Follow-up questionnaires were received from 92.6%. Patients in Group U were significantly less likely to have a BARC 2+ bleed, 10.4% versus 19.9% P = 0.02, were less likely to suffer groin pain after discharge (27.1% vs. 42.8%; P = 0.006) and were less likely to experience prolonged local bruising (21.5% vs. 40.4%; P = 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association of vascular complications with nonultrasound guided access (OR 3.12 95%CI 1.54–5.34; P = 0.003) and increasing age (OR 1.05 95%CI 1.01–1.09; P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Routine use of ultrasound-guided vascular access for AFA is associated with a significant reduction in bleeding complications, postprocedural pain, and prolonged bruising when compared to standard care.

### Effectiveness and safety of single transseptal ablation for atrial fibrillation in real-word practice [^1122jzwE]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

We have previously reported that unilateral groin‐single transseptal (ST) ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was safe and significantly reduced patient discomfort compared with bilateral groin‐double transseptal (DT) ablation.

Hypothesis

In the present study, we hypothesized that ST ablation would be as effective and safe as DT ablation in real‐world practice like previous study. Among the 1765 consecutive patients in the Yonsei AF ablation cohort from October 2015 to January 2020, 1144 patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation were included for the analysis. Among them, 450 underwent ST ablation and 694 underwent DT ablation.

Results

The total procedure time, ablation time, and fluoroscopy time were longer in the ST group than in the DT group (p < .05 for all). The hospital stay after catheter ablation was 1.3 ± 1.1 days which was longer in DT group than ST group (p = .001). No significant difference was observed in the complication rate (p = .263) and AF‐free survival rate (log‐rank p = .19) between the groups. However, after excluding patients who used antiarrhythmic drugs when AF recurred, the AF‐free survival rates were lower in the DT group than in the ST group before and after propensity score matching (log‐rank p = .026 and.047, respectively).

Conclusion

Although the ST approach increases the procedure time compared with the DT approach owing to the need for more frequent catheter exchanges, the ST approach is a feasible and safe strategy for AF ablation in terms of rhythm outcomes and risk of complications.

### Radiofrequency ablation for cancer pain with inadequate opioid response [^115wyiVM]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Data on the use of radiofrequency (RT) to ablate a tumor mass-causing pain have not been reported. A male in his 50s, diagnosed with a pelvic relapse of rectal cancer, was admitted for pain from the left groin to the perineum. The principal findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence in the pelvic area of large solid tissue infiltrating the internal obturator muscle and eroding the vertebral column of the acetabulum. Also involving the gluteal muscles. He was poorly responsive to multiple opioids. He was treated with RT under CT guidance to ablate the pelvic mass. Pain relief was immediate as it was possible to reduce methadone doses since the afternoon of the operation day. Very selected patients who are not responsive to optimisation of opioid therapy, could be candidates to RF of the tumor mass, that may offer an efficient method to provide fast pain relief and allowing opioid dose reduction.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — vascular complications and incidence: Vascular complications are the most common complications of AF ablation and include groin hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, femoral arterial pseudoaneurysm, or femoral arteriovenous fistula. The published incidence of vascular complications varies from 0% to 13%, with a literature review describing a 1% incidence of hematoma and a 1% incidence of an arteriovenous fistula at the puncture site; a worldwide survey of 8745 procedures reported femoral arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula rates of 0.53% and 0.43%, respectively. In most EP laboratories, patients are fully anticoagulated during and following the ablation procedure with interruption of anticoagulation for less than 4–6 hours to allow sheath removal. The approach to femoral venous access may impact risk, and when a superior approach is used there is a potential for a retroperitoneal bleeding complication where substantial blood loss can occur before becoming clinically evident.

### A novel CT-guided transpsoas approach to diagnostic genitofemoral nerve block and ablation [^115GwfeY]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernia repair is associated with a high incidence of chronic postsurgical pain. This pain may be caused by injury to the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, or genitofemoral nerves. It is often difficult to identify the specific source of the pain, in part, because these nerves are derived from overlapping nerve roots and closely colocalize in the area of surgery. It is therefore technically difficult to selectively block these nerves individually proximal to the site of surgical injury. In particular, the genitofemoral nerve is retroperitoneal before entering the inguinal canal, a position that puts anterior approaches to the proximal nerve at risk of transgressing into the peritoneum. We report a computed tomography (CT)-guided transpsoas technique to selectively block the genitofemoral nerve for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes while avoiding injury to the nearby ureter and intestines.

Case

A 39-year-old woman with chronic lancinating right groin pain after inguinal hernia repair underwent multiple pharmacologic interventions and invasive procedures without relief. Using CT and Stimuplex nerve stimulator guidance, the genitofemoral nerve was localized on the anterior surface of the psoas muscle and a diagnostic block with local anesthetic block was performed. The patient had immediate relief of her symptoms for 36 hours, confirming the diagnosis of genitofemoral neuralgia. She subsequently underwent CT-guided radiofrequency and phenol ablation of the genitofemoral nerve but has not achieved long-term analgesia.

Conclusion

CT-guided transpsoas genitofemoral nerve block is a viable option for safely and selectively blocking the genitofemoral nerve for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes proximal to injury caused by inguinal surgery.

### A case of loin pain after cardiac catheterisation [^114M26Bu]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 57-year-old woman with known moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation (AF) presented to the emergency department with acute onset right loin pain after having a coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterisation through the right femoral route about 28h ago. The cardiac catheterisation was done after she presented with one episode of troponin-negative chest pain and progressive shortness of breath. She had anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) 25years ago, which was thought to be due to coronary artery embolism. Her mitral stenosis was diagnosed at that stage. Her warfarin was stopped for 5days before cardiac catheterisation and international normalised ratio (INR) on the day of the procedure was 1.1. No bridging heparin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used and warfarin was restarted on the evening of the procedure at the usual dose. Clinical examination revealed some guarding in the right iliac fossa and some tenderness in the right loin. She was not feverish and there was no dysuria or frequency. There was no lump at the puncture site. On presentation to the emergency department, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen was performed (figures 1 and 2).

### Spontaneous adrenal haemorrhage after catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^1172w24R]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation is established as a first-line therapy for most patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with high success rates and very low complication rates. A 60-year-old woman developed severe right flank pain following straightforward catheter ablation for SVT. This was caused by a spontaneous right adrenal haemorrhage, which, after much delay, was eventually recognised as the cause of her symptoms. Adrenal haematomas are rare and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous adrenal haemorrhage occurring after any interventional cardiac procedure. Clinicians should be aware of this rare but potentially serious complication and consider it as a differential diagnosis in any patient with severe flank pain following interventional cardiac procedures, to prevent delays in diagnosis.

Vascular Complications

Vascular complications, including groin hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, or arteriove-nous fistula, are the most common complications of AF ablation. The incidence of the more significant of these complications (femoral pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and retroperitoneal bleeding) varies from 0.2% to 1.5%. The first and updated worldwide surveys of AF ablation in 2005 and 2010, respectively, reported that the incidence of vascular complications was 0.95% (84 of 8745 patients) and 1.5% (240 of 16309 patients), respectively. A report from the United States analyzing an estimated 93,801 AF ablations between 2000 and 2010 showed the overall incidence of vascular complications requiring blood transfusion or surgical repair was 1.53%, which remained statistically unchanged from year 2000 to 2010. More recent reports from Czechia, Belgium, Japan, and the United States reported the incidence of these complications as 1.1% (13 of 1192 procedures in 959 patients), 1.2% (15 of 1233 procedures in 947 patients), 0.2% (7 of 3373 patients), and 1.5% (18 of 1190 patients), respectively. The incidence of vascular complications that result from AF ablation is lower than those reported for ventricular tachycardia ablation (range, 3.6%–6.9%), in which femoral arterial access is used in many cases. Most groin hematomas can be managed conservatively or with ultrasound-guided compression. However, complications such as femoral pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and retroperitoneal bleeding might require blood transfusion and/or surgical or percutaneous repair, which leads to increased morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. Rarely, a large dense hematoma can lead to femoral neurological sequelae.

### Neuromodulation of the dorsal root ganglion for chronic postsurgical pain [^111TTsGK]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods/Results

Groin/Hernia Surgery (Post-herniorrhaphy Neuralgia)

More than 20 million people undergo inguinal hernia surgery annually around the world, and it is estimated that up to 16% of these individuals will develop chronic and severe postoperative pain, known as post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia. This condition can often be neuropathic in nature, characterized by burning pain or even allodynia in the distribution of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and/or the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. The mechanisms of injury can be the result of direct structural damage as a byproduct of the surgical procedure (i.e. excessive traction or pressure on one of the aforementioned nerves), stitch or mesh entrapment, postoperative inflammation, and/or scar tissue formation.

Treatment of neuropathic groin pain traditionally involves a stepwise approach that includes conservative management with oral analgesics and anti-epileptics, interventional pain modalities like nerve blocks and ablations, peripheral nerve stimulation, surgical revision of the repaired groin, or even a surgical neurectomy. Corticosteroid injections and neuroablative techniques (i.e. cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation) have been frequently utilized; however, the relief tends to be short term.

Surgical neurectomy of the genitofemoral, ilioinguinal, and iliohypogastric nerves (aka "triple neurectomy") is an accepted and sometimes preferred treatment for surgeons for post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia refractory to conservative management. However, there have been no published studies demonstrating the long-term efficacy of this technique. Although this procedure is widely implemented, the risks of this particular surgery are considerable (i.e. permanent sensory loss, loss of the cremasteric reflex, and differentiation pain) and should not be thought of as a benign intervention, as destruction of peripheral nerves may actually increase ectopic firing and even lead to allodynia.

ASV reflux with a hypoplastic proximal GSV and incompetent distal GSV

Occasionally, it is necessary to treat a refluxing distal GSV concomitantly with the proximal ASV, leaving the non-refluxing proximal GSV untreated. This occurs when the reflux arises from a dominant ASV, the GSV is hypoplastic or competent from the lower thigh to the groin, and the venous drainage in the distal GSV arborizes with the ASV and is incompetent. In this case, it may be necessary to ablate the ASV in the thigh, and possibly also the GSV in the lower leg, but leave the non-refluxing GSV in the thigh without treatment (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Dilated ASV in the thigh with proximal hypoplastic GSV in the thigh that dilates and refluxes at and below the knee.

Should the normal ASV be treated when initially treating refluxing GSV?

Given that the ASV is one of the most common sources of recurrence after prior GSV treatment. An example is shown in Figure 4 where an initially normal ASV was later a source of reflux after prior GSV treatment 5 years later (Figure 4). Some investigators have postulated that ablating the normal ASV at the time of GSV ablation would reduce the risk of recurrence. In the most recent Appropriate Use Criteria, prophylactic treatment of a non-refluxing ASV at the time a refluxing GSV is treated, with the goal of reducing recurrence is deemed inappropriate due to lack of evidence. Thus, treating an ASV in the absence of significant reflux for purposes of reducing recurrence is without any indication and could be cause for action against a treating physician by payers or government entities for providing unindicated and inappropriate care. Patients should be advised that this may be a source of future recurrence and that they should be reevaluated if symptoms return. The impact of synchronous prophylactic treatment of the ASV on the incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing thermal ablation of an incompetent GSV is being studied in a randomized prospective trial (the SYNCHRONOUS-Study) with 1150 patients. Studies such as this will help determine if there is sufficient evidence to recommend such a prophylactive approach to reduce recurrence in the future.

The weak point of this Consensus Conference was the paucity and lack of high-quality studies present in the literature. This represented a problem concerning scientific support to substantiate and validate the experts' various opinions. For this reason the conclusions of this Consensus Conference do not represent evidence, but rather guidelines.

The relatively small number of female participants in the present literature could theoretically be a limitation for the applicability of the data described above to a female population. Further studies focused on female population are needed.

Finally, we would like to point out the need for future multidisciplinary Consensus Conferences that could help to further clarify this difficult field of study.

2.5 Trial endpoints

2.5.1 Post hoc subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint

The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint are described and reported elsewhere. The primary endpoint was time to hemostasis. We stratified the primary endpoint by chronologically splitting the study into chronologic halves (based on individual operator case volume) to evaluate for temporal changes in efficacy and to describe the learning curve of the SMC procedure. We also performed a post hoc secondary analysis of the primary endpoint stratified by the number of access points/sheaths to determine if there may be different efficiencies in SMC with different access strategies. We performed a sub‐group analysis, including only those in the MC group who had a figure‐of‐eight suture (Fo8) suture placed to compare efficacy of SMC to Fo8 in this context.

2.5.2 Prospectively collected, prespecified secondary endpoints

We included and collected data on several secondary endpoints at discharge and routine 30‐day follow up. Details of these endpoints are available in the online Supporting Information (Supporting Information Methods). In summary, these included failure of initial ambulation at goal time, composites of all major and minor access site complications at discharge and follow up, as well as resultant additional unplanned clinic and hospital visits and associated diagnostic testing to evaluate those complications (see Supporting Information Methods), postprocedure length of stay, frequencies in delays of planned discharge, the number of nursing encounters required before discharge, opiate pain medication requirements, and patient reported outcomes as follows:
1 pain at discharge measured by a previously validated10‐point visual analog pain scale.
2 patient responses to a validated short form inguinal pain questionnaire at follow up.
3 patient satisfaction score measured by a survey adopted from prior studies of vascular closure, that was administered both at discharge and follow up, as well as a
4 patient satisfaction on a Likert scale based on five questions pertaining to their access site.

We also collected direct costs (reported in USD, $) associated with the procedure including overall cost of care, as well as cost related to hemostasis, groin site complications, and unplanned visits and diagnostic testing related to issues with the groin/access site through follow up time. Cost was determined using facility charges. Additional details on the calculation of costs are available on the online Supporting Information appendix (Supporting Information Methods).

### Vascular access complications after catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias: impact of vascular closure devices [^112zgejj]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings are in line with prior studies on different interventional/structural cardiology procedures that, similarly to VA ablation, require ≥ 1 arterial access with large bore sheaths and have shown that complete access closure is associated with a reduced rate of vascular complications. – In this context, we found that the total number of arterial accesses was also an independent predictor of vascular complications whereas femoral venous access (and number of accesses) appeared protective. The latter finding was likely multifactorial. First, we observed excellent outcomes in the 129 procedures performed via a transfemoral venous access–only route (ie, no arterial access). In this subgroup, an overall higher number of venous access points was obtained compared with patients in whom arterial access was obtained (2.8 ± 0.8 venous accesses vs 2.5 ± 0.7 venous accesses; P = 0.001 for comparison) and no major vascular complications occurred, with only 1 case of minor groin hematoma not requiring intervention. Of note, these findings have modified our current institutional approaches to patients undergoing CA of VAs, in whom femoral arterial access is avoided whenever possible, and a transvenous femoral route only is used as a first-line strategy in order to minimize the risk of vascular complications. Furthermore, within the group of patients who had any arterial access obtained, those with arterial accesses < 8 F had a higher number of femoral venous accesses than did those who had arterial accesses ≥ 8 F (2.8 ± 0.7 venous accesses vs 2.4 ± 0.7 venous accesses; P < .001 for comparison). These figures may explain the protective effect of the increasing number of venous accesses seen in our analysis.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^11481iMY]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

The number and complexity of endovascular procedures performed via either arterial or venous access are steadily increasing. Albeit associated with higher morbidity compared to the radial approach, the traditional common femoral artery remains the preferred access site in a variety of cardiac, aortic, oncologic and peripheral vascular procedures. Both transarterial and venous cannulation (for electrophysiology, intravenous laser ablation and central catheterisation) at the groin may result in potentially severe vascular access site complications (VASC). Furthermore, vascular and soft-tissue groin infections may develop after untreated VASC or secondarily to non-sterile injections for recreational drug use. VASC and groin infections require rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment to avoid further, potentially devastating harm. Whereas in the past colour Doppler ultrasound was generally used, in recent years cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists increasingly rely on pelvic and femoral CT angiography. Despite drawbacks of ionising radiation and the need for intravenous contrast, multidetector CT rapidly and consistently provides a panoramic, comprehensive visualisation, which is crucial for correct choice between conservative, endovascular and surgical management. This paper aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with iatrogenic and self-inflicted VASC and infections at the groin by presenting examples of haematomas, active bleeding, pseudoaneurysms, arterial occlusion, arterio-venous fistula, endovenous heat-induced thrombosis, septic thrombophlebitis, soft-tissue infections at the groin, and late sequelae of venous injuries.

Teaching Points

- Complications may develop after femoral arterial or venous access for interventional procedures.

- Arterial injuries include bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, occlusion, arteriovenous fistula, dissection.

- Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis is a specific form of iatrogenic venous complication.

- Iatrogenic infections include groin cellulitis, abscesses and septic thrombophlebitis.

- CT angiography reliably triages vascular access site complications and groin infections.

### Systematic review of electrophysiology procedures in patients with obstruction of the inferior vena cava [^111GFXGw]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

8 OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

Ablation was successful in 135 of 140 procedures in which outcomes were reported. There were no repeat procedures performed in the local cases after their index procedures. In previously reported cases, one patient underwent a repeat procedure for ablation of typical atrial flutter after having had prior ablation for AVNRT. Both procedures were performed successfully using an inferior approach.

In the superior approach group, one patient experienced left atrial perforation during attempted transseptal puncture with superior approach and it required thoracotomy and left atrial repair. Haemoptysis was reported in another patient undergoing cryoballoon ablation but it was attributed to irritation from the TEE probe. A patient undergoing AF ablation died 11 days following the procedure after inadvertent entry into an undiagnosed atrioesophageal fistula from a prior convergent epicardial ablation performed 3 weeks before. This complication was thought to be unrelated to the superior approach of access.

In the transhepatic approach group, one patient undergoing RF PVI developed a small pericardial effusion that did not require intervention. One patient developed reactive arthritis 16 days following cryoballoon ablation, and it was possibly related to the hemostatic plug. Self‐limited scrotal tenderness developed in one patient a day after PVI and a small amount of blood in the pelvis was noted on CT. Anticoagulation was restarted the following day.

In the transaortic approach group, one patient developed a groin haematoma associated with pseudoaneurysm requiring thrombin injection following AF and atrial tachycardia ablation using RMN. There were no complications reported in the inferior approach group.

### Radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branches of the femoral nerve for the treatment of greater trochanteric syndrome [^116rfBx6]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 12–15% of adults over the age of 60 suffer from chronic hip pain, defined as pain most of the days over the past six weeks. The prevalence of chronic hip pain is even greater among adults who play sports, with estimates ranging from 30–40%. Not only is this pain debilitating, often impairing an individual's ability to sit and stand, but it often becomes chronic, increasing in incidence with increasing age. The high prevalence of chronic hip pain might be partially explained by the difficulty clinicians experience in diagnosing the pain. The hip joint is innervated by articular branches of the obturator, femoral, superior gluteal, and sciatic nerves, which complicates the diagnosis of hip pain, as pain is often referred to the hip via these nerves. Patients often present with hip pain accompanied by chronic lumbar or knee pain, or hip pain that is referred from the spine, abdomen, hernial sites, sites of trauma, and several other locations. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is one of the most common diagnoses in patients with chronic hip pain. GTPS encompasses several disorders of the lateral, peritrochanteric space of the hip, including tears of the gluteus medius and minimus, external coxa saltans tears, and trochanteric bursitis. Like generalized hip pain, GTPS is relatively common and has a broad differential diagnosis. A multicenter observational study conducted by Segal et al estimated the prevalence of unilateral and bilateral GTPS to be 15% and 8% in women and 6.6% and 1.9% in men ages 50–79, respectively. Many patients who present with GTPS will continue to experience chronic pain following both conservative and surgical intervention. Given the complexity of hip joint pathology, which commonly results in groin and thigh pain, it is often difficult to manage the pain of patients who suffer from GTPS.

### 2025 international expert practical guide on the use of the pentaspline pulsed field ablation system in atrial fibrillation ablation procedures [^113BtDUk]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Role of ICE (Routinely Used in the United States)

ICE is an imaging tool in guiding catheter-based ablation of arrhythmias. ICE allows real-time imaging of the cardiac anatomy, guiding the placement of the catheters. Using ICE for pentasline PFA catheter-based ablation may enhance the safety and precision of the procedure.

The outline of using ICE to guide pentasline PFA catheter-based ablation includes the following:

After appropriate patient preparation and obtaining femoral venous access, the ICE catheter is inserted via the femoral vein and advanced to the right atrium (RA). The ICE catheter is typically positioned in the RA for real-time imaging.
ICE can provide real-time images of the cardiac structures, including the RA, interatrial septum, left atrium (LA), atrial appendage, PVs, ventricles, aorta, valves, pericardium, and the positions of the sheath/wire/catheter.
For transseptal puncture, ICE provides real-time visualization to guide the puncture with optimal alignment of the transseptal puncture needle with the interatrial septum, to avoid mechanical damage of the needle (or sheath/wire) to the surrounding structures. ICE can also guide the exchange of the sheath.
For catheter positioning, ICE can guide the catheter position and confirm the location of the pentaspline PFA catheter and visualize proper contact with the tissue to be ablated.
For procedure monitoring, throughout the procedure ICE can continuously visualize the catheter and surrounding anatomy, and check for complications such as pericardial effusion or thrombus formation.

General Practical Aspects of PFA Procedure (Seen in)

summarizes the general practical aspects of PFA, which include: preprocedural imaging, patient preparation/sedation, groin access, anticoagulation, transseptal puncture, assessment of anatomy, sheath exchange/preparation and manipulation, and the PFA ablation protocol.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^112f2Tka]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The number and complexity of endovascular procedures performed via either arterial or venous access are steadily increasing. Albeit associated with higher morbidity compared to the radial approach, the traditional common femoral artery remains the preferred access site in a variety of cardiac, aortic, oncologic and peripheral vascular procedures. Both transarterial and venous cannulation (for electrophysiology, intravenous laser ablation and central catheterisation) at the groin may result in potentially severe vascular access site complications (VASC). Furthermore, vascular and soft-tissue groin infections may develop after untreated VASC or secondarily to non-sterile injections for recreational drug use. VASC and groin infections require rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment to avoid further, potentially devastating harm. Whereas in the past colour Doppler ultrasound was generally used, in recent years cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists increasingly rely on pelvic and femoral CT angiography. Despite drawbacks of ionising radiation and the need for intravenous contrast, multidetector CT rapidly and consistently provides a panoramic, comprehensive visualisation, which is crucial for correct choice between conservative, endovascular and surgical management. This paper aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with iatrogenic and self-inflicted VASC and infections at the groin by presenting examples of haematomas, active bleeding, pseudoaneurysms, arterial occlusion, arterio-venous fistula, endovenous heat-induced thrombosis, septic thrombophlebitis, soft-tissue infections at the groin, and late sequelae of venous injuries.

Teaching Points

- Complications may develop after femoral arterial or venous access for interventional procedures.
- Arterial injuries include bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, occlusion, arteriovenous fistula, dissection.
- Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis is a specific form of iatrogenic venous complication.
- Iatrogenic infections include groin cellulitis, abscesses and septic thrombophlebitis.
- CT angiography reliably triages vascular access site complications and groin infections.

### Does ultrasound-guided lidocaine injection improve local anaesthesia before femoral artery catheterization? [^116yK8V5]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To present the results of a prospective, randomized, single-centre study investigating local anaesthesia before percutaneous common femoral artery (CFA) puncture and catheterization with the use of ultrasound-guided injection of lidocaine versus standard infiltration by manual palpation.

Materials and Methods

Patients scheduled to undergo diagnostic or therapeutic transfemoral catheter-based procedures gave informed consent and were randomized in two groups. In the first arm local anaesthesia with lidocaine hydrochloride 1% was performed under ultrasound guidance (group U/S), while in the second arm the standard method of manual artery palpation was applied (group M). In both groups, subsequent CFA catheterization was achieved under ultrasound guidance. The primary study endpoint was peri-procedural pain level evaluated with a visual-analogue scale (VAS score 0–10).

Results

Between January 2009 and 2010, 200 patients (161 men, mean age 63 ± 12 years) were equally assigned to each group without any significant differences in baseline demographics. Patients in group U/S experienced significantly less pain during CFA catheterization in comparison with group M with a difference of three points in mean VAS score reported (1.6 ± 1.6 versus 4.6 ± 1.9, p < 0.0001). In addition, significantly less volume of lidocaine was used in group U/S compared to group M (16 ± 2.7 versus 19 ± 0.8ml, p < 0.001). Total vascular access time was similar in both groups (4.4 ± 1.3 versus 4.5 ± 1.3min). Overall complications included two small groin haematomas in each group.

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided local anaesthesia of the CFA prior to percutaneous transcatheter procedures is safe and achieves superior levels of analgesia with minimal patient pain and discomfort compared to the standard method of manual palpation.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^1112T5a8]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

The use of PRF ablation in the treatment of CPIP has been reported in multiple case series–as well as in a recent systematic review.PRF ablation delivers high intensity currents in pulses, which allows for heat (typically 42°C) to dissipate during the latent phase so that neurodestructive temperatures are not obtained, thus lowering the risk of neuroma formation, neuritis-type reaction, and deafferentation pain. This mild heating of the nerve tissue is thought to temporarily block nerve conduction; however, the exact mechanism by which PRF ablation provides analgesia is unclear. Rozen and Ahnand Rozen and Parvezdescribed in two published case series (of the same patient cohort) the use of PRF ablation of the T12, L1, and L2 lumbar nerve roots for treatment of CPIP. In these repeat publications, the five patients had 75%–100% pain reduction that lasted 6–9 months, leading the authors to conclude that this modality is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients suffering from CPIP. In the published case series by Cohen and Foster, three patients with chronic groin pain (two of them were CPIP) underwent either IIN and/or IHN or GFN PRF ablation after having successful diagnostic blocks. Compared with the Rozen and Ahn, and Rozen and Parvez studies, the PRF ablation in the study by Cohen and Foster, was performed peripherally based on anatomic location of these nerves in the groin, and correct needle placement was confirmed using sensory stimulation. All three of these patients reported continued complete pain relief at 6 months. Mitra et alpublished a single case report on the use of PRF ablation for a patient with non-CPIP ilioinguinal neuralgia. Similarly to Cohen and Foster, they report performing PRF ablation peripherally at the anatomic location of the nerves in the groin, using sensory stimulation as confirmation for correct needle placement. In this study, they describe a significant reduction in pain score (from VAS [visual analog scale] 8/10 to 3/10) that persisted at a 3-month follow-up.

AF ablation — postprocedural chest pain and pericarditis management includes analgesic recommendations, steroid avoidance caveat, and triggers for ischemia evaluation. Chest pain is common after ablation; the causes include pericarditis, coronary ischemia, and musculoskeletal pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are recommended for symptom control, and colchicine can also be used to treat pericardial symptoms. Oral steroids should be avoided after catheter ablation unless pericardial symptoms persist or are recurrent. Chest pain with ECG changes or that occurs with exertion should prompt evaluation of coronary ischemia, and circumflex artery stenosis should be considered if ablation involved the coronary sinus for mitral isthmus or CS tachycardia targets.

### Bleeding sites and treatment strategies for cardiac tamponade by catheter ablation requiring thoracotomy: risks of catheter ablation in patients with left atrial diverticulum [^112XHemE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Among the complications associated with catheter ablation, cardiac tamponade is the most feared. Its incidence varies from 0.3 to 2.5%. In this study, among 1,083 catheter ablation cases for AF, we encountered five cardiac tamponades (0.5%; 5 of 1083). Of the five patients with cardiac tamponade, three required sternotomy and two required pericardiocentesis (Table 1). Although one of five in our study were woman, the incidence of cardiac tamponade due to catheter ablation was reported to be significantly higher in women. The women's hearts are smaller than those of men's, but the same catheters are used in both sexes. This increases the groin complication rate at the puncture site and also increases the risk of perforation and transseptal mispuncture. The incidence of atrial septal aneurysm is reported to be higher in women, and performing transseptal puncture may be more difficult in women than in men. Furthermore, most cases of cardiac tamponade occur during catheterization or ablation due to the thin LA wall and small atrial volume in women. Owing to the small number of analyzed cases in the present study, we were unable to demonstrate a direct relationship between sex and the risk of cardiac tamponade.

### Role of MR neurography in groin and genital pain: ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral neuralgia [^114zqfNP]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic neuralgia of the border nerves (ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral) is difficult to diagnose and treat clinically. We examined the role of MR neurography (MRN) in the evaluation of border nerve abnormalities and the results of treatments directed at the MRN-detected nerve abnormalities.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cross-sectional study included 106 subjects with groin or genital pain (mean [± SD] age, 50.7 ± 15.4 years) who showed mono- or multifocal neuropathy of the border nerves at 3-T MRN. Subjects who underwent CT-guided perineural injection were assessed for pain response. Injection responses were categorized as positive, possible positive, and negative. Subjects who received hyaluronidase, continuous radiofrequency ablation, or surgery were also evaluated for treatment outcomes.

Results

One hundred forty abnormal nerves were positive for neuropathy in 106 studies. Eighty of 106 subjects had single neuropathy, and 26 had multifocal neuropathy. Fifty-eight subjects underwent CT-guided perineural injections, with five receiving bilateral injections (63 injections). Improvement in subjective pain was seen in 53 of 63 cases (84.2%). A statistically significant improvement in pain response was noted in the isolated ilioinguinal nerve block group as compared with the isolated genitofemoral nerve block group (p = 0.0085). Thirteen of 58 subjects received multiple nerve injections at the same sitting. Both groups receiving single or multiple nerve injections had similar improvement in pain scores of 84% and 85%, respectively, although this difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Our retrospective analysis showed improved pain relief in subjects who underwent CT-guided nerve blocks on the basis of a positive MRN.

### Nonfluoroscopic catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in adults: feasibility, safety, and efficacy [^115foVvo]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter ablations are traditionally performed using fluoroscopic guidance, exposing both patients and medical staff to the risks of radiation. Nonfluoroscopic catheter ablation has been used successfully to treat limited types of arrhythmias in children, but whether this approach has broad application in adults is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of fluoroless catheter ablation in adults being treated for a range of arrhythmias.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis was performed in 2 patient groups (both n = 60): (1) the nonfluoroscopy (NF) group consisting of consecutive adult patients, in which catheter positioning was accomplished exclusively with intracardiac electrograms (IE), electroanatomic mapping (EAM), and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE); and (2) the fluoroscopy (F) group, in which catheter positioning was additionally guided by fluoroscopy. The patients in the F group were selected to match the types of arrhythmias in the NF group. All ablation procedures were performed by one operator. The total procedure time did not differ between groups for any specific type of arrhythmia ablated. Acute procedural success was similar in both groups (NF, 59/60 [98%] and F, 60/60 [100%]). The complications were limited to a groin pseudoaneurysm in the NF group, and pericardial effusion and groin hematoma in the F group.

Conclusion

Catheter ablations were efficiently and effectively performed in adults with a variety of arrhythmias using only IE, EAM, and ICE for catheter guidance. This nonfluoroscopic technique was feasible, posed no additional safety concerns, and should be readily implementable in most electrophysiology laboratories.

If pericardial access may be needed, the subxiphoid region and possibly the parasternal and apical regions should also be prepped and draped, and in cases with higher risk of cardiac tamponade, sterile preparation of the subxiphoid region can be considered at the onset of the procedure.

### Atrial fibrillation ablation using open-irrigated tip radiofrequency: experience with intraprocedural activated clotting times ≤ 210 seconds [^111qmyTp]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures generally use intraprocedural activated clotting time (ACT) of > 300–350 seconds to prevent thromboembolic events.

Objective

To evaluate bleeding and thromboembolic procedural complications in patients with symptomatic AF undergoing ablation procedures with low intraprocedural ACT.

Methods

We examined a subset of 372 of 2334 (15.9%) AF ablation procedures using open-irrigated tip radiofrequency catheters at 50 W, interrupted oral anticoagulation, and a target ACT of 225 seconds, with average ACT ≤ 210 seconds.

Results

There were 372 ablation procedures in 339 patients with average ACT ≤ 210 seconds. Patient demographic characteristics were as follows: age 60.9 ± 9.4 years, men 269 (79.3%), left atrial (LA) size 4.27 ± 0.65 cm, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack 24 (7.1%), CHADS2 score 0.94 ± 0.98, and CHA2DS2-VASc score 1.53 ± 1.35. AF type was categorized as paroxysmal in 107 (31.6%), persistent in 200 (59.0%), and long-standing persistent in 32 (9.4%). Procedural and LA times were 119 ± 26 and 82 ± 24 minutes. Patients underwent preprocedure transesophageal echocardiography. The heparin bolus (8738 ± 2823 units, 93.4 mg/kg) was given after LA access, and the maintenance infusion was 1000 units/hour via a single transseptal sheath with subsequent adjustments based on ACT values. The average ACT was 202 ± 7.5 seconds per procedure, with 116 patients with average ACT < 200 seconds and 16 patients with all ACTs < 200 seconds. Complications occurred in 7 of 372 (1.9%) ablation procedures, including 2 pericardial tamponades (0.54%), 1 groin pseudoaneurysm (0.27%), and 1 pulmonary embolus, several weeks postablation. There were no other bleeding events and no strokes/transient ischemic attacks or systemic thromboemboli.

Conclusion

Using open-irrigated tip radiofrequency catheters at 50 W and preablation transesophageal echocardiography as well as infusing maintenance heparin through a single transseptal sheath, AF ablation can be performed safely despite ACT averaging ≤ 210 seconds. While we are not advocating target ACTs this low, our data suggest that long ACTs may not be absolutely necessary for preventing thromboembolic events. Lower target ACTs may potentially reduce bleeding complications.

### Inferior gluteal pain with sitting, unrelated to ischial bursitis [^1127ot2z]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 64-year-old woman presented to an academic medical centre with postoperative left ischial pain following a left total hip replacement. Her pain was exacerbated by sitting down and with forward flexion of the spine, and the pain radiated from the left ischial tuberosity to the left perineum, groin and medial thigh. An ischial bursa injection was performed, but only resulted in 1day of excellent pain relief. A diagnosis of inferior cluneal neuralgia was then made. Subsequent inferior cluneal nerve radiofrequency ablation was performed, and provided sustained 50% relief in pain. The patient had a concomitant sensation of 'ball like' pressure at her rectum which was determined to be due to levator ani syndrome. She was prescribed pelvic floor physical therapy and botulinum toxin injection, which resulted in further notable improvement of her symptoms.

### Management of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization [^1118vVKS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

While performance of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the domain of specialized cardiologists, patients undergoing PCI are cared for by noninvasive cardiologists, internists, and primary care physicians. Therefore, patient care is optimized when the entire patient care team understands procedural risks and complications as well as optimum patient management before, during, and after PCI. Before PCI, patients with contrast dye allergies should be identified and pretreated with steroids and an H1-blocker. Hydration should be initiated and maintained before and after the procedure to minimize the risks for contrast nephropathy. Periprocedure, patients should be monitored clinically for evidence of ischemia. In patients with significant groin, flank, abdominal, or back pain, as well as those with decrease in hematocrit or unexplained hypotension, the diagnosis of groin or retroperitoneal hematoma should be considered and promptly evaluated. Groin tenderness, pulsatile mass, or bruit should prompt evaluation for possible femoral pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistulae. After the procedure, all patients treated with coronary stents should receive aspirin plus clopidogrel. Patients who develop typical anginal symptoms between the 1st and 6th to 8th months after PCI are likely to have restenosis and can be evaluated by an imaging study or repeated catheterization.

### The anterior saphenous vein. part 4. clinical and technical considerations in treatment. endorsed by the American Vein and Lymphatic Society, the American Venous Forum, and the International Union of Phlebology [^112gYCgA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Technical considerations

There are several technical considerations when treating the ASV. For example, when treating both the ASV and GSV, the second vein to be cannulated can go into spasm when the first is treated and make it more difficult to treat at the same time. A double pre-puncture can help reduce the risk of spasm in the second vein after initial ablation of the first.

Another consideration is that in some patients with a dilated ASV, the vein may be located very close to the superficial femoral artery (SFA) just at or distal to the groin (Figure 5). When using a thermal ablation technique, one should make sure to assess the distance between the ASV and the SFA and place ample tumescent anesthesia to further separate these vessels as an AV fistula has been reported in this situation.

Figure 5
ASV 21 mm from the superficial femoral artery (SFA).

The ASV is generally shorter than the GSV and in some cases, it can be too short to cannulate with a thermal ablation catheter and ablate. In obese patients, it can be hard to locate, cannulate, and treat the ASV as it may leave the fascia and become a varicose tributary just distal to the groin crease where it can be less easily identified with ultrasound for needle and wire placement. Similarly, tumescent anesthesia can be difficult in such patients. When targeting the ASV within the fascia, the length can be shorter than the catheter heating zone. Depending on the manufacturer, a catheter with a 2.5 or 3 cm treatment zone can often be used to insure that the length of the ASV can be ablated without exposing the skin to the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) coil (Figure 6). In these cases, non-thermal approaches such as cyanoacrylate, proprietary foam sclerotherapy, or mechanochemical ablation may be additional non-thermal non-tumescent options. Alternatively, surgical options such as high ligation or phlebectomies only can be considered.

### Risk factors for bacterial catheter colonization in regional anaesthesia [^113dnHMH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Although several potential risk factors have been discussed, risk factors associated with bacterial colonization or even infection of catheters used for regional anaesthesia are not very well investigated. METHODS: In this prospective observational trial, 198 catheters at several anatomical sites where placed using a standardized technique. The site of insertion was then monitored daily for signs of infection (secretion at the insertion site, redness, swelling, or local pain). The catheters were removed when clinically indicated (no or moderate postoperative pain) or when signs of potential infection occurred. After sterile removal they were prospectively analyzed for colonization, defined as > 15 colony forming units. RESULTS: 33 (16.7%) of all catheters were colonized, and 18 (9.1%) of these with additional signs of local inflammation. Two of these patients required antibiotic treatment due to superficial infections. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with catheter colonization. Out of 26 potential factors, three came out as statistically significant. Catheter placement in the groin (odds-ratio and 95%-confidence interval: 3.4; 1.5–7.8), and repeated changing of the catheter dressing (odds-ratio: 2.1; 1.4–3.3 per removal) increased the risk for colonization, whereas systemic antibiotics administered postoperatively decreased it (odds ratio: 0.41; 0.12–1.0). CONCLUSION: Colonization of peripheral and epidural nerve catheter can only in part be predicted at the time of catheter insertion since two out of three relevant variables that significantly influence the risk can only be recorded postoperatively. Catheter localisation in the groin, removal of the dressing and omission of postoperative antibiotics were associated with, but were not necessarily causal for bacterial colonization. These factors might help to identify patients who are at increased risk for catheter colonization.

### Safety and efficacy of DOACs vs acenocoumarol in patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^115za9iE]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Thromboembolic complications can be life-threatening during atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous treatment using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as an alternative to uninterrupted acenocoumarol for periprocedural anticoagulation.

Hypothesis

Continuous treatment with DOACs has similar safety and efficacy compared to acenocoumarol.

Methods

We enrolled 474 patients (mean age, 58 years; 68.4% male) undergoing AF catheter ablation between June 2013 and December 2016. All patients were equally assigned to take acenocoumarol (group 1, 136 patients) or DOACs (group 2, 338 patients) for ≥ 2 months before the procedure. We compared thromboembolic and bleeding complications between the 2 groups.

Results

Our analysis showed no significant difference in major and minor complications between the 2 patient groups. Specifically, 3 of 136 patients (2.2%) using uninterrupted acenocoumarol had a major complication (1 patient [0.7%] had transient ischemic attack resolved 8 hours later, 1 [0.7%] had pericardial tamponade, and 1 [0.7%] had a subcapsular renal hematoma) and 2 patients (1.4%) had minor complications (1 [0.7%] pseudoaneurysm and 1 [0.7%] groin hematoma). In group 2, 1 of 338 patients (0.3%) had a major complication (transient ischemic attack). In the same group, 7 patients (2.1%) had a minor complication (1 patient [0.3%] presented with pseudoaneurysm, 4 [1.2%] with pericardial effusion < 1 cm, 1 [0.3%] femoral arteriovenous fistula between the femoral artery and femoral vein, and 1 [0.7%] groin hematoma).

Conclusions

DOACs and acenocoumarol have similar safety and effectiveness regarding thromboembolic complications prevention without increasing bleeding complications.

Procedure results

The procedure results are presented in Table 2. Case 1, which had a sheath left in the ipsilateral common femoral artery, showed extravasation in the distal site of the external iliac artery (Fig. 1 a). NBCA was mixed with Lp at a ratio of 1:2 (n = 4) or 1:3 (n = 1). In case 5, we injected NBCA-Lp twice at the same procedure because the arteriography revealed that complete hemostasis could not be achieved after the first injection. In the other four cases, NBCA-Lip was injected only once (Fig. 1 b). The total volume range of injected NBCA-Lp was 0.5–1.0 ml. In all the patients, arteriography showed the disappearance of the pseudoaneurysm or extravasation just after the embolization (Fig. 1 c). The mean follow-up duration after the procedure was 7.9 ± 5.0 months (range: 0.5–13 months). Post-operative CT follow-up was performed for all patients, and the CT revealed no recurrence of bleeding in all cases. The technical and overall success rate in all the patients was 100%. There were no complications, including migration of NBCA-Lip following deflation of the balloon catheter and resultant limb ischemia.

### Femoral pseudoaneurysms after percutaneous access [^1177jL7t]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The femoral artery has been the primary percutaneous-based arterial access site for coronary artery catheterizations for more than three decades. Noncardiac percutaneous-based procedures have also been performed primarily with femoral access and have increased in number exponentially by vascular specialists in past decades. Groin complications are infrequent in incidence after femoral arterial access for cardiac and peripheral diagnostic and interventional cases, with groin hematomas and pseudoaneurysms being the most common. Until ultrasound-based treatment modalities became the mainstay of treatment, vascular surgeons were the primary specialty managing pseudoaneurysms, but now other specialties also manage these cases. This review outlines the clinical implications and current issues relevant to understanding the ideal treatment strategy for this common complication.

### Leadless pacing: a comprehensive review [^115XpYk7]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The early performance of the Micra was studied in 140 patients from 11 different countries, with a successful implantation procedure in all patients. In more than half of the patients (59%), the device was successfully implanted at the first attempt. During the 3-month follow-up, 30 adverse events occurred in 26 patients, consisting of 9 cases of arrhythmias, 7 events at device placement site, 11 events at groin puncture site, and other including back pain in 3 patients.

The second larger study to investigate the safety of the Micra was the Micra Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study. In this study, 725 patients were enrolled from 56 centres with a 6-month follow-up period. In 99.2%, the implantation was successful, and the remaining unsuccessful implantations were attributed to four cardiac perforations, one patient with unsatisfactory pacing thresholds, and one patient with tortuous venous anatomy. During 6-month follow-up, 96.0% of the patients were free from major complications and 98.3% had an adequate pacing threshold. Likewise, in the Micra Acute Performance European and Middle Eastern (MAP EMEA) cohort with 928 patients included and in the Micra Post-Approval Registry (PAR) cohort, including 1817 patients, successful implantation rates equalled 99.9% and 99.1%, respectively. At 12 months, 98.1% and 97.0% of patients had adequate pacing threshold values. Major complications were experienced in 3.6% and 2.7% during 12-month follow-up (Table 1). Major complications included complications related to groin access, pacing issues, pacemaker syndrome, and cardiac perforation. With respect to the risk of thrombosis and embolism, the IDE and PAR studies reported on deep vein thrombosis (n = 1, 0.3%) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1, 0.1%). In the MAP EMEA study, vascular events were not reported. The use of antithrombotic therapy peri-interventional within these three studies was unfortunately not described. In another study, including 107 patients, only 1 case of thrombosis of the ipsilateral saphenous vein occurred in a female patient who was not anticoagulated. In 2016, a case report described thrombus formation at the tip of the Micra catheter during the implantation, and heparin was not administered during this procedure. Ever since, administering a bolus of heparin during the implantation procedure has been recommended. Importantly, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or thrombosis of the LPMs was not observed in our cohort of 449 patients of whom 133 did not receive any anticoagulants during follow-up.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^1122VGLE]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

Although little has been written on postprocedural management of access sites specifically after catheter VT ablation, practices have been adapted by extrapolating results from other procedures requiring femoral venous or arterial access. Manual compression has been the standard of care for achievement of hemostasis after venous sheath removal. In randomized studies of other electrophysiology procedures comparing manual compression with temporary suture closures or a vascular closure device, comparable high rates of hemostasis had been achieved. Extrapolating these results to ventricular ablation procedures, manual compression is effective in achieving hemostasis, though time to hemostasis can be expected to be shorter with temporary suture techniques compared with manual compression.
The use of a temporary purse-string or figure-of-8 suture that can be removed after achieving hemostasis has been studied after venous access in other ablation procedures, such as for AF, in which procedures are routinely performed on uninterrupted anticoagulation and/or with large-bore catheters. Compared with manual compression, temporary suture techniques can yield faster hemostasis and ambulation times and reduce the pain or discomfort associated with hemostasis. Two randomized studies have shown shorter times to hemostasis and ambulation, with one reporting reduced rates of access complications compared with manual compression. Vascular closure device-based methods for venous closure have not been specifically studied for electrophysiology procedures. One randomized study compared manual compression to an extravascular closure system that delivers resorbable polyethylene glycol sealant external to the vessel at the sheath access point in 208 patients with a 5, 6, or 7 Fr sheath in the common femoral vein. There were no vascular complications in either arm. Time to hemostasis was significantly shorter in the device arm (0.12 ± 0.89 vs 7.6 ± 5.7 minutes; P < .001). When the writing committee was surveyed regarding venous access hemostasis, all the respondents used manual compression, approximately half (53%) used temporary figure-of-8 or purse-string sutures some of the time, and only 1 (6%) had used a vascular closure device. Given that venous access complications are driven primarily by insertion difficulties or concomitant arterial access, reduction in venous access complication outcomes might be best achieved with methods such as use of ultrasound at insertion, rather than by device- or suture-based methods.

### Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation for resistant hypertension: durability of blood pressure reduction out to 24 months [^112Zvjo4]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Renal sympathetic hyperactivity is seminal in the maintenance and progression of hypertension. Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. Durability of effect beyond 1 year using this novel technique has never been reported. A cohort of 45 patients with resistant hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg on ≥ 3 antihypertension drugs, including a diuretic) has been originally published. Herein, we report longer-term follow-up data on these and a larger group of similar patients subsequently treated with catheter-based renal denervation in a nonrandomized manner. We treated 153 patients with catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation at 19 centers in Australia, Europe, and the United States. Mean age was 57 ± 11 years, 39% were women, 31% were diabetic, and 22% had coronary artery disease. Baseline values included mean office BP of 176/98 ± 17/15 mm Hg, mean of 5 antihypertension medications, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 83 ± 20 mL/min per 1.73 m². The median time from first to last radiofrequency energy ablation was 38 minutes. The procedure was without complication in 97% of patients (149 of 153). The 4 acute procedural complications included 3 groin pseudoaneurysms and 1 renal artery dissection, all managed without further sequelae. Postprocedure office BPs were reduced by 20/10, 24/11, 25/11, 23/11, 26/14, and 32/14 mm Hg at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. In conclusion, in patients with resistant hypertension, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation results in a substantial reduction in BP sustained out to ≥ 2 years of follow-up, without significant adverse events.

### Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve radiofrequency ablation for long-term control of refractory meralgia paresthetica [^112u3ZzB]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a term used to describe a clinical pain syndrome related to the compression or irritation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The LFCN is a pure sensory nerve that is susceptible to compression injury. The most common compression locations are: as it courses from the lumbosacral plexus, through the abdominal cavity, under the inguinal ligament, and into the subcutaneous tissue of the thigh.

Methods

This case series is a retrospective single-center review of six patients with medically intractable meralgia paresthetica who were treated with radiofrequency ablation. To be considered for radiofrequency ablation, the patient must have been unsuccessful with medical management alone for more than two months and have a clinical diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. Temporary relief of pain of 50% or greater was considered a positive result. Average pain scores were measured pre- and postprocedure, along with one-, two-, three-, and six-month intervals postoperation.

Results

All patients demonstrated immediate relief in self-reported pain scores, averaging a 75.5% reduction in pain. At the one-, two-, three-, and six-month follow-ups, patients averaged a reduction of 60.0%, 58.0%, 51.4%, and 40.5%, respectively. Both the postop and one-month follow-up pain scores were lower, statistically significantly so (P < 0.05), whereas the two-, three-, and six-month follow-ups were not statistically different from pretreatment scores.

Conclusions

Although our study was small, radiofrequency ablation showed a clear reduction in average pain scores in a subset of patients who had failed standard medical therapy with a reduction in pain at one-month follow-up with relief of symptoms sometimes lasting longer than 12months.

### Approach to the patient with chronic groin pain [^1117gxkW]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic postoperative inguinal pain has become a primary outcome parameter after elective inguinal hernia repair with significant consequences affecting patient productivity, employment, and quality of life. A systematic and thorough preoperative evaluation is important to identify the etiologies and types of pain. Owing to the complex nature of chronic pain, a multimodal and multidisciplinary treatment approach is recommended. Patients with chronic pain refractory to conservative measures may be considered for surgical intervention. Triple neurectomy remains the most definitive and accepted remedial operation performed and provides effective relief in the majority of patients.

A 70-year-old man was admitted with stinging pain in his right groin radiating towards his inner thigh. In a few days, the pain increased in intensity, he experienced diminished strength in his right leg and got dependent on morphine. Conventional investigations did not show any pathology. A CT-scan revealed a mass in the obturator foramen, indicative of a possible obturator hernia or neuroma of the obturator nerve. However, an additional MRI showed a well-circumscribed cystic mass in the obturator foramen, indicative of a ganglion cyst. This cyst was percutaneously punctured under the CT-guidance and the viscous material was aspirated, after which corticosteroids were injected. After the puncture all symptoms of the patient had completely resolved and the patient was discharged from the hospital without any painkillers.

### Iatrogenic superficial femoral arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysm [^114ncaC3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a painful, ecchymotic, and edematous right lower extremity. He had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation for sustained atrial fibrillation 7 days earlier. A 3-cm pulsatile mass with an associated bruit was noted on physical examination. Duplex ultrasound examination revealed a pseudoaneurysm located in the proximal part of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (A and B). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography also confirmed a 25 mm × 32 mm pseudoaneurysm located in the anterior wall of the SFA and a fistulous communication between the SFA and the vein (C /Cover). Endovascular treatment was performed via the right common femoral artery access. An 8 mm × 50 mm Viabahn stent graft (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff) was placed in the proximal part of the SFA to exclude the pseudoaneurysm and the AVF with no adverse effect on the profunda femoral artery. The patient had an uneventful recovery and he discharged 7 days after the procedure. A follow-up computed tomography angiograph at 3 months showed complete patency of the SFA and the profunda femoral artery, successful thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm, and nonvisualization of the AVF (D).

With the increasing prevalence of interventional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, iatrogenic vascular complications have become a clinically significant concern. Optimally, the puncture site should be 1 to 2 cm below the inguinal ligament and above the femoral bifurcation. A distal access site is more likely to injure either or both the femoral artery and vein, causing AVF or pseudoaneurysm formation. Although most cases are asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, failure to promptly diagnose and manage them may lead to severe consequences such as rupture, massive hemorrhage, distal embolism, or heart failure. Timely diagnosis and proper management of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms and AVFs have become extremely important. Preventative measures such as ultrasound guidance and vascular closure devices should be used during peripheral vascular access to avoid development of pseudoaneurysm and AVF formation. Minimally invasive endovascular treatment using the stent graft is a rapid, safe, and reliable method, avoiding risks and dangers of an open surgery procedure. The patient provided consent for the publication of this case.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^116UGkE1]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of endovascular procedures performed via either arterial or venous access by cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists has been steadily increasing over the past decades. Percutaneous transarterial access represents the initial step in a variety of cardiac, peripheral vascular, aortic and oncologic procedures. The radial approach is associated with lower morbidity and is therefore recommended by the European Society of Cardiology. However, the traditional common femoral artery (CFA) access remains the preferred technique by many operators due to its easiness and familiarity, particularly when the radial access is unfeasible or large-bore access is needed. Unfortunately, piercing into the arterial system carries the potential risk of vascular access site complications (VASC) that result in prolonged hospitalisation, higher costs, increased morbidity and, occasionally, mortality.

Alternatively, VASC at the groin may occur following endovascular procedures performed via venous access such as electrophysiology, intravenous laser ablation, or short- or mid-term central venous catheter (CVC) placement. Unfortunately, compared to subclavian veins the femoral venous access suffers from a higher rate of thrombosis and bacterial colonisation. Furthermore, vascular and soft-tissue inguinal infections may develop following unrecognised VASC, particularly with use of vascular closure devices (VCD) and secondarily to non-sterile injections performed for recreational drug use.

Potentially severe vascular and soft-tissue injuries require rapid diagnosis and proper treatment to limit the associated morbidity and avoid further complications. Traditionally, colour Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) was used to investigate suspected VASC, and CT was reserved for those patients with inconclusive sonographic findings. However, in our experience cardiologists and interventional radiologists increasingly rely on pelvic and femoral CT angiography to rapidly and consistently provide a panoramic, comprehensive visualisation of both vascular and infectious complications, which proves crucial for a correct choice between conservative, endovascular and surgical management. This paper aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with iatrogenic and self-inflicted VASC and infections at the groin.

### Percutaneous renal sympathetic nerve ablation for loin pain haematuria syndrome [^113rmZYv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Loin pain haematuria syndrome (LPHS) is a severe renal pain condition of uncertain origin and often resistant to treatment. Nephrectomy and renal autotrasplantation have occasionally been performed in very severe cases. Its pathogenesis is controversial. A 40-year-old hypertensive lady was diagnosed with LPHS after repeated diagnostic imaging procedures had ruled out any renal, abdominal or spinal conditions to justify pain. Notwithstanding treatment with three drugs, she had frequent hypertensive crises during which the loin pain was dramatically exacerbated. Vascular causes of the pain and hypertension were investigated and excluded. Her renal function was normal. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary pain clinic, but had no significant improvement in her pain symptoms despite the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, adjuvant antidepressants and opioid-like agents. The pain and the discomfort were so severe that her quality of life was very poor, and her social and professional activities were compromised. Nephrectomy and renal autotransplantation have occasionally been performed in these cases. Since visceral pain signals flow through afferent sympathetic fibres, we felt that percutaneous catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of the renal sympathetic nerve fibres (recently introduced for the treatment of drug-resistant hypertension) could be valuable for pain relief. We treated the patient with radiofrequency ablation (Medtronic Symplicity Catheter) applied only to the right renal artery. After a 6-month follow-up, the patient is pain free and normotensive with all drugs withdrawn. She has experienced no hypertensive crises in the meantime. This observation suggests that percutaneous sympathetic denervation could prove to be an effective mini-invasive strategy for the treatment of chronic renal pain, and LPHS in particular.

### Right ureteral injury after radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation [^116sM1ki]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is a common procedure to treat atrial fibrillation. We describe a patient without a urologic history who had immediate abdominal pain after this treatment. Computed tomography scan and cystoscopy/retrograde pyelography confirmed a right proximal ureteral injury with urinary extravasation. The patient was treated with right ureteral stent placement and urethral catheter drainage. This case appears to be the first report of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation complicated by spontaneous ureteral injury related to blunt injury during manipulation of the transseptal sheaths or intracardiac catheters.

Atrioesophageal fistula after atrial fibrillation ablation — diagnostic imaging and procedural precautions: Postablation symptoms suggesting evolving atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) include "chest pain, painful swallowing, fever, leukocytosis, TIA, and/or stroke typically occurring between 1 and 3 weeks postablation". If injury is suspected, "CT imaging with intravenous and water-soluble oral contrast is recommended", yet CT findings "are usually observed late" and "early in the course of this complication can be entirely normal". "Esophageal ultrasound can also be useful", a "barium swallow… sensitivity is low", and "endoscopy with air insufflation should be avoided" because it can cause "a large air embolus, producing stroke or death"; using "CO2 instead of air for insufflation… appears to have lower risk".

Consensus statement

14.2. For patients with an asymptomatic superficial truncal vein aneurysm, located > 3 cm distal to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed. Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the risk of VTE.

Consensus statement

14.3. Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed or large (> 3 cm) aneurysms in the superficial veins are best treated with surgical excision.

Rationale

Focal dilation of the saphenous veins (GSV, SSV, AAGSV, or PAGSV) that measures ≥ 20 mm for GSV and 15 mm for SSV, or has a diameter that is three times the upper limit of the average saphenous diameter is considered an aneurysm. Most patients are asymptomatic or have a palpable lump at the groin or in the popliteal fossa. Many patients present only with symptoms of varicosity or CVI. Patients occasionally complain of a tender lump, that can be firm, if the aneurysm is thrombosed. Evaluation with duplex scanning is usually satisfactory, but congenital superficial truncal vein aneurysms may occur in patients with venous malformations (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome)and saphenous aneurysms may occasionally mimic femoral hernia, synovial, or Baker cystor venous leiomyosarcoma. In these patients further evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is warranted. When the saphenous aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing of a dilated proximal saphenous stump. In patients with symptomatic saphenous reflux, endovenous ablation, tumescent anesthesia aided phlebectomy or limited stripping of the distal segment is performed. If the aneurysm is located > 3 cm distal to the SFJ or SPJ, permitting safe proximal occlusion with endovenous techniques, endovenous ablation alone is frequently possible and safe, although most large (> 3 cm) or symptomatic, thrombosed aneurysms are better treated with surgical excision at any location. There is also significant risk of sural nerve injury, when thermal ablation is used to treat proximal SSV aneurysm. Ablation of saphenous aneurysms within 3 cm. of the SFJ and SPJ should not be treated with UGFS due to the increased risk of propagation of larger amount of foam into the deep venous system.

### Image-guided peripheral nerve interventions-applications and techniques [^114xTJNv]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventional radiology continues to be at the forefront of acute and chronic pain management. Our unique imaging expertise and ability to target difficult to reach structures allows for the continuous development of new ways to treat a variety of pain generators. In addition, the advent of thermal ablation techniques and technologies has provided a unique opportunity to offer patients more durable and predictable options to treat their pain. This is particularly important during the opioid epidemic, as multiple local and international governmental bodies push for physicians to create ways to manage pain while reducing the need for long-term opioid dependence. This article aims to review various image-guided techniques and tools for the treatment of pain related to peripheral pain generators, with a focus on the extremities, lumbosacral and pelvic region, and the chest wall. For each target and pathology, we will discuss general etiology, anatomy, procedural approach, and briefly evaluate the supporting literature in each clinical situation.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1156EkTM]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — periprocedural anticoagulation and femoral venous access: The RE‑CIRCUIT trial directly compared uninterrupted dabigatran with uninterrupted warfarin, randomizing 704 patients across 104 sites, and major bleeding during and up to 8 weeks postablation among the 635 ablated patients was significantly lower with dabigatran than with warfarin (5 patients [1.6%] vs 22 patients [6.9%]). For femoral venous access, an inferior approach can penetrate small medial femoral artery branches causing femoral pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula, whereas a superior approach has an increased risk of retroperitoneal bleeding; to prevent these, real‑time ultrasound‑guided venipuncture is useful and can be recommended because it reduces both major and minor vascular complications, and two‑thirds of the writing group routinely use ultrasound imaging to guide vascular access.

9 Complications of AF Ablation

The acceptability of an interventional or surgical procedure depends on the balance between efficacy and safety and catheter ablation of AF is no exception to this rule.

The overall complication rate of catheter ablation of AF is estimated to be around between 5.1% and 7.5% with the commonest complications being those related to vascular access, followed by manifestations of volume overload, the occurrence of pericardial effusion and tamponade, and cerebrovascular accidents or TIAs.

Other less frequent complications include lesions of the vagus or phrenic nerve and pulmonary vein stenosis, inflammation or infection.

Esophageal fistulas, including atrio‐esophageal fistulas are by far the most lethal complication but fortunately the rarest as well in current practice.

Recent retrospective data on large collective indicate that complications with PF ablation may be less frequent than with former energy ablation techniques. This observation contrasts with the data obtained in the first randomized study prospectively reporting comparative safety outcomes in patients assigned to PF ablation versus RF or cryo‐ablation and awaits confirmative evidence from more objective data as those generated for RF and cryo‐ablation as well as from further studies comparing PF ablation with these former techniques.

Incidences for each complication in the following list refer to NIS data sets and literature searches from RCTs on AF ablation.

The following description provides information that may be helpful to prevent, recognize and efficiently treat peri‐procedural complications of AF ablation.

9.1 Complications of Vascular Access

The multiple and/or large bore venous access(es) necessary for this ablation procedure combined with anatomic variability of the femoral arterial tree and venous trunks and strong anticoagulation all favor the occurrence of complications such as local hematomas, arterio‐venous fistulas, and even retroperitoneal bleeding/hematoma.

Incidence: 0.7%–1.3%

Mitigation

Ultrasound guided venipuncture, micro puncture technique. Uninterrupted OACs may be associated with lower risk of bleeding at site of vascular access.

Postprocedural care after epicardial ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation — pericardial management: COR I, LOE C-EO — if pericardial bleeding or cardiac tamponade has occurred during epicardial VT ablation, a pericardial drain should be left in place until bleeding has resolved. COR IIa, LOE B-NR — the instillation of intrapericardial corticosteroids can be effective in reducing pericarditic chest pain after epicardial VT mapping or ablation. COR IIa, LOE B-NR — to reduce pericardial pain after epicardial VT ablation, unless pericardial bleeding or cardiac tamponade has occurred, it is reasonable to remove all pericardial access sheaths at the end of the procedure. COR IIb, LOE C-EO — leaving a pericardial drain in place might be reasonable in patients at high risk for late bleeding or cardiac tamponade after epicardial VT ablation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — acute coronary artery occlusion: Damage to the coronary arteries usually does not occur during left atrial catheter ablation, but acute coronary artery occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery has been reported in a single case report following RF energy delivery to create a "mitral isthmus" linear lesion. Diagnosis is made from the 12-lead ECG with changes according to circumflex distribution and dominance, and depending on the level of sedation, the patient may complain of chest pain. When treatment is suspected, standard percutaneous therapy for acute coronary occlusion should be initiated.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^112omKLQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The key and most feared complication of a PA is rupture in either retroperitoneum or upper thigh, which depends on its size and is heralded by non-contained CM extravasation (Fig. 6). Other complications include pain from compression neuropathy, distal venous thrombosis, and limb ischaemia.

Fig. 6
Two cases of right CFA PA complicated by bleeding. A-B) in a 29-year-old man on haemodialysis, suffering from pelvic pain four days after CA, precontrast (A) CT showed ample, high-attenuation retroperitoneal haematoma (*) compressing the urinary bladder (o). CT angiography MIP (B) showed PA (arrow) with thin feeding tract (thin arrow) and CM extravasation (arrowhead), which required immediate surgical treatment. C-D) In a 75-year-old man with myocardial ischaemia, 48 h after complex PCI CT detected a vast adductor muscle haematoma (*) caused by a small CFA PA (arrow volume-rendering image D) with CM extravasation (arrowheads), which required surgical repair

Rare vascular complications

Other VASC following CFA access include AVF, arterial occlusion and dissection (Table 1). Their manifestations may be similar to those of a groin PA. Alternatively, these injuries may cause limited complaints and be incidentally discovered later.

Resulting from puncture-induced connection between the accessed CFA and the adjacent femoral vein, AVF manifests at CT angiography by synchronous luminal opacification (Fig. 7). Occlusion of the CFA is optimally demonstrated in its longitudinal extent as segmental non-opacification of the arterial lumen (Fig. 8). The rare dissection is heralded by the identification of an intimal flap separating the true from the false lumen in the CFA or iliac artery.

### Comparison of catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113whPe5]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare both the beneficial and adverse effects of catheter ablation (CA) and surgical ablation (SA) on patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and 4 additional databases for randomized controlled trials that compared CA with SA. Following data extraction, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy and safety of CA relative to SA. The primary end point of this study was the absence of AF during a 12-month follow-up period without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs.

Results

Seven trials comparing SA with CA met the inclusion criteria for efficacy outcome assessments. Following the meta-analysis, we obtained a summary odds ratio (OR) of achieving success 1 year after CA relative to SA was 0.37:1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–0.69). The result was robust in the subgroup analysis. CA was associated with a greater incidence of femoral vascular complications (OR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.03–32.71), but a lower incidence of pneumothorax (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.74) than SA. Statistically significant differences in the other safety outcomes were not observed between CA and SA.

Conclusions

SA confers a moderate advantage over CA in 1-year efficacy outcomes and may be safely performed by experienced surgeons.

6.8. Esophageal Monitoring — esophageal injury risk and mitigation during AF ablation notes that a rare but potentially devastating complication of AF ablation is injury to the esophagus with the possible outcome of atrial esophageal fistula or esophageal perforation leading to mediastinal infection, stroke, and/or death, and another complication thought to be related to thermal injury to the peri‑esophageal vagal plexus is gastroparesis; current approaches include reducing energy delivery, reducing catheter tip contact using "abstinence", esophageal thermal monitoring, and active protection of the esophagus; with open irrigated radiofrequency energy in the posterior left atrium (LA) it is common to decrease power delivery to less than 25 W, and another strategy is to move the ablation catheter every 10 to 20 seconds on the posterior wall; some operators employ light conscious sedation and use pain as an assay for potential esophageal injury, but there are conflicting data on its specificity; while there have not been reports of atrial esophageal fistula or peri‑esophageal vagal plexus injury with cryoballoon, one study reported esophageal ulceration in a subset of patients, and other heat‑based sources such as ultrasound energy can damage the esophagus.
