## Question

management of bronchiolitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of bronchiolitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and severity assessment. Then, I should verify the core principle of supportive care and oxygenation targets. Next, I will examine pharmacologic therapies that should be avoided or used selectively. After that, I need to check respiratory support escalation, including high-flow nasal cannula and CPAP. I will then review hydration strategies and discharge criteria. I should also consider special populations and evolving evidence on phenotypes and targeted therapies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and address implementation and quality gaps, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis and severity framework. Bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis in infants with a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by wheeze, crackles, tachypnea, and signs of respiratory distress; routine viral testing, chest radiography, and laboratory studies are not recommended in typical cases because they rarely change management and can drive unnecessary interventions [^113Bczkd] [^113SrS5m]. I should double-check severity markers that guide disposition: work of breathing, feeding tolerance, and oxygenation; pulse oximetry is useful, but I need to ensure I interpret a single value cautiously and in context, as SpO2 thresholds vary across guidelines and should not be the sole determinant of severity or admission [^113DjCmy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oxygen targets. I initially thought to use a strict SpO2 ≥ 94% target, but wait, the BIDS randomized equivalence trial showed that managing to a permissive target of SpO2 ≥ 90% was as safe and clinically effective as ≥ 94%, with no difference in time to cough resolution and similar serious adverse events, supporting a lower threshold to reduce oxygen exposure and length of stay in stable infants [^111yX2m8] [^115VTbAG]. I should confirm guideline alignment: AAP and AARC endorse SpO2 ≥ 90% for bronchiolitis, while acknowledging variability across international guidelines, so I will individualize within that evidence-based range and avoid overreliance on a single oximetry reading [^112G59Ak] [^113RGAFq] [^116MSHji].

> Next, I should review the core principle of supportive care. The cornerstone is maintaining adequate oxygenation and hydration while minimizing handling and avoiding unnecessary tests and treatments; this "do less" approach reduces low-value care without compromising safety when implemented with clinical judgment and appropriate monitoring [^113Bczkd] [^113SrS5m]. Let me verify that this principle is reflected across major guidelines: AAP, NICE, and CPS converge on supportive care as standard, reinforcing that most infants recover without pharmacologic therapy [^112G59Ak] [^116MSHji] [^115bKkiD].

> I will now examine bronchodilators, and I need to ensure I am precise. Routine use of salbutamol or epinephrine is not recommended for bronchiolitis; evidence shows no consistent reduction in hospitalization, length of stay, or time to resolution, though short-term clinical scores may transiently improve in some settings, particularly outpatient trials of epinephrine [^114iSqg9] [^115mVjoz]. But wait, what if there is a documented response? If a monitored trial shows clear improvement in work of breathing or feeding, a short course may be reasonable; otherwise, I should stop and avoid repeated dosing without benefit [^112G59Ak].

> Let me consider corticosteroids carefully. I should confirm that routine systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for bronchiolitis due to lack of benefit in typical infants, and this is consistently advised by AAP, CPS, and AAFP; however, I need to check for exceptions where combined epinephrine and dexamethasone showed signal for benefit in outpatients, which remains controversial and not standard inpatient practice pending replication and consensus [^114Yz932] [^115jFUvH] [^116wu5WA]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not extrapolating to inpatients; current inpatient evidence does not support steroids, so I will avoid them outside of research or carefully selected scenarios with shared decision-making [^114iSqg9].

> Hypertonic saline deserves a cautious look. I should double-check that routine use is not recommended in most guidelines due to inconsistent effects on length of stay and admission rates, though some studies and settings suggest possible benefit; if considered, it should be framed as optional and not a standard, particularly given potential harms with repeated dosing and lack of robust inpatient benefit [^113Bczkd] [^116MSHji]. Wait, let me verify that any trial should be time-limited and coupled with objective reassessment to avoid therapeutic inertia [^notfound].

> Antibiotics are another area where I need to ensure stewardship. Routine antibiotics are not indicated for viral bronchiolitis; they should be reserved for clear bacterial coinfection or when bacterial pneumonia is suspected, given the risks of adverse effects and resistance without proven benefit in uncomplicated cases [^112G59Ak] [^111vY68r]. I should confirm that local antibiograms guide any necessary bacterial therapy and that viral testing does not change antibiotic decisions in typical bronchiolitis [^113SrS5m].

> Now, I should review respiratory support escalation. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen for moderate to severe bronchiolitis, with typical flows of 1–2 L/kg/min and appropriate nasal cannula sizing. However, I need to ensure continuous monitoring, trained staff, and clear escalation protocols because HFNC does not consistently reduce ICU admission or intubation rates in randomized trials [^115DnhDo] [^111uYYsp] [^113Bczkd]. Let me reconsider CPAP: evidence is limited and low certainty, though observational and some RCT data suggest improved respiratory parameters; CPAP remains a reasonable bridge or alternative when HFNC is unavailable or failing, ideally in a higher-acuity setting with close monitoring [^116QNpUm] [^113Bczkd].

> I need to check hydration strategies next. For infants unable to maintain oral intake due to respiratory distress, isotonic fluids (IV or NG) are appropriate; both routes are acceptable, and the choice should reflect local expertise, vascular access, and infant comfort, with attention to electrolyte monitoring when using IV therapy [^115bKkiD] [^117EWjrf]. Hold on, I should verify that overhydration is a concern; yes, in severe disease, judicious fluid management is prudent to avoid pulmonary edema, so I will reassess frequently and adjust as the clinical picture evolves [^112S6YEd].

> Next, I should review discharge readiness and follow-up. Safe discharge generally requires sustained SpO2 ≥ 90–92% in room air for several hours, adequate feeding without significant work of breathing, reliable caregiver follow-up within 24–48 hours, and clear return precautions; I should confirm that local pathways align with these principles and that documentation of severity and feeding status is complete to reduce readmissions [^1177X7Rr]. Let me verify that caregiver education on red flags and hydration is emphasized, as this reduces return visits and improves safety at home [^notfound].

> I will now examine special populations and the evidence gap. High-risk infants (prematurity, chronic lung disease, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, immunocompromise) are underrepresented in trials, yet they account for a disproportionate share of PICU admissions; management remains largely extrapolated from standard-risk data, and emerging reviews call for RCTs in this group to define best practices for respiratory support and adjuncts in the ICU [^114SYpHF] [^115QJaRo]. But wait, what about evolving phenotypes? Recent reviews propose that bronchiolitis comprises heterogeneous endotypes (e.g. RSV vs rhinovirus, atopic risk), and selected subgroups may benefit from targeted therapies such as early corticosteroids or bronchodilators; this remains investigational and should not alter current guideline-concordant care pending stronger evidence [^116EtQZz] [^1144Kwi6].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm while I double-check alignment with evidence. For mild disease, manage at home with supportive care, nasal suctioning, and close follow-up; for moderate disease, consider observation or admission based on feeding and work of breathing, use low-flow oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%, and trial bronchodilator only if there is a documented response; for severe disease or impending respiratory failure, escalate to HFNC or CPAP with continuous monitoring, and involve PICU early for invasive ventilation if noninvasive support fails or the infant deteriorates [^112G59Ak] [^115DnhDo] [^113Bczkd]. I should confirm that all steps are documented, reassessed frequently, and de-escalated promptly as the infant improves to avoid unnecessary interventions [^112G59Ak].

> Finally, I need to address implementation and quality gaps. Despite strong evidence and guidelines, real-world care often includes unnecessary chest radiographs, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics; targeted de-implementation interventions, clinical pathways, and point-of-care tools can reduce low-value care without worsening outcomes, as shown in cluster RCTs and quality improvement studies [^111PgELD] [^116XrbYu] [^1114SGxM]. Hold on, I should verify that local leadership, audit-and-feedback, and education are key levers; yes, multifaceted, theory-informed strategies outperform passive dissemination and are more likely to sustain change [^114qwKof].

> In summary, I need to ensure that care remains diagnosis-based and supportive, with oxygenation targets individualized within an evidence-based 90–94% range, avoidance of routine pharmacotherapies, judicious use of HFNC or CPAP for moderate to severe disease, careful hydration management, and clear discharge criteria, while actively closing the evidence-practice gap through pathway implementation and quality improvement [^113Bczkd] [^111yX2m8] [^115DnhDo] [^112G59Ak].

---

Bronchiolitis management is **supportive care only** [^113Bczkd], with oxygen for SpO2 < 90% [^111yX2m8], hydration maintenance, and minimal handling [^115bKkiD]. Routine use of **bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, or hypertonic saline is not recommended** [^114iSqg9] [^114Yz932] [^115jFUvH] [^117KPPs3]. High-flow nasal cannula is appropriate for moderate–severe distress or escalating support needs [^115DnhDo] [^111uYYsp]. Hospitalize for apnea, severe respiratory distress, SpO2 < 90% despite oxygen, or inability to maintain hydration [^notfound]. Discharge when stable on room air, feeding reliably, and with reliable follow-up [^1177X7Rr].

---

## Clinical assessment and severity classification

Accurate clinical assessment is essential to guide management and disposition. Severity is typically classified as **mild, moderate, or severe** based on clinical signs, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and work of breathing [^notfound].

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Minimal respiratory distress <br/> - Normal oxygen saturation <br/> - Feeding normally [^1177X7Rr] |
| Moderate | - Moderate respiratory distress <br/> - Oxygen saturation 90–94% <br/> - Difficulty feeding [^111yX2m8] |
| Severe | - Severe respiratory distress <br/> - Oxygen saturation < 90% <br/> - Apnea <br/> - Signs of respiratory failure [^112G59Ak] |

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care remains the cornerstone of bronchiolitis management, including:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^111yX2m8]. Permissive hypoxemia (SpO2 90–92%) may be acceptable in stable infants without significant distress [^112ndHtr].

- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate hydration. Use intravenous or nasogastric fluids if oral intake is inadequate [^117KPPs3].

- **Minimal handling**: Reduce stimulation and handling to decrease respiratory distress [^115bKkiD].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Routine pharmacological interventions are generally **not recommended** based on current evidence:

- **Bronchodilators**: Routine use of bronchodilators (e.g. albuterol) is not recommended due to lack of consistent benefit [^114iSqg9] [^111swgJt].

- **Corticosteroids**: Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use [^114Yz932] [^115jFUvH].

- **Hypertonic saline**: Routine use of hypertonic saline is not recommended due to insufficient evidence of benefit [^113Bczkd].

- **Antibiotics**: Not indicated unless there is evidence of bacterial co-infection [^112G59Ak].

---

## Respiratory support

Non-invasive respiratory support may be required for infants with moderate-to-severe respiratory distress or **impending respiratory failure**. High-flow nasal cannula (**HFNC**) oxygen therapy is increasingly used and considered safe and effective for infants with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis [^115DnhDo] [^111uYYsp]. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be considered for infants with severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure, though **evidence is limited** [^116QNpUm].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for infants with any of the following:

- **Severe respiratory distress**: Including apnea, cyanosis, or signs of respiratory failure.

- **Persistent hypoxemia**: SpO2 < 90% despite supplemental oxygen [^notfound].

- **Inability to maintain hydration**: Requiring intravenous or nasogastric fluids [^117KPPs3].

- **Significant comorbidities**: Such as prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or immunodeficiency [^notfound].

---

## Discharge criteria

Infants may be discharged once they meet the following criteria:

- **Stable respiratory status**: No significant respiratory distress or oxygen requirement [^1177X7Rr].

- **Adequate hydration**: Able to maintain oral intake [^1177X7Rr].

- **Reliable follow-up**: Ensured outpatient follow-up within 24–48 hours [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on reducing **RSV transmission** and prophylaxis for high-risk infants. Hand hygiene is the most effective measure to reduce nosocomial RSV transmission [^112G59Ak]. Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for **high-risk infants**, including those with prematurity, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease [^112G59Ak]. Emerging therapies such as maternal RSV vaccination and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. nirsevimab) are promising strategies under evaluation [^112tcTQi].

---

## Follow-up care

Follow-up care ensures continued recovery and **early detection of complications**. Arrange outpatient follow-up within **24–48 hours** after discharge to assess recovery and address any ongoing symptoms [^notfound]. Provide parent education on recognizing signs of **respiratory distress**, dehydration, and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].

---

Bronchiolitis management centers on **supportive care**, with oxygen, hydration, and minimal handling as the mainstays. Routine pharmacologic therapies are not recommended, and hospitalization is reserved for severe cases or those with significant comorbidities.

### Implementing evidence-based practices in the care of infants with bronchiolitis in australasian acute care settings: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled study [^114qwKof]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) network is well placed to undertake this study having completed a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of intravenous versus nasogastric fluid replacement in children admitted with bronchiolitis. As part of this trial, data were collected on > 3800 admissions for bronchiolitis, over three years from seven Australasian sites. These data show that five therapies and management processes, for which there is high-level evidence that they are ineffective, were used at least once in 27 to 48% of bronchiolitis admissions. Ineffective interventions included inhaled salbutamol, inhaled adrenaline, oral glucocorticoids, antibiotics and chest x-ray.

Having identified both inappropriate care and variation in care, an Australasian Bronchiolitis Guideline for the management of bronchiolitis was developed, providing evidence and recommendations for emergency department (ED) and paediatric inpatient care, with widespread stakeholder endorsement. Guidelines can be formally defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioners and patient decisions about appropriate care for specific clinical circumstances". It is recognised that to effectively manage conditions there needs to be agreement from all specialty groups within individual hospitals involved in care for the condition of interest. Thus, the Australasian Bronchiolitis Guideline was developed using a consensus process across both countries utilising craft groups and specialists from both the ED and paediatric inpatient units involved in management of infants with bronchiolitis. Recommendations from this guideline will be implemented using tailored, theory informed KT interventions in this study as it is now accepted that simply providing such a guideline to clinicians is insufficient to significantly change practice.

Using a theoretical approach to develop KT interventions is increasing considered to be best practice. Tailored interventions (interventions planned following investigation into the factors that influence practice and reasons for resisting practice change) are more likely to improve practice than no intervention. Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care systematic reviews have shown that: Interventions consistently showing effectiveness include audit and feedback, interactive educational meetings, educational outreach visits, reminders (either manual or computerised) and multifaceted interventions (defined as a minimum of two combined interventions); Interventions that have shown some improvement include the use of local champions and local consensus processes and patient-mediated interventions; Interventions that consistently show little or no effect are didactic educational meetings and educational materials such as those distributed for recommendations of clinical care, including practice guidelines, electronic publications and audio-visual materials. However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of interventions in PEM settings.

### National survey of feasibility of NIV trials for management of children with bronchiolitis [^116qcrYw]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a major cause of admission to hospital in children. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen is routinely used for infants in the UK with bronchiolitis.

Objective

To establish UK paediatric practice regarding management of bronchiolitis, and to explore issues pertinent to the design of a potential future randomised controlled trial of NIV.

Design

Screening logs were completed in hospitals in England capturing information on paediatric bronchiolitis admissions. An online national survey of clinical practice was disseminated to healthcare professionals (HCPs) across the UK to ascertain current management strategies.

Results

Screening logs captured data on 393 infants from 8 hospitals. Reasons for admission were most commonly respiratory distress and/or poor fluid intake. Oxygen was administered for 54% of admissions. Respiratory (CPAP and HFNC) and non-respiratory support administered varied considerably. The national survey was completed by 111 HCPs from 76 hospitals. Data were obtained on criteria used to commence and wean NIV, responsibilities for altering NIV settings, minimum training requirements for staff managing a child on NIV, and numbers of trained staff. Most centres were interested in and capable of running a trial of NIV, even out of normal office hours.

Conclusions

Respiratory and non-respiratory management of bronchiolitis in UK centres varies widely. A trial of HFNC oxygen therapy in this group of patients is feasible and HCPs would be willing to randomise patients into such a trial. Future work should focus on defining trial eligibility criteria.

### Provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding bronchiolitis and pneumonia guidelines [^1173oY3h]. Hospital Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Practice guidelines have been published for bronchiolitis and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but little is known about pediatricians' knowledge of and attitudes toward these guidelines since their publication.

Methods

We surveyed pediatric providers at 6 children's hospitals in the New York City area. Two vignettes, an infant with bronchiolitis and a child with CAP, were provided, and respondents were asked about management. Associations between respondent characteristics and their reported practices were examined using χ² and Fisher's exact tests. Associations between questions probing knowledge and attitude barriers relevant to guideline adherence and reported practices were examined using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel relative risk estimates.

Results

Of 283 respondents, 58% were trainees; 57% of attending physician respondents had finished training within 10 years. Overall, 76% and 45% of respondents reported they had read the bronchiolitis and CAP guidelines, respectively. For the bronchiolitis vignette, 40% reported ordering a chest radiograph (CXR), and 38% prescribed bronchodilators (neither recommended). For the CAP vignette, 38% prescribed ceftriaxone (not recommended). Study site, level of training, and practice locations were associated with nonrecommended practices. Site-adjusted knowledge and attitude barriers were used to identify that those who agreed CXRs were useful in managing bronchiolitis were more likely to order CXRs, and those who felt bronchodilators shortened length of stay were more likely to prescribe them. Concerns about ampicillin resistance and lack of confidence using local susceptibility patterns to guide prescribing were associated with ordering ceftriaxone.

Conclusions

Provider-level factors and knowledge gaps were associated with ordering nonrecommended treatments for bronchiolitis and CAP.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^112npwhs]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — oxygen for pediatric patients: For hospitalized pediatric patients, the committee does not recommend using an oxygen hood or tent in lieu of a low-flow oxygen device for consistent oxygen delivery (Evidence level C, median appropriateness score 8). For infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis in pediatric ward and ICU settings, the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) appears to be safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen (Evidence level B, median appropriateness score 7.5). For humidification with low-flow oxygen delivery, low level of evidence does not support the use of heated or non-heated humidification (Evidence level B, median appropriateness score 8.25). For oxygenation targets, in bronchiolitis evidence supports an oxygenation target of 90% or greater (Evidence level C, median appropriateness score 7), whereas for respiratory diseases outside of bronchiolitis establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is best practice, but a specific target cannot be recommended (Evidence level C, median appropriateness score 7).

### Management of bronchiolitis in the emergency department: impact of evidence-based guidelines? [^1114SGxM]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend limiting use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and diagnostic testing for patients with bronchiolitis. We sought to determine the association of the evidence-based guidelines with bronchiolitis care in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative sample of ED visits. We compared utilization for patient visits before and after the publication of the guidelines. We used logistic regression to determine the association of the availability of the guidelines with resource utilization.

Results

Bronchodilators were used in 53.8% of patient visits with no differences noted after the introduction of the guidelines (53.6% vs 54.2%, P = 0.91). Systemic steroids were used in 20.4% of patient visits, and antibiotics were given in 33.2% of visits. There were no changes in the frequency of corticosteroid (21.9% vs 17.8%, P = 0.31) or antibiotic (33.6% vs 29.7%, P = 0.51) use. There was an associated decrease in use of chest x-rays (65.3% vs 48.6%, P = 0.005). This association remained significant after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.26–0.67).

Conclusions

For patients seen in the ED with bronchiolitis, utilization of diagnostic imaging has decreased with the availability of the American Academy of Pediatrics practice guidelines. However, there has not been an associated decrease in use of nonrecommended therapies. Targeted efforts will likely be required to change practice significantly.

### Effectiveness of targeted interventions on treatment of infants with bronchiolitis: a randomized clinical trial [^116XrbYu]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Previous studies to improve bronchiolitis care have used a quality improvement design using before-and-after evaluation of multifaceted interventions, with interventions developed by expert clinicians. These studies may have shown decreased use of inappropriate investigations and pharmacotherapies, but reliability is weakened by their nonexperimental design, which can be subject to major confounders. Although interventions developed by expert clinicians may by chance address factors influencing bronchiolitis management, they are not developed specifically to address identified factors influencing the staff delivering care, as in our study.

Improving evidence-based bronchiolitis management and reducing exposure to low-value and potentially harmful therapies (important patient-centered outcomes for the infant and their family) was achieved without the unintended consequences of increased length of stay or ICU admissions. As length of stay is unchanged, cost savings will be limited to the cost (time and money) of the individual guideline recommendations that were deimplemented.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1143FvUM]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-bronchiolitis chronic cough — For children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks) after acute viral bronchiolitis, we suggest that the cough be managed according to the CHEST pediatric chronic cough guidelines, asthma medications not be used for the cough unless other evidence of asthma is present, and inhaled osmotic agents not be used (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### The syndrome we agreed to call bronchiolitis [^1144Kwi6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We are ignoring evidence suggesting that the diagnosis of bronchiolitis encompasses several diseases with distinct underlying mechanisms, considerable heterogeneity in treatment responses, and ultimately different therapeutic targets. Understanding this heterogeneity may be the only way to deliver appropriate, stratified treatments.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^115cE9Fz]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

On review of current NICE guidelines for the management of acute bronchiolitis, we identified a paucity of evidence regarding the management of high-risk infants in the PICU, with the majority of RCTs excluding those with high-risk conditions, comorbidity and escalation of care. Our systematic review highlighted a similar lack of evidence-based management for high-risk infants with acute bronchiolitis in the PICU. Studies excluded patients on the basis of underlying medical disorders, prematurity, or did not account for potential adverse effects of interventions which may pose higher risk for vulnerable cohorts. In turn, those studies which did not exclude high-risk patients were conducted with smaller sample sizes. Although oxygen support is a mainstay of treatment in severe bronchiolitis, only one study identified did not exclude patients with underlying respiratory and cardiac conditions. We recommend further evidence-based trials into the use of prophylactic dexamethasone, heliox therapy, and early use of diuretic therapy, as these showed favourable outcomes. This review highlights the need for larger-scale, evidence-based trials on the above interventions, with recommended focus on prospective RCTs. Following on from this, future efforts can be tailored towards creating guidelines for the management of high-risk infants with acute bronchiolitis in the PICU setting.

### Assessing the quality of health care in the management of bronchiolitis in Australian children: a population-based sample survey [^115DXDP2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is a respiratory infection in children aged less than 12 or 24 months, depending on the definition, that causes respiratory distress often associated with cough, wheeze or crackles and hypoxia. Almost one-third of all children will develop bronchiolitis by their first birthday and 90% children will develop the disease by the second year of their lives. It is the most common cause of hospitalisation in children in this age group. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) suggest only supportive management without the need for bronchodilators, epinephrine, anticholinergic drugsor corticosteroids. There is no proven benefit for antivirals or antibiotics. The availability of guidelines does not guarantee that they are used appropriately, and previous studies have demonstrated marked variation in the clinical management of bronchiolitis. However, there is a dearth of information relating to the quality of clinical care in management of bronchiolitis in Australian children. Evaluation of the quality of clinical care and the extent to which it is adherent to guidelines can identify areas for improvement and help design interventions to improve quality of care.

CareTrack Kids (CTK) assessed the care delivered to Australian children aged 0–15 years, in 2012 and 2013, to estimate the proportion that received care in line with CPGs for 17 common conditions, including bronchiolitis. Across the 17 conditions, indicator-adherent care was provided for an estimated average of 59.8% (95% CI 57.5 to 62.0) of indicators and at 59.3% (95% CI 54.6 to 63.9) for bronchiolitis indicators. This paper presents and discusses the CTK results for bronchiolitis care. While it has been documented that variation in clinical care exists, the primary aim of this study was to document specific aspects of clinical care where variation exists across different healthcare settings including ambulatory and hospital settings, which is important for designing initiatives to improve quality of care.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^117GKrg1]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Systematically review the management of infants with severe bronchiolitis in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting with a focus on high-risk infants to identify gaps in evidence-based knowledge.

Methods

This systematic review utilised Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) to examine the literature on the PICU management of bronchiolitis in infants < 24 months old. Three databases, Embase, PubMed and Medline, were searched and higher levels of evidence I, II and III were included.

Results

There were 455 papers reviewed and 26 met the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, 19 of these studied respiratory interventions such as positive airway pressure and oxygen delivery. The remaining 7 examined: erythropoietin, caffeine, dexamethasone, protein supplementation, ribavirin, respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin, or diuretic therapy. Of the 26 studies, 20 excluded infants with high-risk conditions. Therapies showing favourable outcomes included Heliox, prophylactic dexamethasone pre-extubation, protein supplementation, and diuretic use.

Conclusions

Clinical trials for bronchiolitis management frequently exclude high-risk children. Innovative study design in the future may improve access to clinical trials for the management of bronchiolitis in high-risk infants in a PICU setting.

Impact

Clinical trials for bronchiolitis management frequently exclude high-risk children. We review the evidence base for the management of an under-investigated patient demographic in the setting of acute bronchiolitis. Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy of management strategies for bronchiolitis in high-risk infants in a paediatric intensive care setting.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114iKnji]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children aged 5 years and younger — Step 1 initial treatment: As-needed inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) should be provided to all children who experience wheezing episodes for relief of symptoms, although it is not effective in all children. Use of SABA for the relief of symptoms on average more than twice a week over a 1-month period indicates the need for a trial of low-dose ICS. Initial episodes of wheezing in children < 1 year with infectious bronchiolitis should be managed according to local bronchiolitis guidelines and SABAs are generally ineffective for bronchiolitis. Oral bronchodilator therapy is not recommended due to its slower onset of action and higher rate of side-effects compared with inhaled SABA. For children with intermittent viral-induced wheeze and no interval symptoms, particularly those with underlying atopy (positive for modified API) when inhaled SABA is not sufficient, intermittent high-dose ICS may be considered, but because of the risk of side-effects, this should only be considered if the physician is confident that the treatment will be used appropriately.

### Bronchiolitis: recommendations for diagnosis, monitoring and management of children one to 24 months of age [^115bKkiD]. CPS (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to supportive care, CPS 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate supportive care including hydration, minimal handling, gentle nasal suctioning and oxygen therapy in 1–24 months old patients with bronchiolitis.

### Change in viral bronchiolitis management in hospitals in the UK after the publication of NICE guideline [^117SpT5i]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Viral bronchiolitis is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation in young infants. It has previously been shown that many United Kingdom (UK) hospital Trusts were not compliant with many aspects of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) bronchiolitis guideline prior to its publication.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate changes in the management of bronchiolitis by hospital Trusts between 2015 (before NICE guideline publication) and 2017, after publication.

Study Design

We prospectively surveyed paediatricians at UK hospital Trusts on the management of bronchiolitis before (March to May 2015) and after (January to May 2017) the NICE bronchiolitis guideline publication in June 2015, using an electronic, structured questionnaire.

Results

In 2015 111 Trusts were represented and in 2017 100 Trusts. Significant improvements were seen in the use of nebulised bronchodilators and hypertonic saline and provision of parental written guidance. However, full compliance with the guideline did not change with 18% of Trusts compliant before publication of the guideline in 2015 and 19% fully compliant with the guideline in 2017.

Conclusions

Overall there were modest but important improvements in the reported management of bronchiolitis after the publication of the NICE guideline.

### The heterogeneity of viral bronchiolitis: a lack of universal consensus definitions [^115UVeJk]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is one of the most common hospital presentations in infancy and as such represents a major healthcare burden worldwide. However despite this, there are currently no effective targeted therapies nor can those infants at highest risk for developing severe disease or subsequent respiratory morbidity be predicted on initial hospital presentation. Current definitions of bronchiolitis in the published literature vary significantly in terms of the age range at presentation, specific clinical symptoms, causative virus, and the inclusion or exclusion of infants with previous presentations and/or various comorbidities. In this review, we highlight how this heterogeneity among definitions contributes to a lack of clarity on this condition and its likely multiple endotypes. We argue that without a new universal consensus definition or sets of definitions, progress into bronchiolitis will continue to be stalled.

### Viral bronchiolitis management in hospitals in the UK [^113UTtwn]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalisation in infants less than a year old. The United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline for the management of viral bronchiolitis in June 2015.

Objectives

This study aimed to prospectively survey the management of viral bronchiolitis in hospital Trusts in the UK to provide a baseline of practice prior to the publication of the 2015 NICE bronchiolitis guideline against which future practice can be assessed.

Study Design

An electronic, structured questionnaire was sent to hospital paediatricians in the UK prior to the publication of the NICE bronchiolitis guideline via the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health e-portfolio system to assess the quality of Trust's viral bronchiolitis management guidelines.

Results

Paediatricians from 111 (65% of all) UK Trusts completed an electronic questionnaire. 91% of Trusts had a bronchiolitis guideline. Overall only 18% of Trusts would be fully compliant with the NICE guideline. Between 43–100% of Trusts would be compliant with different sections of the guideline. There was variation in hospital admission criteria with respect to the need for supplemental oxygen (oxygen saturations < 88% to < 95%). 'Unnecessary' medications (especially bronchodilators, nebulised hypertonic saline and antibiotics) and investigations (chest x-ray and blood gas) were regularly advised. 72% of Trusts advised respiratory virus testing in all hospitalised infants and 64% created bronchiolitis bays to cohort infants.

Conclusions

There was wide variation in the management of infants with bronchiolitis in Trusts. Most bronchiolitic infants are not managed optimally in hospitals. Future guidelines should include advice on virus testing and isolation/cohorting.

### Office-based treatment and outcomes for febrile infants with clinically diagnosed bronchiolitis [^116G86Zs]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goals were to describe the (1) frequency of sepsis evaluation and empiric antibiotic treatment, (2) clinical predictors of management, and (3) serious bacterial illness frequency for febrile infants with clinically diagnosed bronchiolitis seen in office settings.

Methods

The Pediatric Research in Office Settings network conducted a prospective cohort study of 3066 febrile infants (< 3 months of age with temperatures ≥ 38 degrees C) in 219 practices in 44 states. We compared the frequency of sepsis evaluation, parenteral antibiotic treatment, and serious bacterial illness in infants with and without clinically diagnosed bronchiolitis. We identified predictors of sepsis evaluation and parenteral antibiotic treatment in infants with bronchiolitis by using logistic regression models.

Results

Practitioners were less likely to perform a complete sepsis evaluation, urine testing, and cerebrospinal fluid culture and to administer parenteral antibiotic treatment for infants with bronchiolitis, compared with those without bronchiolitis. Significant predictors of sepsis evaluation in infants with bronchiolitis included younger age, higher maximal temperature, and respiratory syncytial virus testing. Predictors of parenteral antibiotic use included initial ill appearance, age of < 30 days, higher maximal temperature, and general signs of infant distress. Among infants with bronchiolitis (N = 218), none had serious bacterial illness and those with respiratory distress signs were less likely to receive parenteral antibiotic treatment. Diagnoses among 2848 febrile infants without bronchiolitis included bacterial meningitis (n = 14), bacteremia (n = 49), and urinary tract infection (n = 167).

Conclusions

In office settings, serious bacterial illness in young febrile infants with clinically diagnosed bronchiolitis is uncommon. Limited testing for bacterial infections seems to be an appropriate management strategy.

### Management practices for standard-risk and high-risk patients with bronchiolitis [^116UWeps]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Management guidelines for bronchiolitis advocate for supportive care and exclude those with high-risk conditions. We aim to describe and compare the management of standard-risk and high-risk patients with bronchiolitis.

Methods

This retrospective study examined patients < 2 years of age admitted to the general pediatric ward with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision discharge diagnosis code of bronchiolitis or viral syndrome with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patients were defined as either standard- or high-risk on the basis of previously published criteria. The frequencies of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions were compared.

Results

We included 265 patients in this study (122 standard-risk [46.0%], 143 high-risk [54.0%]). Increased bronchodilator use was observed in the standard-risk group (any albuterol dosing, standard-risk 65.6%, high-risk 44.1%, P = 0.003). Increased steroid use was observed in the standard-risk group (any steroid dosing, standard-risk 19.7%, high-risk 14.7%, P = 0.018). Multiple logistic regression revealed > 3 doses of albuterol, hypertonic saline, and chest physiotherapy use to be associated with rapid response team activation (odds ratio [OR] > 3 doses albuterol: 8.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.99–35.10], P = 0.048; OR > 3 doses hypertonic saline: 13.94 [95% CI: 4.32–44.92], P = 0.001); OR percussion and postural drainage: 5.06 [95% CI: 1.88–13.63], P = 0.017).

Conclusions

A varied approach to the management of bronchiolitis in both standard-risk and high-risk children occurred institutionally. Bronchodilators and steroids continue to be used frequently despite practice recommendations and regardless of risk status. More research is needed on management strategies in patients at high-risk for severe disease.

### Viral bronchiolitis [^113SrS5m]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is a common clinical syndrome affecting infants and young children. Concern about its associated morbidity and cost has led to a large body of research that has been summarised in systematic reviews and integrated into clinical practice guidelines in several countries. The evidence and guideline recommendations consistently support a clinical diagnosis with the limited role for diagnostic testing for children presenting with the typical clinical syndrome of viral upper respiratory infection progressing to the lower respiratory tract. Management is largely supportive, focusing on maintaining oxygenation and hydration of the patient. Evidence suggests no benefit from bronchodilator or corticosteroid use in infants with a first episode of bronchiolitis. Evidence for other treatments such as hypertonic saline is evolving but not clearly defined yet. For infants with severe disease, the insufficient available data suggest a role for high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure use in a monitored setting to prevent respiratory failure.

### Severe bronchiolitis in children [^117VdFkK]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a common, acute, contagious lower respiratory tract illness of infants and young children. The majority of cases are secondary to respiratory syncytial virus. There are a number of risk factors for severe disease, including children less than six weeks of age and patients with atopy and/or asthma. The management requires vigilant monitoring and high-quality supportive care, including impressive use of fluids and nutritional support. Further research on anti-virals is essential to prevent respiratory syncytial virus induced bronchiolitis. Fortunately, the prognosis for the majority of normal infants who develop bronchiolitis is good.

### Assessing the quality of health care in the management of bronchiolitis in Australian children: a population-based sample survey [^111vY68r]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

The inappropriate use of different medications such as nebulised epinephrine, bronchodilators and corticosteroid in managing the acute phase of bronchiolitis was assessed to be ~22% (BRON32); lower than rates documented in studies conducted in Spain (64%) and Turkey (> 50%).CPGs recommend only symptomatic management of bronchiolitis without the need for any medication. The rate of use of antibiotics for viral bronchiolitis (BRON25) was ~14%; this was comparable with studies from other developed countries. This is a particularly important finding given that, in high-income countries, where antibiotics are not available without a prescription, antibiotics for respiratory tract infections are commonly prescribed in primary care settings. Despite the wealth of evidence suggesting no benefit of use of antibiotic in viral bronchiolitis, inappropriate use of antibiotics remains a problem as it leads to wastage of resourcesand is also associated with emergence of antimicrobial resistance, a well-known global public health problem. The use of antibiotics in children with acute bronchiolitis have not demonstrated improved clinical outcomes; on the contrary, they have been associated with adverse events. Studies suggest that making evidence-based guidelines more accessible at the point of care can reduce use of antibiotics in children with bronchiolitis. However, implementation of guidelines in primary practice requires complex interventions.

One of the main limitations of the study is that it was based on review of medical records and it is possible that there were discrepancies between documented care and the actual care provided. However, this method of assessing appropriateness of care has been used previously for adults in Australia and the USA, and it has been estimated that such methodology to assess quality of care may lead to a 10% point underestimate of adherence. The low recruitment rates for GPs in the broader CTK study, around 24%, creates the possibility of bias due to self-selection; for example, participating providers could be more likely to provide guideline-adherent care. However, we had a large sampling frame covering 60% of the Australian paediatric population which provided an overall assessment of guideline adherence. We did not investigate providers' familiarity with, or knowledge of, existing guidelines and we did not assess which guidelines, if any, were used in different healthcare settings.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^113RGAFq]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — hospitalized pediatric oxygen therapy recommendations developed via a modification of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method include four directives. The use of an oxygen hood or tent in lieu of a low-flow oxygen device for consistent oxygen delivery is not recommended. The use of high-flow nasal cannula therapy is safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen to treat infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The application of humidification with low-flow oxygen delivery is not recommended. Targeting Spo2 90–97% for infants and children with bronchiolitis is recommended; however, no specific target can be recommended for pediatric patients with respiratory diseases outside of bronchiolitis, and establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is considered best practice.

### Diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis [^115LmYHr]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a disorder most commonly caused in infants by viral lower respiratory tract infection. It is the most common lower respiratory infection in this age group. It is characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways, increased mucus production, and bronchospasm. The American Academy of Pediatrics convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and specialists in the fields of pulmonology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, epidemiology, and medical informatics. The committee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the RTI International-University of North Carolina Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of bronchiolitis. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate clinical practice guideline recommendations. This guideline addresses the diagnosis of bronchiolitis as well as various therapeutic interventions including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antiviral and antibacterial agents, hydration, chest physiotherapy, and oxygen. Recommendations are made for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection with palivizumab and the control of nosocomial spread of infection. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before it was approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with bronchiolitis. Rather, it is intended to assist clinicians in decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with bronchiolitis.

### Bronchiolitis [^116JybtZ]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a distressing, potentially life-threatening respiratory condition that affects young babies. Around 2–3% of all infants younger than 1 year are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis, usually during the seasonal epidemic. The majority of these infants are infected with respiratory syncytial virus and all have an intense inflammatory response in their airways. Although most infants recover, they have an increased risk of recurrent wheezing. Although bronchiolitis is common, little is known about what causes infants to be susceptible. Diagnostic interventions have little effect on clinical outcome, and apart from supportive measures, there is no specific treatment. Bronchiolitis therefore presents an intriguing clinical conundrum and a major challenge to researchers. High quality clinical studies are needed to clarify assessment of disease severity and criteria for hospital admission, particularly the use of pulse oximetry and chest radiography. Careful mapping of the inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis should lead to development of new therapies to alleviate symptoms.

### Steroids and bronchodilators for acute bronchiolitis in the first two years of life: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116wu5WA]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research

Future research should focus on areas where there is some suggestion of benefit (significant or close to significant results in direct meta-analysis with a magnitude of effect that is clinically meaningful, or relative superiority in mixed treatment comparisons) but the strength of evidence is moderate or low — that is, future research may change our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate. Based on this review, adrenaline and combined adrenaline and dexamethasone seem to be emerging as the preferred treatments for outpatients. This review found no clear advantage of steroids or bronchodilators among inpatients. This information should guide the choice of comparators, including their dose and combinations, for future large trials.

Strengths and limitations of the review

This review has followed current methodological standards for the synthesis of evidence. Moreover, we have incorporated new methods of analysis to simultaneously compare the different interventions and to provide greater clarity around their relative benefits. Limitations of mixed treatment comparisons have been cited, specifically assumptions of sufficient homogeneity to combine data and generalisability to individual patients. The influence of age, history of wheezing episodes, and wheezing phenotype has led to repeated controversies in this subject, and it is not yet clear how best to approach these problems at a trial and systematic review level. We focused on first time wheezing so results could be directly pertinent to infants with typical viral bronchiolitis. We searched extensively for relevant literature and included all studies regardless of language of publication. We are confident that this review represents the most comprehensive synthesis currently available for the two most promising treatments for bronchiolitis, steroids and bronchodilators.

Conclusion

Uncertainty about the optimal management of bronchiolitis is underscored by evidence showing substantial variation in practice, even within homogenous clinical settings. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend only supportive measures based on the absence of convincing evidence for any other approach. This systematic review shows a benefit of adrenaline for outcomes of most clinical relevance among outpatients. Moreover, adrenaline is shown to be safe and is relatively inexpensive. Some evidence exists for a beneficial synergistic effect of adrenaline and dexamethasone. Further research of this combined treatment is needed among outpatients. For inpatients, none of the interventions examined showed clear benefits for length of stay. Consensus on the most clinically important outcomes and consistency in their application will yield stronger evidence for this important source of morbidity among young children.

### Clinical practice guidelines: management of severe bronchiolitis in infants under 12 months old admitted to a pediatric critical care unit [^111gYY4n]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We present guidelines for the management of infants under 12 months of age with severe bronchiolitis with the aim of creating a series of pragmatic recommendations for a patient subgroup that is poorly individualized in national and international guidelines.

Methods

Twenty-five French-speaking experts, all members of the Groupe Francophone de Réanimation et Urgence Pédiatriques (French-speaking group of paediatric intensive and emergency care; GFRUP) (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland), collaborated from 2021 to 2022 through teleconferences and face-to-face meetings. The guidelines cover five areas: (1) criteria for admission to a pediatric critical care unit, (2) environment and monitoring, (3) feeding and hydration, (4) ventilatory support and (5) adjuvant therapies. The questions were written in the Patient-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome (PICO) format. An extensive Anglophone and Francophone literature search indexed in the MEDLINE database via PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Embase was performed using pre-established keywords. The texts were analyzed and classified according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. When this method did not apply, an expert opinion was given. Each of these recommendations was voted on by all the experts according to the Delphi methodology.

Results

This group proposes 40 recommendations. The GRADE methodology could be applied for 17 of them (3 strong, 14 conditional) and an expert opinion was given for the remaining 23. All received strong approval during the first round of voting.

Conclusion

These guidelines cover the different aspects in the management of severe bronchiolitis in infants admitted to pediatric critical care units. Compared to the different ways to manage patients with severe bronchiolitis described in the literature, our original work proposes an overall less invasive approach in terms of monitoring and treatment.

### Steroids and bronchodilators for acute bronchiolitis in the first two years of life: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114iSqg9]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is the most common disease of the lower respiratory tract during the first year of life. Respiratory syncytial virus is the underlying cause of most bronchiolitis and this infection is associated with substantial morbidity in young children. Ongoing research in bronchiolitis reflects both the burden of disease in developed and developing countries and a lack of clear evidence for its therapeutic management. Previous studies have shown substantial variation in the management of acute bronchiolitis throughout the world, including the use of different bronchodilators (β₂ agonists, adrenaline (epinephrine), anticholinergics) and steroids. Some of this variation may be attributable to varying severity of disease or to different care settings and geographical location.

Several systematic reviews have assessed various treatments, including β₂ agonists and anticholinergics, adrenaline, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, antibiotics, surfactant, ribavirin, and chest physiotherapy. These reviews have failed to provide convincing evidence to support any of these treatments in the acute management of bronchiolitis, and their routine use is not recommended by current clinical practice guidelines. Despite implementation of these guidelines, bronchodilators especially are still frequently used.

### Respiratory support for infants with bronchiolitis, a narrative review of the literature [^115DDFGK]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a common viral disease that significantly affects infants less than 12 months of age. The purpose of this review is to present a review of the current knowledge of the uses of respiratory support in the management of infants with bronchiolitis presenting to hospital. We electronically searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE (inception to 25th March 2018), to manually search for clinical trials that address the management strategies for respiratory support of infants with bronchiolitis. We identified 120 papers who met the inclusion criteria, of which 33 papers were relevant for this review with only nine randomized controlled trials. This review demonstrated that non-invasive respiratory support reduced the need for escalation of therapy, particularly the proportion of intubations required for infants with bronchiolitis. Additionally, clear economic benefits have been demonstrated when non-invasive ventilation has been used. The potential early use of non-invasive respiratory supports such as nasal high flow therapy and non-invasive ventilation may have an impact on health care costs and reduction in ICU admissions and intubation rates. High-grade evidence demonstrates safety and quality of high flow therapy in general ward settings.

### Quality improvement project to decrease unnecessary investigations in infants with bronchiolitis in cork university hospital [^1177X7Rr]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

A child can be safely discharged home if the following criteria have been met: adequate feeding has been established; oxygen saturation is above 92% for 4 hours, even during sleep. Certain factors may also affect a carer's capacity to care for a child with bronchiolitis at home, which needs to be considered when assessing whether a child can safely be discharged and may warrant a child to be admitted. Infants with bronchiolitis that have been ill less than 3 days often worsen on the third and fourth day of illness and may need to represent to the ED.

Rationale

Stakeholder meetings concluded that the use of unnecessary investigations is likely due to the high patient load and lack of confidence of doctors to withhold investigations in these small babies with respiratory illness.

There was no guideline available to aid in the approach to diagnosis and management that was easy and free to access, yet extensive enough to safely advise the appropriate discharge of some patients and to guide management of more severe cases. There was a need to produce an evidence-based guideline that could meet all the aforementioned criteria to improve care of infants with bronchiolitis.

Specific aims

The aim of this study was to improve quality of patient care by decreasing the number of inappropriate investigations (namely, X-rays and blood tests) of patients with bronchiolitis below 1 year of age, to below 15%, and hereby decreasing patient hospital length of stay (LOS) without increasing the representation rate. The aim was to be accomplished by implementation of an evidence-based protocol on diagnosis and management of these patients.

### Effectiveness of targeted interventions on treatment of infants with bronchiolitis: a randomized clinical trial [^111PgELD]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can the evidence-based treatment of infants with bronchiolitis be improved by using targeted interventions to deimplement low-value care?

Findings

In this international cluster randomized clinical trial of 26 hospitals and 3727 infants, an absolute risk difference favoring intervention hospitals was seen in compliance with 5 evidence-based recommendations in the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.

Meaning

Use of targeted interventions improved the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis by deimplementing the use of ineffective and potentially harmful therapies and management; these results are important for bronchiolitis management, deimplementation science, and future interventions in acute care pediatrics.

### Evaluation of clinical case definitions for respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection in young children [^113DjCmy]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of SpO₂ to clinically assess disease severity or to differentiate between severe and nonsevere LRTI has been debated and explored over recent decades. The WHO proposes thresholds of 93% for severe RSV-LRTI and 90% for very severe RSV-LRTI. The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines mention a cutoff of 90% for oxygen supplementation in bronchiolitis, while the United Kingdom NICE recommendations state that cases with SpO₂ < 92% should be referred for hospital emergency care. However, a study assessing different hypoxemic targets in infants indicated no differences in the safety and clinical effectiveness for SpO₂ targets of 90% and 94% in bronchiolitis management. All guidelines recommend caution, highlighting the possibility of errors if relying on a single measurement or inappropriate instruments. Finally, standardized definitions for RSV illness severity should incorporate provisions for individuals with low baseline SpO₂ measurements. Despite these potential issues, SpO₂ for assessing disease severity is an objective measure that can be readily obtained in diverse clinical settings.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^115DnhDo]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for pediatric bronchiolitis: The use of HFNC (≤ 2 L/kg/min) appears to be safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen (< 2 L/min) to treat infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis in the pediatric ward and pediatric ICU settings. Practitioners need to use appropriately sized cannulas that block around 50% of nares openings, since larger sizes increase the risk of inadvertently creating PEEP and pressure ulcers. Cannulas should not exceed the manufacturers' recommended maximum flow, because exceeding these flows results in the buildup of back pressure. Protocols should include indications, contraindications, escalation and de-escalation of care, scheduled monitoring of occurrence of pressure ulcers, recommendations for obtaining a blood gas, and transfer to pediatric ICU if used in the ward, with monitoring of adverse events included. When HFNC is used in pediatric wards, patients should be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and staff need to be appropriately trained to use the devices and to recognize complications.

### Bronchiolitis management before and after the AAP guidelines [^114z1rGX]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Evidence-based practice guidelines for bronchiolitis management published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2006 recommend supportive care with limited diagnostic testing and treatment. We sought to determine the impact of these guidelines on the treatment of hospitalized children.

Methods

We analyzed data on inpatients with bronchiolitis aged 1 to 24 months from the Pediatric Health Information System, an administrative billing database, from November 1, 2004 to March 31, 2012. We compared trends in use of diagnostic and treatment resources before and after the publication of the guidelines by using segmented time series.

Results

A total of 41 pediatric hospitals contributed data to yield 130,262 patients; 58% were male, and 59% were publicly insured. Median age was 4.0 months (interquartile range, 2–9). Unadjusted analysis showed improvement in utilization rates before and after guidelines for diagnostic tests and for medications; however, there was no decreased use of antibiotics. A segmented regression analysis also demonstrated differences in rates of change before and after guidelines, with significant improvement for chest radiography, steroids, and bronchodilators (P < .0001).

Conclusions

In a nationally representative cohort of pediatric hospitals, publication of the 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines was associated with significant reductions in the use of diagnostic and therapeutic resources.

### Assessing the impact of national guidelines on the management of children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis [^112QRjJ6]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is a common illness accounting for $500 million annually in hospitalizations. Despite the frequency of bronchiolitis, its diagnosis and management is variable. To address this variability, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an evidence-based practice management guideline for bronchiolitis in 2006.

Objective

Assess for changes in physician behavior in the management of bronchiolitis before and after publication of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed at two academic medical centers of children < 24months of age admitted to the hospital with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Pre-guideline charts were gathered from 2004 to 2005 and post-guideline charts from 2007 to 2008. Evaluation and therapeutic interventions prior to and during hospitalization were analyzed. Data were analyzed using chi-squared analysis for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney testing for continuous variables.

Results

One thousand two hundred thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Diagnostic laboratory testing rates did not decline after guideline publication. The number of chest X-rays obtained decreased from 72.9% to 66.7% post-guidelines (P = 0.02). Fewer children received a trial of racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.006) or albuterol (81.6% vs. 72.6%, P < 0.0001) post-guidelines, and physicians more often discontinued albuterol when documented ineffective in the post-guidelines period (28.6% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.0001). Corticosteroid use in children without a history of RAD or asthma dropped post-guidelines (26.5% vs. 17.5%, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

A modest change in physician behavior in the inpatient management of bronchiolitis was seen post-guidelines. Additional health care provider training and education is warranted to reduce unnecessary interventions and healthcare resources use.

Acute viral bronchiolitis represents one of the most important health burdens in the paediatric population with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the primary causative agent. Estimates suggest that, worldwide, there are approximately 34 million new cases of lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV in children under 5 years of age, resulting in 3.4 million hospitalisations and around 199 000 deaths annually, predominantly in developing countries. The incidence of bronchiolitis is also high in developed countries. Indeed, bronchiolitis is the leading cause of respiratory failure in children under 12 months of age, accounting for up to 100 000 hospital admissions per year in the USA. Although hospitalisation rates have decreased, emergency department visits, mechanical ventilation usage and hospital expenditures have increased.

To date, there is no curative treatment. Indeed, published meta-analyses indicate that pharmacological therapies (corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, epinephrine and bronchodilators) are not associated with a reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Therefore, supportive therapy remains the cornerstone of management. Management outside the ICU includes monitoring vital signs, nasal saline washes with superficial suctioning, adequate hydration and low-flow oxygen therapy (LFO).

Recently, the administration of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannulas (high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)) has gained interest. This method of oxygen delivery emerged approximately 20 years ago, initially in the neonatal ICU, and later in paediatric units and during interhospital transfer.HFNC delivers a heated and humidified gas mixture (air and oxygen), with variable flow intensity (generally 1–2 L/kg/min) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) to meet the patient's demand. HFNC has several physiological effects, including a decrease in airway resistance, the generation of a flow-dependent distending pressure and a washout of dead space. Based on a consistent international literature, together with its easy use and safety, HFNC has also expanded outside the ICU, becoming a common treatment in paediatric emergency departments and general paediatrics.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^116rcB9m]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen saturation targets standardise clinical care in patients with acute disease, aiming to maintain tissue oxygenation and improve clinical outcomes. No randomised clinical trial has assessed oxygen saturation targets in management of patients with acute lower respiratory infection (LRTI). The most common acute LRTI in early life is acute viral bronchiolitis, which causes about 128 000 hospital admissions each year in the USA at an estimated cost of US$1·73 billion. Applying standard unit cost estimates to annual rates in the UK reveals that the annual cost of paediatric bronchiolitis to NHS England would be about £83·8 million. This figure is based on 37 200 cases of paediatric bronchiolitis per yearwith an average cost per case of £2254. In 2006, two evidence-based guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis included contrasting recommendations for oxygen saturation targets. The UK SIGN guideline (SIGN 91) recommended a normoxic pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target (≥ 94%), whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)recommended a permissive hypoxaemic SpO 2 target (≥ 90%; reiterated 2014). The AAP's advice is consistent with WHO's recommended SpO 2 target of 90% and higher in infants with LRTI. However, WHO's recommendation is considered pragmatic advice for best use of scarce oxygen availability in low-resource settings, and neither AAP or WHO targets have been tested in a randomised controlled trial.

Despite AAP's guidance, recommended SpO 2 targets for infants with bronchiolitis continue to vary between national guideline portals for the USA, Europe,… This inconsistency might show clinical hesitance to adopt a lower SpO 2 target for infants than is currently recommended for older children with pneumonia (≤ 92%)and asthma (< 94%), or a reticence to use hypoxaemic targets provided by expert opinion when similar recommendations have been associated with unanticipated adverse events once tested in a randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess whether a target oxygen saturation of 90% or higher would be equivalent to 94% or higher for resolution of illness in acute viral bronchiolitis. To do this we assessed time to resolution of cough, which is associated with airway inflammation and might be influenced by hypoxia. Cough is a ubiquitous symptom in bronchiolitis consistently identified by parents and has a duration well documented in many trials.

### Choosing wisely-SHP recommendations [^116a2UUz]. Choosing Wisely (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to bronchodilators (SHP), SHM 2013 guidelines recommend to do not use bronchodilators routinely in pediatric patients with bronchiolitis.

### Assessing the quality of health care in the management of bronchiolitis in Australian children: a population-based sample survey [^115u3qWd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Using indicators drawn from CPGs, we have shown that the guideline-adherent care for children with bronchiolitis ranges between 10% and almost 100%. Previous studies evaluating the appropriateness of care for bronchiolitis have focused on specific areas of its management in either an ambulatory or inpatient setting; a strength of the current study is that it assesses a broad range of different aspects of the clinical management of bronchiolitis across 119 different healthcare sites in three Australian States, covering three settings: GP, the ED and inpatient admissions. This comprehensive study suggests that management of bronchiolitis in Australia is largely adherent to CGPs.

Our results suggest that the lowest adherence across different healthcare settings was for indicators associated with documentation of history and clinical assessment in children aged < 12 months with acute bronchiolitis. This variation was greatest within primary care settings. Appropriate recording of a diagnosis of mild, moderate and severe bronchiolitis (BRON11–13) was undertaken in less than a third of visits. Proper assessment of the severity of symptoms guides management pathways and determines the need for hospital admission and subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Inadequate recording of medical diagnosis can also lead to an information gap especially when patients are transferred from the primary care setting to ED. Information gaps due to inadequate documentation have been associated with a longer patient stay in ED. Additionally, inaccurate diagnosis is related to discrepancies in assignment of clinical codes. In Australia, healthcare financing is dependent on accurate clinical coding and inaccuracies may result in increased hospital revenues. It was beyond the scope of the study to assess the factors associated with inadequate documentation which may be due to increased workload and limited resources. Converting paper-based records to an electronic record system which is currently being implemented across the Australian healthcare system may reduce missing information.

### National survey of feasibility of NIV trials for management of children with bronchiolitis [^111dt73k]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is a major cause of admission to hospital in children. Between 2004 and 2012, 8172 children under the age of 1 year were admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for bronchiolitis in England. From 2004 to 2011, the overall average PICU admission rate increased by 1.8% each year.

Bronchiolitis management is centred on oxygen therapy for hypoxia, respiratory support and good hydration. Early use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or heated humidified high-flow nasal (HFNC) oxygen (O₂), may have an impact on outcome by avoiding disease progression. There has been an increase in the use of HFNC in routine clinical practice for moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis; however, until recently, there has been little evidence to guide practice, and there have been no studies using NHS patients from the UK. Recently, a number of reports have raised concerns regarding its cost effectiveness in bronchiolitis.

The objectives of this study were to assess current UK practice regarding bronchiolitis management in terms of the type of NIV methods used and the criteria for commencing and weaning NIV. We also wished to explore issues pertinent to the design of a potential future randomised controlled trial (RCT) of NIV. This study formed part of a larger research project (Non-Invasive Ventilation for the Management of Children with Bronchiolitis: a feasibility study (NOVEMBR)).

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^117WcPNW]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Because children in the modified group managed to a target of 90% had the same or better outcomes than did those managed to a 94% target, the WHO oxygen saturation target of 90% might not be the lower limit of tolerance for oxygen saturation in acute respiratory disease in children. Particularly in low-resource settings, the risk and benefit balance of managing acute respiratory infection at a target lower than the current WHO recommended SpO 2 target could be considered. However, with increased risk of death shown for children with pneumonia and preterm infants with chronic lung disease managed at target oxygen saturation of lower than 90%, the ethical boundaries to such a study would need careful consideration.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^112F1Drs]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Oxygen therapy is one of the most important therapeutics offered in the clinical management of pediatric patients with cardiopulmonary disease. As the medical community seeks to ensure evidence-based management of clinical interventions, we conducted a systematic review with the goal of providing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to answer questions surrounding the use of simple oxygen therapy to improve oxygenation, including a comparison of delivery devices, the efficacy of humidification, comparison of flows, and goals for use in children. Using a modification of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, we developed 4 recommendations to assist clinicians in the utilization of oxygen therapy in hospitalized children: (1) the use of an oxygen hood or tent in lieu of a low-flow oxygen device for consistent oxygen delivery is not recommended; (2) the use of high-flow nasal cannula therapy is safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen to treat infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis; (3) the application of humidification with low-flow oxygen delivery is not recommended; (4) targeting [Formula: see text] 90–97% for infants and children with bronchiolitis is recommended; however, no specific target can be recommended for pediatric patients with respiratory diseases outside of bronchiolitis, and establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is considered best practice.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^115VTbAG]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with bronchiolitis, which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections. No evidence exists to support this threshold. We aimed to assess whether the 90% or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94% or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK (the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [BIDS]). A central computer randomly allocated (1:1) infants, in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification, to be clipped to standard oximeters (patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [SpO2] < 94%) or modified oximeters (displayed a measured value of 90% as 94%, therefore oxygen not given until SpO2 < 90%). All parents, clinical staff, and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough (prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN28405428.

Findings

Between Oct 3, and March 30, 2012, and Oct 1, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters. Cough resolved by 15·0 days (median) in both groups (95% CI for difference -1 to 2) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent. We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group. In the standard care group, eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit, 23 were readmitted, and one had a prolonged hospital stay. In the modified care group, 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital. Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly.

Interpretation

Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90% or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94% or higher. Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children, particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce.

### Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis: drugs, antibiotics [^116cWoeX]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

RSV bronchiolitis is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission and for visits to emergency departments for children, and at least half of affected infants will have subsequent episodes of respiratory illness. Despite this, there are wide variations in management. Initial assessment of respiratory status should include a measure of oxygenation and oxygen should be given when there is clinical evidence of respiratory distress even before full assessment is completed. Fluid and nutritional status should also be assessed early and decisions made about use of intravenous fluids, nasogastric feeding, or maintenance of frequent feeds orally. Given the lack of evidence on all drug therapies for bronchiolitis, clinicians should carefully evaluate treatments for their ability to reduce symptoms, decrease length of hospital stay and reduce sequelae. Furthermore, clinicians should monitor antibiotic use carefully and develop a strategy to change current physician practice.

### Application of the 2023 Italian guidelines for respiratory support management in acute viral bronchiolitis: a retrospective study [^117SnxVo]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

We carried out a retrospective analysis to compare the management of patients with bronchiolitis who required oxygen therapy during two epidemic seasons: October to March 2022–2023 (pre-guidelines) and 2023–2024 (post-guidelines).

Participants

All infants under 12 months of age, hospitalised at the paediatric emergency department of Policlinico Umberto I, Rome (Italy), with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis and who needed oxygen therapy for hypoxaemia were included in the study. Patients with congenital heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency and those for whom data could not be retrieved from medical records were excluded. These patients were excluded because they could have more compromised respiratory function compared with healthy children, which may influence the clinical course and the need for more intensive care.

### Bronchiolitis: recent evidence on diagnosis and management [^112PCKQ3]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is a leading cause of acute illness and hospitalization of young children. Research into the variation in treatment and outcomes for bronchiolitis across different settings has led to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Ongoing investigation continues to expand this body of evidence. Authors of recent surveillance studies have defined the presence of coinfections with multiple viruses in some cases of bronchiolitis. Underlying comorbidities and young age remain the most important predictors for severe bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry plays an important role in driving use of health care resources. Evidence-based reviews have suggested a limited role for diagnostic laboratory or radiographic tests in typical cases of bronchiolitis. Several large, recent trials have revealed a lack of efficacy for routine use of either bronchodilators or corticosteroids for treatment of bronchiolitis. Preliminary evidence suggests a potential future role for a combination of these therapies and other novel treatments such as nebulized hypertonic saline.

### Managing respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis… [^112S6YEd]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Although the foundation of management of respiratory syncytial virus disease is supportive care with fluid replacement and supplemental oxygen, treatments to dilate constricted bronchi can be useful. These treatments include corticosteroids, bronchodilators, helium/oxygen therapy, and exogenous surfactant, which are used to decrease disease duration and improve morbidity and mortality. Supportive treatment with parenteral fluids is often required to maintain hydration but must be administered carefully because of the risk of pulmonary congestion. Hospitalized infants should be given humidified, supplemental oxygen when they are hypoxemic, and pulse oximetry monitoring is recommended. Mechanical ventilation may be needed in severe cases in children who develop apnea or respiratory failure. Saline drops and suction can help keep the nasal passages clear. Airway obstruction is caused by plugs formed from mucus and desquamated epithelial cells.

Enhanced smooth muscle tone increases bronchospasm. Beta-adrenergic agonists may be useful when bronchospasms are present, and anti-inflammatory therapy may be useful when an inflammatory process dominates the clinical picture. No clear evidence supports the use of chest physiotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids, mucolytic agents, or theophylline in the management of bronchiolitis. Beta. Use of systemic corticosteroids appears to reduce the duration of symptoms, especially if given early and if used in infants with more severe symptoms. Recent studies also show decreased hospitalization if systemic steroids are used early in infants with mild to moderate cases of bronchiolitis. Inhaled epinephrine or anticholinergics have not demonstrated consistent clinical benefit. Combination therapy with systemic cortico-steroids and inhaled beta agonists has shown some promise. Further studies are needed to examine the ability of exogenous surfactant to prevent small airway obstruction.

Helium/oxygen therapy can decrease airway resistance, providing symptom relief and time for the disease to resolve naturally. The author concludes that treatments beyond supportive care in children with bronchiolitis should be individualized. Further studies are needed to make specific universal recommendations about treatments beyond hydration and oxygen maintenance. In the same journal issue, Jafri reviewed antiviral therapies with ribavirin respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin intravenous, and palivizumab, an IgG mono-clonal antibody for bronchiolitis. Aerosolized ribavirin may be useful early when the viral load is maximal.

### Respiratory support in bronchiolitis: trial evidence [^115zXkoC]. American Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute viral lower respiratory tract infection is frequently associated with hypoxemia and respiratory distress, sometimes progressing to hypercarbia and respiratory failure. In recent years, trials have assessed the effects of oxygen supplementation and respiratory support with high-flow oxygen therapy. An oxygen saturation target of 90% is as safe and clinically effective as 94% in infants with bronchiolitis. Trials of high-flow humidified oxygen have demonstrated safety, but as yet poorly demarcated an appropriate place for use within the clinical course of the disease. Effective trials of continuous positive airway pressure are lacking and urgently required. The trials reported to date have highlighted the need for common outcomes in relation to treatment failure.

### Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for acute bronchiolitis in children [^116QNpUm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent causes of emergency department visits and hospitalisation in children up to three years of age. There is no specific treatment for bronchiolitis except for supportive treatment, which includes ensuring adequate hydration and oxygen supplementation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) aims to widen the lungs' peripheral airways, enabling deflation of overdistended lungs in bronchiolitis. Increased airway pressure also prevents the collapse of poorly supported peripheral small airways during expiration. Observational studies report that CPAP is beneficial for children with acute bronchiolitis. This is an update of a review first published in 2015 and updated in 2019.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of CPAP compared to no CPAP or sham CPAP in infants and children up to three years of age with acute bronchiolitis.

Search Methods

We conducted searches of CENTRAL (2021, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to August 2021), Embase (1974 to August 2021), CINAHL (1981 to August 2021), and LILACS (1982 to August 2021) in August 2021. We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for completed and ongoing trials on 26 October 2021.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cross-over RCTs, and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data using a structured pro forma, analysed data, and performed meta-analyses. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies. We created a summary of the findings table employing GRADEpro GDT software. MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies with a total of 122 children (62/60 in intervention/control arms) aged up to 12 months investigating nasal CPAP compared with supportive (or 'standard') therapy. We included one new trial (72 children) in the 2019 update that contributed data to the assessment of respiratory rate and the need for mechanical ventilation for this update. We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in the current update. The included studies were single-centre trials conducted in France, the UK, and India. Two studies were parallel-group RCTs, and one study was a cross-over RCT. The evidence provided by the included studies was of low certainty; we made an assessment of high risk of bias for blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting, and confidence intervals were wide. The effect of CPAP on the need for mechanical ventilation in children with acute bronchiolitis was uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision around the effect estimate (risk difference -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 0.08; 3 RCTs, 122 children; low certainty evidence). None of the trials measured time to recovery. Limited, low certainty evidence indicated that CPAP decreased respiratory rate (decreased respiratory rate is better) (mean difference (MD) -3.81, 95% CI -5.78 to -1.84; 2 RCTs, 91 children; low certainty evidence). Only one trial measured change in arterial oxygen saturation (increased oxygen saturation is better), and the results were imprecise (MD -1.70%, 95% CI -3.76 to 0.36; 1 RCT, 19 children; low certainty evidence). The effect of CPAP on change in arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO₂) (decrease in pCO₂ is better) was imprecise (MD -2.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.29 to 0.05; 2 RCTs, 50 children; low certainty evidence). Duration of hospital stay was similar in both the CPAP and supportive care groups (MD 0.07 days, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.50; 2 RCTs, 50 children; low certainty evidence). Two studies did not report pneumothorax, but pneumothorax did not occur in one study. No studies reported occurrences of deaths. Several outcomes (change in partial oxygen pressure, hospital admission rate (from the emergency department to hospital), duration of emergency department stay, and need for intensive care unit admission) were not reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of CPAP did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in children with bronchiolitis, although the evidence was of low certainty. Limited, low certainty evidence suggests that breathing improved (a decreased respiratory rate) in children with bronchiolitis who received CPAP; this finding is unchanged from the 2015 review and 2019 update. Due to the limited available evidence, the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis is uncertain for our other outcomes. Larger, adequately powered trials are needed to evaluate the effect of CPAP for children with acute bronchiolitis.

### Quality improvement project to decrease unnecessary investigations in infants with bronchiolitis in cork university hospital [^116Crenj]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Problem description

Bronchiolitis is a common presentation of infants in the busy emergency department (ED).

These infants are often exposed to diagnostic interventions that are not evidence-based. Inappropriate management of infants with bronchiolitis results in less appropriate discharges and poor outcomes when admitted. This increases the burden on the ED. There are evidence-based standards of care which, when implemented, will improve quality of care in patients.

A retrospective audit was performed on all cases of infants below 1 year of age, diagnosed with bronchiolitis, every week from 1 November 2018 to 30 January 2019 (see table 1). The results confirmed that a large number of patients had received inappropriate investigations, namely, chest X-rays (CXRs) and blood tests, as a means to diagnose bronchiolitis. A total of 323 patients were diagnosed with bronchiolitis (see table 1), of which a weekly average of 25% had CXRs and a weekly average of 29% had blood tests.

### Bronchiolitis [^1144JXDS]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants, occurring in a seasonal pattern, with highest incidence in the winter in temperate climates, and in the rainy season in warmer countries. Bronchiolitis is a common reason for attendance at and admission to hospital.

Methods and Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of prophylactic interventions for bronchiolitis in high-risk children? What are the effects of measures to prevent transmission of bronchiolitis in hospital? What are the effects of treatments for children with bronchiolitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 40 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bronchodilators (oral, inhaled salbutamol, inhaled adrenaline [epinephrine]), chest physiotherapy, corticosteroids, montelukast, nursing interventions (cohort segregation, hand washing, gowns, masks, gloves, and goggles), respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulins, pooled immunoglobulins, or palivizumab (monoclonal antibody), ribavirin, or surfactants.

### A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis [^116MSHji]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospital admission for respiratory disease among infants aged < 1 year. Clinical practice guidelines can benefit patients by reducing the performance of unnecessary tests, hospital admissions, and treatment with lack of a supportive evidence base. This review aimed to identify current clinical practice guidelines worldwide, appraise their methodological quality, and discuss variability across guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis.

Methods

A systematic literature review of electronic databases EMBASE, Global Health, and Medline was performed. Manual searches of the gray literature, national pediatric society websites, and guideline-focused databases were performed, and select international experts were contacted to identify additional guidelines. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

Thirty-two clinical practice guidelines met the selection criteria. Quality assessment revealed significant shortcomings in a number of guidelines, including lack of systematic processes in formulating guidelines, failure to state conflicts of interest, and lack of consultation with families of affected children. There was widespread agreement about a number of aspects, such as avoidance of the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests, risk factors for severe disease, indicators for hospital admission, discharge criteria, and nosocomial infection control. However, there was variability, even within areas of consensus, over specific recommendations, such as variable thresholds for oxygen therapy. Guidelines showed significant variability in recommendations for the pharmacological management of bronchiolitis, with conflicting recommendations over whether use of nebulized epinephrine, hypertonic saline, or bronchodilators should be routinely trialled.

Conclusions

Future guidelines should aim to be compliant with international standards for clinical guidelines to improve their quality and clarity and to promote their adoption into practice. Variable recommendations between guidelines may reflect the evolving evidence base for bronchiolitis management, and platforms should be created to understand this variability and promote evidence-based recommendations.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^111yX2m8]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with bronchiolitis, which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections. No evidence exists to support this threshold. We aimed to assess whether the 90% or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94% or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK (the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [BIDS]). A central computer randomly allocated (1:1) infants, in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification, to be clipped to standard oximeters (patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [SpO₂] < 94%) or modified oximeters (displayed a measured value of 90% as 94%, therefore oxygen not given until SpO₂ < 90%). All parents, clinical staff, and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough (prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN28405428.

Findings

Between Oct 3, and March 30, 2012, and Oct 1, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters. Cough resolved by 15·0 days (median) in both groups (95% CI for difference −1 to 2) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent. We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group. In the standard care group, eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit, 23 were readmitted, and one had a prolonged hospital stay. In the modified care group, 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital. Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly.

Interpretation

Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90% or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94% or higher. Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children, particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce.

### Clinical practice guideline for bronchiolitis: key recommendations… [^112G59Ak]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchiolitis is common in children younger than 24 months. The most common etiology for bronchiolitis is respiratory syncytial virus infection. Although bronchiolitis is common, there are wide-ranging practice variations for its diagnosis and management. To address these variations, the American Academy of Pediatrics formed a committee with representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, and the American College of Chest Physicians to develop a clinical practice guideline. 1 which is summarized on page 265 of this issue of American Family Physician. 2 The guideline focuses on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of bronchiolitis in children one month to two years of age. Each recommendation was given an evidence profile that included statements on aggregate evidence quality, benefits, harms, and a benefits-harms assessment. This editorial highlights some of the key recommendations from the guideline.

Another major point in the guideline is that the routine use of medications to treat bronchiolitis is not necessary. Although bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and ribavirin are used in practice, there is little evidence to support their use. If a trial of inhaled bronchodilator therapy is initiated, it should be continued only if there is documented improvement in the patient's clinical condition. Furthermore, an antibacterial medication should not be used unless there is specific evidence that a coexisting bacterial infection is present. The guideline also addresses several nonpharmacologic treatments. Physicians should assess the hydration status of all children with bronchiolitis. If a child is in respiratory distress and adequate oral hydration cannot be achieved, the child should receive intravenous fluids. The use of supplemental oxygen is indicated if functional oxygen saturation persistently falls below 90 percent.

The routine use of chest physiotherapy is not indicated. The guideline recommends adequate handwashing, preferably with an alcohol-based rub, as the most significant approach to preventing the nosocomial spread of RSV. It is important that the medical staff and the patient's family members are educated about adequate hand decontamination. For bronchiolitis prevention, the guideline focuses on palivizumab for selected children who are premature or who have chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease. Prophylactic palivizumab should be given in five monthly doses based on the epidemiology of RSV infection in the community. Although seasonal and regional outbreak variations can occur.

### Current concepts in the evaluation and management of bronchiolitis [^117ByyZt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract illness caused by viral infection in children 2 years of age and younger, frequently associated with wheezing on physical examination. It is a common cause of hospitalization, particularly in patients with risk factors for more serious disease. The diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs and symptoms alone, and care is generally supportive with a focus on safely doing less for symptomatic children. Bronchodilators, systemic steroids, and other therapies have been shown to have no significant effect on hospitalization rates, length of stay, or symptom duration.

### Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: supportive care and therapies designed to overcome airway obstruction [^113Jjv6i]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis rests primarily on supportive care with oxygen and fluid management. Other therapies commonly used include bronchodilators, corticosteroids and ribavirin, when considered appropriate. Small studies have also suggested that exogenous surfactant, helium/oxygen mixtures (heliox) and combination therapies may offer clinical benefit as well. Management of bronchiolitis can be facilitated by (1) recognizing the risks and benefits of various therapies, (2) understanding the markers of disease severity and (3) gaining familiarity with the time course of viral replication compared with presentation of symptoms. Although oxygen administration and judicious fluid replacement are the only interventions proved to be of reliable benefit to infants with bronchiolitis, newer studies support a role for adjunctive therapies aimed at relieving airway obstruction, especially when administered very early in the course of the illness or given to infants with more severe disease.

### Viral bronchiolitis in infants in the era of targeted therapies: what now and what's next? [^112tcTQi]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Viral bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 1 year of age. Most clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend a minimalist management approach based on supportive therapy, focusing solely on maintaining oxygenation and hydration.

Objectives

To examine the reasons behind the poor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for bronchiolitis in real-world clinical practice and to explore potential strategies to improve future management.

Methods

This narrative review discusses factors that may explain the observed gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, including recent findings from the field that help clarify this poor adherence.

Results

We highlight the discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical implementation. We also discuss the evolving landscape of bronchiolitis management, including evidence supporting novel interventions such as maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy and the use of monoclonal antibodies like nirsevimab and ziresovir, an oral RSV F protein inhibitor.

Conclusions

Understanding and addressing the causes of poor adherence to bronchiolitis guidelines is critical. Future research should aim to integrate evidence-based treatments with options for personalized adjustments. Updated guidelines should reflect emerging interventions and provide rational management pathways until robust evidence from new studies becomes available.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^113xKAPg]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

A protocol for this systematic review was generated to delineate the rationale, hypothesis, objectives, and methodology of the review (Supplemental Fig. 2). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines were utilised to form the protocol. No Institutional Research Board (IRB) approval or consent was required for this study as it is a systematic review of previously published literature.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were utilised for the review if they met all of the following inclusion criteria: Involved a study population of infants under 24 months of age; The population must have a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis; The population must be undergoing intensive care management.

Studies were excluded from this review if they met any of the following exclusion criteria: Not available in the English language; Did not have full texts available for full-text review; Did not report outcomes of the management used; The study did not take the format of a clinical study, such as a randomised controlled trial, cohort study or case-control study.

Information sources and search strategy

In order to assess the evidence base for the management of these infants, a systematic review of the evidence for the intensive care management of bronchiolitis was conducted. Due to the wide variety of conditions which infer a higher risk of severe bronchiolitis, it was decided that independent searches for each condition would be unsuitable. Thus, we conducted our search for infants who required escalation to intensive care as those who require this level of intervention are typically those with a high-risk condition. For this review, articles were sourced from three online database search engines: PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE. The search strategy combined key terms and Emtree to source studies that incorporated the key aspects of our question; bronchiolitis and intensive care management. There was not a timeframe included in the search strategy as many older studies may still guide clinical management today. The last search was performed on the third of December 2021. The search strategy utilised is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

### A clinical pathway for bronchiolitis is effective in reducing readmission rates [^1164tdK1]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the use of a clinical pathway in the management of infants hospitalized with acute viral bronchiolitis.

Study Design

A clinical pathway with specific management and discharge criteria for the care of infants with bronchiolitis was developed from pathways used in tertiary care pediatric institutions in Australia. Two hundred and twenty-nine infants admitted to hospital with acute viral bronchiolitis and prospectively managed using a pathway protocol were compared with a retrospective analysis of 207 infants managed without a pathway in 3 regional and 1 tertiary care hospital.

Results

Readmission to hospital was significantly lower in the pathway group (P = 0.001), as was administration of supplemental fluids (P = 0.001) and use of steroids (P = 0.005). There were no differences between groups in demographic factors or clinical severity. The pathway had no overall effect on length of stay or time in oxygen.

Conclusions

A clinical pathway specifying local practice guidelines and discharge criteria can reduce the risk of readmission to hospital, the use of inappropriate therapies, and help with discharge planning.

### Improving evidence based bronchiolitis care [^117KPPs3]. Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there continues to be widespread use of non-recommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory support are recommended. Standardization of bronchiolitis care with evidence based institutional clinical pathways spanning ED to inpatient care can help optimize resource utilization while simultaneously improving care of bronchiolitis and reducing hospital length of stays and costs.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^114SYpHF]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Research on the care of critically ill high-risk infants with bronchiolitis has been limited to date. Despite the existence of national guidelines pertaining to the management of acute bronchiolitis, little impact has been shown for the management of patients in the PICU with severe disease. For example, the NICE guidelines recommended against the use of nebulised therapies for the management of patients in the PICU and advised the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with impending respiratory failure. However, small regional studies published since the 2015 NICE guidelines have found that the use of nebulised therapies, including hypertonic saline, have increased. Additionally, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) such as high-flow oxygen therapy has increased, while the use of CPAP decreased.

Available guidelines rarely included specific guidance for the management of infants with bronchiolitis in the PICU setting. Significantly, acute bronchiolitis accounts for around 13% of PICU admissions in the UK, contributing a significant burden on the availability of PICU beds. Additionally, it has been shown that those infants experiencing severe disease and admission to the PICU are those with identifiable risk factors including prematurity and chronic medical conditions as above. As shown in Table 1, the majority of RCTs included in the NICE guidelines (2015) excluded those infants with any high-risk condition, comorbidity, or requiring escalation of care. The greatest percentage of patients excluded from the clinical trial data included those with underlying respiratory disease, followed by those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Additionally, a large percentage of patients were excluded for having received previous medication or treatment, such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids, as well as having any history of atopy including asthma, wheeze, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Over half of the studies excluded patients who required escalation of care and/or PICU management. Finally, over 30% of studies excluded those who were premature and around 7% of studies excluded congenital anomalies such as Down Syndrome. Given the exclusion of high-risk infants from trials which are subsequently used to make evidence-based recommendations, this significantly limits the generalisability of the guidelines among infants with various underlying health conditions. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that there is a significant gap in the research pertaining to the management of high-risk infants experiencing bronchiolitis.

### Management of severe bronchiolitis: impact of NICE guidelines [^113yfTgy]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To understand the impact of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) bronchiolitis guidelines on the management of children referred to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with bronchiolitis.

Design and Setting

Data were collected on all children referred to a regional PICU transport service with the clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis during the winter prior to the NICE consultation period (2011–2012) and during the winter after publication (2015–2016). Management initiated by the referring hospital was assessed.

Results

There were 165 infants referred with bronchiolitis in epoch 1 and 187 in epoch 2. Nebuliser use increased from 28% in epoch 1 to 53% in epoch 2. Increased use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and reduction in continuous positive airway pressure use were observed. The use of antibiotics did not change between epochs.

Conclusion

The use of nebulised therapies has increased in the management of severe bronchiolitis despite national guidance to the contrary.

### Assessing the quality of health care in the management of bronchiolitis in Australian children: a population-based sample survey [^112j9Bq7]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Despite low adherence to diagnosis, and poor recording of all items relating to history and examination, adherence to appropriate symptomatic management of bronchiolitis including monitoring oxygen saturation, prescribing oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation at 93% or greater and ensuring frequent feeding either through nasogastric tube or intravenous fluid depending on the severity of symptoms (BRON20–22) was over 70%. Though it was beyond the scope of this study to verify whether clinicians were unsure of the appropriate diagnosis of bronchiolitis, the documented discrepancy between diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis suggest that the documentation of diagnosis was incomplete.

The overall appropriateness of undertaking blood tests (BRON15) and chest X-rays (BRON14) in the management of mild/moderate bronchiolitis in children aged < 2 years exceeded 90%. These were avoided for ~60% of the children aged < 12 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending ED and requiring admission in the hospitals (BRON23). This latter figure is comparable with the use of chest X-ray and blood investigation in Canadian children (42% and 15%, respectively)and in children in the USA attending ED with bronchiolitis, where 15%–40% underwent chest X-ray. The available data do not support the use of chest X-ray in management of bronchiolitis. The overuse of chest X-rays does not comply with paediatric patient safety initiatives and also wastes healthcare resources. In our study, while adherence to CPG's recommendations to minimise laboratory investigation in children with bronchiolitis aged < 2 years was high, there was overuse of chest X-rays particularly in children aged < 12 months. Physicians often recommend chest X-rays in children with wheeze who are aged < 6 months or who require hospitalisations, which do not have any beneficial impact on clinical management.CPGs highlighting specific criteria for use of chest X-rays and other laboratory investigations in management of bronchiolitis may reduce such unwarranted variation in clinical practice. Studies have suggested that interventions that lead to providers pledging to minimise overuse of investigations not supported by CPGs including chest X-rays may also lead to reduction in use.

### Leukotriene inhibitors for bronchiolitis in infants and young children [^115kLwqj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is an acute inflammatory illness of the bronchioles common among infants and young children. It is often caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Management of bronchiolitis varies between clinicians, reflecting the lack of evidence for a specific treatment approach. The leukotriene pathway has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis. Leukotriene inhibitors such as montelukast have been used in infants and young children with bronchiolitis. However, the results from limited randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are controversial and necessitate a thorough evaluation of their efficacy for bronchiolitis in infants and young children.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of leukotriene inhibitors for bronchiolitis in infants and young children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to April week 4, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to May 2014), CINAHL (1981 to May 2014), LILACS (1982 to May 2014), Web of Science (1985 to May 2014), WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov (6 May 2014).

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing leukotriene inhibitors versus placebo or another intervention in infants and young children under two years of age diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Our primary outcomes were length of hospital stay and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical severity score, percentage of symptom-free days, percentage of children requiring ventilation, oxygen saturation, recurrent wheezing, respiratory rate and clinical adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Collaboration methodological practices. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data, such as general information, participant characteristics, interventions and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence. We used Review Manager software to pool results and chose random-effects models for meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included five studies with a total of 1296 participants under two years of age hospitalised with bronchiolitis. Two studies with low risk of bias compared 4 mg montelukast (a leukotriene inhibitor) daily use from admission until discharge with a matching placebo. Both selected length of hospital stay as a primary outcome and clinical severity score as a secondary outcome. However, the effects of leukotriene inhibitors on length of hospital stay and clinical severity score were uncertain due to considerable heterogeneity between the study results and wide confidence intervals around the estimated effects (hospital stay: mean difference (MD) -0.95 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.08 to 1.19, P value = 0.38, low quality evidence; clinical severity score on day two: MD -0.57, 95% CI -2.37 to 1.23, P value = 0.53, low quality evidence; clinical severity score on day three: MD 0.17, 95% CI -1.93 to 2.28, P value = 0.87, low quality evidence). The other three studies compared montelukast for several weeks for preventing post-bronchiolitis symptoms with placebo. We assessed one study as low risk of bias, whereas we assessed the other two studies as having a high risk of attrition bias. Due to the significant clinical heterogeneity in severity of disease, duration of treatment, outcome measurements and timing of assessment, we did not pool the results. Individual analyses of these studies did not show significant differences between the leukotriene inhibitors group and the control group in symptom-free days and incidence of recurrent wheezing. One study of 952 children reported two deaths in the leukotriene inhibitors group: neither was determined to be drug-related. No data were available on the percentage of children requiring ventilation, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. Finally, three studies reported adverse events including diarrhoea, wheezing shortly after administration and rash. No differences were reported between the study groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence does not allow definitive conclusions to be made about the effects of leukotriene inhibitors on length of hospital stay and clinical severity score in infants and young children with bronchiolitis. The quality of the evidence was low due to inconsistency (unexplained high levels of statistical heterogeneity) and imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals, which did not rule out a null effect or harm. Data on symptom-free days and incidence of recurrent wheezing were from single studies only. Further large studies are required. We identified one registered ongoing study, which may make a contribution in the updates of this review.

### Effect of point of care information on inpatient management of bronchiolitis [^114RweWs]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A computerised clinical decision support system (CDSS) may improve the efficiency and efficacy of patient care, in part by facilitating incorporation of clinical evidence into therapeutic decision-making. As with all health care innovations, CDSSs require rigorous evaluation before their widespread use in patient care. A systematic review of 68 controlled trials found improvements in health care practitioner performance with 66% of the innovations, principally in drug dosing and preventive care for treatment of hypertension, diabetes and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Another, more recent systematic review found that successful CDSSs are computerised, provide decision support as part of clinician workflow, provide recommendations rather than just assessments, and provide decision support at the time and location of decision making.

Bronchiolitis was chosen as the context for evaluation of a computer-based CDSS providing medical evidence at the point of care. This virus-induced acute inflammation of the lower respiratory tract is the most common reason for hospitalisation of infants. Over 100,000 children under 1 year of age are hospitalised annually in North America, with an estimated annual health care cost of more than $300,000,000. Bronchiolitis treatment is largely supportive, although therapies (bronchodilators, systemic steroids, and antibiotics) may benefit some patients. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have modified care and improved clinical outcome.

Despite these guidelines, published studies of bronchiolitis treatment often contradict each other, and may be contrary to local management strategies. For instance, supra-infection with bacteria in uncomplicated cases of bronchiolitis is uncommon and the recommendation has been not to routinely use antimicrobials. However, antibiotics are commonly given to many hospitalised infants. Needless antimicrobial therapy has significant care implications, because antibiotics confer potential risks of infection with resistant bacteria, as well as adverse drug reactions. Successful implementation of a clinical evidence CDSS depends upon high quality credible information, ready access within existing tasks, upkeep of the information as research evolves and assessment of physician actions and patient outcomes. These elements were incorporated into this study, wherein point-of-care access to up-to-date clinical evidence regarding bronchiolitis management in hospitalised children was provided through a computerized physician order entry system (CPOE) to medical students and residents.

### New paradigms in acute viral bronchiolitis: is it time to change our approach? [^116EtQZz]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is the most common pediatric acute respiratory infection leading to hospitalization, and it causes a significant healthcare burden worldwide. Current guidelines recommend supportive management after many clinical trials on specific therapies failed to demonstrate benefits. However, several studies in the past decade have revealed that bronchiolitis may not be a homogeneous disease, but instead may constitute an umbrella comprised of different "endotypes" and "phenotypes" based on patient characteristics, etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical presentation. In this extensive review, we summarize the current evidence that several different types of bronchiolitis ("bronchiolitides") coexist, with different short- and long-term consequences on respiratory health and the risk of asthma development. Disease pathobiology, immune response, and clinical characteristics may differ between the two most prevalent viral agents, respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. Recent randomized trials have shown that some subgroups of children may benefit from the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators. These findings also suggest that some children may benefit from individualized therapeutical approaches for viral bronchiolitis rather than following broad recommendations for treating all patients uniformly using only supportive management.

### The treatment of bronchiolitis [^111MkAdg]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is the commonest reason for hospital admission in infancy and the most frequent cause of acute respiratory failure in children admitted to paediatric intensive care units in the UK and North America. The respiratory syncytial virus accounts for most cases of bronchiolitis, however, new virus isolation techniques have led to the discovery of previously unrecognised viruses, including the human metapneumovirus and bocavirus which also play a significant role. The main developments in bronchiolitis management in recent years relate to the use of immunoprophylaxis; a number of other therapies such as the use of heliox are currently being investigated. Supportive therapy remains the mainstay of management with limited or no evidence of benefit for most other pharmacological treatments. This article summarises the current understanding of the different bronchiolitis phenotypes, with a brief description of outcomes and a review of the evidence for the various therapeutic interventions.

Materials and methods

The CTK methods have been described in detail elsewhere. Aspects specifically relevant to bronchiolitis are presented below.

Development of indicators

We searched for national and international CPGs relating to bronchiolitis in children. Ten CPGs were found and 56 recommendations extracted. Five recommendations were excluded because they were guiding statements only with no actions; they used auxiliary verbs such as 'may', 'consider' and 'could' to indicate the recommendation's strength; there was a low likelihood of information being documented in the medical record; or they were out of scope for our purposes (such as structure-level measures).

The 51 candidate recommendations were subjected to a three-round modified Delphi internal review by three clinicians (all paediatricians) involved in CTK, by email. The recommendations passing this process were subjected to further reviews and modifications by 12 paediatricians and two nurses, external to the project, again using a modified Delphi method. External reviewers were recruited via advertisements and communications in relevant medical colleges, and professional associations and networks. The reviews were undertaken on a customised wiki site. For both the internal and external reviews, a modified RAND-UCLA method was used. Additionally, each clinician recorded whether each recommendation was acceptable and feasible to collect, and its level of clinical impact.

During internal and external review, recommendations were excluded due to low acceptability, feasibility or impact; if the concept was covered in other recommendations(s); or rated with a low appropriateness score by reviewers. Of 51 recommendations, 35 were excluded during internal review, with 16 recommendations passed to external review, with all of these retained. These recommendations were re-formatted into 40 medical record audit indicator questions. For the purposes of this study, a clinical indicator was defined as a measurable component of a standard or guideline, with explicit criteria for inclusion, exclusion, time frame and practice setting. For example, a single recommendation that all infants presenting with acute bronchiolitis have six elements of history elicited and recorded (ie, duration and progression of symptoms, presence of apnoeas, etc) was re-formatted into six separate indicator questions (BRON01–BRON06). All indicator questions are shown, with additional details, in online appendix 1.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^115QJaRo]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, as previously mentioned, infants with high-risk conditions have an increased chance of being hospitalised for bronchiolitis. Despite this population experiencing more severe illness and morbidity, they have been excluded quite consistently from clinical studies. From the studies extracted for the purpose of this review, it is clear that a lack of evidence exists pertaining to the management of high-risk patients with bronchiolitis. It highlights the need for evidence-based trials with a particular preference for prospective RCTs. These should explore the above interventions and management techniques in high-risk infants with underlying medical comorbidities requiring ICU management.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — immunodeficiency considerations in pediatric diffuse lung disease (DLD): All patients with DLD should be evaluated for immunodeficiency, because infections can cause DLD; categorizing any detected immunodeficiency as primary, acquired, or due to immunosuppressive medication may help guide evaluation and treatment. Identifying an underlying immunodeficiency does not exclude a chILD diagnosis, and many chILD diagnoses are associated with immunologic dysfunction, including follicular bronchiolitis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, and constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis.

### Epinephrine for bronchiolitis [^115mVjoz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchodilators are commonly used in the management of bronchiolitis. A recent systematic review showed that bronchodilators produce modest short-term benefit among patients with mild or moderate bronchiolitis.

Objectives

To compare epinephrine versus placebo and other bronchodilators in infants less than 2 years of age with bronchiolitis.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches were conducted on the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003), and EMBASE (January 1988 to May 2003). The reference lists of all selected articles were examined for relevant studies. Primary authors were contacted for information on additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they: 1) were RCTs comparing epinephrine with placebo or other bronchodilator; 2) involved children less than two years with bronchiolitis; 3) presented at least one quantitative outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Searches were screened and inclusion criteria applied independently by two reviewers. Quality was assessed by two reviewers using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Data were extracted by one reviewer using a structured form and checked by a second. Separate analyses were conducted for the two types of control groups (placebo, non-epinephrine bronchodilators) and for patient status (inpatient, outpatient).

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included. Quality ranged from one to five (Jadad scale) with a median of three (inter-quartile range: two to three). Allocation concealment was adequate in six trials and unclear in eight. Among inpatient studies comparing epinephrine and placebo (n = five), there was one significant outcome favouring epinephrine: change in clinical score at 60 minutes post-treatment (SMD -0.52; 95% CI -1.00,-0.03). For outpatient studies (n = three), change in clinical score at 60 minutes (SMD -0.81; -1.56,-0.07), change in oxygen saturation at 30 minutes (WMD 2.79;1.50,4.08), respiratory rate at 30 minutes (WMD -4.54;-8.89–0.19), and "improvement" (OR 25.06; 4.95,126.91) favoured epinephrine. Heart rate at 60 minutes post-treatment favoured placebo (WMD 11.80; 5.20,18.40). Admission rates and change in oxygen saturation at 60 minutes post-treatment were not significantly different. For inpatient studies comparing epinephrine and salbutamol (n = four), only one of the seven outcomes was statistically significant: respiratory rate at 30 minutes favoured epinephrine (WMD -5.12; -6.83;-3.41). Among outpatient studies (n = four), change in oxygen saturation at 60 minutes (WMD 1.91; 0.38,3.44), heart rate at 90 minutes (WMD -14.00; -22.95;-5.05), respiratory rate at 60 minutes (WMD -7.76; -11.35,-4.17) post-treatment and "improvement" (OR 4.51; 1.93,10.53) favoured epinephrine. Admission rates were not significantly different (OR 0.40; 0.12,1.33). Pallor at 30 minutes post-treatment was significantly higher in the epinephrine group (OR 6.00; 1.33,27.00).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of epinephrine for the treatment of bronchiolitis among inpatients. There is some evidence to suggest that epinephrine may be favourable to salbutamol and placebo among outpatients. A number of large, multi-centered trials are required to examine the effectiveness of epinephrine compared to placebo and salbutamol for infants presenting to outpatient settings. There is a need to develop a validated, reliable scoring system that is sensitive to important clinical changes in patients with bronchiolitis.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^111UoyEx]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias

The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used by reviewers to screen for the risk of bias within the selected studies and critically appraise these studies. These tools search for bias across distinct domains, with conclusions from each domain revealing the study's risk of bias. Often, in the case of incomplete reporting, conclusions could not be assessed, thus these domains were reported as no information. The outcome of this risk of bias tool is summarised into Supplementary Table 3.

### Assessing the quality of health care in the management of bronchiolitis in Australian children: a population-based sample survey [^117U4r4e]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of respiratory hospitalisation in children aged < 2 years. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) suggest only supportive management of bronchiolitis. However, the availability of CPGs do not guarantee that they are used appropriately and marked variation in the clinical management exists. We conducted an assessment of guideline adherence in the management of bronchiolitis in children at a subnationally representative level including inpatient and ambulatory services in Australia.

Methods

We searched for national and international CPGs relating to management of bronchiolitis in children and identified 16 recommendations which were formatted into 40 medical record audit indicator questions. A retrospective medical record review assessing compliance with the CPGs was conducted across three types of healthcare setting: hospital inpatient admissions, emergency department (ED) presentations and general practice (GP) consultations in three Australian states for children aged < 2 years receiving care in 2012 and 2013.

Results

Purpose-trained surveyors conducted 13979 eligible indicator assessments across 796 visits for bronchiolitis at 119 sites. Guideline adherence for management of bronchiolitis was 77.3% (95% CI 72.6 to 81.5) for children attending EDs, 81.6% (95% CI 78.0 to 84.9) for inpatients and 52.3% (95% CI 44.8 to 59.7) for children attending GP consultations. While adherence to some individual indicators was high, overall adherence to documentation of 10 indicators relating to history taking and examination was poorest and estimated at 2.7% (95% CI 1.5 to 4.4).

Conclusions

The study is the first to assess guideline-adherence in both hospital (ED and inpatient) and GP settings. Our study demonstrated that while the quality of care for bronchiolitis was generally adherent to CPG indicators, specific aspects of management were deficient, especially documentation of history taking.

### Bronchiolitis: from practice guideline to clinical practice [^113gwduM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' clinical practice guideline in bronchiolitis was last updated in 2014 with recommendations to improve care for pediatric patients with bronchiolitis. As most treatments of bronchiolitis are supportive, the guideline minimizes the breadth of treatments previously used and cautions the use of tests and therapies that have a limited evidence base. Emergency physicians must be familiar with the guidelines in order to apply best practices appropriately.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^115JaQjP]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of various agents in the management of this condition. These include the use of corticosteroids, inhaled beta-agonists, epinephrine, hypertonic saline, in addition to others, however, at present there is no single definitive treatment available for bronchiolitis. In turn, various guidelines have been developed for the management of bronchiolitis in low-risk patients. – These serve as a guide for management; however, recommended treatments remain essentially supportive with emphasis placed on ensuring adequate hydration and oxygen supplementation as needed. Despite evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of bronchiolitis, wide variations in practice remain, including marked variability in the inpatient management of bronchiolitis across different sites.

The aim of the present study was to systematically identify and characterise the current body of evidence available on the management options for patients with severe bronchiolitis who required escalation of treatment to a PICU setting. The systematic search was conducted to identify any potential gaps in the current literature pertaining to the management of this patient population.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^112ndHtr]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — oxygen saturation targets and titration in hospitalized children: In hospitalized patients with bronchiolitis, targeting a lower-than-normal oxygen saturation results in less time receiving oxygen therapy and earlier discharge, and in hospitalized pediatric patients with bronchiolitis, evidence supports an oxygenation saturation target of 90–98%. While expert clinicians recommend therapeutic oxygenation targets for respiratory diseases, we could find little evidence that these targets are correct. In hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory diseases other than bronchiolitis, establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is best practice, but a specific target cannot be recommended.

### Bronchiolitis: in-patient focus [^111EYKiB]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is among the most common and serious lower respiratory tract syndromes that affects young children. In developed countries, the case fatality rate among previously healthy children remains low; in contrast, infants with underlying medical conditions, such as immunodeficiency or chronic lung disease, are at risk of prolonged illness and death. Bronchiolitis is associated with significant morbidity among healthy young children. During the winter season, bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization among infants. Each year in the United States, approximately 2 per 100,000 infants die as a result of complications associated with bronchiolitis.

### Bronchiolitis [^111nP7bj]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants, occurring in a seasonal pattern, with highest incidence in the winter in temperate climates and in the rainy season in warmer countries. Bronchiolitis is a common reason for attendance at and admission to hospital.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of prophylactic interventions for bronchiolitis in high-risk children? What are the effects of measures to prevent transmission of bronchiolitis in hospital? What are the effects of treatments for children with bronchiolitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 59 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, bronchodilators (oral, inhaled salbutamol, inhaled adrenaline [epinephrine], hypertonic saline), chest physiotherapy, continuous positive airway pressure, corticosteroids, fluid management, heliox, montelukast, nasal decongestants, nursing interventions (cohort segregation, hand washing, gowns, masks, gloves, and goggles), oxygen, respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulins, pooled immunoglobulins, or palivizumab (monoclonal antibody), ribavirin, or surfactants.

### Bronchiolitis [^113Bczkd]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is the most common cause of admission to hospital for infants in high-income countries. Respiratory syncytial virus accounts for 60–80% of bronchiolitis presentations. Bronchiolitis is diagnosed clinically without the need for viral testing. Management recommendations, based predominantly on high-quality evidence, advise clinicians to support hydration and oxygenation only. Evidence suggests no benefit with use of glucocorticoids or bronchodilators, with further evidence required to support use of hypertonic saline in bronchiolitis. Evidence is scarce in the intensive care unit. Evidence suggests use of high-flow therapy in bronchiolitis is limited to rescue therapy after failure of standard subnasal oxygen only in infants who are hypoxic and does not decrease rates of intensive care unit admission or intubation. Despite systematic reviews and international clinical practice guidelines promoting supportive rather than interventional therapy, universal de-implementation of interventional care in bronchiolitis has not occurred and remains a major challenge.

### Bronchiolitis management in pediatric emergency departments in Australia and new zealand: a PREDICT study [^115yJ38y]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bronchiolitis is the most frequent reason for admission in infants. We set out to compare clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and physician management of bronchiolitis at Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) sites in Australia and New Zealand as a baseline for prospective trials.

Methods

(i) Review of bronchiolitis CPGs from PREDICT sites. (ii) Survey of senior pediatric emergency physicians at PREDICT sites to determine management strategies in bronchiolitis.

Results

All 11 PREDICT sites participated. Ten sites used a specific bronchiolitis CPG. beta-agonists were not recommended unless the child was older or asthma was suspected. Eight sites did not and 2 sites only recommended corticosteroids for older infants in whom asthma was likely. For rehydration, 7 sites recommended intravenous (i.v.) fluids exclusively or in the acute phase, with 3 recommending nasogastric (n.g.) fluids in the recovery phase or for difficult vascular access. Two sites recommended n.g. fluids for moderate and i.v. fluids for severe bronchiolitis. Physician response rate was 78/83 (94%). No medications were used for mild (94%) or moderate (83%) bronchiolitis. Inhaled beta-agonists were used by 5% for moderate and 18% for severe bronchiolitis. Steroids were not used by any physicians for mild or moderate and was used by only 3% for severe bronchiolitis. The preferred mode of rehydration was i.v. in 45%, n.g. in 49%, and either one depending on disease severity in 6%.

Conclusions

Management of bronchiolitis was similar across PREDICT sites. Practice is equally split between i.v. and n.g. rehydration. This reflects a lack of evidence which should be addressed through a multicenter comparative trial.

### The problematic 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines [^1124VGDs]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines do not adequately serve the needs and clinical realities of front-line clinicians caring for undifferentiated wheezing infants and children. This article describes the clinical challenges of evaluating and managing a heterogeneous disease syndrome presenting as undifferentiated patients to the emergency department. Although the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics bronchiolitis guidelines and the multiple international guidelines that they closely mirror have made a good faith attempt to provide clinicians with the best evidence-based recommendations possible, they have all failed to address practical, front-line clinical challenges. The therapeutic nihilism of the guidelines and the dissonance between many of the recommendations and frontline realities have had wide-ranging consequences. Nevertheless, newer evidence of therapeutic options is emerging and forecasts hope for more therapeutically optimistic recommendations with the next revision of the guidelines.

### Retrospective audit of guidelines for investigation and treatment of bronchiolitis: a French perspective [^114ixWzH]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the most recent French bronchiolitis guidelines were published in 2000, there is a current overinvestigation and an overtreatment of infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis in France. In 2012, the Group of Pediatric University Hospitals in Western France ('HUGO') proposed new evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in keeping with the latest international guidelines. We hypothesise that the implementation of these guidelines contributed to the quality improvement of the management of bronchiolitis in our hospital. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of these guidelines on the management of bronchiolitis inpatients.

Methods

This retrospective before/after study design was conducted in the general paediatric unit of a tertiary care French hospital, looking at 1 year before (ie, the winter of 2011–2012) and 1 year after (ie, the winter of 2013–2014) the implementation of the guidelines. Two hundred and eighty bronchiolitis inpatients, all less than 1 year of age, 115 in 2011–2012 and 165 in 2013–2014, were included. The primary outcome we sought to evaluate was the proportion of children administered a diagnostic test associated with a treatment not routinely recommended by the guidelines. As balancing measures, we evaluated the length of stay, the intensive care unit transfer and the readmission rates.

Results

Following implementation of the guidelines, use of any given treatment associated with a diagnostic test was reduced by 66% (p < 0.001). There were major decreases in the use of chest X-ray (86%vs26%, p < 0.001), antibiotics (38%vs13%, p < 0.001) and corticosteroids (10%vs3%, p = 0.011). Balancing measures were not significantly different.

Conclusions

HUGO guidelines were effective at reducing the administration of unnecessary diagnostic tests and medications. This study was the first step in convincing French paediatricians to streamline their practices until updated national guidelines are published.
