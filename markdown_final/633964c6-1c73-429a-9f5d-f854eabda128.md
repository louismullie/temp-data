## Question

Does the menveo vaccine cover tetanus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the Menveo meningococcal vaccine provides protection against tetanus, and if receiving Menveo fulfills tetanus immunization requirements. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which specific product "Menveo" refers to and how it is formulated. Then, I should verify the difference between carrier proteins and target antigens in conjugate vaccines. Next, I will check authoritative labeling and ACIP recommendations to confirm tetanus-related implications. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note any related conjugate vaccines that actually do include tetanus toxoid as a carrier, so we don't overgeneralize.

> Let me first confirm the product identity. Menveo is the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM, meaning the meningococcal serogroup A, C, W, and Y polysaccharides are conjugated to CRM197, a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin used as the carrier protein. This is not a tetanus toxoid–based formulation [^112upt33].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between carrier and antigen, because that's where confusion often arises. In conjugate vaccines, the carrier protein helps elicit a T-dependent immune response to the polysaccharide antigens, but the carrier itself is not the disease antigen being targeted; tetanus toxoid used as a carrier does not confer tetanus protection, and conversely, CRM197 as a carrier does not confer diphtheria protection, even though it is derived from diphtheria toxin [^111E6SRE] [^112c1Vo5].

> I need to check the labeling language carefully. The FDA labeling for Menveo explicitly states it is indicated for active immunization against invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135, and it does not provide tetanus immunity. The product is a meningococcal vaccine only, with no tetanus indication or claims [^111DAYsS] [^112upt33].

> Next, I should review ACIP policy to ensure there's no hidden tetanus utility. ACIP's meningococcal recommendations reiterate that MenACWY-TT (tetanus toxoid conjugate) is licensed for meningococcal disease prevention only and does not replace tetanus-toxoid–containing vaccines or alter their dosing intervals; by extension, Menveo (CRM197 conjugate) likewise has no role in tetanus immunization scheduling and does not count toward tetanus boosters [^111E6SRE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tetanus toxoid conjugates in general. I should confirm whether any meningococcal vaccines actually do use tetanus toxoid and what that means. MenQuadfi (MenACWY-TT) uses tetanus toxoid as the carrier, and some African campaigns with the monovalent group A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac/PsA-TT) produced measurable anti–tetanus toxoid antibody rises, but these effects are considered incidental and are not a substitute for scheduled tetanus immunization in routine programs; importantly, ACIP does not recognize any MenACWY vaccine as a tetanus vaccine [^111E6SRE] [^114ym6Wz] [^112MybQB] [^111E6SRE].

> I should double-check a potential point of confusion. I briefly wondered if the "-TT" suffix on some meningococcal products might imply tetanus coverage, but that would be a mistake; the "-TT" denotes tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein for the meningococcal polysaccharides and still does not convert the product into a tetanus vaccine for clinical scheduling purposes, reinforcing that only dedicated tetanus-toxoid–containing vaccines fulfill tetanus requirements [^111E6SRE] [^112vs5xS].

> Putting this together, I can conclude with confidence that Menveo (MenACWY-CRM) does not cover tetanus and does not contribute toward tetanus immunization requirements. Patients still need standard tetanus-toxoid–containing vaccines (Tdap, Td) on the recommended schedule, and Menveo should be considered solely for meningococcal disease prevention [^111DAYsS] [^112upt33] [^111E6SRE].

---

Menveo (meningococcal ACWY-CRM) **does not provide tetanus protection** because it uses CRM197 (diphtheria protein) as the carrier, not tetanus toxoid [^112upt33]. Only meningococcal vaccines using tetanus toxoid as the carrier (e.g. MenQuadfi) can modestly boost anti-tetanus antibodies, but this is not a substitute for routine tetanus vaccination [^111E6SRE] [^114ym6Wz]. Patients should still receive standard tetanus-containing vaccines (Tdap/Td) per schedule [^114gdgQy].

---

## Carrier proteins in meningococcal vaccines

Meningococcal conjugate vaccines use **carrier proteins** to enhance immunogenicity, especially in infants and young children [^115yxSkX]. The main carrier proteins are **CRM197** (a nontoxic diphtheria toxoid) and **tetanus toxoid** (TT) [^1114Gbc5].

| **Vaccine name** | **Carrier protein** | **Serogroups covered** |
|-|-|-|
| Menveo (MenACWY-CRM) | CRM197 (diphtheria protein) | A, C, W, Y |
| Menactra (MenACWY-D) | Diphtheria toxoid | A, C, W, Y |
| MenQuadfi (MenACWY-TT) | Tetanus toxoid | A, C, W, Y |

---

Menveo uses **CRM197**, not tetanus toxoid, as its carrier protein [^112upt33].

---

## Immunological implications of carrier proteins

Carrier proteins influence **immune responses** to conjugate vaccines:

- **CRM197**: Enhances immunogenicity of meningococcal polysaccharides but does not induce a clinically meaningful anti-tetanus response.
- **Tetanus toxoid**: Can induce modest anti-tetanus antibody responses, but these are not sufficient to replace routine tetanus vaccination [^111E6SRE].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding tetanus protection

There is **no evidence** that Menveo provides clinically significant tetanus protection, as it uses CRM197, not tetanus toxoid [^112upt33]. In contrast, vaccines using tetanus toxoid (e.g. MenQuadfi) may induce modest anti-tetanus responses but are not substitutes for routine tetanus vaccination [^111E6SRE].

---

## Official recommendations and guidelines

ACIP and CDC state that Menveo **does not provide tetanus protection** and does not replace routine tetanus vaccination [^notfound]. Patients should receive standard tetanus-containing vaccines (Tdap or Td) per the recommended schedule [^114gdgQy].

---

## Summary of evidence

- **Menveo's carrier protein**: CRM197 (diphtheria protein), not tetanus toxoid [^112upt33].
- **Tetanus protection**: Menveo does not provide tetanus protection.
- **Routine tetanus vaccination**: Still required per ACIP/CDC guidelines [^111E6SRE].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinicians should ensure patients receive **routine tetanus vaccination** (Tdap or Td) according to the recommended schedule, as Menveo does not provide tetanus protection [^114gdgQy].

---

Menveo **does not provide tetanus protection** because it uses CRM197 as the carrier protein. Patients must still receive routine tetanus-containing vaccines per ACIP/CDC guidelines [^111E6SRE].

NEW MULTIVALENT VACCINES FOR THE MENINGITIS BELT

Because meningococcal epidemics are unpredictable, impose a serious long-term burden on affected households, can severely disrupt health systems, and generate fear and confusion in affected countries, ministries of health and expert policy advisors aspire to prevent non-A epidemics, just as the serogroup A epidemics have been prevented. In response, the partnership between PATH and the Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd (SIIPL) that enabled the development, licensure, and introduction of MenAfriVac is now developing an affordable 5-valent NmCV (NmCV-5) for serogroups A, C, W, X and Y with financial support provided by the UK Department for International Development.

Initial development of the SIIPL NmCV-5 reduced manufacturing costs by improving the efficiency of carrier protein production, polysaccharide fermentation and purification, and chemical conjugation. One important component of this NmCV-5 is serogroup X, against which there are no licensed vaccines. The PATH-SIIPL collaboration has developed a high-yield serogroup X–tetanus toxoid conjugate that is highly immunogenic in preclinical animal models. For the 5-valent vaccine formulation, serogroup A and X polysaccharides are conjugated to tetanus toxoid, and serogroup C, W, and Y polysaccharides are conjugated to recombinant CRM 197, a genetically altered form of diphtheria toxin that lacks toxin activity.

### One or two doses of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine is immunogenic in 9-to 12-month-old children [^112uDqKV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease is highest in infants. A quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) was evaluated in children 9–12 months of age.

Methods

We randomized infants (1:1) to receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at 12 months of age (ACWY-1 group) or 2 doses at 9 and 12 months (ACWY-2). We measured immunogenicity after each dose and 1 year after completing vaccination using human serum bactericidal antibody (hSBA) assays according to prespecified criteria of ≥ 1:8. Local and general symptoms were solicited for 8 days after vaccination. Adverse events were recorded for 6 months after the last dose.

Results

We enrolled and vaccinated 349 subjects, of whom 248 reenrolled at Year 1 for evaluation of antibody persistence. Percentages of subjects with postvaccination hSBA ≥ 1:8 in the ACWY-1 group were 79.5%, 94.6%, 50.8% and 56.1% and in the 2-dose group (ACWY-2) were 88.4%, 100%, 99.3% and 99.3% postdose 2 for serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, respectively. At Year 1, 80.0–99.1% in each group had hSBA ≥ 1:8, except for serogroup A, for which 20.6% (ACWY-1) and 25.9% (ACWY-2) retained hSBA ≥ 1:8. Both schedules were well-tolerated, with no observed increase in reactogenicity after the second dose.

Conclusions

MenACWY-TT was immunogenic when administered as a single dose at 12 months of age, or as 2 doses at 9 and 12 months, and had a clinically acceptable safety profile. Good antibody persistence was observed through 12 months postvaccination after both treatment schedules for serogroups C, W-135, Y.

FFS Arrangements

Most Medicaid program FFS arrangements provided adult vaccination benefits coverage for all or most ACIP-recommended adult immunizations (Figure 1). Twenty-four of 49 FFS arrangements provided coverage for all ACIP-recommended adult immunizations. Forty-eight FFS arrangements covered 1 or more influenza vaccines in addition to Tdap, MMR, varicella, and PPSV23. In contrast, benefits coverage was less common for the 9vHPV vaccine (43 of 49 FFS arrangements), Hib vaccine (37 of 49 FFS arrangements), and zoster vaccine (33 of 49 FFS arrangements).

Figure 1.
Medicaid Program Coverage of All Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)–Recommended Adult Vaccines by Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Managed Care Organization (MCO) Arrangement

Data are from public domain document review and survey. For ACIP-recommended adult immunizations with multiple Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes available, benefits coverage was assumed if any 1 of the associated CPT codes was reported as covered. If a Medicaid program covered at least 1 of 3 selected influenza vaccines (inactivated, live attenuated, or recombinant), the program was considered to cover influenza vaccines. 9vHPV indicates 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine; HepA, hepatitis A vaccine; HepB, hepatitis B vaccine; Hib, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; MenACWY, serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal vaccine; MenB, serogroup B meningococcal vaccine; MMR, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; PCV13, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PPSV23, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; and Tdap, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine.

MCO Arrangements

Thirty-nine of 51 Medicaid programs (76%) covered some proportion of their beneficiaries via MCO arrangements. Because information regarding adult vaccination benefits coverage by individual CPT code for MCO arrangements was unavailable, coverage of the ACIP-recommended adult immunization schedule was evaluated using survey responses from 34 of 39 participating programs. Although adult vaccination benefits coverage varied by individual MCO, 21 programs provided coverage for all ACIP-recommended immunizations. Similar to FFS arrangements, coverage for the 9vHPV vaccine (25 of 34 participating programs), Hib vaccine (25 of 34 participating programs), and zoster vaccine (23 of 34 participating programs) was lower than for other vaccines under MCO arrangements (Figure 1).

### Safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy meningococcal-Naïve children 2–9 years of age: a phase III, randomized study [^111VnH4x]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Meningococcal vaccines have helped to reduce the incidence of IMD to < 1 case per 100,000 population per year in developed countries with established meningococcal vaccine programs. In sub-Saharan Africa, the introduction of the meningococcal serogroup A vaccine has led to the virtual elimination of this serogroup as a cause of epidemic IMD in some countries in the region. Nonetheless, the disease incidence continues to vary geographically overtime, with periodic epidemics/outbreaks caused by different IMD serogroups. The temporal dynamic changes in the disease-causing serogroups highlights the need for meningococcal vaccines that provide protection against a broad range of serogroups.

An investigational quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACYW-TT, Sanofi Pasteur) has been developed for use in individuals ≥ 6 weeks of age. We compared the immunogenicity and safety profile of a single dose of MenACYW-TT with a licensed quadrivalent diphtheria protein (CRM 197) conjugate meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-CRM, Menveo ®, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines Srl; formerly Novartis Vaccines) in children 2–9 years of age in the United States, including Puerto Rico.

RESULTS

Demographics and Participant Disposition

A total of 1016 participants were enrolled and 1011 participants were vaccinated (MenACWY-TT lot A 337, MenACWY-TT lot B 336, MenACWY-DT 338) (Figure 1). A total of 60 participants were excluded from the ATP for immunogenicity cohort: 20 were from MenACWY-TT lot A, 16 were from MenACWY-TT lot B, and 24 were from MenACWY-DT. Reasons for exclusion were similar amongst the 3 groups and were mostly due to participant ineligibility, noncompliance with blood sample schedule, and missing essential serological data. A total of 977 (96.6%) vaccinated participants completed the study and were equally distributed amongst the vaccine groups; the most frequent reasons for noncompletion were loss to follow-up and consent withdrawal.

Figure 1.
Participant disposition.

The 3 vaccine groups were similar for demographic characteristics (Table 1). The mean age of participants was 16.3 years (range, 10–25 years) and varied from 16.2 to 16.4 years amongst the 3 vaccine groups. A total of 58.9% of participants were between 10 and 17 years of age, and 41.1% were between 18 and 25 years of age. Females comprised 51.4% of participants, and participants ranged from 50.3% to 52.1% amongst the vaccine groups. The majority of participants (73.6%–76.0%) were of white-Caucasian/European heritage.

Methods

ACIP provides recommendations for the prevention and control of meningococcal disease in the United States. The ACIP Meningococcal Vaccines Work Group met by teleconference once per month during 2005–2020, except during brief periods of hiatus. Work group membership included voting members of ACIP, representatives of ACIP ex-officio and liaison organizations, and scientific consultants with expertise in public health, vaccinology, medical specialties, vaccine research, and assessments of vaccine efficacy and safety. Work group discussions included topics such as meningococcal disease surveillance and epidemiology and meningococcal vaccine safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, coverage, program feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. Presentations were requested from invited experts, and published and unpublished data were discussed. These data were summarized by the work group and presented to ACIP to help establish recommendations. When evidence was lacking, the recommendations incorporated expert opinion from ACIP. Meeting minutes and information on ACIP membership and conflicts of interest are available on the ACIP website. This report updates and replaces previously published ACIP recommendations for meningococcal vaccines.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was adopted by ACIP in 2010. Recommendations using the GRADE approach include the use of MenACWY oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM 197 conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) among children aged 2–23 months at increased risk for meningococcal disease, use of a MenACWY vaccine among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), all MenB vaccine recommendations, and use of a MenACWY tetanus toxoid vaccine (MenACWY-TT) among persons aged ≥ 2 years. GRADE evidence tables for these recommendations are available. In 2018, ACIP adopted the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) framework to facilitate the assessment and ensure transparency of additional factors considered in developing vaccine recommendations, including target population values, stakeholder acceptability, and feasibility of implementation. Recommendations for MenB booster doses among persons aged ≥ 10 years at increased risk for meningococcal disease and use of MenACWY-TT among persons aged ≥ 2 years were further evaluated using the EtR framework. The EtR frameworks for these recommendations are available. ACIP did not use GRADE or EtR for updates of evidence related to recommendations made before implementation of these approaches.

Meningococcal ACWY vaccine — children with HIV: "All children with HIV age ≥ 2 months should routinely receive the age-appropriate series of the meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) conjugate vaccine (AIII)". For those aged < 2 years, "children with HIV aged < 2 years should be vaccinated according to the age-appropriate multidose schedule with MenACWY-CRM (Menveo)". For those aged ≥ 2 years with no prior doses, they "should receive a primary series of MenACWY conjugate vaccine of two doses given at least 8 weeks apart". For boosters, "children aged < 7 years should get a single dose at 3 years after the primary series and every 5 years thereafter" and "Children aged ≥ 7 years should receive a single dose at 5 years after primary vaccination and every 5 years thereafter".

Among adolescents and adults aged 11–55 years who received a single dose, injection site pain (31%–69%) was the most common local reaction, followed by induration (9%–20%), erythema (3%–20%), and swelling (1%–14%). Myalgia (15%–26%), headache (11%–45%), fatigue or malaise (10%–28%), and diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms (11%–17%) were the most commonly reported systemic adverse events; fever was observed in < 8%. Similar types and rates of adverse events were observed after a booster dose administered 4 years later. In general, MenACWY-D administered simultaneously with HPV vaccine, tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), MenB-FHbp, or typhoid vaccines was well tolerated, although rates of some adverse events (e.g. headache and fatigue) were slightly higher with simultaneous administration compared with MenACWY-D administered alone (,–). Across age groups, whether MenACWY-D was administered alone or simultaneously with other vaccines, adverse events were mild to moderate and typically resolved within 3 days.

Introduction

Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a life-threatening illness caused by the obligate human bacterium, Neisseria meningitidis. IMD is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, with a fatality rate of 8–15%. It is often associated with long-term sequelae amongst survivors, such as neurological complications, hearing loss, loss of limbs and paralysis. The incidence of IMD peaks in infants under 1 year of age with a second smaller peak in incidence observed in adolescents and young adults in many countries. Notably, carriage rates have been observed to be highest in this latter age group.

Of the 12 meningococcal serogroups identified, 6 (A, B, C, W, Y and X) are the causative agent in the majority of cases of IMD worldwide. The dominant serogroup varies by geographical region and fluctuates unpredictably over time. In Western Europe and Canada, meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) outbreaks in the late 1990/early 2000s led to a steep rise in the incidence of IMD, while an increased incidence of MenW has been more recently observed in these countries. In the US, most outbreaks over the past two decades have also been caused by C and more recently B, with a smaller proportion of IMD cases caused by Y and W. Vaccination campaigns with monovalent (MenC) and quadrivalent (MenACWY) polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines have successfully reduced IMD incidence in many countries where this has been implemented. – The recent development of two novel recombinant protein vaccines against MenB offers additional protection against IMD caused by serogroup B.

MenACWY-TT Immunogenicity

Infants and Children

Because MenACWY-TT is currently only licensed for persons aged ≥ 2 years in the United States, immunogenicity and safety data for children aged < 2 years are not presented in this report. Among children who received a single dose at age 2–9 years, the proportions who achieved hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 1 month after vaccination were 86% for serogroup A, 98% for serogroup C, 95% for serogroup W, and 99% for serogroup Y. MenACWY-TT seroresponse rates were demonstrated to be noninferior to those observed for MenACWY-CRM. No data are available on MenACWY-TT administered simultaneously with routine vaccines or on persistence of the immune response to MenACWY-TT among this age group; data will be reviewed as they become available to inform vaccine recommendations.

Adolescents and Adults

One month after a single MenACWY-TT dose among adolescents and adults aged 10–55 years, the proportions who achieved hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 were 94%–96% for serogroup A, 94%–99% for serogroup C, 95%–99% for serogroup W, and 97%–99% for serogroup Y. Among adults aged ≥ 56 years, these proportions were 89%–94%, 75%–90%, 77%–80%, and 81%–92% for serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. Across these age groups, MenACWY-TT seroresponse rates were noninferior to those of the comparator meningococcal vaccines. MenACWY-TT administered simultaneously with HPV and Tdap vaccines in adolescents did not result in reduced immune responses to meningococcal serogroups or tetanus, diphtheria, or HPV antigens. Noninferiority criteria were not met for three pertussis antigens when MenACWY-TT and Tdap were administered simultaneously, although the clinical relevance of this is unclear. No data are available on persistence of the immune response to MenACWY-TT. When available, data will be reviewed to inform booster dose recommendations for persons primed with MenACWY-TT. Among adolescents and adults aged ≥ 15 years primed with MenACWY-D or MenACWY-CRM 4–10 years previously, > 99% achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 across all serogroups at 1 month after booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT.

### Meningococcal vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2020 [^111JJ4dQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Adolescents and Adults

One month after a single MenACWY-CRM dose among adolescents and adults aged 11–75 years, 66%–92% of recipients achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 for serogroup A, 79%–98% for serogroup C, 84%–99% for serogroup W, and 79%–96% for serogroup Y. In one study that reported immunogenicity separately for adults aged ≥ 55 years, those aged 56–65 years had results similar to those aged 19–55 years. Administration of MenACWY-CRM simultaneously with other vaccines did not result in reduced immune responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, or Y or tetanus, diphtheria, HPV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, or rabies antigens (,–). After simultaneous administration of MenACWY-CRM and MenB-4C, a robust immune response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y and to select meningococcal serogroup B strains was observed, although the majority of persons had high prevaccine hSBA titers across serogroups. Noninferiority criteria were not met for two pertussis antigens (i.e. pertussis toxoid and pertactin) when MenACWY-CRM and Tdap were administered simultaneously, although the clinical relevance of this is unclear.

By 12–22 months postvaccination, substantial antibody waning was observed for serogroup A, though the majority of recipients remained seroprotected for serogroups C, W, and Y. After this initial decline, hSBA titers remained relatively stable at 3 and 5 years postvaccination, with 28%–32% of recipients having an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 against serogroup A, 59%–76% against serogroup C, 72%–82% against serogroup W, and 64%–76% against serogroup Y. One month after a single MenACWY-CRM booster dose administered at 3–6 years after the primary dose, ≥ 94% of subjects achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 across all serogroups. Booster vaccination elicited a robust immune response whether MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D was used for the primary dose. By 2 years after the booster dose, the proportion of recipients with an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 decreased to 79% for serogroup A but remained at ≥ 95% for serogroups C, W, and Y.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Statistical Considerations

The primary analysis of immunogenicity used the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity, defined as all evaluable participants (those meeting all eligibility criteria, compliance with protocol procedures, and with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least 1 serogroup for the blood taken 1 month postvaccination (defined as 21–48 days postvaccination). The primary analysis for safety used the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available. For each treatment group and for each antibody at each time point, the GMT and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The proportion and 95% CIs of participants with hSBA titers against prespecified cutoffs (≥ 1:4, ≥ 1:8) and the proportion and 95% CIs of participants with hSBA vaccine responses were also calculated. The primary objective of noninferiority of MenACWY-TT (lot A) compared with MenACWY-DT with respect to the serogroup A, C, W-135, Y vaccine responses were evaluated through computation of the 95% CIs for the difference in the percentage of participants with an hSBA vaccine response (MenACWY-TT lot A minus MenACWY-DT) 1 month postvaccination. Statistical noninferiority of MenACWY-TT was defined as a lower limit of the 95% CI greater than or equal to the predefined clinical limit of −10%. Exploratory immunological analyses included (1) computation of the 95% CIs of the difference in the percentage of participants with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 1 month after vaccination (MenACWY-TT lot A minus MenACWY-DT, MenACWY-TT lot B minus MenACWY-DT, and MenACWY-TT lot A minus MenACWY-TT lot B) and (2) computation of the 95% CIs of the difference in the proportion of participants with hSBA vaccine response 1 month after vaccination (MenACWY-TT lot A minus MenACWY-DT and MenACWY-TT lot B minus MenACWY-DT). In the exploratory analyses, 2 vaccine groups were said to be significantly different for percentages if the 95% CI for the difference in rates did not contain the value 0. Computation of the 95% CIs of the hSBA GMT ratios (ACWY-A over ACWY-DT, ACWY-B over ACWY-DT, and ACWY-A over ACWY-B) were also performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model on the logarithm 10 transformation of the titers including the vaccine group as fixed effect and using the prevaccination (ie, the month 0 blood sampling) logarithm 10 transformation of the titers and the age strata as covariates. Two groups were considered significantly different for GMTs if the 95% CI for the GMT ratio between the 2 groups did not contain the value 1. Results of the exploratory analyses should be interpreted with caution because no adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was made.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^1121xMHA]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunogenicity

Blood samples for immunogenicity analyses were obtained prior to (Day 0) and 30 (+14) days after booster vaccination. A subset of the first 50 participants enrolled into groups 1 (MenACYW-TT primed, MenACYW-TT booster) and 2 (MCV4-CRM primed, MenACYW-TT booster) provided additional post-vaccination samples on Day 6 (± 1 day).

Functional antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y were measured by a serum bactericidal antibodies assay using human complement (hSBA; Global Clinical Immunology, Sanofi, Swiftwater, PA), as described previously. The lower limit of quantification for the hSBA assay was 1:4. Vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, Y and W was defined as hSBA pre-vaccination titer < 1:8 for participants with a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:16; or a ≥ 4-fold increase in titer post-vaccination for participants with a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:8. Vaccine seroprotection was defined as hSBA titers ≥ 1:8.

The primary immunogenicity endpoints of this study were vaccine seroresponse rates against meningococcal serogroups (A, C, W and Y) following a booster dose of MenACYW-TT in participants primed with MenACYW-TT 3–6 years previously, based on hSBA titers pre-booster and 30 days post booster. The secondary immunogenicity endpoints were hSBA seroresponse and seroprotection rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) against serogroups A, C, W and Y in MenACYW-TT- or MCV4-CRM-primed participants, pre- (to evaluate persistence of immune response) and 30 days post-MenACYW-TT booster and, for a subset of participants, at 6 days post booster. In addition, vaccine hSBA seroresponse, seroprotection and GMTs to serogroups A, C, W and Y were determined following MenACYW-TT booster alone or co-administered with MenB-T or 4CMenB.

### Enter B and W: two new meningococcal vaccine programmes launched [^114PU4eu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Laboratory-confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal group W (MenW) disease by age group and epidemiological year in England.

The alarming rise in MenW cases probably reflects the virulence properties of the ST-11 clonal complex. In South America, the MenW CFR was 27%. In the UK, since its arrival, MenW CFR has been more than double (12%) that seen with MenB disease over the same period (< 5%), and similar to that observed with the MenC ST-11 clonal complex outbreak in the UK in the 1990s.

Fortunately an effective vaccine for MenW already exists as part of multicomponent conjugate vaccines that also protect against group A, C, W and Y meningococci (MenACWY). Like the MenC conjugates, these vaccines contain the capsular polysaccharides of these four meningococcal capsular groups chemically conjugated to tetanus toxoid, CRM197 or diphtheria toxoid (diphtheria toxoid conjugate only available in the USA). In February 2015, the Department of Health accepted JCVI's advice that the vaccine should be used to control the rapid increase in the number of MenW cases. From 1st August 2015, the MenACWY conjugate vaccine will be offered to adolescents aged 14–18 years because this age group experiences a high attack rate, and, as with MenC, teenagers and young adults have the highest carriage rates and are considered to be responsible for driving transmission. The JCVI considered it highly likely that vaccinating individuals in this age group will result in wide population protection and eventual control of MenW. Because the MenACWY conjugate vaccine also protects against MenC disease, it will replace the MenC conjugate vaccine currently in the routine adolescent programme from late 2015 to maintain long-term population control of MenC.

†† MenACWY-D should be given either before or at the same time as DTaP to avoid interference with the immune response to meningococcal vaccine in children. MenACWY-D may be given at any time in relation to Tdap or Td.

§§ Because of the high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, children with functional or anatomic asplenia or human immunodeficiency virus infection should not be vaccinated with MenACWY-D (Menactra) before age 2 years to avoid interference with the immune response to PCV. If MenACWY-D is used in a person (of any age) with functional or anatomic asplenia or HIV infection, it should not be administered until at least 4 weeks after completion of all PCV doses.

### Immunogenicity of reduced dose priming schedules of serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine followed by booster at 12 months in infants: open label randomised controlled trial [^111wZnnR]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

In countries where the incidence of invasive MenC disease in infancy has been controlled or practically eliminated after a routine MenC vaccination programme, two MenC infant priming doses could be reduced to a single priming dose without loss of immediate post-booster immunogenicity and without any effect on reactogenicity. Unlike MenC-TT, priming with MenC-CRM or administering the first MenC dose at the age of 12 months does not result in bactericidal antibody that is sustained at 24 months of age above the accepted protective threshold for most young children. Implementation of MenC vaccine prime and boost schedules with MenC tetanus toxoid conjugates seems more likely to induce sustained protection against MenC disease in early childhood. In the absence of any infant MenC vaccine priming doses, the protection provided by just one MenC vaccine dose administered at 12 months of age would strongly rely on the persistence of herd protection, induced by a previous catch up MenC immunisation campaign, which could then be maintained by a booster in adolescence.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years – United States, 2014 [^116GSyzC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

What is already known on this topic?

Routine immunization is recommended for adolescents aged 11–12 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for protection against diseases including pertussis, meningococcal disease, and human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated cancers. During 2006–2013, national coverage with ≥ 1 dose of tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine and ≥ 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine increased annually. Although ≥ 1-dose HPV coverage among females increased during 2007–2011, no change was observed during 2011–2012. However, during 2012–2013 and 2011–2013, ≥ 1-dose HPV coverage among females and males, respectively, increased.

What is added by this report?

During 2013–2014, vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years increased for ≥ 1 dose of Tdap, ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY, and each HPV dose among females and males, with considerable variation in coverage by state. Although HPV vaccination coverage among females increased nationally for the second consecutive year, HPV coverage lags behind Tdap and MenACWY coverage. Seven jurisdictions achieved significant increases in ≥ 1- or ≥ 3-dose HPV vaccination coverage among females during 2013–2014, demonstrating that substantial improvement in HPV vaccination coverage is feasible.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Despite similar percentage point increases in coverage with Tdap and MenACWY vaccines, and ≥ 1 HPV dose among females in 2014, national HPV coverage estimates remain low for adolescents. Differences in coverage estimates by vaccine indicate missed opportunities for administering HPV vaccine at visits when Tdap or MenACWY vaccines are given. Routinely recommending HPV vaccine at ages 11–12 years, during the same visit and with the same emphasis used for other vaccines, is critical. Multifaceted interventions that engage clinicians and other immunization stakeholders and increase community awareness might improve HPV vaccination coverage.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2019 [^113rHLG6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Three vaccines are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of adolescents aged 11–12 years to protect against 1) pertussis; 2) meningococcal disease caused by types A, C, W, and Y; and 3) human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers (1). At age 16 years, a booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended. Persons aged 16–23 years can receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB), if determined to be appropriate through shared clinical decision-making. CDC analyzed data from the 2019 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the United States.* Coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine increased from 68.1% in 2018 to 71.5% in 2019, and the percentage of adolescents who were up to date † with the HPV vaccination series (HPV UTD) increased from 51.1% in 2018 to 54.2% in 2019. Both HPV vaccination coverage measures improved among females and males. An increase in adolescent coverage with ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY (from 86.6% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019) also was observed. Among adolescents aged 17 years, 53.7% received the booster dose of MenACWY in 2019, not statistically different from 50.8% in 2018; 21.8% received ≥ 1 dose of MenB, a 4.6 percentage point increase from 17.2% in 2018. Among adolescents living at or above the poverty level, § those living outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) had lower coverage with ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY and with ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose, and a lower percentage were HPV UTD, compared with those living in MSA principal cities. In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed the way health care providers operate and provide routine and essential services. An examination of Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider ordering data showed that vaccine orders for HPV vaccine; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap); and MenACWY decreased in mid-March when COVID-19 was declared a national emergency (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/91795). Ensuring that routine immunization services for adolescents are maintained or reinitiated is essential to continuing progress in protecting persons and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy meningococcal-Naïve children 2–9 years of age: a phase III, randomized study [^1171fRXx]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive web response system (stratified by the age groups of 2–5 and 6–9 years) to receive a single dose (0.5 mL) of either MenACYW-TT conjugate vaccine or MenACWY-CRM at day 0. Participants, their parents/guardians, and investigators were unaware of treatment assignments throughout the study. The vaccines were administered by an unblinded administrator who was not involved in safety data collection. Serology testing was performed by the sponsor and laboratory personnel who remained blinded to treatment assignments throughout the study.

MenACYW-TT (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) was presented as a liquid solution in single-dose vials; each 0.5 mL dose contained 10 μg of each serogroup (A, C, W, and Y) and approximately 55 μg of tetanus toxoid protein carrier. MenACWY-CRM (GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines Srl; formerly Novartis Vaccines) was presented as a lyophilized powder of the serogroup A vaccine component and a liquid serogroup C, W, and Y vaccine component in 2 separate vials which were combined for a single dose of 0.5 mL. Each dose contained 10, 5, 5, and 5 μg of serogroups A, C, W, and Y oligosaccharide, respectively, and approximately 32.7–64.1 μg of CRM 197 protein carrier. Both vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the right or left deltoid region.

### Do dose numbers matter? evaluation of differing infant and toddler meningococcal C conjugate vaccine programs in Canadian children [^115m4xcm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The diversity of Canadian infant meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccine programs is unique among countries providing MenC vaccines and offers a valuable opportunity to determine the optimal vaccine program. This longitudinal study assessed differences in seroprotection by 3 different vaccine schedules in children two years after receiving either 1 toddler MenC vaccine dose (1 dose), 1 infant and 1 toddler dose (2 doses), or 2 infant and 1 toddler MenC vaccine dose (3 doses).

Methods

Three similar cohorts of healthy infants from 1, 2 and 3 dose program areas were enrolled before to their 12 month toddler dose and vaccinated with MenC-tetanus toxoid (MenC-TT) conjugate vaccine. Sera obtained 2 years later were assayed for serogroup C bactericidal activity using standardized procedures with rabbit as the exogenous complement source. Serum bactericidal activity titers ≥ 1:8 were considered protective.

Results

Results were available for 384 children. Rates of seroprotection at 36 months of age were significantly different between the 1 and 3 dose programs, but confidence intervals overlapped between the 1 and 2 dose programs and between the 2 and 3 dose programs: 1 dose 92% (95% confidence interval: 86%-96%) versus 99% (95%-100%) with 2 doses and 100% (97%-100%) with 3 doses. Geometric mean titers were significantly different at 12.1 (10.8–13.5), 32.4 (28.9–36.2) and 50.6 (45.7–55.9) in the 1, 2 and 3 dose programs, respectively.

Conclusions

At 36 months of age, evidence of seroprotection remained for greater than 90% of participants. Our results indicate that 1 toddler dose or 1 infant plus 1 toddler dose with MenC-TT vaccine provides seroprotection against MenC disease in early childhood.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The primary study objective was to demonstrate the noninferiority of MenACWY-TT (lot A) when compared with MenACWY-DT in terms of the percentage of participants with a serum bactericidal antibody response against each serogroup 1 month postvaccination. Vaccine response was defined as a serum bactericidal titer of at least 1:8 in participants initially seronegative (titer < 1:4) and as a 4-fold increase in titer in participants initially seropositive (titer ≥ 1:4). Secondary objectives included evaluation of the immune response by comparing geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) of the 3 vaccines; comparison of MenACWY-TT lots A and B; and evaluation of local and general solicited symptoms, unsolicited adverse events (AEs), new onsets of chronic illness, and serious AEs.

Study Procedures

After obtaining informed consent, a medical history was taken, a physical examination was performed, and 10 mL of blood was obtained by venipuncture for baseline serology. After a urine pregnancy test (in females of childbearing potential), participants were randomly allocated to receive a single dose of 0.5 mL of MenACWY-DT or 1 of the 2 lots of MenACWY-TT intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm. Randomization was performed at GlaxoSmithKline using MATEX, a program developed for use in the Statistical Analysis System software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for center and age strata (10 through 17 years and 18 through 25 years). The 2 vials of the 2 lots of MenACWY-TT differed in appearance and required reconstitution before injection; MenACWY-DT was supplied in a ready-to-administer liquid. Therefore, to maintain blinding, vaccine preparation and injection was performed by study personnel not otherwise involved in study evaluation procedures (observer blind). A second visit was scheduled 1 month postvaccination for repeat blood sampling for antibody determination.

Immunogenicity

At baseline, 79 (25.5%) of 310 participants in the MenACWY-TT lot A group, 84 (27.2%) of 309 in the MenACWY-TT lot B group, and 89 (29.1%) of 306 participants in the MenACWY-DT group were seropositive for MenA antibody. For MenC antibody, 175 (60.8%) of 288 in the MenACWY-TT lot A group, 188 (65.7%) of 286 in the MenACWY lot B group, and 197 (68.2%) of 289 in the MenACWY-DT group were seropositive. For MenW-135 antibody, 99 (33.8%) of 293 in the MenACWY-TT lot A group, 98 (33.8%) of 290 in the MenACWY-TT lot B group, and 102 (34.1%) of 299 in the MenACWY-DT group were seropositive. For MenY antibody, 215 (72.6%) of 296 in the MenACWY-TT lot A group, 224 (73.2%) of 306 in the MenACWY-TT lot B group, and 234 (77.0%) of 304 in the MenACWY-DT group were seropositive. The proportion of participants in each vaccine group with a vaccine response against the 4 serogroups is depicted in Table 3. Vaccine response rates were consistently higher in participants who were initially seronegative at baseline (data not shown). The noninferiority of MenACWY-TT (lot A) compared with MenACWY-DT was demonstrated in terms of the percentage of participants with a vaccine response as measured by hSBA against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y 1 month after vaccination. The difference in vaccine response rate (MenACWY-TT lot A minus MenACWY-DT) was 6.01% (95% CI −1.45 to 13.44) for MenA, 0.95% (−6.10 to 8.00) for MenC, 6.95% (−0.76 to 14.59) for MenW-135, and 12.21% (4.17–20.10) for MenY, all above the noninferiority threshold for the lower limit of the 95% CI of −10%. In the exploratory analyses, a statistically significantly higher vaccine response rate was observed for MenACWY-TT lot A compared with MenACWY-DT for hSBA Men Y and for MenACWY-TT lot B compared with MenACWY-DT for hSBA MenW-135 and MenY. No statistically significant differences were detected for vaccine response between any of the serogroups between MenACWY-TT lots A and B.

The primary endpoint of the sufficiency of the vaccine seroresponse to serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 30 following a booster dose of MenACYW-TT alone was achieved in Group 1 and 2 participants (Table 2). At 30 days after a booster dose of MenACYW-TT, seroresponse was seen in > 93% of participants across serogroups, regardless of the priming vaccination (Table 2).

On Day 30 after MenACYW-TT booster vaccination, nearly all participants demonstrated hSBA vaccine seroprotection against each serogroup in Groups 1 and 2 (serogroup A, 99.4% [95% CI 96.8, 100] and 99.4% [95% CI 96.9, 100]; serogroup C, 100.0% [95% CI 97.9, 100] and 100% [95% CI 97.9, 100]; serogroup W, 100% [95% CI 97.9, 100] and 100% [95% CI 97.9, 100]; and serogroup Y, 100% [95% 97.9, 100] and 100% [95% 97.9, 100], respectively). Day 30 GMTs were also comparable between Group 1 and Group 2 for serogroups A, W and Y, with higher GMTs for serogroup C in Group 1 (Table 3).

### Immunogenicity and safety of an investigational quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in healthy adolescents and young adults 10 to 25 years of age [^111pFSnj]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

An investigational quadrivalent Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) has been developed to expand available options for vaccination against invasive meningococcal disease.

Methods

A total of 784 healthy adolescents and young adults 11 to 25 years of age were randomized (3:1) to receive a single dose of the MenACWY-TT vaccine or a licensed MenACWY diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-DT). An additional nonrandomized group of 88 subjects 10 years of age received the MenACWY-TT vaccine only (MenACWY-TT/10). Immunogenicity was assessed 1 month postvaccination by human complement serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) for all serogroups. Solicited local and general symptoms were recorded for 8 days postvaccination and safety outcomes for 6 months.

Results

One month postvaccination, 81.9% to 96.1% of subjects had hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 in the MenACWY-TT group compared with 70.7% to 98.8% in the MenACWY-DT group. Exploratory analyses showed the proportion of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 to be higher in the MenACWY-TT group than in the MenACWY-DT group for serogroups A, W-135, and Y. GMTs adjusted for age strata and baseline titer 1 month postvaccination were higher in the MenACWY-TT group than in the MenACWY-DT group for all 4 serogroups. The percentage of subjects reporting solicited local and general symptoms of any or Grade 3 severity or serious adverse events was similar between the 2 groups. Immune response and reactogenicity in the MenACWY-TT/10 group was similar to that in the MenACWY-TT group, except for higher hSBA-MenA GMTs in the MenACWY-TT/10 group.

Conclusions

The investigational MenACWY-TT vaccine was immunogenic in adolescents and young adults, with an acceptable safety profile.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This was a randomized, observer-blinded, multicentered, phase 2 clinical trial conducted in 33 centers in Canada and the United States between August 2010 and March 2011. Healthy individuals between 10 and 25 years of age were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 lots of MenACWY-TT or to MenACWY-DT. The study was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation principles of Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans. The protocol received ethics approval at each participating center; written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parent or legal guardian (ClinicalTrials. Gov NCT01165242).

Study Participants

Healthy males and females from 10 to 25 years of age, inclusive, were eligible to participate in the study. Individuals were excluded from participation for the following reasons: if they had used any other investigational drug or vaccine within the previous 30 days; if they were receiving immunosuppressive medication or had an immunocompromising condition; if they had previously received a meningococcal vaccine or had a history of meningococcal infection; if they had received tetanus toxoid containing vaccine within the previous month; if they had an allergy to any of the vaccine components; if they had received immunoglobulin or blood products within the 3 previous months or planned administration during the study period; if they were female and pregnant, planning to become pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to use effective contraceptive during the study; if they had a bleeding disorder; if they had a serious chronic infection or congenital defect; if they had any neurological disorder; or if they had an acute illness at the time of enrollment.

Vaccines

The MenACWY-TT investigational vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium) contained in each 0.5 mL dose 5 µg of each polysaccharide antigen (serogroup A, C, W-135, Y) conjugated to a total of approximately 44 µg tetanus toxoid. Two lots of MenACWY-TT were included in the study: lot A had 68% and lot B had 92% O-acetylation of the MenA polysaccharide, respectively. The MenACWY-DT control vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) contained in each 0.5 mL dose 4 µg of each of the 4 meningococcal serogroup polysaccharides (A, C, W-135, Y) conjugated to a total of approximately 48 µg of diphtheria toxoid.

### Higher tetanus toxoid immunity 2 years after PsA-TT introduction in Mali [^115Hvd37]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Our evidence suggests that polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines containing TT such as PsA-TT boost tetanus immunity and should be considered bivalent vaccines. Introduction of these vaccines in widespread population campaigns can help increase tetanus immunity across age groups not typically targeted for TT-containing vaccines or when coverage with TT vaccines is suboptimal. Recognition of this added benefit of PsA-TT could inform future vaccination strategies in resource-limited settings where maintaining high tetanus immunity, in addition to preventing meningococcal disease, is a priority.

Introduction

Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening invasive infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine administration of a single dose of quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) to persons at age 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. ACIP recommends a 2-dose serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) series for persons aged 16–23 years, based on shared clinical decision-making, to provide short-term protection against meningococcal disease caused by most serogroup B strains. ACIP also recommends routine vaccination with MenACWY (for persons aged ≥ 2 months) and MenB (for persons aged ≥ 10 years) who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease caused by the serogroups covered by each vaccine (Box).

Existing Meningococcal Vaccination Recommendations * — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2024

In October 2023, a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp [Penbraya, Pfizer Inc.]) was licensed for use in persons aged 10–25 years. MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp contains the same components as those in two existing meningococcal vaccines: 1) N. meningitidis polysaccharide groups A, C, W, and Y conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier protein (MenACWY-TT * [Nimenrix, Pfizer Inc.], a non–U.S.-licensed vaccine), and 2) two recombinant lipidated factor H–binding protein (FHbp) variants from N. meningitidis serogroup B (MenB-FHbp [Trumenba, Pfizer Inc.]). This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides clinical guidance for the use of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp.

Meningococcal Vaccines

Three quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccines are currently licensed and available in the United States: 1) meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-D) (Menactra); 2) meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM 197 conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) (Menveo); and 3) meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) (MenQuadfi) (Table 1). Additional information is available in the package inserts.

In addition, two serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines are licensed and available in the United States: 1) MenB-FHbp (Trumenba) and 2) MenB-4C (Bexsero) (Table 1). MenB-FHbp consists of two purified recombinant lipidated FHbp antigens, one from each FHbp subfamily (A and B). MenB-4C consists of three recombinant proteins (neisserial adhesin A [NadA], factor H binding protein [FHbp] fusion protein from subfamily B, and neisserial heparin binding antigen [NhbA] fusion protein) and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) containing outer membrane protein porin A (PorA) serosubtype P1.4. Additional information on MenB vaccines is available in the package inserts.

Two additional licensed meningococcal vaccines are no longer available in the United States: 1) a quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) (Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135) and 2) a combined Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal serogroups C and Y conjugate vaccine (Hib-MenCY-TT) (MenHibrix).

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^111jH9Zy]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of tetanus toxoid-conjugate quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MenACYW-TT), alone or co-administered with MenB vaccine, were assessed in healthy 13–25-year olds who received MenACYW-TT or a CRM-conjugate vaccine (MCV4-CRM) 3–6 years earlier.

Methods

This phase IIIb open-label trial (NCT04084769) evaluated MenACYW-TT-primed participants, randomized to receive MenACYW-TT alone or with a MenB vaccine, and MCV4-CRM-primed participants who received MenACYW-TT alone. Functional antibodies against serogroups A, C, W and Y were measured using human complement serum bactericidal antibody assay (hSBA). The primary endpoint was vaccine seroresponse (post-vaccination titers ≥ 1:16 if pre-vaccination titers < 1:8; or a ≥ 4-fold increase if pre-vaccination titers ≥ 1:8) 30 days post booster. Safety was evaluated throughout the study.

Results

The persistence of the immune response following primary vaccination with MenACYW-TT was demonstrated. Seroresponse after MenACYW-TT booster was high regardless of priming vaccine (serogroup A: 94.8% vs 93.2%; C: 97.1% vs 98.9%; W: 97.7% vs 98.9%; and Y; 98.9% vs 100% for MenACWY-TT-primed and MCV4-CRM-primed groups, respectively). Co-administration with MenB vaccines did not affect MenACWY-TT immunogenicity. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

MenACYW-TT booster induced robust immunogenicity against all serogroups, regardless of the primary vaccine received, and had an acceptable safety profile.

Impact

A booster dose of MenACYW-TT induces robust immune responses in children and adolescents primed with MenACYW-TT or another MCV4 (MCV4-DT or MCV4-CRM), respectively.
Here, we demonstrate that MenACYW-TT booster 3–6 years after primary vaccination induced robust immunogenicity against all serogroups, regardless of the priming vaccine (MenACWY-TT or MCV4-CRM), and was well tolerated.
Persistence of the immune response following previous primary vaccination with MenACYW-TT was demonstrated.
MenACYW-TT booster with MenB vaccine co-administration did not affect MenACWY-TT immunogenicity and was well tolerated.
These findings will facilitate the provision of broader protection against IMD particularly in higher-risk groups such as adolescents.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^112mZw6v]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Participants who had previously received a priming dose of MenACYW-TT (MenACYW-TT primed) were randomized 2:1:1 to receive a booster dose of MenACYW-TT either alone (Group 1), or co-administered with a single dose of a licensed MenB vaccine, MenB-T (Trumenba®, Pfizer, Philadelphia; Group 3) or 4CMenB (Bexsero, GSK Vaccines, Sovicille, Italy; Group 4). Participants who had previously received a priming dose of MCV4-CRM were assigned to receive a booster dose of MenACYW-TT vaccine alone (Group 2). Only laboratory technicians were blinded to treatment assignment.

The booster dose of MenACYW-TT was administered intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid muscle of the arm. Each MenACYW-TT dose was presented in 0.5 mL of saline solution containing 10 μg of each meningococcal capsular polysaccharide serogroups A, C, Y and W, and approximately 55 μg of tetanus toxoid protein carrier. MenB-T and 4CMenB were administered IM into the deltoid muscle of the opposite arm to that used for MenACYW-TT administration. Each MenB-T dose was presented in 0.5 mL containing factor H binding protein (fHBP) subfamily A, fHBP subfamily B, adsorbed on AIPO 4. Each 4CMenB dose was presented as 0.5 mL containing recombinant N. meningitidis group B Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen, group B Neisseria adhesin A protein, group B fHbp fusion protein and outer membrane vesicles from N. meningitidis group B strain NZ98/254 adsorbed on Al(OH) 3. Second and third (if applicable) MenB doses were offered 30 and 180 days after the first MenB dose, respectively, in line with the US FDA-approved schedules for the respective MenB vaccines. These vaccinations were performed outside of study procedures and were not described in the study protocol.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a pentavalent meningococcal ABCWY vaccine in adolescents and young adults: an observer-blind, active-controlled, randomised trial [^1118ovCJ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

Meningococcal serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y cause nearly all meningococcal disease, and comprehensive protection requires vaccination against all five serogroups. We aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a pentavalent MenABCWY vaccine comprising two licensed vaccines-meningococcal serogroup B-factor H binding protein vaccine (MenB-FHbp) and a quadrivalent meningococcal serogroup ACWY tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT)-compared with two doses of MenB-FHbp and a single dose of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroup ACWY CRM 197 -conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) as the active control. We previously reported the primary safety and immunogenicity data relating to the two-dose MenB-FHbp schedule. Here we report secondary outcomes and ad-hoc analyses relating to MenABCWY immunogenicity and safety.

Methods

We did an observer-blind, active-controlled trial at 68 sites in the USA, Czech Republic, Finland, and Poland. Healthy individuals (aged 10–25 years) who had or had not previously received a MenACWY vaccine were randomly assigned (1:2) using an interactive voice or web-based response system, stratified by previous receipt of a MenACWY vaccine, to receive 0.5 mL of MenABCWY (months 0 and 6) and placebo (month 0) or MenB-FHbp (months 0 and 6) and MenACWY-CRM (month 0) via intramuscular injection into the upper deltoid. All individuals were masked to group allocation, except staff involved in vaccine dispensation, preparation, and administration; and protocol adherence. Endpoints for serogroups A, C, W, and Y included the proportion of participants who achieved at least a four-fold increase in serum bactericidal antibody using human complement (hSBA) titres between baseline and 1 month after each vaccination. For serogroup B, secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who achieved at least a four-fold increase in hSBA titres from baseline for each of four primary test strains and the proportion of participants who achieved titres of at least the lower limit of quantitation against all four test strains combined at 1 month after the second dose. Endpoints for serogroups A, C, W, and Y were assessed in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one vaccine dose and had at least one valid and determinate MenB or serogroup A, C, W, or Y assay result before vaccination up to 1 month after the second dose, assessed in ACWY-experienced and ACWY-naive participants separately. Secondary endpoints for serogroup B were analysed in the evaluable immunogenicity population, which included all participants in the mITT population who were randomly assigned to the group of interest, received all investigational products as randomly assigned, had blood drawn for assay testing within the required time frames, had at least one valid and determinate MenB assay result after the second vaccination, and had no important protocol deviations; outcomes were assessed in both ACWY-experienced and ACWY-naive populations combined. Non-inferiority of MenABCWY to MenACWY-CRM and MenB-FHbp was determined using a -10% non-inferiority margin for these endpoints. Reactogenicity and adverse events were assessed among all participants who received at least one vaccine dose and who had available safety data. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03135834, and is complete.

Findings

Between April 24 and November 10, 2017, 1610 participants (809 MenACWY-naive; 801 MenACWY-experienced) were randomly assigned: 544 to receive MenABCWY and placebo (n = 272 MenACWY-naive; n = 272 MenACWY-experienced) and 1066 to receive MenB-FHbp and MenACWY-CRM (n = 537 MenACWY-naive; n = 529 MenACWY-experienced). Among MenACWY-naive or MenACWY-experienced MenABCWY recipients, 75.5% (95% CI 69.8–80.6; 194 of 257; serogroup C) to 96.9% (94.1–98.7; 254 of 262; serogroup A) and 93.0% (88.4–96.2; 174 of 187; serogroup Y) to 97.4% (94.4–99.0; 224 of 230; serogroup W) achieved at least four-fold increases in hSBA titres against serogroups ACWY after dose 1 or 2, respectively, in ad-hoc analyses. Additionally, 75.8% (71.5–79.8; 320 of 422) to 94.7% (92.1–96.7; 396 of 418) of MenABCWY and 67.4% (64.1–70.6; 563 of 835) to 95.0% (93.3–96.4; 782 of 823) of MenB-FHbp recipients achieved at least four-fold increases in hSBA titres against MenB strains after dose 2 in secondary analyses; 79.9% (334 of 418; 75.7–83.6) and 74.3% (71.2–77.3; 605 of 814), respectively, achieved composite responses. MenABCWY was non-inferior to MenACWY-CRM (single dose) and to MenB-FHbp in ad-hoc analyses based on the proportion of participants with at least a four-fold increase in hSBA titres from baseline and (for MenB-FHbp only) composite responses. Reactogenicity events after vaccination were similarly frequent across groups, were mostly mild or moderate, and were unaffected by MenACWY experience. No adverse events causing withdrawals were related to the investigational product. Serious adverse events were reported in four (1.5%; 0.4–3.7) MenACWY-naive individuals in the MenABCWY group versus six (2.2%; 0.8–4.8) among MenACWY-experienced individuals in the MenABCWY group and 14 (1.3%; 0.7–2.2) in the active control group (MenACWY-experienced and MenACWY-naive individuals combined); none of these were considered related to the investigational product.

Interpretation

MenABCWY immune responses were robust and non-inferior to MenACWY-CRM and MenB-FHbp administered separately, and MenABCWY was well tolerated. The favourable benefit-risk profile supports further MenABCWY evaluation as a simplified schedule compared with current adolescent meningococcal vaccination programmes.

2015 FDA licensed MenB-4C as a 2-dose series for persons aged 10–25 years. ACIP recommended persons at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease receive a MenB series, and persons aged 16–23 years were recommended to be vaccinated with a MenB series on the basis of shared clinical decision-making.

2016 FDA licensed MenB-FHbp as a 2-dose series for persons aged 10–25 years.

2016 ACIP recommended persons with HIV infection be routinely vaccinated with a 2-dose MenACWY primary series.

2017 ACIP updated its recommendations for use of MenB-FHbp following a change in licensure that allowed both a 2- and 3-dose series. Distribution of MPSV4 and Hib-MenCY-TT was discontinued in the United States.

2019 ACIP recommended that persons with certain medical conditions and microbiologists routinely exposed to Neisseria meningitidis isolates receive a MenB booster dose 1 year after primary series completion, then every 2–3 years thereafter. During an outbreak, a single MenB booster dose was recommended if it had been ≥ 1 year since primary series completion (interval of ≥ 6 months may be considered if recommended by public health officials).

2020 FDA licensed MenACWY-TT for persons aged ≥ 2 years.

### Technical development of a new meningococcal conjugate vaccine [^1135NYcm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background. Group A Neisseria meningitidis has been a major cause of bacterial meningitis in the sub-Saharan region of Africa in the meningitis belt. Neisseria meningitidis is an encapsulated pathogen, and antibodies against the capsular polysaccharide are protective. Polysaccharide–protein conjugate vaccines have proven to be highly effective against several different encapsulated bacterial pathogens. Purified polysaccharide vaccines have been used to control group A meningococcal (MenA) epidemics with minimal success.

Methods. A monovalent MenA polysaccharide–tetanus toxoid conjugate was therefore developed. This vaccine was developed by scientists working with the Meningitis Vaccine Project, a partnership between PATH and the World Health Organization.

Results. A high-efficiency conjugation method was developed in the Laboratory of Bacterial Polysaccharides in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and transferred to the Serum Institute of India, Ltd, which then developed methods for purification of the group A polysaccharide and used its tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein to produce the now-licensed, highly effective MenAfriVac conjugate vaccine.

Conclusions. Although many years of application of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines have had minimal success in preventing meningococcal epidemics in the meningitis belt of Africa, our collaborative efforts to develop a MenA conjugate vaccine yielded a safe and highly effective vaccine.

A total of 99% (98/99) of healthy toddlers aged 12–23 months had protective anti-TT concentrations at baseline; by visit 3 and throughout the remainder of this study, this was at 100%. Figure 2 illustrates the anti-TT IgG GMCs by vaccine group. Primary vaccination with either PsA-TT or Hib-TT noticeably boosted anti-TT IgG GMCs, whereas no increase was seen following vaccination with ACWY vaccine. At 4 weeks after primary vaccination, anti-TT IgG GMC was significantly higher in the PsA-TT and Hib-TT groups than in ACWY group (P < .0001 for both PsA-TT vs ACWY and Hib-TT vs ACWY). Ten months following vaccination, anti-TT IgG GMCs had declined but remained significantly higher (P < .0001 for both PsA-TT vs ACWY and Hib-TT vs ACWY) in the 2 conjugate vaccine groups than the ACWY vaccine group. Revaccination with either PsA-TT or Hib-TT in those primed with PsA-TT or Hib-TT restored levels to that following the primary vaccination.

Effectiveness of MenACWY Vaccines

Overall vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of MenACWY-D against meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, W, or Y among adolescents in the United States is estimated at 69% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%–80%) in the 8 years after vaccination: 77% (95% CI: 57%–88%) against serogroup C and 51% (95% CI: 1%–76%) against serogroup Y. Effectiveness was 79% (95% CI: 49%–91%) in the first year but decreased to 69% (95% CI: 44%–83%) 1 to < 3 years postvaccination and 61% (95% CI: 25%–79%) 3 to < 8 years postvaccination. No data are available on the effectiveness of MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-TT.

Vaccination and Meningococcal Disease Incidence

Measuring the association between adolescent MenACWY vaccination on rates of meningococcal disease has been challenging because of the low and decreasing incidence of meningococcal disease among all age groups. However, from MenACWY introduction through 2017, adolescents experienced the greatest percentage decreases (> 90%) in meningococcal disease incidence due to serogroups C, W, or Y combined compared with other age groups. In the setting of 85% coverage with at least 1 dose of MenACWY-D or MenACWY-CRM among U.S. adolescents aged 13–17 years and 44% coverage with at least 2 doses among adolescents aged 17 years by 2017, a twofold to threefold increase in the rate of decline in incidence was observed during the postvaccination period compared with the prevaccination period among adolescents, suggesting that vaccination with MenACWY-D or MenACWY-CRM is associated with reductions in disease rates in adolescents. No data are available for MenACWY-TT.

### Vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-national immunization survey-teen, United States, 2022 [^114Jf2mK]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that children aged 11–12 years receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV vaccine can be started at age 9 years). A booster dose of MenACWY is recommended at age 16 years, and using shared clinical decision-making, adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years may also receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB). ACIP also recommends that adolescents stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, * acquire any missed childhood vaccines (catch-up vaccination), and receive an annual influenza vaccine †. Results from 2021 National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) revealed declines in MenACWY § and Tdap coverage among adolescents born in 2008; these persons were due for their routine adolescent vaccines in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing assessment of adolescent vaccination coverage can help guide progress in implementation of ACIP recommendations and identify populations and areas with low coverage.

### Comparison of the safety and immunogenicity of a novel quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine and a marketed quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine in healthy individuals 10–25 years of age [^115NGK1B]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Universal immunization of adolescents against meningococcal disease with a quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) conjugate vaccine is recommended in a number of countries.

Methods

In a randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, multicenter trial, 1016 participants, 10–25 years of age, were randomly allocated 1:1:1 to receive a single dose of 1 of 2 lots of an investigational tetanus toxoid‐conjugated MenACWY vaccine (MenACWY‐TT) or a marketed diphtheria toxoid‐conjugated MenACWY vaccine (MenACWY‐DT). The primary outcome was the noninferiority of the vaccine response after MenACWY‐TT (lot A) compared with MenACWY‐DT for all 4 serogroups. Vaccine response was defined as a postvaccination human serum bactericidal antibody (hSBA) titer against each of the serogroups of at least 1:8 in persons initially seronegative (< 1:4) or as a 4‐fold increase in titer pre‐ to postvaccination in persons initially seropositive (≥ 1:4). Adverse events (AEs) after immunization were measured 4 and 31 days postvaccination.

Results

The mean age of participants was 16.3 years; 977 (96.6%) completed the study. The noninferiority of MenACWY‐TT (lot A) to the control vaccine in terms of the percentage of participants with hSBA vaccine response was demonstrated for each serogroup. Vaccine response rates ranged from 51.0% to 82.5% for the 4 serogroups after MenACWY‐TT (both lots) compared with 39.0%–76.3% for the 4 serogroups after MenACWY‐DT. Pain was the most common injection‐site reaction reported by 50.8%–55.4% across the 3 groups. Fatigue and headache were the most common systemic solicited AEs, reported by 27.3%–29.2% and 25.5%–26.4%, respectively.

Conclusions

Tetanus toxoid‐conjugated MenACWY vaccine was well tolerated and elicited an immune response that was noninferior to that of a marketed MenACWY‐DT (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01165242).

In recent years, conjugate vaccines that link the polysaccharides on the outer surface of bacterial pathogens to protein carriers such as tetanus toxoid (TT) have been developed to protect against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other pathogens. Conjugate bacterial vaccines have markedly improved prevention and control efforts beyond results obtained with polysaccharide vaccines alone. Conjugate vaccines have had significantly greater impact than polysaccharide vaccines because the presence of a carrier protein transforms the T-cell–independent immune response into a T-cell–dependent response, inducing immunologic memory and a strong immune response even among infants. In addition, meningococcal, pneumococcal, and Hib conjugate vaccines have been shown to effectively prevent the acquisition of nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine strains. The 2010 introduction of an affordable group A meningococcal polysaccharide–TT protein conjugate vaccine, PsA-TT, or MenAfriVac, through mass vaccination campaigns targeting individuals aged 1–29 years in the African meningitis belt, has led to a dramatic decrease in group A meningococcal disease. In addition to 10 µg of group A polysaccharide, PsA-TT contains 10–33 µg of TT, a level similar to other TT-containing vaccines. As a result, PsA-TT may boost immunity to tetanus in populations, adding benefit beyond prevention of meningococcal disease. Boosting tetanus immunity would be especially beneficial in resource-limited settings where tetanus incidence is highest and in areas where not all individuals have had prior exposure to sufficient doses of TT-containing vaccines to maintain immunity.

### Meningococcal vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2020 [^1156kur6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Among toddlers receiving a 2-dose primary series at ages 12 and 15 months, 85% achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 against serogroup A and ≥ 96% against serogroups C, W, and Y at 1 month after the primary series. In another study in which MenACWY-D was administered at ages 12 and 18 months, ≥ 96% achieved rSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for all serogroups. In this study, administration of MenACWY-D simultaneously with routine vaccines did not result in reduced immune responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, or Y or tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, poliovirus, or H. influenzae type b antigens.

Among children aged 2–10 years, the rate of seroresponse (defined as a greater than fourfold rise in hSBA or a titer ≥ 1:8 among persons with baseline titers < 4) was highest for serogroup A (80%) and lower for serogroups C, W, and Y (42%–57%) at 1 month after a single dose. Studies using rSBA demonstrated a higher proportion of seroresponse across serogroups (≥ 86%) using different thresholds (either a greater than fourfold rise in titers among persons with baseline titers < 1:8 or a titer ≥ 1:8). Among children aged 4–6 years, administration of MenACWY-D simultaneously with routine vaccines did not result in reduced immune response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, or W or diphtheria, tetanus, or poliovirus antigens; however, the noninferiority criteria were not met for serogroup Y and one pertussis antigen (anti-fimbriae). Because no clinical correlates of protection are available for pertussis antigens, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. When MenACWY-D was administered 30 days after diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine (DAPTACEL), significantly lower geometric mean titers (GMTs) were observed for all meningococcal serogroups. Among children aged 4–6 years vaccinated previously at age 2–3 years, the proportions maintaining an rSBA titer ≥ 1:128 were 75%, 52%, 61%, and 90% for serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively.

MenACWY Vaccines

ACIP recommends a single dose of MenACWY at age 11 or 12 years followed by a booster dose administered at age 16 years (Table 2). Children who received MenACWY at age 10 years do not need an additional dose at age 11–12 years but should receive the booster dose at age 16 years. Children who received MenACWY before age 10 years and with no ongoing risk for meningococcal disease for which boosters are recommended should still receive MenACWY according to the recommended adolescent schedule, with the first dose at age 11–12 years and a booster dose at age 16 years. For example, a healthy child who received MenACWY at age 9 years because of short-term travel to a country where meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic and who is not otherwise at increased risk should receive the MenACWY at age 11–12 years according to the recommended ACIP adolescent vaccination schedule. Children who received MenACWY before age 10 years and for whom boosters are recommended because of an ongoing increased risk for meningococcal disease (e.g. those with complement deficiency, HIV infection, or asplenia) should follow the booster schedule for persons at increased risk.

Adolescents who receive their first dose at age 13–15 years should receive a booster dose at age 16–18 years; the booster dose can be administered at any time, as long as a minimum interval of 8 weeks between doses is maintained. Adolescents who receive a first dose after their 16th birthday do not need a booster dose unless they become at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Persons aged 19–21 years who have not received a dose after their 16th birthday can receive a single MenACWY dose as part of catch-up vaccination. MenACWY vaccines are interchangeable; the same vaccine product is recommended, but not required, for all doses. MenACWY vaccines can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines indicated for this age group, but at a different anatomic site, if feasible. MenACWY-TT, which is conjugated to tetanus toxoid, is only licensed for the prevention of meningococcal disease; use of this vaccine does not replace doses or affect the dosing intervals of routinely recommended tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines in any age group.

### Prevention and control of meningococcal disease: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111oYCCv]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Meningococcal disease describes the spectrum of infections caused by Neisseria meningiditis, including meningitdis, bacteremia, and bacteremic pneumonia. Two quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines that provide protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY-D [Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania] and MenACWY-CRM [Menveo, manufactured by Novartis Vaccines, Cambridge, Massachusetts]) are licensed in the United States for use among persons aged 2 through 55 years. MenACWY-D also is licensed for use among infants and toddlers aged 9 through 23 months. Quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4 [Menommune, manufactured by sanofi pasteur, Inc, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania]) is the only vaccine licensed for use among persons aged ≥ 56 years. A bivalent meningococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine that provides protection against meningococcal serogroups C and Y along with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (Hib-MenCY-TT [MenHibrix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) is licensed for use in children aged 6 weeks through 18 months. This report compiles and summarizes all recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding prevention and control of meningococcal disease in the United States, specifically the changes in the recommendations published since 2005 (CDC. Prevention and control of meningococcal disease: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2005;54 [No. RR-7]). As a comprehensive summary of previously published recommendations, this report does not contain any new recommendations; it is intended for use by clinicians as a resource. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) for adolescents aged 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. ACIP also recommends routine vaccination for persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease (i.e., persons who have persistent complement component deficiencies, persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia, microbiologists who routinely are exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis, military recruits, and persons who travel to or reside in areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic). Guidelines for antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis and for evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks of meningococcal disease also are provided.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy meningococcal-Naïve children 2–9 years of age: a phase III, randomized study [^113W9NxE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive meningococcal disease is a major cause of meningitis in children. An investigational meningococcal (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACYW-TT) could offer protection against invasive meningococcal disease in this population. This phase III study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of MenACYW-TT in children compared with a licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine conjugated with diphtheria protein CRM197 (MenACWY-CRM).

Methods

Healthy children 2–9 years of age in the United States, including Puerto Rico, were randomized (1:1) to receive MenACYW-TT (n = 499) or MenACWY-CRM (n = 501) (NCT03077438). Meningococcal antibody titers to the 4 vaccine serogroups were measured using a serum bactericidal antibody assay with human complement (hSBA) before and at day 30 after vaccination. Noninferiority between the vaccine groups was assessed by comparing seroresponse rates (postvaccination titers ≥ 1:16 when prevaccination titers were < 1:8, or ≥ 4-fold increase if prevaccination titers were ≥ 1:8) to the 4 serogroups at day 30. Safety was monitored.

Results

The proportion of participants achieving seroresponse at day 30 in the MenACYW-TT group was noninferior to the MenACWY-CRM group (A: 55.4% vs. 47.8%; C: 95.2% vs. 47.8%; W: 78.8% vs. 64.1%; Y: 91.5% vs. 79.3%, respectively). Geometric mean titers for serogroups C, W, and Y were higher with MenACYW-TT than for MenACWY-CRM. Both vaccines were well-tolerated and had similar safety profiles.

Conclusions

MenACYW-TT was well-tolerated in children and achieved noninferior immune responses to MenACWY-CRM against each of the 4 vaccine serogroups.

Abbreviations: MenACWY = quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine; MenACWY-CRM = meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM 197 conjugate vaccine; MenACWY-D = meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine; MenACWY-TT = meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine; MenB = serogroup B meningococcal vaccine.

Because of the high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, children with functional or anatomic asplenia or HIV infection should not be vaccinated with MenACWY-D before age 2 years to avoid interference with the immune response to 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13); MenACWY-CRM should be used in this group. If MenACWY-D is used in persons of any age with these conditions, it should not be administered until at least 4 weeks after completion of all PCV doses.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in children aged 10–12 years: phase III randomized trial complementary analysis of immune persistence 3–6 years after priming [^115SJ6XP]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact

Immune persistence following primary vaccination with a single dose of meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccines, MenACYW-TT/MCV4-CRM, at age 10–12 years was demonstrated. Most participants primed with MenACYW-TT and MCV4-CRM maintained seroprotective titers against all serogroups, suggesting continued protection. Priming with MenACYW-TT resulted in higher persistent titers for serogroups C, W, and Y than MCV4-CRM. A MenACYW-TT booster induced a robust immune response; almost all participants achieved seroprotection against all serogroups. This analysis supports the ACIP recommendations for routine administration of a primary dose of a meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine at 11–12 years, with a booster dose at 16 years.

### Immunogenicity of a single dose of tetravalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine administered to 2-to 10-year-olds is noninferior to a licensed-ACWY polysaccharide vaccine with an acceptable safety profile [^114MpaWE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Meningococcal disease remains an important cause of invasive bacterial infections in children less than 5 years of age. Immunogenicity and safety of the investigational ACWY vaccine conjugated with tetanus toxoid (ACWY-TT, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) were evaluated in 1501 healthy 2- to 10-year-old children in the Philippines, India, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia.

Methods

Children were randomized (3:1) to receive ACWY-TT or licensed tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Mencevax, GlaxoSmithKline, Men-PS). Diary cards were used to collect solicited symptoms for 4 days after vaccination. Serious adverse events were reported for 6 months. Serum bactericidal activity (rSBA, rabbit complement) was measured before and 1 month after vaccination in the first 75% of subjects enrolled in each country.

Results

The statistical criteria for noninferiority in terms of rSBA vaccine responses were reached. Exploratory analyses showed that postvaccination rSBA titers ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 were significantly higher after ACWY-TT than Men-PS for serogroups C, W-135, and Y, and rSBA vaccine responses and geometric mean antibody titers were significantly higher for all 4 serogroups after administration of ACWY-TT. Noninferiority in terms of incidences of grade 3 general symptoms was not demonstrated. ACWY-TT was well tolerated with grade 3 events reported in < 1% of subjects per group. No serious adverse events were considered related to vaccination.

Conclusion

ACWY-TT was immunogenic in children between 2 to 10 years of age with a clinically acceptable safety profile that resembled licensed Men-PS. These data support a positive benefit/risk ratio for the ACWY-TT vaccine.

### Immunogenicity, safety and antibody persistence of a booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine compared with monovalent meningococcal serogroup C vaccine administered four years after primary vaccination using the same vaccines [^114u6pAz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated safety, immunogenicity and antibody persistence of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) booster vaccination 4 years after priming of toddlers.

Methods

This phase III, open-label, controlled study in Finland (NCT00955682) enrolled children previously randomized (3:1) at 12–23 months (NCT00474266) to receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT or MenC conjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM197). Serum bactericidal antibody titers using rabbit (rSBA, cut-off 1:8) and human complement (hSBA, cut-off 1:8) were assessed at year 3 and 4 after priming and 1 month and 1 year after administration of a booster dose of the same vaccine given for primary vaccination. Reactogenicity and safety were assessed, and vaccination-related serious adverse events were recorded from the time of primary vaccination.

Results

Before booster (year 4), 74.1%, 40.4%, 49.3% and 58.2% of MenACWY-TT-recipients retained rSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively; 28.8%, 73.2%, 80.6% and 65.4% retained hSBA ≥ 1:8. Percentages for the MenC-CRM group were 35.6% (rSBA-MenC) and 46.9% (hSBA-MenC). After MenACWY-TT booster, ≥ 99.5% had rSBA ≥ 1:8 and hSBA ≥ 1:8 for each serogroup. After MenC-CRM197 booster, all children had rSBA-MenC ≥ 1:8 and hSBA-MenC ≥ 1:8. At year 5, percentages above the cut-off were ≥ 97.4% (rSBA) and ≥ 95.5% (hSBA) in MenACWY-TT-vaccinees for each serogroup. The MenACWY-TT booster dose had a clinically acceptable safety profile. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

There was evidence of antibody persistence 4 years after toddlers were primed with MenACWY-TT. Booster vaccination induced robust immune responses for all serogroups with an acceptable safety profile.

### Meningococcal ACWYX conjugate vaccine in 2-to-29-year-olds in Mali and Gambia [^116xPZ16]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Finally, there are now early data on the effectiveness of MenACWY-D and other quadrivalent vaccines, also licensed based on immunogenicity. Analyzing serogroup C and serogroup Y breakthrough cases following the introduction of a single adolescent MenACWY-D vaccine dose in the US, vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be between 80 and 85%. A case-control study conducted in the same setting estimated a vaccine effectiveness of 79% within one year, and of 69% between one and three years following vaccination. The effectiveness against serogroup C was 79%, and against serogroup Y was 51% up to eight-years following vaccination. Following the introduction of an adolescent quadrivalent vaccine programme, predominantly using a tetanus toxoid conjugate (Nimenrix®, Pfizer) in the UK, an overall vaccine effectiveness of 94% has recently been reported, including effectiveness of 94% and 82% against serogroups W and Y respectively. The programme has also been shown to reduce pharyngeal carriage of meningococcus and is expected to generate herd protection. Thus, strong post-implementation data support the licensure of meningococcal conjugate vaccines based on immunogenicity rather than efficacy endpoints. The availability of such effectiveness data and the extensive use of MenACWY-D, as the first quadrivalent conjugate vaccine licensed, including as part of an outbreak response in West Africa, support the choice of the vaccine as the comparator in this study. Some differences in the immunogenicity of the four currently licensed quadrivalent vaccines have been reported. However, there are no data to suggest these translate into difference in effectiveness. The generally higher immune responses to NmCV-5 over the licensed comparator provides further reassurance with this regard.

### Antibody persistence 12 months after a booster dose of meningococcal-C conjugated vaccine in the second year of life [^112i9zk9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

We report on the results of the 12-month follow-up of children aged 14 to 18 months who received primary and booster vaccinations with either a meningococcal-C vaccine conjugated to tetanus toxoid or CRM197. Seroprotection (92.8%) and geometric mean titers/serum bactericidal activity (410.5; 95% CI: 273.4–616.3) were higher in children receiving the meningococcal serogroup C tetanus toxoid conjugate, compared with 61.5% and serum bactericidal antibody geometric mean titer of 45.1 (95% CI: 28.5–71.3) when MenC-CRM197 conjugate was used.

### MenAfriVac as an antitetanus vaccine [^114ym6Wz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine, PsA-TT, uses tetanus toxoid (TT) as a carrier protein (PsA-TT). TT as a carrier protein in other conjugate vaccines is known to be immunogenic and generates a robust anti-TT response.

Methods

Clinical studies in Africa assessed whether PsA-TT generated tetanus serologic responses when tested in African populations (toddlers to adults). Second, the high acceptance of PsA-TT mass immunization campaigns in the 1- to 29-year age group meant that a sizeable fraction of women of reproductive age received PsA-TT. Incidence data for neonatal tetanus were reviewed for countries with and without PsA-TT campaigns to check whether this had any impact on the incidence.

Results

PsA-TT generated robust tetanus serologic responses in 1- to 29-year-olds, similar to those expected after a booster dose of TT. Neonatal cases of tetanus fell by 25% in countries that completed PsA-TT campaigns in 1- to 29-year-olds.

Conclusions

Although these data are not yet definitive, they are consistent with the hypothesis that improved community immunity to tetanus as a result of the PsA-TT campaigns may be having an impact on the incidence of neonatal tetanus in sub-Saharan Africa.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^113YAW1D]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of tetanus toxoid-conjugate quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MenACYW-TT), alone or co-administered with MenB vaccine, were assessed in healthy 13–25-year olds who received MenACYW-TT or a CRM-conjugate vaccine (MCV4-CRM) 3–6 years earlier.

Methods

This phase IIIb open-label trial (NCT04084769) evaluated MenACYW-TT-primed participants, randomized to receive MenACYW-TT alone or with a MenB vaccine, and MCV4-CRM-primed participants who received MenACYW-TT alone. Functional antibodies against serogroups A, C, W and Y were measured using human complement serum bactericidal antibody assay (hSBA). The primary endpoint was vaccine seroresponse (post-vaccination titers ≥ 1:16 if pre-vaccination titers < 1:8; or a ≥ 4-fold increase if pre-vaccination titers ≥ 1:8) 30 days post booster. Safety was evaluated throughout the study.

Results

The persistence of the immune response following primary vaccination with MenACYW-TT was demonstrated. Seroresponse after MenACYW-TT booster was high regardless of priming vaccine (serogroup A: 94.8% vs 93.2%; C: 97.1% vs 98.9%; W: 97.7% vs 98.9%; and Y; 98.9% vs 100% for MenACWY-TT-primed and MCV4-CRM-primed groups, respectively). Co-administration with MenB vaccines did not affect MenACWY-TT immunogenicity. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

MenACYW-TT booster induced robust immunogenicity against all serogroups, regardless of the primary vaccine received, and had an acceptable safety profile.

Impact

A booster dose of MenACYW-TT induces robust immune responses in children and adolescents primed with MenACYW-TT or another MCV4 (MCV4-DT or MCV4-CRM), respectively. Here, we demonstrate that MenACYW-TT booster 3–6 years after primary vaccination induced robust immunogenicity against all serogroups, regardless of the priming vaccine (MenACWY-TT or MCV4-CRM), and was well tolerated. Persistence of the immune response following previous primary vaccination with MenACYW-TT was demonstrated. MenACYW-TT booster with MenB vaccine co-administration did not affect MenACWY-TT immunogenicity and was well tolerated. These findings will facilitate the provision of broader protection against IMD particularly in higher-risk groups such as adolescents.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in children aged 10–12 years: phase III randomized trial complementary analysis of immune persistence 3–6 years after priming [^113Hcz2c]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

At Day 30 after administration of MenACYW-TT booster, nearly all participants in both the MenACYW-TT- and MCV4-CRM-primed groups achieved seroprotective titers (hSBA titer ≥ 1:8) for each serogroup (Table 1). An anamnestic response was observed post-booster with MenACYW-TT, with increases in GMTs much higher than those observed after priming vaccination across all serogroups (Fig. 1).

This analysis shows that priming vaccination with a single dose of MenACYW-TT at 10–12 years of age induces an antibody immune response against all four vaccine serogroups that persists for at least 3–6 years. Additionally, at least 70% of participants primed with MenACYW-TT maintained seroprotective titers (hSBA titers ≥ 1:8), suggesting continued protection against invasive meningococcal disease in this population up to the ACIP-recommended age to receive a booster dose (at approximately 16 years of age). Of note, a priming dose of MenACYW-TT appears to consistently result in persistence of a higher level of hSBA antibody for serogroups C, W, and Y, as assessed by seroprotection (hSBA titers ≥ 1:8) rates and GMTs, compared with a priming dose of MCV4-CRM. Persistence was similar in both MenACYW-TT-primed and MCV4-CRM-primed groups for serogroup A. Booster vaccination with MenACYW-TT induced robust hSBA antibody responses against all vaccine serogroups with almost all participants achieving seroprotection (hSBA titers ≥ 1:8) 30 days post-booster in both MenACYW-TT- and MCV4-CRM-primed groups.

Geometric Mean Antibody Titers and Percentage of Participants With a Vaccine Response at 1 Month After Vaccination in the MenACWY-TT and MenACWY-DT Groups (ATP Cohort for Immunogenicity)

Prevaccination, GMTs against the 4 serogroups were similar amongst the 3 vaccine groups (Table 3). Postvaccination, all groups demonstrated increased GMTs against all 4 serogroups. Differences in GMTs between groups were explored using GMT ratios; GMTs for serogroups W-135 and Y were statistically higher in recipients of either MenACWY-TT lot A or MenACWY-TT lot B compared with MenACWY-DT; no differences were observed between MenACWY-TT (lots A and B). The proportion of participants postvaccination with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 for the 4 serogroups ranged between 73.1% and 80.3% for serogroup A, between 96.1% and 98.3% for serogroup C, between 83.2% and 91.3% for serogroup W-135, and between 94.1% and 98.4% for serogroup Y (Figure 2). The percentage of participants with antibody titers ≥ 1:4 was significantly higher at day 28 for recipients of MenACWY-TT lot A for serogroups A, W-135, and Y compared with MenACWY-DT, and statistically higher for recipients of MenACWY-TT lot B for serogroups W-135 and Y compared with MenACWY-DT. There were no differences between MenACWY-TT lots A and B. A similar pattern was observed for the proportion of participants with postvaccination titers ≥ 1:8; most participants who achieved protective titers of ≥ 1:4 also exceeded the ≥ 1:8 threshold (Figure 2).

### Licensure of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (menveo) and guidance for use-advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2010 [^112yRunR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

On February 19, 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics). MenACWY-CRM is licensed as a single dose for use among persons aged 11–55 years. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed data from prelicensure clinical trials on the safety and immunogenicity of MenACWY-CRM. This report summarizes the approved indications for MenACWY-CRM and provides guidance from ACIP for its use. The following guidance for use of MenACWY-CRM is consistent with licensed indications and ACIP recommendations for meningococcal conjugate vaccines.

### National vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-national immunization survey-teen, United States, 2023 [^1158TWJn]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Based on safety and efficacy data, vaccinations are the best defense to protect persons and communities from serious vaccine-preventable diseases. 2024 marks the 30th anniversary of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides recommended vaccines at no cost to eligible children and adolescents. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of children aged 11–12 years with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap); quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY); and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (which may begin at age 9 years). At age 16 years, adolescents should receive a booster dose of MenACWY. In addition, persons aged 16–23 years may receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) on the basis of shared clinical decision-making. Adolescents should also catch up on missed childhood vaccines, stay current with COVID-19 vaccinations, * and receive an annual influenza vaccine †. A recent publication used National Immunization Survey-Child data to assess trends in vaccination coverage among VFC-eligible children aged 19–35 months. This new report includes the first assessment of vaccination coverage trends by birth year among adolescents eligible for the VFC program. This report uses 2015–2023 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) data to assess 1) trends in coverage by eligibility for the VFC program § and birth year, 2) vaccination coverage in 2023 among adolescents aged 13–17 years, and 3) recent trends in coverage by birth year.

### A randomized trial to assess safety and immunogenicity of alternative formulations of a quadrivalent meningococcal (A, C, Y, and W-135) tetanus protein conjugate vaccine in toddlers [^115AjHJS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of meningitis and septicemia globally. Recent shifts in serogroup dominance in some settings highlight the desirability of polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines with broader meningococcal coverage than serogroup C vaccines in widespread use.

Methods

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of meningococcal quadrivalent (A, C, W-135, Y) tetanus conjugate vaccine (TetraMen-T), administered at 1 year of age. A total of 378 children were randomized to 1 of 6 groups — 5 received alternative formulations of TetraMen-T, the sixth licensed adjuvanted serogroup C conjugate vaccine (Neisvac-C). Solicited adverse event reports were collected from day 0 to 7 after vaccination and unsolicited and serious adverse event reports throughout study participation. Immunogenicity was assessed by serum bactericidal assays containing either a human (hSBA) or baby rabbit (rSBA) complement source before and 1 month after immunization.

Results

All vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. Using the various measures of immunogenicity, no consistent relationships were observed between the dose of either polysaccharide or carrier and serogroup-specific response for any one antigen. The highest-dose vaccine provided optimal coverage for all 4 serogroups, with the percentage of recipients achieving hSBA titers ≥ 8 against each as follows: A, 92%; C, 96%; W-135, 71%; Y, 82% (corresponding proportions with rSBAs titers > 8 all exceeded 90%). The investigational vaccines were less immunogenic against the serogroup C capsular polysaccharide than the licensed comparator.

Conclusions

Studies are ongoing that will help to identify optimal scheduling of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines, to facilitate their inclusion into national immunization programs seeking extended serogroup coverage against meningococci.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2018 [^112Fe9G8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of persons aged 11–12 years to protect against certain diseases, including human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated cancers, meningococcal disease, and pertussis. A booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended at age 16 years, and serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) may be administered to persons aged 16–23 years. To estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2018 National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) which included 18,700 adolescents aged 13–17 years. * During 2017–2018, coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine increased from 65.5% to 68.1%, and the percentage of adolescents up-to-date † with the HPV vaccine series increased from 48.6% to 51.1%, although the increases were only observed among males. Vaccination coverage increases were also observed for ≥ 1 MenACWY dose (from 85.1% to 86.6%) and ≥ 2 MenACWY doses (from 44.3% to 50.8%). Coverage with tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) remained stable at 89%. Disparities in coverage by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) § and health insurance status identified in previous years persisted. Coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine was higher among adolescents whose parents reported receiving a provider recommendation; however, prevalence of parents reporting receiving a recommendation for adolescent HPV vaccination varied by state (range = 60%–91%). Supporting providers to give strong recommendations and effectively address parental concerns remains a priority, especially in states and rural areas where provider recommendations were less commonly reported.

Recommendations for Use of Meningococcal Vaccines

Adolescents and Young Adults

ACIP recommends routine administration of a MenACWY vaccine for all persons aged 11–18 years (Table 2). In addition, ACIP recommends a MenB vaccine series for persons aged 16–23 years on the basis of shared clinical decision-making to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease (Table 2). The preferred age for MenB vaccination is 16–18 years.

TABLE 2
Recommended meningococcal vaccines and administration schedules for children and adults — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2020

Abbreviations: MenACWY-CRM = meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM 197 conjugate vaccine; MenACWY-D = meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine; MenACWY-TT = meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine; MenB-4C = four-component meningococcal group B vaccine; MenB-FHbp = meningococcal group B factor H binding protein vaccine.

* MenB vaccines are licensed in the United States only for persons aged 10–25 years.

† College freshmen living in residence halls should receive at least 1 dose of MenACWY within 5 years before college entry. The preferred timing of the most recent dose is on or after their 16th birthday. If only 1 dose of vaccine was administered before the 16th birthday, a booster dose should be administered before enrollment. Adolescents who received a first dose after their 16th birthday do not need another dose before college entry unless it has been more than 5 years since the dose. Certain schools, colleges, and universities have policies requiring vaccination against meningococcal disease as a condition of enrollment.

§ When given to healthy adolescents who are not otherwise at increased risk for meningococcal disease, 2 doses of MenB-FHbp should be administered at 0 and 6 months. For persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease and for use during serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreaks, 3 doses of MenB-FHbp should be administered at 0, 1–2, and 6 months to provide earlier protection and maximize short-term immunogenicity.

### Infant meningococcal vaccination: advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) recommendations and rationale [^115H2x49]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

At its October 2012 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend vaccination against meningococcal serogroups C and Y for children aged 6 weeks through 18 months at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Meningococcal groups C and Y and Haemophilus b tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Hib-MenCY-TT [MenHibrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals]) is licensed for active immunization for prevention of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and meningococcal serogroups C and Y. Hib-MenCY-TT is not indicated for prevention of disease caused by meningococcal serogroup B, the most common serogroup causing disease in infants, or serogroups W135 or A, which are represented in quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Before licensure of Hib-MenCY-TT, no meningococcal conjugate vaccine was licensed for infants aged 2 through 8 months. MenACWY-D (Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur) is licensed as a 2-dose series for infants and toddlers aged 9 through 23 months, and MenACWY-D and MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, Novartis Vaccines) are licensed for persons aged 2 through 55 years as a single dose. These vaccines are recommended routinely for persons aged 11 through 18 years and persons aged 2 through 55 years at increased risk for meningococcal disease (and persons aged 9 months through 55 years for MenACWY-D). This report summarizes the deliberations of ACIP, the rationale for its decision, and recommendations for use of Hib-MenCY-TT in infants at increased risk for meningococcal disease.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Neisseria meningitidis is an important cause of invasive bacterial infection worldwide. Disease manifestations include bacteremia and sepsis, meningitis, septic arthritis, and pericarditis. Death and long-term sequelae including hearing loss, neurological disabilities, and limb loss in survivors are not uncommon after invasive meningococcal disease. Although there are 12 immunologically distinct serogroups of N meningitidis, 6 serogroups (A, B, C, W-135, X, Y) cause most disease in humans. Polysaccharide vaccines against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y have been available for decades, but, like other polysaccharide vaccines, they are limited in the durability of the protective responses, fail to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage, do not provide opportunities for boosting with subsequent doses, and, except for serogroup A, are not immunogenic in children under 2 years of age. The development of conjugate vaccines, where the polysaccharide antigens are covalently linked to proteins, has led to more immunogenic vaccines for use in children for the prevention of several infectious diseases, including invasive meningococcal disease. Meningococcal C (MenC) conjugate vaccines have been approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere for use at 2 months of age and older beginning in 1999. Addition of MenC conjugate vaccines to the routine pediatric vaccination schedule has resulted in dramatic decreases in invasive MenC disease in many countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada. Two quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines using diphtheria toxoid or diphtheria toxoid cross-reacting material (CRM) as the conjugate protein (MenACWY-DT and MenACWY-CRM, respectively) have been developed and approved for use in individuals 9 months (MenACWY-DT) or 2 years (MenACWY-CRM) to 55 years of age, and they are now recommended for universal preadolescent and adolescent immunization in the United States and some provinces in Canada. The MenB capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic because of antigenic similarities to human neural tissue, which has precluded development of MenB conjugate vaccines. Therefore, broadly protective MenB vaccines are being developed using universally expressed N meningitidis surface proteins.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years – United States, 2013 [^111QLLx1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents receive 1 dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, and 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. ACIP also recommends administration of these and all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. During 2006–2012, national vaccination coverage for ≥ 1 Tdap and ≥ 1 MenACWY increased steadily, with Tdap coverage in 2011 reaching national target levels for adolescents. During 2007–2011, coverage for ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose among females increased steadily, but from 2011 to 2012, there were no changes in coverage. Coverage for ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose among males increased from 2011–2012.

What is added by this report?

From 2012 to 2013, vaccination coverage among U.S. adolescents increased to 86.0% for ≥ 1 dose of Tdap vaccine, 77.8% for ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine, 57.3% for ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine among females, and 34.6% for ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine among males. Vaccination coverage levels continued to vary widely among states. Although HPV vaccination coverage increased among both females and males, levels are still low and reflect many missed opportunities. Five states had substantial increases in HPV coverage from 2012 to 2013, suggesting greater progress is feasible.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Lower vaccination coverage for HPV compared with Tdap and MenACWY vaccines indicates clinicians, parents, and adolescents are missing opportunities for infection and cancer prevention. Clinician recommendations strongly influence the decisions of parents to vaccinate their children; to maximize coverage, clinicians should clearly and consistently recommend all ACIP-recommended vaccines, including HPV. Health care systems interventions, including use of client reminder and recall systems, immunization information systems, clinician reminders, and standing orders, should be employed to improve protection of adolescents from vaccine-preventable infections and future cancers.

### National vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-national immunization survey-teen, United States, 2021 [^116W2MVZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of persons aged 11–12 years with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY). A second (booster) dose of MenACWY is recommended at age 16 years. On the basis of shared clinical decision-making, adolescents aged 16–23 years may receive a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) series. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for hepatitis A vaccine (HepA); hepatitis B vaccine (HepB); measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR); and varicella vaccine (VAR) for adolescents whose childhood vaccinations are not up to date. Although COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination coverage estimates are not presented in this report, vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine and annual influenza vaccination are also recommended by ACIP for adolescents *. To estimate vaccination coverage, CDC analyzed data for 18,002 adolescents aged 13–17 years from the 2021 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). † Coverage with ≥ 1 dose of Tdap § (89.6%) and ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY (89.0%) remained high and stable compared with the previous year. Increases in coverage with the following vaccines occurred from 2020 to 2021: ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine (from 75.1% to 76.9%); adolescents who were up to date with HPV vaccination (HPV UTD) †† (from 58.6% to 61.7%); and ≥ 2 MenACWY doses among adolescents aged 17 years (from 54.4% to 60.0%). Coverage with MenACWY, HPV vaccine, and ≥ 2 HepA doses was lower among adolescents living in nonmetropolitan statistical areas (non-MSAs) §§ than among those living in MSA principal cities. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed by comparing vaccination coverage by age and birth year before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coverage with ≥ 1 MenACWY dose by age 13 years was 5.1 percentage points lower among adolescents who reached age 13 years during the pandemic (2021) compared with those who reached age 13 in 2019. Coverage with ≥ 1 Tdap dose by age 12 years was 4.1 percentage points lower among children who reached age 12 years during the pandemic (2020) compared with those who reached age 12 before the pandemic. Coverage with ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose by ages 12 and 13 years among children and adolescents who reached age 12 or 13 during the pandemic did not differ from coverage before the pandemic. Many children and adolescents might have missed routine medical care and recommended vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Review of patient vaccination records is important for providers to ensure that children and adolescents are up to date with all recommended vaccinations.

### Safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine coadministered with routine childhood vaccines in European infants: an open, randomized trial [^111GDcwu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This was the first study evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of the quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) coadministered with routine childhood vaccines in young infants.

Methods

In this open, randomized, controlled, phase III study (NCT01144663), 2095 infants (ages 6–12 weeks) were randomized (1:1:1:1) into 4 groups to receive MenACWY-TT at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age, or MenACWY-TT, MenC-cross-reactive material (CRM197) or MenC-TT at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. All participants received PHiD-CV and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age. Immune responses were measured by serum bactericidal activity assays using rabbit (rSBA) and human (hSBA) complement. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms were recorded during 8 and 31 days post-vaccination, respectively, and serious adverse events throughout the study.

Results

Noninferiority of immune responses to MenC induced by 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY-TT versus 2 doses of MenC-TT or MenC-CRM197 was demonstrated. Predefined criteria for the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT to MenA, MenW and MenY were met. One month after 2 or 3 primary MenACWY-TT doses, ≥ 93.1% and ≥ 88.5% of infants had rSBA and hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for all serogroups. The robust increases in rSBA and hSBA titers observed for all vaccine serogroups postbooster vaccination suggested that MenACWY-TT induced immune memory. MenACWY-TT coadministered with childhood vaccines had a clinically acceptable safety profile.

Conclusions

This study supports the coadministration of MenACWY-TT with routine childhood vaccines as 2 or 3 primary doses during infancy followed by a booster dose in the second year of life.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^112wMgXp]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This phase IIIb, open-label, partially randomized, parallel-group, multicenter trial demonstrated that a booster dose of MenACYW-TT in adolescents and adults who had been vaccinated 3–6 years earlier with a single dose of MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM was immunogenic and well tolerated, with in the sufficiency of seroresponse demonstrated at Day 30 post booster. We observed a robust response to a booster dose of MenACYW-TT, with over 93% seroresponse for all serogroups in adolescents and adults. The seroresponse rate was greater than 75% for all serogroups in both Groups 1 and 2 by Day 6, suggesting a quick onset of the immune response, regardless of the priming vaccine (MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM). This observation supports previous studies of a booster dose of MenACYW-TT which have shown similar results, and is indicative of immune memory in these participants. Such a rapid anamnestic response is important to be able to rapidly boost protection against infection among groups of at-risk individuals whose protective antibody levels may have waned over time and thus may otherwise be at risk of a potential outbreak. Vaccination with MenACYW-TT as a booster in adolescents and adults vaccinated 3–6 years earlier with MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM was found to be well tolerated with no safety concerns identified. There were no SAEs within 30 days of the booster, or discontinuations due to AEs.

When examining the persistence of the immune response, 3–6 years after the priming vaccination with either MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM, prior to the booster vaccination, seroprotection ranged from 52% to 91% across the serogroups and vaccine groups. GMTs at Day 0, pre-booster, were higher than those prior to the priming vaccine in participants from previous studies, suggesting the persistence of the immune response in these participants. GMTs were also higher pre-booster in those primed with MenACYW-TT compared to those primed with MCV4-CRM for serogroups C, W and Y. These results demonstrate for the first time persistence of the immune response in adolescents and young adults and are in line with previous studies of a booster dose of MenACYW-TT findings showing persistence of the immune response in a younger population.

### Licensure of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine for children aged 2 through 10 years and updated booster dose guidance for adolescents and other persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2011 [^111prhUJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

In January 2011, the Food and Drug Administration lowered the approval age range for use of MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics), a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, to include persons aged 2 through 55 years. One other quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, MenACWY-D(Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur), is licensed in the United States for prevention of meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 among persons aged 2 through 55 years; MenACWY-D also is licensed as a 2-dose series for children aged 9 through 23 months. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that persons aged 2 through 55 years at increased risk for meningococcal disease and all adolescents aged 11 through 18 years be immunized with meningococcal conjugate vaccine. ACIP further recommended, in January 2011, that all adolescents receive a booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine at age 16 years. This report summarizes data supporting the extended age indication for MenACWY-CRM and the interchangeability of the two licensed meningococcal conjugate vaccines.

### Five-year antibody persistence and booster response after 1 or 2 doses of meningococcal A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in healthy children [^114fnozM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated antibody persistence up to 5 years postvaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), and subsequent booster responses to MenACWY-TT in healthy US children.

Methods

In the initial phase II, open, multicenter study (NCT00471081), 349 infants were randomized (1:1) to receive MenACWY-TT (1 or 2 doses). In the follow-up study (NCT00718666), we evaluated antibody persistence at years 1, 3 and 5 by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). At year 5, children received a booster dose of MenACWY-TT. We compared their immune responses at 1 month postbooster with those from 100 age-matched, meningococcal naive children, who received a primary MenACWY-TT dose. We recorded solicited adverse events for 4 days and unsolicited adverse events for 31 days, followed by an additional 5-month extended safety follow-up.

Results

At year 5, ≥ 64.0% of 1-dose and ≥ 74.6% of 2-dose recipients had hSBA titers ≥ 8 for MenC, MenW and MenY. For MenA, 31.7% of 1-dose and 38.0% of 2-dose recipients had hSBA titers ≥ 8. One month postvaccination, all booster dose recipients and ≥ 78.5% of primary dose recipients exhibited hSBA titers ≥ 8 for all serogroups. Geometric mean titers were higher in primed than in naive children. MenACWY-TT had a clinically acceptable safety profile.

Conclusions

With the exception of serogroup W, antibody persistence 5 years after MenACWY-TT vaccination did not differ substantially between children who received 1 or 2 doses in infancy. A booster dose of MenACWY-TT elicited robust anamnestic responses and was well tolerated.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in children aged 10–12 years: phase III randomized trial complementary analysis of immune persistence 3–6 years after priming [^1155e7JF]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, 470 of the 570 participants (82.5%) included in study MET59 were 10–12 years of age on the day of priming with MenACYW-TT (n = 340) or MCV4-CRM (n = 130). At the time of enrollment in study MET59, the mean age (SD) of participants primed with MenACYW-TT was 15.1 (± 1.01) years and 15.6 (± 0.81) years for those primed with MCV4-CRM. The majority of participants were Caucasian (MenACYW-TT primed, 87.4%; MCV4-CRM primed, 91.5%).

The persistence of the immune response was evaluated at Day 0 of MET59, prior to administration of the MenACYW-TT booster. Across the four serogroups, seroprotection rates at Day 30 post-priming with MenACYW-TT were 95.3% for serogroup A, 98.8% for serogroup C, 100.0% for serogroup W, and 97.9% for serogroup Y; by 3–6 years, these declined to 71.1% for serogroup A, 86.8% for serogroup C, 88.2% for serogroup W, and 82.3% for serogroup Y (Table 1). Seroprotection rates at Day 30 post-priming with MCV4-CRM were 80.6% for serogroup A, 73.2% for serogroup C, 93.5% for serogroup Y, and 88.7% for serogroup W; by 3–6 years, these declined to 73.1% for serogroup A, 48.5% for serogroup C, 75.4% for serogroup Y, and 51.5% for serogroup W (Table 1). GMTs also declined in both primed groups but remained higher than those measured prior to priming vaccination (Fig. 1), indicative of long-term persistence of immune response.

### Five-year antibody persistence and booster response to a single dose of meningococcal A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in adolescents and young adults: an open, randomized trial [^111MSgd9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated antibody persistence after 1 dose of meningococcal serogroups ACWY tetanus toxoid (MenACWY-TT) or diphtheria toxoid (MenACWY-DT) conjugate vaccines and subsequent booster responses to MenACWY-TT.

Methods

In the initial phase II, open, multicenter study (NCT00454909), 872 participants aged 10–25 years received 1 MenACWY-TT or MenACWY-DT dose. In this study (NCT00715910), antibody persistence was evaluated at years 1, 3 and 5 by serum bactericidal activity assays using human complement (hSBA). At year 5, all participants received a MenACWY-TT booster dose. Immune responses at 1-month postbooster were compared with a control group including 101 participants aged 15–30 years who received a primary MenACWY-TT dose. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were recorded for 4 and 31 days, respectively, followed by a 6-month extended safety follow-up.

Results

At year 5, ≥ 79.5% of MenACWY-TT-primed (n = 170) and MenACWY-DT-primed (n = 45) participants had hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for MenC, MenW and MenY, and ≥ 37.5% for MenA. For all serogroups, ≥ 85.7% and ≥ 67.1% of MenACWY-TT booster and primary dose recipients exhibited vaccine responses 1-month postmvaccination, respectively. Geometric mean titers were potentially higher in primed versus naive participants, with no potential difference between MenACWY-TT-primed and MenACWY-DT-primed participants (exploratory analyses). MenACWY-TT had a clinically acceptable safety profile.

Conclusions

Before the booster dose administration at year 5, hSBA-MenC, -MenW and -MenY antibody persistence was observed in most participants. However, only ≥ 37.5% of MenACWY-TT and 44.4% of MenACWY-DT recipients retained hSBA-MenA titers ≥ 1:8. MenACWY-TT booster doses elicited robust anamnestic responses, irrespective of the priming vaccine, and were well tolerated.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2019 [^111vmiD6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Three vaccines are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of adolescents aged 11–12 years to protect against 1) pertussis; 2) meningococcal disease caused by types A, C, W, and Y; and 3) human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. At age 16 years, a booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended. Persons aged 16–23 years can receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB), if determined to be appropriate through shared clinical decision-making. CDC analyzed data from the 2019 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the United States. * Coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine increased from 68.1% in 2018 to 71.5% in 2019, and the percentage of adolescents who were up to date † with the HPV vaccination series (HPV UTD) increased from 51.1% in 2018 to 54.2% in 2019. Both HPV vaccination coverage measures improved among females and males. An increase in adolescent coverage with ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY (from 86.6% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019) also was observed. Among adolescents aged 17 years, 53.7% received the booster dose of MenACWY in 2019, not statistically different from 50.8% in 2018; 21.8% received ≥ 1 dose of MenB, a 4.6 percentage point increase from 17.2% in 2018. Among adolescents living at or above the poverty level, § those living outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) had lower coverage with ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY and with ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose, and a lower percentage were HPV UTD, compared with those living in MSA principal cities. In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed the way health care providers operate and provide routine and essential services. An examination of Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider ordering data showed that vaccine orders for HPV vaccine; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap); and MenACWY decreased in mid-March when COVID-19 was declared a national emergency (Supplementary Figure 1). Ensuring that routine immunization services for adolescents are maintained or reinitiated is essential to continuing progress in protecting persons and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks.

Introduction

Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial infection that primarily presents as meningitis, bacteremia, or both. Three quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccines and two serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines are licensed and available in the United States and are recommended by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the prevention of meningococcal disease caused by these serogroups (Table 1) (Box 1). Details about groups recommended to receive meningococcal vaccination, number of vaccine doses, dosing regimens, contraindications, precautions, and special circumstances are described elsewhere in this report.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine 6 years after menC priming as toddlers [^116NnLY6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We assessed immunogenicity, antibody persistence and safety of the meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y-tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) in children primed as toddlers with MenC vaccine.

Methods

This open, multicenter extension study enrolled children 84–95 months of age who had received one dose of the combined Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)-MenC-TT conjugate vaccine (HibMenC group) or Hib-TT and monovalent MenC (MCC)-CRM197 vaccines (Hib+MCC group) at 12–18 months of age, in the primary study. All participants received one dose of MenACWY-TT. We assessed immunogenicity against MenA, MenC, MenW and MenY at 1 month and 2 years postvaccination by serum bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA). Safety and reactogenicity were evaluated.

Results

Six years post-MenC vaccination, < 20% of children retained rSBA-MenC titers ≥ 1:8. At 1 month post-MenACWY-TT vaccination, vaccine response rates against all serogroups were high for both groups with ≥ 97.1% of children having rSBA ≥ 1:8. Two years postvaccination, ≥ 63.6% of children retained rSBA-MenA ≥ 1:8, and ≥ 87.9% for other serogroups. Geometric mean titers for all serogroups declined at 2 years post-MenACWY-TT vaccination, but remained ≥ 13 times higher than prevaccination levels. For both groups, pain (≤ 58.5%), redness (≤ 51.4%) and fatigue (≤ 27.0%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

One dose of MenACWY-TT boosts protection against MenC in primed children, is safe and extends protection against MenA, MenW and MenY. Immunogenicity and safety were comparable in infants vaccinated with conjugated vaccine (HibMenC-TT) or the separate vaccines (Hib-TT and MCC-CRM197).

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^11239sT1]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

This study offers key data about the immunogenicity and safety of MenACYW-TT when administered as a booster alone or co-administered with a MenB vaccine, in participants primed with MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM. A booster dose of MenACYW-TT produced a comparable and robust response to all serogroups in adolescents and adults who had received a priming dose of either MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM 3–6 years earlier. In addition, no interference of the immune response to MenACYW-TT was observed when MenACYW-TT was co-administered with MenB-T or 4CMenB vaccines.

### Use of menACWY-CRM vaccine in children aged 2 through 23 months at increased risk for meningococcal disease: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, 2013 [^113jRuvk]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

During its October 2013 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of a third meningococcal conjugate vaccine, MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, Novartis), as an additional option for vaccinating infants aged 2 through 23 months at increased risk for meningococcal disease. MenACWY-CRM is the first quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine licensed for use in children aged 2 through 8 months. MenACWY-D (Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur) is recommended for use in children aged 9 through 23 months who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease, and Hib-MenCY-TT (MenHibrix, GlaxoSmithKline) is recommended for use in children aged 6 weeks through 18 months at increased risk. This report summarizes information on MenACWY-CRM administration in infants and provides recommendations for vaccine use in infants aged 2 through 23 months who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Because the burden of meningococcal disease in infants is low in the United States and the majority of cases that do occur are caused by serogroup B, which is not included in any vaccine licensed in the United States, only those infants who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease are recommended to receive a meningococcal vaccine.

### Updated recommendations for use of meningococcal conjugate vaccines-advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2010 [^114TuQmo]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

On October 27, 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved updated recommendations for the use of quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) meningococcal conjugate vaccines (Menveo, Novartis; and Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur) in adolescents and persons at high risk for meningococcal disease. These recommendations supplement the previous ACIP recommendations for meningococcal vaccination. The Meningococcal Vaccines Work Group of ACIP reviewed available data on immunogenicity in high-risk groups, bactericidal antibody persistence after immunization, current epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and cost-effectiveness of different strategies for vaccination of adolescents. The Work Group then presented policy options for consideration by the full ACIP. This report summarizes two new recommendations approved by ACIP: 1) routine vaccination of adolescents, preferably at age 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years and 2) a 2-dose primary series administered 2 months apart for persons aged 2 through 54 years with persistent complement component deficiency (e.g. C5-C9, properidin, factor H, or factor D) and functional or anatomic asplenia, and for adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. CDC guidance for vaccine providers regarding these updated recommendations also is included.

### Comparison of the safety and immunogenicity of a novel quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine and a marketed quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine in healthy individuals 10–25 years of age [^111fy4fr]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

At the time of this clinical trial, 2 other quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines were marketed worldwide. Menactra (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA), which uses diphtheria toxoid as the carrier protein, was the first quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine to market, and it was used as the comparator vaccine in this study. Menveo (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA), which uses CRM 197 as the carrier protein, was second to market, and it demonstrated noninferiority to Menactra in a prelicensure clinical trial conducted in adolescents. Similar to this study with the novel MenACWY-TT vaccine, Menveo showed increased GMTs compared with Menactra. MenACWY-TT has also been shown to be noninferior to quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine in children aged 2 to 10 years, Asian adolescents, and European adolescents and young adults. Four different formulations of the novel MenACWY-TT vaccine compared with age-appropriate, marketed meningococcal vaccines (either MenC conjugate vaccine or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine) were studied in children 1–5 years of age, and noninferiority of MenACWY-TT compared with MenC was demonstrated in children 12–23 months of age. There was no detrimental effect on reactogenicity or immunogenicity when MenACWY-TT was coadministered with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, hepatitis B vaccine in toddlers, with combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine in toddlers, or combined hepatitis A-hepatitis B vaccine in adolescents. In this study, MenACWY‐TT vaccine was well tolerated and elicited an immune response that was noninferior to that of a marketed MenACWY‐DT vaccine. Taken collectively, these studies provide the data needed to support the use of MenACWY-TT in various national meningococcal vaccination programs. In the United States, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines are licensed and recommended for all adolescents, as well as for children 9 months to 2 years (2-dose regimen) of age and individuals 2–55 years of age (single dose) with conditions that put them at increased risk for invasive meningococcal disease. In Canada, some provinces recommend an adolescent booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines after infant MenC conjugate vaccination. Most European countries have implemented MenC conjugate vaccination programs because of the predominance of serogroup C disease. MenACWY-TT has now received market authorization in the European Union for administration as a single dose to individuals 12 months of age or older, expanding the options for invasive meningococcal disease control.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (menACWY-TT): a review [^115xWEkw]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Meningococcal disease poses serious health risks globally. The six Neisseria meningitidis serogroups responsible for most of the disease burden are A, B, C, W, X and Y. The case fatality rate remains high worldwide and prevention by vaccination remains the best strategy. Because polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in young children, conjugated vaccines were developed to overcome this drawback. The quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), comprising the serogroups A, C, W and Y conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier protein (marketed under the trade name Nimenrix ™), is the first quadrivalent vaccine to be approved in Europe as a single dose for ages 12 months and in Canada for ages 12 months to 55 years.

Areas Covered

This review addresses the limitations posed by polysaccharide vaccines, compares them with the MenACWY-TT conjugated alternative, and focuses on the clinical studies that investigate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT in various age groups and its co-administration with other vaccines compatible with each age group.

Expert Opinion

Evidence suggests that MenACWY-TT has a good immunogenicity profile across a broad age range including toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults. It also has an acceptable safety profile and is well tolerated when administered with other vaccines.

### Quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate booster vaccination in adolescents and adults: phase III randomized study [^116yk4Cb]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine primary vaccination with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) in children aged 11 or 12 years, and a booster dose at age 16. Several European countries also recommend MCV4 vaccination in toddlers and/or adolescents. Since their launch in 2015, MenB vaccines have been introduced into routine national vaccination programs, often in infants, in a number of European countries, and other countries worldwide including the UK, US and Australia. –

MenACYW-TT (MenQuadfi®; Sanofi, Swiftwater, US) is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (Serogroups A, C, W and Y) tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine, and does not contain an adjuvant. It was licensed in the US for use in individuals aged ≥ 2 years of age, and individuals aged ≥ 12 months in the EU, Australia, Canada, Brazil, and other countries. MenACYW-TT has been extensively evaluated in toddlers, children, adolescents and adults (including those over 65 years), – and more recently in infants from 6 weeks of age. A dose of MenACYW-TT in those primed 4–10 years previously with an MCV4 (MCV4-DT or MCV4-CRM), at age 10 years or older, was previously demonstrated to boost the immune response in adolescents and adults. Similarly, a dose of MenACYW-TT in children aged 4–5 years who received a primary dose of MenACYW-TT or MCV4-TT as toddlers also demonstrated robust boosting of the immune response.

The aim of this phase IIIb study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of MenACYW-TT 3–6 years after a priming vaccination with either MenACYW-TT or MCV4-CRM (Menveo, GSK) in adolescents and adults in the US, with and without co-administration of a MenB vaccine, and to evaluate the persistence of the immune response to MenACYW-TT and MCV4-CRM 3–6 years after vaccination.
