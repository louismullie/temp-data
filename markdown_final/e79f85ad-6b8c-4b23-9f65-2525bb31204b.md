## Question

what do you call the stage where ther is no active HSV infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the correct medical term is for the stage when there is no active HSV infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard natural history framework of HSV infection. Then, I should verify the precise definitions of "active" versus "inactive" infection. Next, I will check whether "latency" is the correct term and whether it truly implies no active replication. Finally, I will consider alternative terms like "quiescent" or "inactive" and confirm the most accurate, widely used terminology with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. HSV infection classically progresses from primary infection to establishment of latency, with subsequent reactivation episodes. This is a lifelong cycle, and the "inactive" stage corresponds to latency in sensory ganglia, not to cure or eradication of the virus.

> Wait, let me verify the definition of "active" infection. Active HSV infection refers to periods of productive viral replication with detectable shedding and, when symptomatic, mucocutaneous lesions. This includes primary infection and clinically apparent or subclinical reactivations, which are the times when transmission risk is highest [^114cbvYv] [^113tLF4D] [^111dH5pm].

> I should confirm the term for the inactive stage. The correct term is latency, during which HSV persists in a nonreplicative state within sensory neurons (trigeminal for HSV-1, sacral for HSV-2), typically without detectable shedding and without overt disease. Importantly, latency is lifelong and the virus can reactivate intermittently.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does "latency" truly mean zero activity? I need to check that nuance. While latency is classically described as a quiescent state, modern data indicate intermittent, low-level gene expression and immune surveillance in some neurons; nonetheless, clinically and virologically, this stage is considered nonproductive and "inactive" relative to lytic replication, aligning with the standard usage of the term [^113xZurJ].

> Let me consider synonyms. Terms like "quiescent infection", "dormant infection", or simply "inactive infection" are sometimes used colloquially, but the precise medical term is latency. I should double-check that these alternatives are not preferred in the literature, and they are not — latency remains the standard nomenclature in virology and clinical practice.

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final answer. The stage when there is no active HSV infection is called latency, reflecting lifelong, nonreplicative persistence in sensory ganglia with the potential for future reactivation [^113xZurJ].

The stage with no active HSV infection is called **latency** [^115ZmQDx], a dormant state in which the virus persists in sensory neurons without detectable shedding or symptoms. Latency is **lifelong** and can be interrupted by reactivation, producing recurrent disease. Clinically, this stage is also described as **inactive HSV infection** or **quiescent infection**.

---

## Definition and characteristics of latency

Latency is the **dormant stage** of HSV infection, characterized by:

- **Viral persistence**: HSV remains in sensory neurons (trigeminal for HSV-1, sacral for HSV-2) for life [^113sFWcW] [^115ZmQDx].

- **Minimal gene expression**: Only latency-associated transcripts (LATs) are expressed, with no detectable viral proteins or shedding [^notfound].

- **Immune evasion**: The virus avoids immune detection, allowing persistent infection without symptoms [^111KQFg6].

- **Reactivation potential**: Stress, immunosuppression, or other triggers can reactivate the virus, causing recurrent disease [^117J3x45].

---

## Molecular mechanisms underlying latency

HSV latency is maintained through **complex interactions** between viral and host factors:

- **Chromatin regulation**: HSV DNA is organized into heterochromatin, silencing lytic genes and promoting latency [^115ZmQDx].

- **Latency-associated transcripts (LATs)**: LATs regulate gene expression, inhibit apoptosis, and modulate host immune responses [^notfound].

- **Immune control**: Local immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cells, help maintain latency and prevent reactivation [^113xZurJ].

---

## Clinical implications of latency

Latency has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Lifelong infection**: HSV persists for life, with periodic reactivation causing recurrent disease [^113sFWcW].

- **Asymptomatic shedding**: Reactivation can occur without symptoms, enabling transmission [^114cbvYv].

- **Neurological complications**: Reactivation can cause encephalitis, keratitis, and other serious conditions [^113sFWcW] [^112NSW6o].

---

## Diagnostic methods for detecting latent HSV infection

Detecting latent HSV is challenging because the virus is **dormant and non-replicating**. Diagnostic methods include:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| PCR (polymerase chain reaction) | Detects HSV DNA in sensory ganglia or neurons | Invasive; limited clinical utility |
| In situ hybridization | Detects LATs in neuronal tissues | Invasive; limited availability |
| Serology | Detects HSV-specific antibodies | Cannot distinguish latent from active infection |

---

## Clinical terminology for inactive HSV infection

Clinically, latency is also described as:

- **Inactive HSV infection**: Indicates no active viral replication or shedding [^111ZCC3L].

- **Quiescent infection**: Emphasizes the dormant, non-active state of the virus [^113xZurJ].

- **Latent infection**: The standard medical term for the dormant stage [^113sFWcW].

---

## Factors influencing reactivation from latency

Several factors can trigger **reactivation** from latency:

- **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can weaken immune control, leading to reactivation [^117J3x45].

- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive drugs increase reactivation risk [^116kobey].

- **Hormonal changes**: Pregnancy or menstrual cycles can trigger reactivation [^117HCVjZ].

- **Ultraviolet radiation**: Sun exposure can reactivate oral HSV-1 [^116n95aP].

---

## Clinical management of latent HSV infection

There is **no cure** for latent HSV infection; management focuses on **preventing reactivation** and **reducing transmission**:

- **Antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir suppress reactivation and reduce shedding [^114mNPeo].

- **Suppressive therapy**: Long-term antiviral use reduces recurrence frequency and transmission risk [^112J6d3F].

- **Patient education**: Counseling on triggers, symptom recognition, and safe sex practices [^117Pig25].

---

The stage with no active HSV infection is called **latency**, a dormant state in sensory neurons with minimal gene expression and no shedding. It is **lifelong** and can reactivate, causing recurrent disease; management focuses on suppression and education [^115ZmQDx].

1 Why are herpesviruses important?

Herpesviruses are ubiquitous viral pathogens that cause a variety of clinically important diseases on a global scale, ranging from mild skin sores and rashes to blindness, congenital birth defects, cancer, and encephalitis. The reason for their prevalence and evolutionary success is attributable to their ability to enter into a latent state of infection that is maintained for the duration of the host's lifespan. This latent reservoir of virus evades immune clearance, which can periodically reactivate leading to recurrent disease and transmission to new hosts. Thus, understanding the cellular processes that regulate lytic and latent infection is essential to managing and treating the clinical conditions they cause. Such studies also provide fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms employed by viruses to evade host immune defences that influence the outcome of infection, offering new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

### Current thinking on genital herpes [^1172tkQw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Genital herpes has a high global prevalence and burden of disease. This manuscript highlights recent advances in our understanding of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.

Recent Findings

Studies demonstrate a changing epidemiological landscape with an increasing proportion of genital herpes cases associated with HSV type 1. There is also growing evidence that the majority of infected individuals exhibit frequent, brief shedding episodes that are most often asymptomatic, which likely contribute to high HSV transmission rates. Given this finding as well as readily available serological assays, some have proposed that routine HSV screening be performed; however, this remains controversial and is not currently recommended. Host immune responses, particularly local CD4 and CD8 T cell activity, are crucial for HSV control and clearance following initial infection, during latency and after reactivation. Prior HSV immunity may also afford partial protection against HSV reinfection and disease. Although HSV vaccine trials have been disappointing to date and existing antiviral medications are limited, novel prophylactic and therapeutic modalities are currently in development.

Summary

Although much remains unknown about genital herpes, improved knowledge of HSV epidemiology, pathogenesis and host immunity may help guide new strategies for disease prevention and control.

Methods

Model structure

We constructed an individual-based Monte Carlo simulation model describing sex partnering, birth and death, and HIV/HSV-2 transmission in a given population. Each individual is born, dies, forms/dissolves marital/nonmarital partnerships, or acquires HIV/HSV-2 at event-specific probabilities at each time step in each simulation run. Transmission was assumed to occur only through sex. An initial population of 2000 individuals was assumed (for computational reasons), but this population can vary with time by random birth/death events. The model was structured as a one-sex model to avoid complexities in the definitions and analytics of network statistics. As our present interest is on the natural dynamics as the HIV epidemics emerged in SSA, we did not incorporate more recent intervention scale-up such as HIV antiretroviral therapy. Final analyses were conducted at endemic equilibrium for both infections.

Infection natural history and transmission

HIV/HSV-2 natural history and transmission parameters, and infection stage structures, were based on earlier work and recent data updates (Table 1). HIV progression was divided into the stages of acute, chronic, and advanced with durations of 49 days, 9 years, and 2 years, respectively – based on compilation of data and analyses of cohort studies. AIDS mortality was included as a hazard rate. HIV transmission probability per coital act per stage was based on analyses of the Rakai study.

HSV-2 natural history was described by the stages of primary infection, latent infection, and reactivation. Viral shedding was assumed to occur only during primary infection and reactivations at a frequency of 14% of the time. HSV-2 transmission probability per coital act during shedding was determined through several analyses. Based on evidence of the pattern, sites, and frequency of subclinical reactivations, all seropositive persons were assumed equally infectious regardless of clinical symptoms.

With the conflicting evidence on the biological interaction of HIV and HSV-2, and on the potential effects of any interaction on HIV acquisition and transmission, no HIV/HSV-2 biological interaction was assumed.

### Invasion of herpes simplex virus type 1 into murine epidermis: an Ex vivo infection study [^115VF6an]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) invades its human host via the skin or mucosa. We aim to understand how HSV-1 overcomes the barrier function of the host epithelia, and for this reason, we established an ex vivo infection assay initially with murine skin samples. Here, we report how tissue has to be prepared to be susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Most efficient infection of the epidermis was achieved by removing the dermis. HSV-1 initially invaded the basal epidermal layer, and from there, spreading to the suprabasal layers was observed. Strikingly, in resting stage hair follicles, only the hair germ was infected, whereas the quiescent bulge stem cells (SCs) were resistant to infection. However, during the growth phase, infected cells were also detected in the activated bulge SCs. We demonstrated that cell proliferation was not a precondition for HSV-1 invasion, but SC activation was required as shown by infection of aberrantly activated bulge SCs in integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-deficient hair follicles. These results suggest that the status of the bulge SCs determines whether HSV-1 can reach its receptors, whereas the receptors on basal keratinocytes are accessible irrespective of their proliferation status.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115f5YQi]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

### Cellular state landscape and herpes simplex virus type 1 infection progression are connected [^1159rPip]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Prediction, prevention and treatment of virus infections require understanding of cell-to-cell variability that leads to heterogenous disease outcomes, but the source of this heterogeneity has yet to be clarified. To study the multimodal response of single human cells to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, we mapped high-dimensional viral and cellular state spaces throughout the infection using multiplexed imaging and quantitative single-cell measurements of viral and cellular mRNAs and proteins. Here we show that the high-dimensional cellular state scape can predict heterogenous infections, and cells move through the cellular state landscape according to infection progression. Spatial information reveals that infection changes the cellular state of both infected cells and of their neighbors. The multiplexed imaging of HSV-1-induced cellular modifications links infection progression to changes in signaling responses, transcriptional activity, and processing bodies. Our data show that multiplexed quantification of responses at the single-cell level, across thousands of cells helps predict infections and identify new targets for antivirals.

### The host response to herpes simplex virus infection [^116GiSwG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Infection with herpes simplex virus remains a significant cause of disease. The host immune system plays an important role in containing viral replication, and there has been considerable progress in defining which components of immunity are key to the resolution of infection. Nevertheless, effective immunoprophylaxis or immunotherapy has not yet been achieved.

Recent Findings

Recent work has focused on understanding the early events leading to the herpes simplex virus-specific immune response, in particular on the role of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Herpes simplex virus has evolved a number of ways of interfering with antigen presentation by dendritic cells, thus presumably impeding or delaying the host immune response. Nevertheless, herpes simplex virus triggers strong cellular and humoral immunity. The ability of dendritic cells to take up dead or dying infected cells and cross-present them to cognate T cells may be the key to resolving this apparent paradox. Interaction between dendritic cell subsets, and particularly the virus-induced release of type I interferons may be essential to drive efficient antigen cross-presentation and subsequent T-cell activation.

Summary

A greater understanding of the importance of dendritic cells in driving viral immunity, and of the ligands that activate these cells and the cytokines they secrete, has provided novel vaccination strategies. The delivery of immunomodulatory genes together with viral antigens, for example by DNA vaccination, may harness the full potential of dendritic cells, and achieve the goal of effective immunological control of herpes simplex virus.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UWQPD]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase between Jan 1, 2003, and May 25, 2017, to identify studies of the relative risk (RR) of HIV acquisition after exposure to HSV-2 infection either at baseline (ie, prevalent infection) or during follow-up (ie, incident infection), published since the review by Freeman and colleagues. For PubMed, we searched for articles and abstracts using the terms ("HIV", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human immunedeficiency virus", "human immune deficiency virus", OR "human immuno deficiency virus") AND ("HSV", "herpes simplex", "herpes virus type 2", "herpes virus 2", "herpesvirus 2", "genital herpes" OR "herpes genitalis"). Articles in PubMed were also searched with the Medical Subject Headings terms ("herpes simplex" OR "simplexvirus") AND ("human immunodeficiency virus", "HIV infection", "HIV antibodies", "HIV seronegativity", OR "HIV seroprevalence"). We included studies if they were a cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including case-control studies nested within a cohort or controlled trial); were designed to assess the effect of preceding HSV-2 infection, compared with HSV-2 negativity, on HIV acquisition (ie, excluding case-control studies based on samples from only one point in time and studies that only looked at the effect of pre-existing HIV infection on HSV-2 acquisition); and determined the HSV-2 infection status of study participants with an antibody-type-specific assay.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115TDSwN]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis — layer-specific pathogenesis and treatment — states that manifestations can be distinguished by corneal layer involvement and that different layers reflect distinct mechanisms. HSV dendritic epithelial keratitis occurs due to direct infection of corneal epithelial cells and requires antiviral therapy, whereas HSV stromal keratitis is primarily attributed to immune mechanisms and typically requires a combination of antiviral and topical corticosteroid therapy. The rational and proper choice of therapeutic intervention is critically dependent on proper characterization of the keratitis.

### Refractory and resistant herpes simplex virus mucocutaneous infections in immunocompromised patients: literature review and proposed definitions for use in clinical trials [^1152yd8s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the most prevalent viral infections worldwide. In general, host immunity is sufficient to clear viral shedding and recurrences, although it is insufficient to prevent subsequent virologic reactivations. In immunocompromised patients, prolonged and difficult-to-treat HSV infections may develop. The diagnosis of refractory HSV infection is based on the lack of clinical response to nucleoside analogs. Antiviral resistance is confirmed via genotypic and/or phenotypic testing. To provide consensus definitions of refractory and/or resistant (R/R) HSV mucocutaneous infections for clinical trial use, the HSV Resistance Working Group of the Transplant Associated Viral Infections Forum, which includes international clinicians, scientists, industry representatives, and regulatory officials, conducted a literature review of previously published data related to R/R HSV infections in immunocompromised patients. We propose definitions of R/R HSV mucocutaneous infections, which will be subject to re-evaluation and revision based on forthcoming data and future studies.

### Genital herpes infection: progress and problems [^114mNPeo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes (GH) is a sexually transmitted infection causing recurrent, self-limited genital, buttock, and thigh ulcerations. Symptoms range from unrecognized or mild to severe with frequent recurrences. Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type-1 or type-2 cause GH. HSV establishes latency in sacral ganglia and causes lifelong infection. Viral reactivation leads to genital ulceration or asymptomatic shedding which may lead to transmission. HSV infection during pregnancy can cause fulminant hepatitis and neonatal transmission. Severe and atypical manifestations are seen in immunocompromised people. Guanosine analogs treat symptoms and prevent recurrences, shedding, and transmission. Novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are in development.

### Herpes simplex virus… [^115UABfG]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Sometimes, the viruses cause mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, they can also cause more troublesome forms of herpes simplex. As neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons, particularly in sensory ganglia. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and may cause new sores. Most sexual transmissions of HSV-2 occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle, or hard-to-notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection, so acquiring the virus is possible even if no active HSV blisters or sores are present.

Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II of the infected host. Immediate early genes, which encode proteins, for example, ICP22 that regulate the expression of early and late viral genes, are the first to be expressed following infection. Early gene expression follows, to allow the synthesis of enzymes involved in DNA replication and the production of certain envelope glycoproteins. Expression of late genes occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encodes proteins that form the virion particle. Five proteins from form the viral capsid
- UL6, UL18, UL35, UL38, and the major capsid protein UL19. Cellular entry Entry of HSV into a host cell involves several glycoproteins on the surface of the enveloped virus binding to their transmembrane receptors on the cell surface.

Many of these receptors are then pulled inwards by the cell, which is thought to open a ring of three gHgL heterodimers stabilizing a compact conformation of the gB glycoprotein so that it springs out and punctures the cell membrane. The envelope covering the virus particle then fuses with the cell membrane, creating a pore through which the contents of the viral envelope enters the host cell. The sequential stages of HSV entry are analogous to those of other viruses. At first, complementary receptors on the virus and the cell surface bring the viral and cell membranes into proximity. Interactions of these molecules then form a stable entry pore through which the viral envelope contents are introduced to the host cell. The virus can also be endocytosed after binding to the receptors, and the fusion could occur at the endosome.

In the case of a herpes virus, initial interactions occur when two viral envelope glycoproteins called glycoprotein C and glycoprotein B bind to a cell surface polysaccharide called heparan sulfate. Next, the major receptor binding protein, glycoprotein D, binds specifically to at least one of three known entry receptors. Once bound to the HVEM, gD changes its conformation and interacts with viral glycoproteins H and L, which form a complex. The interaction of these membrane proteins may result in a hemifusion state. gB interaction with the gH/gL complex creates an entry pore for the viral capsid. gB interacts with glycosaminoglycans on the surface of the host cell. Immune evasion HSV evades the immune system through interference with MHC class I antigen presentation on the cell surface, by blocking the transporter associated with antigen processing induced by the secretion of ICP-47 by HSV.

### Treatment of HSV infection in late pregnancy… [^117HCVjZ]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best way to manage genital herpes simplex virus infection in late pregnancy. Evidence-Based Answer Pregnant women with a primary or recurrent episode of genital HSV infection who are later than 36 weeks of gestation should be treated with acyclovir or valacyclovir for viral suppression. Suppressive therapy at the time of delivery can reduce the rate of recurrence, the risk of asymptomatic viral shedding, and the number of cesarean deliveries because of active HSV infection. Women with active lesions at the time of labor should have a cesarean delivery to decrease vertical transmission of HSV. Acyclovir prophylaxis is more cost-effective than expectant management with cesarean delivery in women with a history of genital HSV infection, with or without recurrence during pregnancy.

Evidence Summary Among women with recurrent genital HSV infection, approximately 75 percent can expect at least one recurrence during pregnancy, and approximately 14 percent will have prodromal symptoms or clinical recurrence at delivery. 1, 2 A Cochrane review of seven randomized controlled trials with 1, 249 participants found that women with a primary or recurrent episode of genital HSV infection who received antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir starting at 36. weeks of gestation were significantly less likely to have a recurrence at delivery. 3 Suppression therapy with either drug significantly decreased the number of cesarean deliveries required because of HSV infection. The rate of asymptomatic HSV shedding at time of delivery also decreased. The effect of antiviral prophylaxis on neonatal HSV infection could not be estimated because of a low incidence rate. Valacyclovir is considerably more expensive than acyclovir. A large prospective cohort study of 58, 362 pregnant women was conducted to determine the effect of cesarean delivery on neonatal transmission of HSV. 4 Of the 202 women with active HSV infection at the time of labor, neonatal HSV infection occurred in 1. 2 percent of infants from cesarean delivery compared with
7. 7 percent of infants delivered vaginally.

In patients with a history of genital HSV infection, antiretroviral prophylaxis starting at 36 weeks of gestation has been shown to be more cost-effective than expectant management with cesarean delivery for active lesions at the time of delivery. 5, 6 In women with recurrent HSV infection in pregnancy, the estimated savings were $0. 8 million per case of neonatal HSV infection averted and $1. 8 million per neonatal death or case of disability averted. 6 For women with a history of genital HSV infection but no recurrence in pregnancy, suppressive therapy could save approximately $20 per person and increase total quality-adjusted life years by 0.
01. 7 Considering the 160, 000 women who could benefit from the therapy each year, this becomes a savings of $3. 2 million in direct medical costs and an increase of 1, 600 quality-adjusted life years. There are no studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis with valacyclovir.

### Challenges in genital herpes simplex virus management [^117Pig25]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Development of serologic assays to detect antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoproteins (g)G1 and (g)G2 has allowed accurate definition of the seroprevalence of HSV-2 worldwide. Studies from all continents indicate epidemic proportions of HSV-2 infection. In the United States, 1 in 5 sexually active adults is infected. In Africa and the Caribbean, HSV prevalence is higher. Since the development of the acyclic nucleoside derivatives acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir, treatment of mucocutaneous HSV is a practice of everyday medical care. Yet, despite effective drugs, there is widespread discontent by clients and providers about care of patients with genital herpes. Much of this relates to transmission complexities and the varied natural history of the infection. However, over time, most patients adjust to their disease and the medical and psychosocial complications. Recent studies show condoms reduce transmission, providing an important tool for counseling the patient with newly diagnosed genital herpes.

Serology — diagnostic role in herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis: Serology has a limited role in diagnosis in most cases, and HSV-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels may fluctuate such that a negative result does not absolutely rule out infection; immunoglobulin M (IgM) is found in primary HSV infection and seroconversion with IgG typically occurs 2–4 weeks after infection. Serology may be useful in children and young adults when testing shows HSV-specific IgM indicating primary infection or no antibodies (making HSV less likely), and may be useful in atypical disease. When ordering HSV serology, request both IgG and IgM for HSV-1 and HSV-2, and serial titers tested one month apart can be informative. Pros include "ease, widely available", whereas cons include "low specificity, low utility".

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115wKPNF]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus keratitis treatment guideline — methods and key to ratings — uses methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually using a scale based on SIGN, and that grade is listed with the study citation, while recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence and the body of evidence quality ratings are defined by GRADE. The SIGN Study Rating Scale defines: I++ "High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias"; I+ "Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias"; I- "Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias"; II++ "High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies" and "High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal"; II+ "Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal"; II- "Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal"; III "Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)"; and III* "Interventional case series". Studies not assigned a SIGN Level were labeled "NA: Reviews, Basic Scientific Research, Textbook Chapters, Cost-Effective Analysis, Survey Studies, and Diagnostic Testing".

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection [^117SnCa8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and HSV-2 infections are highly prevalent worldwide and are characterized by establishing lifelong infection with periods of latency interspersed with periodic episodes of reactivation. Acquisition of HSV by an infant during the peripartum or postpartum period results in neonatal HSV disease, a rare but significant infection that can be associated with severe morbidity and mortality, especially if there is dissemination or central nervous system involvement. Diagnostic and therapeutic advances have led to improvements in mortality and, to a lesser extent, neurodevelopmental outcomes, but room exists for further improvement.

### Chromatin control of herpes simplex virus lytic and latent infection [^115ZmQDx]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) can undergo a lytic infection in epithelial cells and a latent infection in sensory neurons. During latency the virus persists until reactivation, which leads to recurrent productive infection and transmission to a new host. How does HSV undergo such different types of infection in different cell types? Recent research indicates that regulation of the assembly of chromatin on HSV DNA underlies the lytic versus latent decision of HSV. We propose a model for the decision to undergo a lytic or a latent infection in which HSV encodes gene products that modulate chromatin structure towards either euchromatin or heterochromatin, and we discuss the implications of this model for the development of therapeutics for HSV infections.

### Characterizing the transitioning epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 1 in the USA: model-based predictions [^112aVQzJ]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a highly contagious and lifelong infection, with high prevalence and rapid acquisition during childhood. It is estimated that there were 118 million new infections globally in 2012, much higher than that of HSV-2 infection at 19 million. HSV-1 infection is never cleared and is endemic globally. The virus is typically transmitted through contact with cold sores or via contact with oral secretions during asymptomatic shedding, such as when children share utensils or food. Symptomatic infection is often characterized by oral or facial lesions at the initial portal of entry. The infection can cause a spectrum of diseases, such as herpetic whitlow, gingivostomatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, and corneal blindness.

HSV-1 can also be transmitted (during asymptomatic or symptomatic shedding) through oral sex or sexual intercourse, resulting in genital herpes, given the genital portal of entry. While HSV-2 infection is more transmissible sexually from males to females than from females to males, current evidence cannot distinguish such sex differential for HSV-1 infection. There is evidence indicating that the proportion of first-episode genital herpes due to HSV-1 has increased steadily in industrialized countries, resulting in HSV-1 becoming recognized as a key sexually transmitted infection (STI). While HSV-2 antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) continues to decline in the United States (US), and thus genital herpes due to HSV-2 is declining, emerging data suggest that genital herpes due to HSV-1 is increasing. In a study of college students in the US, the percentage of genital herpes attributed to HSV-1 (as opposed to HSV-2) increased from 31% in 1993 to 78% in 2001. A recent cohort study reported that nearly 60% of new genital herpes cases were attributed to HSV-1. Similar trends have been observed in other industrialized countries.

### Genital herpes [^111dH5pm]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent genital inflammation and lesions.
- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1 transmitted through sexual contact.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules, papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis (women), and proctitis (homosexual men). Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrent episodes may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pains in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

For pregnant persons with a clinical history suggestive of HSV without laboratory confirmation, HSV screening may be helpful, and repeat serologic testing may be indicated. In symptomatic pregnant persons, antiviral therapy may be indicated; cesarean delivery is recommended for pregnant persons with active genital lesions or prodromal symptoms. The CDC does not recommend routine serologic screening for HSV-2 in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: from the maternal infection to the child outcome [^116nWLpd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This review examines the recent literature on the management of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in neonates. We summarized the three clinical categories of maternal HSV infection during pregnancy (primary first episode, nonprimary first episode, or recurrent episode) and the mechanisms of fetal damage. Considering when the transmission of the infection from the mother to the fetus/newborn occurs, three types of neonatal infection can be distinguished: intrauterine infection (5% of cases), postnatal infection (10% of cases), and perinatal infections (85% of cases). Neonatal presentation could range from a limited disease with skin, eye, and mouth disease to central nervous system disease or disseminated disease: the treatment with acyclovir should be tailored according to symptoms and signs of infection, and virological tests. These children need a multidisciplinary follow-up, to timely intercept any deviation from normal neurodevelopmental milestones. Prevention strategies remain a challenge, in the absence of an available vaccine against HSV.

### Towards an understanding of the molecular basis of herpes simplex virus latency [^111TWLUX]. Virus Research (2005). Low credibility.

The survival strategy of herpes simplex virus centres on the establishment of latency in sensory neurons innervating the site of primary infection followed by periodic reactivation to facilitate transmission. This is a highly evolved and efficient survival mechanism, which despite being the subject of intense research, has proven remarkably difficult to dissect at a molecular level. This review will focus on data, emerging from both in vitro and in vivo model systems, which provide a framework for a mechanistic understanding of latency and the existence and possible significance of non-uniform latent states.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116kobey]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) epidemiology in adults and adolescents with HIV — Among people aged 14 to 49 years in the United States as of 2016, HSV-1 seroprevalence is 47.8% and HSV-2 seroprevalence is 11.9%. HSV-1 has become an increasing cause of first-episode genital herpes, causing up to 42% of infections in young adult heterosexual women and 76% in young adult men who have sex with men in Sydney, Australia between 1992 to 2006. In one study early in the HIV epidemic, approximately 60% of people with HIV were HSV-2 seropositive and 96% were seropositive for either HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition two- to threefold, and in HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected people not taking effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HSV-2 reactivation and shedding is increased and HSV-2 reactivation is associated with increased HIV RNA levels in plasma and genital secretions.

### Single-cell RNA-sequencing of herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells connects NRF2 activation to an antiviral program [^111th1hT]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Herpesvirus infection initiates a range of perturbations in the host cell, which remain poorly understood at the level of individual cells. Here, we quantify the transcriptome of single human primary fibroblasts during the first hours of lytic infection with HSV-1. By applying a generalizable analysis scheme, we define a precise temporal order of early viral gene expression and propose a set-wise emergence of viral genes. We identify host cell genes and pathways relevant for infection by combining three different computational approaches: gene and pathway overdispersion analysis, prediction of cell-state transition probabilities, as well as future cell states. One transcriptional program, which correlates with increased resistance to infection, implicates the transcription factor NRF2. Consequently, Bardoxolone methyl and Sulforaphane, two known NRF2 agonists, impair virus production, suggesting that NRF2 activation restricts viral infection. Our study provides insights into early stages of HSV-1 infection and serves as a general blueprint for the investigation of heterogeneous cell states in virus infection.

### Herpes simplex virus encephalitis: new infection or reactivation? [^113sFWcW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, course, and therapy of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), the most fatal viral encephalitis, in which prognosis is dependent on early diagnosis and effective therapy.

Recent Findings

Herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are human neurotropic viruses that establish latent infection in dorsal-root ganglia for the entire life of the host. From this reservoir, they can reactivate to cause human morbidity and mortality. HSE is one of the most devastating disorders caused by these viruses. The biology of their ability to establish latency, maintain it for the entire life of the host, reactivate, and cause primary and recurrent disease is being studied in animal models and in humans. Of special interest is the question whether HSE is the result of primary infection or is it the outcome of reactivation. The present review covers the biological, medical, and neurological aspects of HSE, focusing among others on recent molecular findings of gene expression during latent infection of HSV-1.

Summary

Despite accumulating knowledge, there are still several issues regarding both pathogenesis and therapy of HSV-1 that currently defy understanding.

### Herpes simplex virus neurovirulence across the human lifespan [^112NSW6o]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The ability of herpes simplex virus (HSV) to establish lifelong latency in sensory neurons makes it one of the most pervasive viruses worldwide. Although most HSV infections are asymptomatic or cause limited cutaneous symptoms, some give rise to serious central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. Both primary HSV infection and subsequent reactivation events can cause viral replication and spread within the brain, ultimately leading to pathologic inflammation and direct CNS damage. In addition to fulminant presentations of HSV encephalitis, subclinical HSV CNS infections have been implicated in neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and neurodegenerative impairment. Here, we review the pathogenesis of HSV infection and resulting CNS manifestations across the human lifespan. Identifying the mechanisms of HSV-induced CNS damage, and therefore the populations at highest risk for neurological morbidity, may provide a better understanding of the role viruses play in neurological diseases and inform novel approaches to treatment.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^115yvpAc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous in human infections. In most cases, HSV infections in individuals with an intact immune system are relatively mild and can cause discomfort, but often go unnoticed. In rare instances, HSV can enter the bloodstream, leading to more severe manifestations affecting multiple regions of the skin, the viscera, and the central nervous system. This is especially true for neonates and individuals with an immunocompromised status, for whom HSV infections or reactivations can be life-threatening. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection, for example, can result in devastating outcomes, with an untreated mortality rate of approximately 80% and up to 30% even with antiviral therapy. In solid organ transplantation recipients, HSV infection or reactivation can also lead to more severe manifestations, including esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and potential graft loss. Therefore, achieving a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis of HSV bloodstream infections is crucial in clinical settings. Rapid diagnosis enables timely administration of antiviral treatment, influences patient management decisions for those at high risk, and can contribute to shorter hospital stays, thereby reducing healthcare costs.

Definitions used

To align with our previous WHO estimates of the annual incidence and prevalence of HSV-2 and genital HSV-1 infection, we defined an individual as having 'recently-acquired' infection if up to 1 year since HSV infection acquisition, and as having an 'established infection' if more than 1 year since HSV acquisition. We defined a first episode of GUD as the first noted GUD symptoms, regardless of whether those symptoms occur before or after HSV seroconversion (ie, development of new HSV type-specific antibodies on infection). A first episode is generally thought to occur within the first year since HSV infection acquisition, and for the purpose of these estimates we assumed that the first episode always occurs within the first year. An occurrence of GUD symptoms subsequent to the first episode was termed a recurrence. For a full list of the definitions used, please refer to table 1.

### The cycle of human herpes simplex virus infection: virus transport and immune control [^114Qc9do]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

After infection of skin or mucosa, herpes simplex virus enters the sensory nerve endings and is conveyed by retrograde axonal transport to the dorsal root ganglion, where the virus develops lifelong latency. Intermittent reactivation, which is spontaneous in humans, leads to anterograde transport of virus particles and proteins to the skin or mucosa, where the virus is shed and/or causes disease. Immune control of viral infection and replication occurs at the level of skin or mucosa during initial or recurrent infection and also within the dorsal root ganglion, where immune mechanisms control latency and reactivation. This article examines current views on the mechanisms of retrograde and anterograde transport of the virus in axons and the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity that control infection in the skin or mucosa and in the dorsal root ganglion — in particular, the role of interferons, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and interferon- gamma and other cytokines, including their significance in the development of vaccines for genital herpes.

### Herpes simplex virus infections of the newborn [^1149jPRD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are fortunately quite rare in the neonatal population. Nevertheless, due to their life-threatening nature and the tremendous damage that surviving infants can incur, neonatal HSV is actually considered in a differential diagnosis relatively commonly. The availability of safe and effective antiviral therapy for the management of neonatal HSV also can accelerate a clinician's decision to consider HSV as the cause of a neonate's disease presentation, and then to obtain appropriate diagnostic studies and empirically institute antiviral treatment. Decisions on whether to continue antiviral therapy for a full course are predicated on the appropriate interpretation of these diagnostic studies as they subsequently are reported to the treating physician. For HSV-infected neonates, the duration of parenteral acyclovir therapy ranges from 14 to 21 days, depending on the extent of disease. Use of subsequent oral suppressive antiviral therapy is under investigation in randomized controlled trials, and at this time cannot be routinely recommended. This article will summarize the current state of neonatal HSV disease presentation, diagnosis, and management.

### The management of herpes simplex virus infections [^114ZYPtY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus persists in a latent form for the life of its host, periodically reactivating and often resulting in significant psychosocial distress for the patient. Currently no cure is available. Antiviral therapy is the main treatment modality, used either orally, intravenously, or topically to prohibit further replication of the virus and thereby minimize cellular destruction. However, immunologic advances in the treatment and prevention of herpes simplex infections are promising and continue to be studied.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^1139tzwc]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections can result in serious morbidity and mortality. Many of the infections result from asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus after a primary episode of genital HSV in the third trimester. Antibodies to HSV-2 have been detected in approximately 20 percent of pregnant women, but only 5 percent report a history of symptomatic infection. All primary episodes of HSV and secondary episodes near term or at the time of delivery should be treated with antiviral therapy. If active HSV infection is present at the time of delivery, cesarean section should be performed. Symptomatic and asymptomatic primary genital HSV infections are associated with preterm labor and low-birth-weight infants. The diagnosis of neonatal HSV can be difficult, but it should be suspected in any newborn with irritability, lethargy, fever or poor feeding at one week of age. Diagnosis is made by culturing the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and fluid from eyes, nose and mucous membranes. All newborns suspected to have or who are diagnosed with HSV infection should be treated with parenteral acyclovir.

### Management of neonates born to mothers with active genital herpes simplex virus infection: an alternative approach [^117RYRix]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although considered a rare disease, neonatal HSV infection represents a disease in urgent need of preventive strategies, as it results in substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes its current epidemiology and discusses guidances on the management of the asymptomatic neonate born to mothers with active genital HSV infection.

Recent Findings

Timely detection and early high-dose acyclovir treatment of neonatal HSV infection decreases mortality. All neonates born to mothers with active genital HSV infection in the third trimester or at delivery should be tested for HSV infection. The newborn management has depended on whether the mother has experienced a primary or recurrent genital HSV infection based on maternal serologic testing and PCR testing of the genital lesion. An alternative strategy on neonatal management is proposed that is based on type of maternal HSV infection and perinatal risk factors.

Summary

The incidence of neonatal HSV infection is increasing with more infections due to HSV-1 than HSV-2. Guidances addressing management of the asymptomatic newborn exposed to active maternal genital HSV infection are discussed.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^114PLcoF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

HSK is an infection of the cornea caused by HSV. Primary infection is the result of direct exposure of the host's mucous membranes to infectious HSV. Following primary infection and the establishment of latency in the sensory ganglia, the virus can be stimulated to enter an infectious cycle, from which it returns to the cornea. Once there, this recurrent infection can cause various complications, in particular an inflammatory response, which if strong enough can compromise the integrity of the cornea, leading to corneal scarring and in severe cases blindness.

HSK is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the findings of the split-lamp examination. Dendritiform epithelial lesions on slit-lamp examination are pathognomonic for keratitis. However, previous studies have shown that ocular lesions caused by cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster, adenovirus, and fungal infections have been misdiagnosed as HSK lesions. Other diagnostic tests, such as PCR assay, ELISA, IFA, and viral cultures, have provided a more definitive diagnosis, but have their own limitations. Additionally, variation in different subtypes of keratitis has made diagnosis of atypical lesions more difficult.

Accurate and prompt diagnosis is necessary to aid the physician to know which treatment will have the best outcomes and thus prevent further complications. Latency of HSV has prevented pharmacotherapy from eliminating the virus. Current pharmacotherapy treatments have helped decrease recurrence and maintain latency, but secondary infections can still occur. Recurring lesions increase a patient's risk of developing fibrosis, scarring, and neovascularization of the cornea. SK, an immunomodulated response, is the major cause of decreased corneal sensation and blindness. Acyclovir is not effective against the inflammatory stage of SK, as there is little virus to be found during peak inflammation. It should be noted that each episode of recurrent infection increases the risk of subsequent episodes and further complicates clinical management.

### Cellular state landscape and herpes simplex virus type 1 infection progression are connected [^113JNPUR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Single-cell heterogeneity in virus infections involves diverse cellular responses to infections as well as variable infection progressions, which together determine disease outcomes. For example in several life-threatening viral infections immune responses of single cells correlate with disease progression –.

Importantly, the source of cell-to-cell variability in virus infections remains unclear. Genetic diversity in virus populations only partially explains variation in influenza virus infections. Kinetics of poliovirus infections suggest that cellular and viral factors determine heterogeneity at different infection stages. It is also known that cell cycle, size, and neighborhood affect cell-to-cell variation in infections. Thus, single-cell studies indicate that infection heterogeneity is a result of a combined action of viral, cellular, and environmental factors.

We explored the possibility that the infection heterogeneity is connected to how the virus is able to alter the cellular state consisting of the physicochemical status and neighborhood of individual cells. As a model virus, we used herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) that is a highly prevalent human pathogen. During a lytic infection, the viral nucleocapsid enters the cytoplasm and is transported to the nuclear pores where the double-stranded DNA genome is released into the nucleus, transcribed, and replicated. Based on the sequential expression, the > 80 known HSV-1 genes are classified into immediate-early, early, and late. Primary infection of epithelial cells starts a lytic replication cycle of HSV-1 and is followed by life-long latency in peripheral neurons and periodic reactivation. HSV-1 infections are often asymptomatic, but re-entry to a productive replication cycle after reactivation can result in blisters or sores, typically in oral, perioral and ocular sites. Infections of the central nervous system may result in viral meningitis or encephalitis. In immunocompromised individuals, HSV-1 infections can have high morbidity and mortality.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1178v3Qb]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) serologic screening for genital herpes infection — For asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, do not routinely screen for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (Grade: D). This applies to routine screening of adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection; "asymptomatic" refers to persons without known past or current history of genital herpes and includes persons who may have unrecognized infection, and persons who are known to have genital herpes and are between outbreak occurrences are not considered to be asymptomatic for this recommendation. The recommendation does not apply to persons who present to clinicians requesting testing due to a history, signs, or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes or persons with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive disorders, and it is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. Rationale notes that routine serologic screening is limited by the low predictive value of the widely available serologic screening tests and the expected high rate of false-positive results likely to occur with routine screening of asymptomatic persons in the US; antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons but in asymptomatic persons with serologic evidence of HSV, the rationale for antiviral treatment is unclear. Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI); infection is lifelong with currently no cure for HSV infection, and neonatal herpes infection is uncommon but can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 in Europe: systematic review, meta-analyses and meta-regressions [^111e6MNz]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes a latent and mostly asymptomatic infection, and is typically acquired orally during childhood. Infection is lifelong, with most viral shedding occurring through subclinical short-duration reactivations on the oral mucosa. When symptomatic, HSV-1 can result in a number of adverse outcomes and sequelae such as mucocutaneous conditions and central nervous system complications. The historical pattern of HSV-1 epidemiology appears to be changing, at least in a few regions. Studies show a decrease in early acquisition of HSV-1, a decline in seroprevalence among youths and an increase in genital herpes cases caused by HSV-1. The disease burden of this infection, alongside its evolving epidemiology, has drawn the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO) and global partners, who are leading an international multisectorial effort focused on understanding the epidemiology of the virus and developing a HSV vaccine.

Under this guise, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review to characterise HSV-1 epidemiology in Europe. We also used meta-analytical methods to provide robust estimates for HSV-1 seroprevalence across different populations, as well as proportions of HSV-1 detection in genital ulcer disease (GUD) and in genital herpes. We further assessed associations and temporal trends for these outcome measures.

### Glycoprotein targeted therapeutics: a new era of anti-herpes simplex virus-1 therapeutics [^112cTN4K]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is among the most common human pathogens worldwide. Its entry into host cells is an intricate process that relies heavily on the ability of the viral glycoproteins to bind host cellular proteins and to efficiently mediate fusion of the virus envelope with the cell membrane. Acquisition of HSV-1 results in a lifelong latent infection. Because of the cycles of reactivation from a latent state, much emphasis has been placed on the management of infection through the use of DNA synthesis inhibitors. However, new methods are needed to provide more effective treatment at earlier phases of the viral infection and to prevent the development of drug resistance by the virus. This review outlines the infection process and the common therapeutics currently used against the fundamental stages of HSV-1 replication and fusion. The remainder of this article will focus on a new approach for HSV-1 infection control and management, the concept of glycoprotein-receptor targeting.

3 THE STRATEGY BY WHICH HSV EVADES MONITORING BY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

Observations from epidemics of HSV infection worldwide suggest a characteristic clinical feature in which a high ratio of serum positivity, which reaches more than 50% in the population, is associated with viral latency in the nervous system, which can lead to viral reactivation in infected individuals. 7 This process has been demonstrated to be caused by the latent infection of neurons by HSV. 30 On the basis of data from studies of HSV pathogenesis, this conclusion is reasonable. The only uncertainty is whether viral latency, which depends on the process of viral entry into neurons from epithelial tissue, might lose control of the activated innate immune response during viral infection or still retain control because of the strong neurotropic characteristic of HSV. 94, 95 Although there are many examples of neurotropic viruses that have the characteristics of intense neurotropism and a shorter proliferative cycle than HSV, a lower rate of neuron infection was observed for these viruses than for HSV. 96 In contrast, neuron infection by HSV is observed in 100% of virus‐infected individuals. Thus, it is logical to infer that HSV possesses the capability to interfere with innate immunity, as innate immunity is activated by viral infection in the epithelial tissue of infected individuals. 97 Data from epidemics have also suggested that the high rate of serum positivity in the population does not prevent a high incidence of HSV infection; eg, approximately 23 million new cases of HSV2 infection are reported each year. 8 Thus, the immune response induced in infected individuals, which usually involves specific neutralizing antibody and cytotoxic responses, is not capable of defending against viral reinfection or latent virus reactivation. This viral characteristic is reported to be an immune evasion strategy 98 and is probably due to viral interference with the immune system by various encoded viral proteins. 99 To understand this process, it is necessary to review the details of the interactions between the virus and the innate and adaptive immune systems.

### Immune control of herpes simplex virus during latency [^113xZurJ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) persists within the host in the presence of concomitant immunity by establishing a latent infection within sensory neurons. HSV-1 latency is widely viewed as a neuron-enforced quiescent state of the virus, in which a lack of viral protein synthesis prevents recognition of the infected neuron by the host immune system. On the basis of recent findings, however, we propose a more dynamic view of HSV-1 latency characterized by persistent or intermittent low-level viral gene expression in some latently infected neurons. We further propose that HSV-1-specific memory/effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes that are retained in the ganglion in close apposition to the neurons prevent full reactivation and virion formation through IFN-gamma production and an additional undefined mechanism(s).

### MTORC2 confers neuroprotection and potentiates immunity during virus infection [^117J3x45]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a double stranded DNA virus, which causes one of the most notorious viral infections known to humanity. Globally, an estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) harbor HSV-1 virions for life and contribute to high transmission rate via symptomatic and/or asymptomatic shedding of the virus. More commonly, HSV-1 causes fever blisters and cold sores but it is also known to cause distressing ocular infections leading to blindness in untreated patients and, in severe cases, life threatening diseases such as viral encephalitis or meningitis which in turn, may result in permanent nervous system damage in surviving patients. After primary infection, HSV-1 remains latent in neuronal tissues including the trigeminal ganglia and reactivates under stress situations. In general, about 74 viral proteins usurp the host assembly to make the host microenvironment permissive to virus replication in neurons as well as the mucosal epithelium, which forms the common site for symptomatic infection and virus shedding. During the infection, several host proteins combat HSV-1 replication by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. Host cells also activate stress responses, including programmed cell death, which limits spread of virus. Although apoptosis plays an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, excessive cell death in neurons during neuronal HSV-1 infection may be detrimental to host survival. This phenomenon might be one of the reasons behind severities during viral encephalitis. Exploring the role of pro-survival host factors including key signaling mechanisms may shed light on new ways to combat severe HSV-1 infections.

### Gene editing for latent herpes simplex virus infection reduces viral load and shedding in vivo [^112qwQaJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Human infection with HSV is lifelong, and while current antiviral approaches can reduce symptoms and transmission, they do not cure. As such, there is a strong unmet desire for new and potentially curative approaches for HSV. Here we extend our previous study of gene editing as a potential curative therapy for HSV in three important ways. First, we established a model of HSV reactivation in mice using a small molecule, to show that a reduction in ganglionic HSV loads via gene editing results in a significant reduction in viral shedding from mice with established orofacial infection. Second, we demonstrated high efficacy of gene editing of latent HSV in DRG after genital HSV infection. Third, we reduced or even eliminated the hepato- and neurotoxicity detected in some animals by decreasing the AAV dose, simplifying the therapy regimen, and using a cell type-specific promoter. Together, these findings address several of the major drivers of interest in HSV cure, and support further development of gene editing for HSV infection.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) clinical manifestations — Orolabial herpes is the most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection, with oral lesions evolving from papule to vesicle, ulcer, and crust; in untreated persons, the course of illness is 5 to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year. The majority of individuals with HSV-2 seropositivity have clinically silent infection, and genital herpes is typically caused by HSV-2, though HSV-2 can also cause orolabial herpes; genital HSV-1 is clinically indistinguishable from HSV-2 but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often. Typical genital mucosal or skin lesions evolve through papule, vesicle, ulcer, and crust, and viral shedding on mucosal surfaces occurs frequently and can result in transmission. HSV shedding occurs more frequently in people with HIV with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those without HIV or with higher CD4 counts.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^116n95aP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Recurrent labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. The decision whether or not to treat recurrent labial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of the quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, and those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with > 5 episodes/year, severe recurrences or unrecognisable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations, including herpetic whitlow, neonatal infection, disseminated and atypical cutaneous infections, traumatic herpes, eczema herpeticum, and HSV-associated erythema multiforme. HSV infection may also represent a complication following cosmetic procedures of the oro-facial region, surgical and dental interventions, sun exposure and burns. Precise treatment guidelines for these HSV infections are not firmly established.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation. A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and selection of the appropriate methodology is paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy. In this article we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^113AvZFS]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Disease modifiers in HSV-1 ocular disease — The severity and likelihood of recurrent HSV-1 ocular disease may be determined by the virulence of the infecting virus strain, the general susceptibility of the host to herpes virus infections and to the particular infecting strain, and the local susceptibility of the host target tissue. Research investigations in laboratory animals have shown that different HSV-1 strains vary widely in their capacity to induce disease, although these studies have not been translated to human patients, and little is known about HSV strain differences in the propensity to cause severe and/or recurrent human disease. The general susceptibility of the host to ocular HSV infections depends on the overall status of the host immune system, and various conditions and age can reduce the immune system's effectiveness in preventing ocular HSV recurrences; individuals may experience more severe disease or more frequent recurrences of HSV keratitis when their immune response is compromised. Any condition that depresses cell mediated immunity may increase the risk of HSV disease, and published literature suggests that individuals with depressed cell mediated immunity — such as after organ transplant or with diabetes mellitus, measles, or HIV — may experience more severe disease or more frequent recurrences of HSV keratitis.

### Defining nervous system susceptibility during acute and latent herpes simplex virus-1 infection [^111TZGkf]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses are neurotropic human pathogens that infect and establish latency in peripheral sensory neurons of the host. Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) readily infects the facial mucosa that can result in the establishment of a latent infection in the sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (TG). From latency, HSV-1 can reactivate and cause peripheral pathology following anterograde trafficking from sensory neurons. Under rare circumstances, HSV-1 can migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and cause Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE), a devastating disease of the CNS. It is unclear whether HSE is the result of viral reactivation within the TG, from direct primary infection of the olfactory mucosa, or from other infected CNS neurons. Areas of the brain that are susceptible to HSV-1 during acute infection are ill-defined. Furthermore, whether the CNS is a true reservoir of viral latency following clearance of virus during acute infection is unknown. In this context, this review will identify sites within the brain that are susceptible to acute infection and harbor latent virus. In addition, we will also address findings of HSV-1 lytic gene expression during latency and comment on the pathophysiological consequences HSV-1 infection may have on long-term neurologic performance in animal models and humans.

### Toll-like receptors as novel therapeutic targets for herpes simplex virus infection [^116dBa3V]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seropositivity for HSV reaches more than 70% within the world population, and yet no approved vaccine exists. While HSV1 is responsible for keratitis, encephalitis, and labialis, HSV2 carriers have a high susceptibility to other STD infections, such as HIV. Induction of antiviral innate immune responses upon infection depends on a family of pattern recognition receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLR). TLRs bridge innate and adaptive immunity by sensing virus infection and activating antiviral immune responses. HSV adopts smart tricks to evade innate immunity and can also manipulate TLR signaling to evade the immune system or even confer destructive effects in favor of virus replication. Here, we review mechanisms by which HSV can trick TLR signaling to impair innate immunity. Then, we analyze the role of HSV-mediated molecular cues, in particular, NF-κB signaling, in promoting protective versus destructive effects of TLRs. Finally, TLR-based therapeutic opportunities with the goal of preventing or treating HSV infection will be discussed.

### The immunobiology of herpes simplex virus encephalitis and post-viral autoimmunity [^116TvfCo]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HSE is a devastating disease with antiviral treatments being the core management strategy. Despite this, the morbidity and mortality rate remains high. The neuroimmunological evolution of HSE is an important research area. Further understanding could reveal genetic predispositions and novel treatment paradigms tailored to the particular stage of the disease. Moreover, the immunopathogenesis of post-HSE AE requires further study, with the aim to provide biological evidence to inform future clinical trials. Relevant peripheral biomarkers of germinal centre activation may stratify patients with HSE by their individualized risk of secondary autoimmunization. This could facilitate pre-emptive use of precision immunotherapeutics in those patients most likely to benefit from such treatments while simultaneously reducing exposure of low-risk patients to any potential risks associated with broad immunosuppression. Elucidation of the underlying biology at this CNS-peripheral neuroimmune interface is likely to translate directly to other research areas of neuroinflammation related to different forms of brain injury or viral-mediated neuroinflammation.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112fMEv8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and ~48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and ~12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

### Rapid host immune response and viral dynamics in herpes simplex virus-2 infection [^114cbvYv]. Nature Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) is periodically shed throughout the human genital tract. Although a high viral load correlates with the development of genital ulcers, shedding also commonly occurs even when ulcers are absent, allowing for silent transmission during coitus and contributing to high seroprevalence of HSV-2 worldwide. Frequent viral reactivation occurs within ganglia despite diverse and complementary host and viral mechanisms that predispose toward latency, suggesting that viral replication may be constantly occurring in a small minority of neurons at these sites. Within genital mucosa, the in vivo expansion and clearance rates of HSV-2 are extremely rapid. Resident dendritic cells and memory HSV-2 specific T cells persist at prior sites of genital tract reactivation and, in conjunction with prompt innate recognition of infected cells, lead to rapid containment of infected cells. The fact that immune responses usually control viral replication in genital skin before lesions develop provides hope that enhancing such responses could lead to effective vaccines and immunotherapies.

### Characterizing the transitioning epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 1 in the USA: model-based predictions [^111ZCC3L]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Mathematical model

A deterministic dynamical model was constructed to describe the oral and sexual HSV-1 transmission in a given population — in this case, the US population (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The model was structured based on current understanding of the natural history and epidemiology of this infection. The model consisted of a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations that stratify the population into compartments according to age, HSV-1 status and stage of infection, and level of oral or sexual risk of exposure. The model was coded and analyzed in MATLAB R2016b.

The model accommodated two forms of exposure to HSV-1 by initial portal of entry. Individuals can be exposed orally leading to symptomatic or asymptomatic infection — both labeled thereon as oral herpes infection. They can also be exposed genitally leading to symptomatic or asymptomatic infection — both labeled thereon as genital herpes infection. Oral herpes can occur as a result of oral-to-oral transmission (believed to be the main mode of transmission) or genital-to-oral transmission (through oral sex). Genital herpes can occur as a result of oral-to-genital transmission (through oral sex) or genital-to-genital transmission (through sexual intercourse).

HSV-1 natural history in the model varied by form of exposure (oral versus genital herpes) and included the two main stages of HSV-1 shedding (through primary infection or reactivations) and no shedding (while in latency). Primary infection and reactivations were assumed equally transmissible, with an average infectiousness. Susceptible individuals (regardless of HSV-2 status) who acquired HSV-1 for the first time developed primary infection followed by latent infection and reactivations throughout a lifetime. Of note is that primary infection is often more symptomatic and severe than reactivations. Those in latent infection episodically reactivated their infection, whether oral or genital, and shed the virus during this reactivation (Additional file 1: Figure S1). HIV status was not incorporated into the model, and thus did not affect HSV-1 natural history.

### Single-cell RNA-sequencing of herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells connects NRF2 activation to an antiviral program [^115T1PLz]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The characterization of cellular heterogeneity due to the activation of different host pathways and the progression of viral infection is of great interest. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) efforts provide an unbiased characterization of virus–host interactions in individual cells, which are masked at the population level –. However, deeper insights into unique molecular signatures and discovery of specific cell subsets can be obtained by increased sequencing depth and the application of advanced analytical approaches to study the course of viral infections.

Here, we profile deep transcriptomes of tens of thousands of individual cells harvested before and at several times post HSV-1 infection. Our results relate the progression of infection to cell cycle phases, and define a precise temporal order of viral gene expression. The depth of data and using unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA) as a predictor for future cell states allows us to connect the course of infection to the activity of specific host cell genes and pathways. Particularly, we investigate the relationship of HSV-1 infection and the transcription factor NRF2, which is activated during infection, and demonstrate that the NRF2 agonists Bardoxolone methyl and-sulforaphane impair a productive viral replication. Overall, our study provides insights into early stages of HSV-1 infection, and an analytical framework to study viral infections using scRNA-seq.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection does not influence viral dynamics during early HIV-1 infection [^114Rvsrs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to compare baseline and longitudinal plasma HIV-1 loads between herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)-seropositive and -seronegative individuals who are enrolled in a primary HIV-1 infection cohort in San Diego, California.

Design

The study was a retrospective cohort analysis.

Methods

We categorized antiretroviral-naive subjects on the basis of HSV-2 serostatus at baseline using an HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay. Low positive results (1.1–3.5) were confirmed by Western blotting. We compared baseline HIV-1 loads of the 2 groups using a linear model. To detect differences in HIV-1 dynamics, we analyzed longitudinal viral loads using a flexible semiparametric model, controlling for the time to antiretroviral therapy and stratifying by HIV-1 infection stage at entry.

Results

We studied 294 adult men. Ninety percent reported sex with men as their main HIV-1 risk factor. The seroprevalence of HSV-2 was 41.5%. The HSV-2-seropositive and -seronegative groups had similar baseline HIV-1 loads during acute infection (5.52 vs. 5.72 log(10) copies/mL; p = 0.39) and early infection (4.57 vs. 4.67 log(10) copies/mL; p = 0.5). Longitudinally, the difference in HIV-1 loads between HSV-2-seropositive and -seronegative men remained close to 0 during the first year of infection.

Conclusions

HSV-2 serostatus has minimal influence on the dynamics of HIV-1 during acute and early HIV-1 infection.

### Recent advance in management of herpes simplex in Japan [^11613rnX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex, a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), is transmitted through contact of the skin/mucous membrane and establishes latency in the sensory ganglia for the rest of the life of the host. HSV occasionally reactivates and forms blisters around the lips or genitalia in some patients. Repeated overt symptoms, and, much more frequent, subclinical reactivation in the mucosa, make the host retain anti-HSV immunity continuously, resulting in maintaining steadily elevated antibody titer at any point after infection. Clinical symptoms differ in primary infection and recurrence. Primary infections sometimes manifest as severe symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy in addition to blisters/erosions of the skin, gingiva, lips, and oral mucosa, while recurrent herpes is generally mild. Diagnosing typical herpes simplex is not difficult, but when the course and manifestations are typical, definitive tests to identify HSV infection are limited since serology is not useful except with primary infection. For treatment, safe and effective oral antiviral drugs are available. Patient-initiated therapy is a new method of administration labeled in Japan. Amenamevir, an inhibitor of viral helicase primase, is available in Japan and labeled in addition to herpes zoster. These new diagnostic and therapeutic tools should be used for better management of herpes simplex.

### Fifteen minute consultation: managing neonatal and childhood herpes encephalitis [^114ffSS5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

What advice should we give to pregnant women who have genital HSV in the final weeks of pregnancy?

HSV primary infection in the third trimester presents a significant neonatal risk, and delivery by caesarean section is advised followed by neonatal screening for HSV (see below). Babies born vaginally should be started on intravenous aciclovir at birth. Women with primary HSV infection in the first or second trimester should be prescribed oral or intravenous aciclovir, followed by daily suppression with oral aciclovir from 36 weeks of gestation to reduce the chances of lesions being present at delivery.

In recurrent HSV infection, the risks are less, but if active lesions are present at delivery then delivery by caesarean section may be considered. For vaginally delivered babies, there are little data to guide initiation of aciclovir, and there is variable practice. We would recommend minimising the risk of a devastating illness by treating all infants born to mothers with active lesions.

All babies born to mothers with suspected or proven active HSV should be screened for HSV by mucosal (conjunctiva, pharynx, rectum) and skin swabs taken between 12 and 24 h of age, even after caesarean section delivery. If HSV is detected, intravenous aciclovir treatment should be continued/initiated.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tLF4D]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are two global health problems. In 2015, 36.7 million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS globally. In 2012, an estimated 417 million people aged 15–49 years had HSV-2 infection.70% of HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa, which also has the highest HSV-2 prevalence.HSV-2 causes genital herpes, which, when symptomatic, is characterised by periodic recurrences of painful genital ulcers. Although genital herpes is asymptomatic or unrecognised in about 80–90% of individuals, asymptomatic viral reactivation and shedding are common. Thus, although individuals with HSV-2 are most infectious when they are symptomatic, most transmissions are thought to occur when the source partner is asymptomatic. Genital HSV-2 infection can considerably affect relationships through feelings of shame and stigma and concerns about risk of transmission.

HIV and HSV-2 are both lifelong sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are associated with similar risk factors (eg, age, sex, partner change rate, condom use, male circumcision). Additionally, evidence exists of direct and reciprocal biological interactions between HIV and HSV-2. Active HSV-2 infection, regardless of symptoms, involves high concentrations of activated CD4-positive T cells, which are target cells for HIV, in the genital area and can lead to breaks in the mucosal layer through which HIV can enter. Because genital ulceration and viral shedding occur most frequently in the first year of HSV-2 infection, the increase in HIV susceptibility might be highest for incident HSV-2 infections. Co-infection with HIV increases HSV-2 genital shedding and transmissibility, while HSV-2 infection correlates with increased HIV viraemia and transmissibility.

### Modeling human HSV infection via a vascularized immune-competent skin-on-chip platform [^112TBzKs]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) cause life-long oral and genital recurrent disease and affect > 3.7 billion people worldwide. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause neonatal herpes, resulting in high mortality and long-term neurological impairment, while genital HSV-2 infection is also a leading risk factor for increased HIV acquisition and transmission –. Standard acyclovir antiviral suppressive therapy that limits HSV disease severity and shortens outbreak duration does not reduce HIV risk and faces increasing drug resistance –. Candidate vaccines that show promise in murine models have failed in human clinical trials, thus demanding alternative platforms for understanding HSV pathogenesis in the human system.

Deciphering in vivo multifaceted and collaborative host responses to HSV infection in humans remains challenging, despite our great efforts and the invaluable insights gained from sequential skin biopsies obtained from HSV-2 infected individuals –. Access to HSV-2-affected human skin requires skillful clinicians and dedicated medical spaces, and is clinically restrained in size, number, location, and timing. Further, the self-reported nature of an outbreak makes it difficult to capture early events of virologic and immunologic importance (< 48 h), which are critical in determining disease outcomes. As such, the early kinetics of the immune response and mechanisms of defense are poorly defined in human HSV infection, contributing to knowledge gaps in human immune protection against viral infection.

### Treatment of herpes simplex virus infections in pediatric patients: current status and future needs [^111RPNWf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are members of the Herpesviridae family and are characterized by their ability to establish latency after primary infection and subsequently reactivate. HSV infections in the neonatal and pediatric populations range from uncomplicated mucocutaneous diseases to severe, life-threatening infections involving the central nervous system (CNS). The antiviral agent acyclovir has significantly improved treatment outcomes of HSV infections, including the frequency of mucocutaneous recurrences and mortality associated with CNS and disseminated infections.

### Characteristics of herpes simplex virus infection and pathogenesis suggest a strategy for vaccine development [^112eFfKU]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

4.1 Tactics forvaccine development

In recent decades, different types of HSV vaccines, including inactivated vaccines, peptide vaccines containing various antigenic structures, and replication‐deficient vaccines, have been investigated for their efficacy and safety, 9 and these vaccines have been found to enable both cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in animals and neutralizing antibody production that blocked viral entry into cultured cells in classic neutralization assays. 20, 146 However, a clinical trial of these vaccine candidates suggested that there were no clinical protective effects on human subjects, even though the immune response induced in rodent animal models was identified as being capable of protecting against viral attack. 9 This finding seems to suggest that the designed vaccine‐induced immune response, which was mainly based upon the antigenic structure of viral surface glycoproteins, might not target various virus‐encoded proteins that play roles in viral pathogenesis. Importantly, this characterized pathological process presents not only as vesicle lesions in epithelial and/or mucosal tissues but also as a modified phenotype of innate immune cells, including DCs and ILCs. The immune response elicited by HSV vaccine candidates based on viral glycoproteins cannot be restimulated by various antigenic molecules from virus‐encoded proteins that are expressed transiently at different stages of infection, and antibodies and CTLs specific for viral surface proteins cannot control various pathological lesions triggered by the interactions of many viral molecules with cellular molecules in tissues. Furthermore, if the characterized pathogenesis of HSV infection is recognized as a systematic dynamic outcome of the interactions between virus‐encoded molecules and cellular components, effective vaccine‐induced immunity would comprise not only neutralizing antibodies specific for viral surface protein‐binding receptors and/or specific CD8 cytotoxic T‐cell subsets in local tissues but also an antibody profile capable of neutralizing various viral molecules that enable interactions with host cells and a specific CTL response against infected cells presenting various viral antigens. However, to achieve this type of vaccine‐mediated immunity, the design for the HSV vaccine would be required to achieve the objectives presented below (Figure 3):
The vaccine candidate should have a viral replication cycle that mimics the HSV replication cycle but is substantially weaker and sufficiently long to ensure the activation of the local innate immune system and the subsequent activation of adaptive immunity.
The vaccine candidate should be capable of inducing the expression of the main viral molecules with pathological effects and exposing them to the host immune system.
The vaccine candidate should be designed to be readily taken up by antigen presenting cells, including DCs and/or ILCs and macrophages, without interference with antigen presentation processes or induction of cellular apoptosis events.
The vaccine candidate should efficiently remove viral molecules with serious pathological effects and be unable to lead to pathological lesions in host tissues.
Ideally, the vaccine candidate should itself possess no neurotropic infectivity, as described by Richards et al in a recent publication. 95 To satisfy these biological requirements in a vaccine candidate, a complex antigenic structure or an attenuated strain integrated with mutated structural genes could be generated with molecular techniques.

### Early events in HSV keratitis – setting the stage for a blinding disease [^114RZ6zZ]. Microbes and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen herpes simplex virus (HSV)-induced stromal keratitis (SK) research shift from being a topic only of interest to vision researchers to one that fascinates the general field of inflammatory disease. Studies on experimental mouse lesions have uncovered several fundamental processes that explain lesion development. In this model, the chronic immuno-inflammatory lesions are mainly orchestrated by CD4+ T cells, but multiple early events occur that set the stage for the subsequent pathology. These include virus replication, the production of key cytokines and chemokines, neovascularization of the avascular cornea and the influx of certain inflammatory cell types. Many of these early events are subject to modulation, providing an approach to controlling this important cause of human blindness. We also comment on events ongoing during chronic SK, debating whether or not these represent virus-induced or autoimmune lesions.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111kt5Ks]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (primary prevention), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to advise HSV-2-seronegative patients with HIV infection to ask their partners to be tested using HSV type-specific serology before initiating sexual activity to reduce the risk of transmission of HSV-2.

### Antiviral therapy for HSV… [^1152LrNZ]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

1 A woman who experiences a primary episode of genital HSV during the third trimester and who has not completed seroconversion by the onset of labor has a 33 percent chance of transmitting the virus to her infant. 2 In contrast, a woman experiencing a secondary reactivation of HSV during the intrapartum period has approximately a 3 percent chance of transmitting the virus to her infant. 2 Of known infected infants, only 30 percent have mothers who had symptomatic HSV or a sexual partner with clinical infection. 3 Many neonatal infections occur because of asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus, usually after a primary episode of HSV infection.
3. 5 Transmission occurs from an HSV-2-positive partner and is often traced to asymptomatic shedding of virus. Symptomatic and asymptomatic primary genital HSV infections are associated with preterm labor and low-birth-weight infants.

6, 7 Because of the high prevalence of HSV among adults, physicians should be aware of the risk of a primary HSV infection in a pregnant woman and its potential consequences to the fetus. The diagnosis of neonatal HSV can be difficult initially. The presentation is nonspecific, with signs and symptoms such as irritability, lethargy, fever or failure to feed at about one week of age. The infant was brought to the emergency department the following day with a one-day history of poor breast-feeding, lethargy and an axillary temperature of 38. 7°C. The examination was significant for mild lethargy, mild jaundice and a few scattered petechiae on the chest. Sepsis work-up was done and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a white blood cell count of 2 per mm. Diagnosis of HSV Infections The hallmark of primary episode genital HSV infections in adults is multiple painful vesicles in clusters on an inflamed surface.

Associated symptoms may include pruritus, dysuria, vaginal discharge and tender regional lymphadenopathy. There is often a systemic prodrome of fever, malaise and myalgias one to two days before the appearance of lesions. Secondary episodes of genital herpes are similar, but they often are associated with fewer lesions and are unilateral on the genitals. The symptoms of secondary episodes are usually less severe with few systemic symptoms. A suspected genital HSV infection should be confirmed with a diagnostic test. Traditionally, this has been viral culture of vesicular fluid. Typically, it may take two to three days to receive a report. More rapid diagnosis may be obtained by direct immunofluorescent staining using fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to HSV. 10 The sensitivity of this test is 80 to 90 percent compared with viral culture. The polymerase chain reaction is a more sensitive assay.

An additional 9 percent of culture-negative women were PCR positive for HSV-2.
11. Diagnosis of an HSV infection in an infant requires a high index of suspicion because the history of an active infection, primary or secondary, in a mother is often not given. HSV infections should be considered in all neonates who present in the first month of life with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, poor feeding, lethargy or seizure. Any vesicular rash in an infant up to eight weeks of age should be cultured and the infant immediately started on antiviral therapy with acyclovir pending culture results. Cultures of blood, CSF, urine and fluid obtained from the eyes, nose and mucous membranes should also be obtained. CSF should be tested for HSV by PCR assay. Antiviral Therapy for HSV Infections All primary episodes of genital HSV infections should be treated with antiviral medications, including primary episodes occurring in pregnant women.

### European consensus-based (S2k) guideline on the management of herpes zoster-guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) in cooperation with the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), part 1: diagnosis [^115mghUn]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to HIV testing, EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for HIV infection in younger patients (possible cut-off ≤ 50 years of age) exhibiting widespread multidermatomal or recurrent HZ, particularly if lesions are simultaneously present in different disease stages and/or if other risk factors for HIV seropositivity are present.

### Herpes simplex type I (HSV-1) infection of the nervous system: is an immune response a good thing? [^114pqeyq]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) can induce a robust immune response initially thru the activation of pattern recognition receptors and subsequent type I interferon production that then shapes, along with other innate immune components, the adaptive immune response to the insult. While this response is necessary to quell virus replication, drive the pathogen into a "latent" state, and likely hinder viral reactivation, collateral damage can ensue with demonstrable cell death and foci of tissue pathology in the central nervous system (CNS) as a result of the release of inflammatory mediators including reactive oxygen species. Although rare, HSV-1 is the leading cause of frank sporadic encephalitis that, if left untreated, can result in death. A greater understanding of the contribution of resident glial cells and infiltrating leukocytes within the CNS in response to HSV-1 invasion is necessary to identify candidate molecules as targets for therapeutic intervention to reduce unwarranted inflammation coinciding with the maintenance of the anti-viral state.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^114XtmyH]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Prevention and early detection — long-term low-dose oral antiviral prophylaxis: In HEDS prophylaxis trials, the first clinical trial "recruited 703 immunocompetent patients who had experienced an ocular HSV episode in the previous year", and "investigated the efficacy of oral acyclovir (400 mg bid) versus placebo… over 12 months and 18 months". "During the 12-month treatment period, patients treated with oral acyclovir experienced approximately half as many recurrences of ocular HSV as the placebo group", with "no statistical difference… in the six months after cessation of treatment". Benefit was most evident in prior stromal disease: "Among patients with a history of HSV stromal keratitis only 14% experienced recurrences compared to 28% in the placebo group", whereas "among patients with a history of ocular HSV other than stromal keratitis, 4% developed HSV stromal keratitis compared to 3% in the placebo group". Based on this, "a long-term (one year or greater), low-dose oral antiviral prophylaxis is recommended for patients with a history of recurrent HSV stromal keratitis… (Strong Recommendation, Good Quality)".

### Indictment by association: once is not enough [^116Y8TWz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Temporality (ie, whether the infection precedes the disease) is addressed in longitudinal cohort studies, during which specimens and clinical data are collected at intervals from individuals who are followed over time. In such studies, each participant serves as his/her own control. Discriminatory power is enhanced if the time series begins before the initial exposure of interest and includes sampling during periods of health, as well as during periods of illness. If sampling begins during the acute phase of the disease being studied, critical information about temporality can be lost; fortunately, useful information can sometimes be gleaned from serologic responses that develop in the days and weeks that follow the initial event.

A key parameter in longitudinal studies is the sampling interval. Short intervals can be highly informative but can be expensive and logistically challenging. Home- and clinically-based daily sampling protocols were developed in Seattle for studies of genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infections. This work has helped to redefine our concept of HSV latency from one in which periods of virologic quiescence (organismal latency) are intermittently punctuated by relatively brief periods of overt viral activity that produce visible lesions and readily transmissible virus, to the more refined understanding that, in addition to readily visible reactivations, HSV frequently asymptomatically reactivates from neuronal latency, releasing small amounts of virus on what can be a nearly continuous basis.

Extending this home-based sampling model to human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B), Zerr et al were able to follow 277 children from birth to 2 years of age by enlisting family members to collect weekly saliva specimens and maintain daily health logs. In addition to revealing a broader range of symptoms and effects due to primary HHV-6 infection, the study further demonstrated the utility and practicality of home-based specimen and data collection. Specimens and data from this study provided the foundation for the new study by Martin et al. Keys to success for such studies include identifying the right specimen to collect, training study participants to collect and ship them properly, ensuring logistical convenience for study participants, performing batch analysis of specimens, and capturing detailed health diaries relevant to the agent being studied.

### Genital herpes: a review [^112J6d3F]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted disease, affecting more than 400 million persons worldwide. It is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and characterized by lifelong infection and periodic reactivation. A visible outbreak consists of single or clustered vesicles on the genitalia, perineum, buttocks, upper thighs, or perianal areas that ulcerate before resolving. Symptoms of primary infection may include malaise, fever, or localized adenopathy. Subsequent outbreaks, caused by reactivation of latent virus, are usually milder. Asymptomatic shedding of transmissible virus is common. Although HSV-1 and HSV-2 are indistinguishable visually, they exhibit differences in behavior that may affect management. Patients with HSV-2 have a higher risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Polymerase chain reaction assay is the preferred method of confirming HSV infection in patients with active lesions. Treatment of primary and subsequent outbreaks with nucleoside analogues is well tolerated and reduces duration, severity, and frequency of recurrences. In patients with HSV who are HIV-negative, treatment reduces transmission of HSV to uninfected partners. During pregnancy, antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir is recommended from 36 weeks of gestation until delivery in women with a history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be performed in laboring patients with active lesions to reduce the risk of neonatal herpes.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^114T6zB4]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis — clinical objective, purpose, and goals — identifies the objective as diagnosis and management of the patient with HSV infection of the cornea and the purpose as minimizing visual loss, relieving pain and discomfort, and minimizing structural corneal damage by improving diagnosis and management. Goals include recognizing risk factors for HSV keratitis and recurrence severity; establishing diagnosis and nomenclature (with diagnosis primarily made with a thorough ophthalmic exam and the use of appropriate diagnostic tests when a definitive diagnosis cannot be established clinically); promoting early diagnosis to prevent sight-threatening sequelae such as stromal scarring, astigmatism, neovascularization, ulceration, and perforation; and relieving pain and discomfort, preventing corneal complications related to undertreated or untreated inflammation or vision loss, persistent ulceration, stromal scarring, thinning, astigmatism, neovascularization, and lipid deposition, and preventing complications related to the inappropriate treatment of inflammation in the setting of active viral replication.

### A systematic review of the epidemiology and interaction of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 [^116EDnBK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore epidemiological evidence about the interaction of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and HSV-2 infections.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken of published epidemiological studies describing the pattern of HSV-1 or HSV-2 by age, and the coincidence of the two viral infections.

Results

In cross sectional studies the unadjusted odds of HSV-2 are greater in those with HSV-1 infection in study populations categorised as "low risk" (p = 0.06) and across European populations (p = 0.001). This was not evident in "high risk" populations or in the United States. This increased risk of HSV-2 in those with HSV-1 infection does not agree with the results of prospective studies where there is a non-significant trend towards a lower risk of HSV-2 infection associated with previous HSV-1 infection.

Conclusions

"Low risk" and European populations have a relatively low HSV-2 seroprevalence and infection is more concentrated in those with characteristics putting them at high risk for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. This confounding could mask any protective effect of HSV-1, which is hinted at, but not demonstrated, in prospective and adjusted studies.

### Herpes simplex virus and HIV-1: deciphering viral synergy [^114KqPXL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Recent proof-of-concept randomised controlled trials have shown a causal relation between herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infection and HIV-1 replication in co-infected individuals. We explore the mechanisms that may operate to enhance reciprocal viral replication. Direct interactions could involve HIV-1-related immune deficiency, disruption of mucosal barrier by HSV infection/reactivation, HSV-induced mucosal cell recruitment, transactivation of HIV-1 replication by HSV proteins, and immune modulation by HSV decoys. Indirect interactions might coexist through disturbances of the vaginal flora during HSV shedding and systemic immune activation. In co-infected individuals, suppressive HSV treatment reduces HIV-1 genital and systemic excretion. This finding is a likely result of efficacious prevention of HSV2 reactivations, and perhaps of other herpesviruses. Strategies to control HSV2 and other herpesviruses deserve urgent attention and should become part of the HIV-1 prevention and care package.

### Guidance on management of asymptomatic neonates born to women with active genital herpes lesions [^117GVbR8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the neonate is uncommon, but genital herpes infections in adults are very common. Thus, although treating an infant with neonatal herpes is a relatively rare occurrence, managing infants potentially exposed to HSV at the time of delivery occurs more frequently. The risk of transmitting HSV to an infant during delivery is determined in part by the mother's previous immunity to HSV. Women with primary genital HSV infections who are shedding HSV at delivery are 10 to 30 times more likely to transmit the virus to their newborn infants than are women with recurrent HSV infection who are shedding virus at delivery. With the availability of commercial serological tests that reliably can distinguish type-specific HSV antibodies, it is now possible to determine the type of maternal infection and, thus, further refine management of infants delivered to women who have active genital HSV lesions. The management algorithm presented herein uses both serological and virological studies to determine the risk of HSV transmission to the neonate who is delivered to a mother with active herpetic genital lesions and tailors management accordingly. The algorithm does not address the approach to asymptomatic neonates delivered to women with a history of genital herpes but no active lesions at delivery.

### A preclinical model for studying herpes simplex virus infection [^115TNNXD]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), the prototype of the α-herpesvirus family, infects 60%–80% of people worldwide. Upon primary infection via the skin and mucocutaneous regions, HSV can reach sensory neurons where latent infection is established. HSV-1 primary infections in humans are typically asymptomatic and are therefore difficult to study, but when symptomatic, replication of HSV-1 causes lesions around the oral mucosa (i.e. cold sores). Normally, skin forms an effective barrier to infection, but skin abrasions, burns, or atopic diseases are conditions favoring HSV susceptibility. HSV is a leading cause of encephalitis, genital ulcerative diseases, corneal morbidity, and blindness in humans and can trigger keratitis. Transmission of virus during birth in newborns and in immunocompromised individuals can be life threatening. Several animal models have been developed, leading to a better understanding of multiple aspects of HSV biology, pathogenesis, disease, and immunity. The species most commonly studied are mice, guinea pigs, rats, and rabbits, but models resembling human physiological conditions during HSV infection are limited.

For a successful invasion and infection of cells, particular surface receptors such as HVEM, 3- O -sulfated heparin sulfate, and nectin-1 have been described as essential. Five viral glycoproteins have been implicated in the viral entry process: gB, gC, gD, gH, and gL. Release of viral DNA into the nucleus allows initiation of transcription, replication of viral DNA, and assembly of progeny capsid within the host by the sequential expression of three gene classes (immediate-early, delayed-early, late genes). HSV-derived cytosolic nucleic acids trigger innate immune response genes in host cells, including type I IFN and proinflammatory genes (IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α), which are known to require the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways, respectively.
