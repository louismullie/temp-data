## Question

Dental hyperpigmentation lead poisoning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dental hyperpigmentation in lead poisoning, including how to recognize it, what it means diagnostically, how to confirm it, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific oral sign and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and how to distinguish mimics. Next, I will review the systemic context and laboratory confirmation. After that, I need to check management principles, including chelation thresholds and source control. Finally, I will consider special populations and prevention, and I will double-check any points that might be outdated or misremembered against current guidance and case data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical sign. The classic oral manifestation of lead poisoning is a blue-black line at the gingival margin, historically termed a Burton line, which reflects deposition of lead sulfide formed by the reaction of circulating lead with sulfhydryl groups released during oral bacterial activity; this is a pathognomonic mucocutaneous marker of lead toxicity and should immediately raise suspicion when seen on exam [^1143VspH] [^112rDSi3].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism so I don't overstate it. The blue-black hue arises from lead sulfide precipitating at the gingival sulcus where bacterial metabolism generates sulfide ions; this is a surface chemical deposition rather than melanin-driven pigmentation, which helps distinguish it from endocrine or drug-induced mucosal hyperpigmentation, and it correlates with elevated blood lead levels in exposed individuals [^1143VspH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — other causes of gingival hyperpigmentation exist, so I need to check the differential. Addison's disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Laugier-Hunzker syndrome, smoker's melanosis, drug-induced pigmentation (e.g., minocycline, antimalarials), and other systemic or neoplastic causes can all darken the gums; however, the linear, blue-black quality at the margin and the context of exposure risk favor a Burton line rather than melanocytic or endocrine etiologies, which tend to be diffuse, patchy, or macular and often have additional stigmata or medication history [^111iRZLC] [^112HxSFK] [^113TvbXc].

> I should confirm the systemic context because the oral sign rarely occurs in isolation. Patients with lead poisoning often have colicky abdominal pain, normocytic or microcytic anemia with basophilic stippling, elevated indirect bilirubin from hemolysis, and sometimes a "lead line" on long-bone radiographs reflecting metaphyseal deposition; recognizing this constellation alongside a Burton line strengthens the pretest probability before labs return [^1143VspH] [^114u8N2W] [^114bmaXj].

> Next, I should review how to confirm the diagnosis. I need to ensure a venous blood lead level is obtained, as capillary screens can be contaminated; if the capillary is elevated, I should confirm venous. Basophilic stippling on peripheral smear supports hematologic toxicity, and in children, dense metaphyseal bands on long-bone films are supportive radiologic evidence when blood lead is not immediately available; I should also remember that porphyria workups can be confounded by lead, so if I see isolated ALA elevation without PBG, I should double-check for lead before labeling porphyria [^111FE8RD] [^114u8N2W] [^114bmaXj] [^113oyWV2].

> Let me think about management, and I should double-check chelation thresholds. Source identification and removal are paramount; chelation is indicated for severe poisoning, with CaNa2EDTA and succimer (DMSA) as standard agents, and the CDC historically used 45 µg/dL as a pediatric treatment threshold, though contemporary guidance emphasizes that there is no safe blood lead level and management should be risk-based; I initially thought the current pediatric reference value remained 5 µg/dL, but wait, I should verify — CDC lowered the reference to 3.5 µg/dL in 2021, which triggers case management rather than chelation per se, so I need to align treatment decisions with current local protocols and severity criteria [^112MwsYo] [^115sMNmz] [^113UiTMa] [^116EofGn] [^111FE8RD].

> I will now examine supportive care and monitoring. Iron deficiency potentiates lead absorption, so correcting iron deficiency is important; anemia often improves after chelation as lead's enzyme inhibition and membrane effects reverse, and I should monitor for rebound rises in blood lead as bone stores redistribute, adjusting the chelation course accordingly and coordinating with environmental specialists for abatement [^111FE8RD] [^114EjBay].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has remote exposure with new symptoms? Bone lead can mobilize during pregnancy, lactation, or metabolic stress, producing acute-on-chronic toxicity without new exposure; in such cases, I should confirm the history carefully, consider maternal-fetal risks, and coordinate chelation timing with obstetrics and toxicology, recognizing that case reports document dramatic BLL increases from skeletal remobilization [^111j7m8c].

> Next, I should review special populations and prevention so I don't miss modifiable risks. Children with pica, those in older housing, users of folk remedies or contaminated spices, and workers in lead industries are high risk; screening policies vary, but targeted screening is prudent in high-prevalence settings, and public health case-finding is essential when a case is identified, as family members may share exposures such as adulterated turmeric or traditional medicines [^111FE8RD] [^116EofGn] [^115sMNmz].

> Let me reconsider the key teaching points to ensure internal consistency. The blue-black gingival Burton line is a highly specific clinical clue to lead poisoning when aligned with compatible systemic features; confirm with venous blood lead, look for basophilic stippling and supportive imaging, prioritize source removal, and use chelation according to current severity-based protocols while correcting iron deficiency and monitoring for rebound; I should also remember to distinguish this from melanin-based oral hyperpigmentations and drug-induced causes by morphology, distribution, and exposure history to avoid misdiagnosis and delay appropriate therapy [^1143VspH] [^111FE8RD] [^111iRZLC].

Dental hyperpigmentation in lead poisoning is most often a **Burton line** — a bluish-gray line at the gingival margin due to lead sulfide deposition from the reaction of circulating lead with sulfide from oral bacteria [^1143VspH]. It is a classic but not universal sign, more common in adults with occupational exposure and less frequent in children [^notfound]. Diagnosis relies on **blood lead testing** and supportive labs (CBC, smear for basophilic stippling, zinc protoporphyrin) [^114u8N2W]. Management includes source removal, supportive care, and chelation when indicated [^112MwsYo]; the line typically resolves with treatment and lead level decline [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of dental hyperpigmentation in lead poisoning

The mechanism involves **lead sulfide formation**: circulating lead reacts with sulfide ions from oral bacteria to form insoluble lead sulfide, which deposits at the gingival margin and appears as a bluish-gray line [^1143VspH]. This is a surface phenomenon rather than intrinsic tooth discoloration.

---

## Clinical appearance and distribution

- **Burton line**: a bluish-gray line at the gingival margin, typically along the upper and lower gums [^114u8N2W].
- **Distribution**: usually continuous and linear at the gingival margin; may be more prominent in areas of irritation or inflammation.
- **Associated features**: may coexist with other oral signs such as gingival inflammation, metallic taste, and halitosis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Blood lead level (BLL)**: the definitive test; levels ≥ 10 µg/dL are considered elevated and concerning [^115aKgND].
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: often shows anemia (normocytic or microcytic) [^1143VspH].
- **Peripheral smear**: basophilic stippling of erythrocytes is characteristic [^114u8N2W].
- **Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP)**: elevated due to lead's inhibition of heme synthesis [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other causes of oral hyperpigmentation to consider include:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| Amalgam tattoo | Localized bluish-gray discoloration | History of amalgam fillings |
| Melanin hyperpigmentation | Diffuse brown/black discoloration | No bluish-gray line |
| Medication-induced hyperpigmentation | Diffuse or localized discoloration | Medication history |
| Addison's disease | Diffuse mucosal hyperpigmentation | Systemic symptoms, adrenal insufficiency |

---

## Management strategies

- **Source identification and removal**: essential to prevent ongoing exposure [^111FE8RD].
- **Chelation therapy**: indicated for elevated BLLs, particularly ≥ 45 µg/dL; agents include EDTA and succimer [^113UiTMa] [^113jsEeM].
- **Supportive care**: address anemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological effects [^notfound].
- **Dental care**: regular oral hygiene and professional cleaning to reduce irritation and inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and reversibility

The Burton line typically **resolves with effective treatment** and declining BLLs; however, persistent discoloration may occur if exposure continues or if there is chronic gingival disease [^114EjBay].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **public health initiatives** — including lead-safe housing, water safety, and consumer product regulations — plus targeted screening of high-risk populations and education of healthcare providers and the public to recognize early signs of lead poisoning [^1135dzMp] [^111FE8RD].

### Facial hyperpigmentation and crusted papules on the hands [^1112qs9w]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Decreased activity in which enzyme plays a role in most cases of this patient's condition?
A. Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
B. Ferrochelatase
C. Porphobilinogen deaminase
D. Uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (UROD)
E. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase

Answers:

A. Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase – Incorrect. Inherited or acquired aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency causes acute porphyria.
B. Ferrochelatase – Incorrect. Inherited deficiency of ferrochelatase causes protoporphyria. Acquired deficiencies in ferrochelatase are due to lead poisoning and may cause acute porphyria.
C. Porphobilinogen deaminase – Incorrect. Deficiency in this enzyme results in acute intermittent porphyria.
D. UROD – Correct. PCT is caused by UROD deficiency, which may be inherited or acquired in the setting of hepatic dysfunction. In this case, excess oral iron supplementation led to UROD inhibition. Iron promotes the formation of nonporphyrin products that directly inhibit UROD, increase the formation of reactive oxygen species that oxidize uroporphyrinogen to uroporphyrin, and induce the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen precursors, leading to increased porphyrin production. Increased circulating porphyrins deposit in the skin, resulting in tissue damage after exposure to sunlight.
E. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase – Incorrect. Deficiencies in this enzyme are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and cause variegate porphyria.

### Folk prescription for treating rhinitis as a rare cause of childhood lead poisoning: a case series [^1176RHfK]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Absorption of lead

Ingestion and inhalation are the two primary modes of lead entry into the body. The former is more common in children due to hand-to-mouth activity, while the latter occurs more frequently in occupationally exposed adults. The percentage of lead absorbed from the gut depends on factors as follows: particle size, gastric pH, other material in the gut, and nutritional status of essential elements. Inhalational absorption through the lung depends on particle size.

The three patients had reportedly short-term exposures to nasal spray liquids for treating rhinitis that had extremely high lead concentrations. The short period of exposure is consistent with acute lead poisoning. This folk remedy was sprayed directly into the nostrils. All three children mentioned that they tasted and swallowed the liquid. Thus, the lead was potentially absorbed from multiple sites including the nasal mucosa, the lungs, as well as the gastrointestinal tract.

Diagnosis of lead poisoning

Abdominal pain caused by lead poisoning has been reported. Possibly the delay in diagnosis in our patients was due to a lack of awareness by the physicians of its features in children. This highlights the need to educate clinicians including subspecialists about this disease. Lead poisoning should be in the list of possible diagnoses for children with unexplained multi-systems symptoms, especially of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems.

These children also had detectable signs of lead poisoning. The line of gingival hyperpigmentation in the first patient has been described in occupationally lead exposed adults. He also had a "lead line" on long bone radiography. The width of the dense metaphysis has been reported to correlate with the length of the period of toxic exposure.

### Approach to reticulate hyperpigmentation [^116sYjo7]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Reticulate hyperpigmentation is a feature of a number of conditions, which differ in age of onset and distribution of the lesions. Associated clinical findings (e.g. hair, nail, teeth, systemic involvement), are used to differentiate between the conditions. Histopathological examination is useful in some disorders. Diagnosing the disorders is important, because the underlying causes may be treatable, and some of the disorders are associated with malignancies and life-threatening systemic involvement. In this review, I present a concise, systematic approach to the treatment of the patient with reticulate hyperpigmentation.

### Oral mucosal hyperpigmentation [^113p5GFy]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What histologic findings would be seen on biopsy?
A. Discrete nests of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction
B. Superficial dermal, yellow-brown nonrefractile coarsely granular pigment deposition
C. Basal melanin hyperpigmentation with superficial dermal melanophages
D. Spongiotic epithelium with dendritic, pigmented melanocytes through its full thickness
E. Iron deposition in salivary glands

Answers:

A. Discrete nests of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction – Incorrect. Junctional nevi present with melanocytic nests.
B. Superficial dermal, yellow-brown nonrefractile coarsely granular pigment deposition – Incorrect. Hydroxychloroquine-induced hyperpigmentation shows superficial dermal pigment deposition highlighted by Perls and Fontana-Masson stains suggestive of the presence of both iron and melanin.
C. Basal melanin hyperpigmentation with superficial dermal melanophages – Correct. Increased levels of MSH and ACTH trigger basal melanin hyperpigmentation in Addison's disease.
D. Spongiotic epithelium with dendritic, pigmented melanocytes through its full thickness – Incorrect. Melanoacanthoma is a self-limited, rapidly enlarging, hyperpigmented buccal mucosal lesion characterized by these histologic findings.
E. Iron deposition in salivary glands – Incorrect. Iron deposition in salivary glands, within the vascular and adnexal structure basement membranes, and in the dermis is characteristic of hemochromatosis.

### Oral mucosal hyperpigmentation [^1168AG5m]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome – Incorrect. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is characterized by the combination of oral mucosal hyperpigmentation and melanonychia in 50% to 60% of cases. Our patient lacked nail involvement.
B. Hemochromatosis – Incorrect. Hemochromatosis can present with bronzing of the skin, but this usually occurs late in the disease course. The oral mucosa is rarely involved.
C. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome – Incorrect. In Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the mucocutaneous pigmentation usually involves the palms, soles, and genitals in addition to the perioral region and buccal mucosa. The pigmentation frequently appears within the first few years of life.
D. Addison's disease – Correct. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency can develop brown hyperpigmentation in chronically sun-exposed areas, in regions of friction or pressure, surrounding scar tissue, and along the buccal mucosa. These patients also have systemic symptoms including volume depletion, orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The pigmentation seen on the buccal mucosa in Addison's disease is patchy and diffuse, in contrast to the discrete 1- to 5-mm brown or black macules involving the lips and buccal mucosa seen in Laugier-Hunziker and Peutz-Jeghers syndromes.
E. Cronkhite-Canada syndrome – Incorrect. Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is characterized by gastrointestinal polyposis with alopecia, onychodystrophy, and hyperpigmented macules on the face and extremities.

### The cockayne syndrome natural history (CoSyNH) study: clinical findings in 102 individuals and recommendations for care [^117Ha7AR]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dermatological and dental

In three individuals the presence of photosensitivity was unclear because of preemptive management. Twenty-three of 99 study participants have no dermal photosensitivity. Forty-six of 99 sunburn easily, but more explicit photosensitivity is present in only 40; these participants sunburn on cloudy days or blister following exposure to sunlight. Sun avoidance prevents issues among the latter group, whereas the former group effectively use simple measures, such as the use of sunscreen and hats. Individuals with CS are not at increased risk of developing skin cancers. Thinning hair and skin hyperpigmentation have been noted in previous reports and are present in 46 and 29% of our cohort, respectively, but they have no clinical significance. There is no evidence to support routine dermatology input in CS. Review may be required upon the initial presentation of more marked photosensitivity, however, and may be useful in individuals with dry or itchy skin. Dental caries, which likely represents enamel hypoplasia, has been reported more frequently in the literature than they occur in our cohort (46.4%). Nevertheless, families should be encouraged to maintain regular dental review so that problems relating to enamel hypoplasia can be addressed early.

Medication

We already highlighted (above and elsewhere) that metronidazole causes acute hepatic failure in CS, which may be fatal. The clinical presentation can be similar to an untreated paracetamol overdose, with extremely increased transaminase concentrations and significant clotting abnormalities. Metronidazole is therefore absolutely contraindicated in CS. Antibiotics of the same class should also be avoided, or used with extreme caution and close monitoring of liver function. There is no evidence of toxicity associated with drugs metabolized in the liver in general.

An exaggerated response to sedative and opioid medications — from respiratory depression to blunted affect lasting several days following administration of codeine — was reported in five cases.

### Imipramine-associated hyperpigmentation [^117TLk6j]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To inform clinicians of the potential for severe and persistent facial hyperpigmentation with the long-term use of imipramine.

Case Summary

A 65-year-old white male veteran with a history of paranoid schizophrenia was referred to the psychiatry service by a dentist who thought that the patient was both cyanotic and psychotic. The history and biopsy results indicated the possibility of imipramine-associated hyperpigmentation, only the second reported case in a male patient. The presentation was complex, with a history of neuroleptic exposure and multiple signs of parkinsonism. A brain single photon-emission computed tomography scan demonstrated frontal lobe hypermetabolism and bilateral caudate hypermetabolism, which normalized 14 months later. Despite discontinuation of imipramine, the patient continued to appear cyanotic, leading to worsening social isolation. He became known as "the man with the purple face". On his rare ventures outside the home, he was embarrassed by sporadic calls to 911 by persons fearing he was ill.

Discussion

Although facial hyperpigmentation secondary to the use of phenothiazines has been reported frequently, it is much less common with imipramine, and is very rare in males. Failure to recognize this adverse reaction led to continuing treatment with imipramine and to an apparently irreversible condition. The brain imaging findings have no link with the hyperpigmenting process, but raise questions about neuroleptic-induced metabolic changes in the brain.

Conclusions

Clinicians need to be aware of rare adverse reactions such as hyperpigmentation, and be prepared to take appropriate and early action to prevent such reactions from becoming irreversible.

### Hyperpigmentation throughout the body [^113rV4PA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Addison disease – Incorrect. Addison disease can present as hyperpigmentation on sun-exposed areas; however, none of the other symptoms of Addison disease are present. A blood test could be ordered to rule out this condition, but the lack of generalized fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, and mood changes make clinical observation sufficient evidence to rule out Addison disease.
B. Melasma – Incorrect. Although melasma presents as a brown facial pigmentation, it does not occur in the sclera. This patient presents with a gray pigmentation in the sclera, so melasma is ruled out.
C. Argyria – Incorrect. Although argyria can present as a gray color in sun-exposed areas including the eyes, the patient had no history of environmental exposure to silver and was not taking any silver-containing medications. Argyria also commonly presents in the mucous membranes, which was absent for this patient.
D. Nevus of Ota/Hori – Incorrect. While Nevi of Ota/Hori appear as brown or gray lesions on the eyes and face, new nevi do not typically form past the age of 30–40. These lesions are also most common in Asian populations whereas the patient described here is Caucasian.
E. MIH – Correct. Cutaneous gray or brown pigmentation is a documented effect of chronic minocycline use and is most common in patients taking 100–200 mg daily for over a year. The hyperpigmentation commonly occurs in the skin, nails, teeth, bones, conjunctiva, and sclera. This patient reported taking 100 mg daily by mouth for 11 and a half years and had pigmentation located in the skin and sclera.

### Oral mucosal hyperpigmentation [^116PzWCV]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the next most appropriate test for diagnostic confirmation?
A. Complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies
B. Colonoscopy
C. AM cortisol
D. Serum homogentisic acid
E. Late-night salivary cortisol

Answers:

A. CBC and iron studies – Incorrect. CBC and iron studies would be helpful to evaluate a case of suspected hemochromatosis, which is characterized by a normal CBC with an elevated ferritin and transferrin saturation. A diagnosis of hemochromatosis could be confirmed by screening for HFE gene mutations.
B. Colonoscopy – Incorrect. With a suspected diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers or Cronkhite-Canada syndrome, colonoscopy would be an appropriate test. Both syndromes are associated with the development of numerous hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract.
C. AM Cortisol – Correct. Individuals with Addison's disease have low morning serum cortisol concentrations. In response to this decreased endogenous cortisol production, the pituitary increases systemic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The precursor to ACTH is pro-opiomelanocortin, which is also a precursor for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). The combination of increased ACTH and MSH results in stimulation of melanocytes and hyperpigmentation.
D. Serum homogentisic acid – Incorrect. Serum homogentisic acid is elevated in alkaptonuria, an inherited deficiency of tyrosine degradation. Although alkaptonuria can present with brown-blue discoloration of the ear cartilage, it does not usually present with buccal hyperpigmentation.
E. Late-night salivary cortisol – Incorrect. Late-night salivary cortisol, performed close to midnight, is an initial test for hypercortisolism or Cushing syndrome. Physiologic cortisol levels nadir near midnight; therefore, high cortisol levels indicate pathologic hypercortisolism.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^114nN3hH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperpigmentation of skin and mucosae may occur in 10–30% after a prolonged period, with an average of 6.1 years, improving within several months after discontinuation. It is characterized by blue-grey discoloration due to pigment deposition of melanin and iron into the basal and dermal layers, typically occurring on the face, extremities, oral mucosa, and nails. Mucosal pigmentation involves the hard palate, gingiva, and lips. Melanonychia striata is a rare adverse event associated with HCQ. It may be associated with skin hyperpigmentation. All patients, especially those on long-term HCQ, should be informed of this side effect. An ophthalmological examination is recommended for patients who develop HCQ-induced hyperpigmentation, due to the increased risk of retinopathy.

Although HCQ is used to treat photodermatoses (e.g. benign summer light eruption, polymorphic light eruption, and porphyria cutanea tarda), photosensitivity, including photoallergic and phototoxic reactions, has been reported but is very rare.

Psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatoses exacerbation during HCQ therapy have been described. HCQ can induce different forms of psoriasis, including inverse psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, and erythrodermic psoriasis. A systematic review showed a lack of high-quality evidence to support a causal relationship.

### Arsenic exposure, assessment, toxicity, diagnosis, and management: guidance for occupational and environmental physicians [^1165PLCu]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Arsenic — acute and chronic toxicity signs: Signs or symptoms of arsenic toxicity depend on the type, route, and whether exposure is acute, subacute, or chronic; iAs and trivalent arsenic (As3+) are generally more acutely toxic than pentavalent arsenate (As5+), and cellular membranes are more permeable to As3+ than As5+; in vitro interconversion of As3+ and As5+ occurs with similar chronic toxicity patterns; arsine gas is highly toxic, causing hemolysis, with exposure in semiconductor and electronics settings; chronic arsenic poisoning is most likely due to environmental or occupational exposure with a more insidious onset, and the most specific sign is skin effects including hyperpigmentation, alternating hyper- and hypopigmentation, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, and focal hyperkeratotic lesions; skin lesions may progress to nonmelanoma skin cancers; in an Indian study of 4865 subjects with elevated arsenic in drinking water, common symptoms included diffuse hyperpigmentation, rain drop pigmentation, hypopigmentation, and palmar and plantar keratosis, with less commonly asthmatic bronchitis and hepatomegaly.

### Lead poisoning in an adult: lead mobilization by pregnancy? [^111j7m8c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

We report a case of acute lead poisoning in an adult female who had last been exposed to lead 7 years ago. She presented with abdominal pain, knee pain, and neurological symptoms, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and anemia with basophilic stippling and lead gum lines. Compared to during her recent pregnancy, her lead level had almost tripled in 5 months to 81 mcg/dL. Chelation therapy was initiated and improved the patient's symptoms and lead level significantly. In the absence of any new lead exposure or other reasons for increased bone turnover, this acute lead increase was likely due to skeletal mobilization caused by increased resorption from mineralized tissue during and after her pregnancy. This case report illustrates the seriousness of long-term health effects associated with lead poisoning at a multi-organ level, even years after the initial exposure. Thus, patient care should not be limited to the acute treatment of increased lead levels, but also include prevention of increased mobilization and bone turnover and appropriate patient education. In this context, we review various aspects of lead toxicity, especially during pregnancy and lactation.

### Chronic lead poisoning induced abdominal pain and anemia: a case report and review of the literature [^1143VspH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

This patient's abdominal pain was severe colic, but with only slight physical signs. The patient presented the kind of characteristics of abdominal pain caused by CLP. Lead is an electropositive metal with high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and thus inhibits sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes. In particular, lead also changes the vasomotor action of smooth muscle due to its effect on Ca-ATPase, which can cause abdominal pain. The patient was moderately anemic, with normocytic anemia and elevated bilirubin, mainly indirect bilirubin, without evidence of hemorrhagic anemia and hematopoietic dysfunction, without supplementation of hematopoietic materials after chelation therapy, the patient's Hb increased to normal levels. First, lead inhibits the major enzymes involved with heme synthesis of δ-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase as well as pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, Second, lead can also be attached to the erythrocyte membrane to interfere with Na + -K + -ATP enzyme, and as a result, erythrocytes become easier to hemolyze. Finally, anemia occurs, and bilirubin levels increase. The patient's physical examination revealed the formation of Burton's lines on the upper and lower gums; Burton's lines are blue-purplish lines on the gums. They are caused by a reaction between circulating lead with sulfur ions released during oral bacterial activity, which deposits lead sulfide at the junction of the teeth and gums. The normal features of CLP include abdominal pain, anemia with basophilic stippling of red cells, blue-black gum deposits, and a lead line on joint radiography. This case reminds us that in the face of a patient with abdominal pain, we should not only consider the usual reasons for abdominal pains, but also carefully inquire about the patient's medical history and consider some other rare etiologies, such as CLP.

In conclusion, CLP is not a common cause of adult abdominal pain, the diagnosis of CLP is often delayed, and the abdominal pain can more easily conceal the underlying illnesses, detailed history taking and physical examination are crucial in early diagnosis and treatment. This report indicates that CLP should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of unexplained abdominal pain when other common causes have been excluded. The diagnosis of CLP is easy once it is suspected, this study may provide more clinical experience for diagnosis of CLP.

### Common hyperpigmentation disorders in adults: part I. diagnostic approach, caféau lait macules, diffuse hyperpigmentation, sun exposure, and phototoxic reactions [^112mpi1r]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The cause of hyperpigmentation usually is traced to the activity and presence of melanocytes. Café au lait macules may be solitary benign findings or may indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis with its associated complications. Diffuse hyperpigmentation should prompt a search for offending medications or systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis, hyperthyroidism, and Addison's disease. In these instances, the hyperpigmentation may be ameliorated by discontinuing offending medications, performing serial phlebotomy in patients with hemochromatosis, instituting cause-specific treatments in patients with hyperthyroidism, and replacing deficient glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids in patients with Addison's disease. Cosmetic treatment with bleaching agents or lasers can be used to decrease pigmentation of ephelides (freckles) and lentigines.

### Radiological changes in lead poisoning [^114bmaXj]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lead poisoning in childhood remains an important public health concern. We highlight the radiological findings in a patient with a high blood lead concentration.

Case Summary

A 7-year-old girl presented to hospital with abdominal pain, nausea, and asthenia. Laboratory tests showed severe hypochromic microcytic anemia, punctate basophilic stippling of erythrocytes, and a blood lead concentration of 880µg/L (4.3µmol/L).

Images

Radiographs of the femur, tibia, and fibula demonstrated dense metaphyseal bands ("lead lines"). On cranial computed tomography, we observed multiple speck-like and curvilinear hyperdensities involving subcortical regions, putamen, and left cerebellar hemisphere.

Conclusion

In patients with lead poisoning, imaging of the brain and bones may show characteristic features. These imaging findings may point to the diagnosis of lead toxicity when these radiographic findings are discovered during the evaluation of vague complaints such as abdominal pain or mental status changes or when a blood lead concentration is not readily available.

### Facial hyperpigmentation and crusted papules on the hands [^111cbMqQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita – Incorrect. Although noninflammatory bullae on acral sites are common in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, facial hyperpigmentation is not characteristic.
B. PCT – Correct. A photo-distributed bullous eruption accompanied by facial discoloration and hypertrichosis is characteristic of PCT. In this case, hyperpigmentation and blistering of the dorsal aspect of the hands in the setting of elevated porphyrins and iron levels is most consistent with a diagnosis of PCT due to acquired hemochromatosis from oral iron supplementation. The patient reported lightening of her face and improvement of her hand lesions after treatment with serial phlebotomy and hydroxychloroquine 100 mg twice weekly, further supporting the diagnosis. While chemotherapy was considered as a cause of her facial hyperpigmentation, the lack of improvement over time since stopping her chemotherapeutic regimen argues against medication-induced hyperpigmentation.
C. Airborne contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Although chronic exposure to an airborne allergen or irritant could lead to vesicobullae and/or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, this patient's lack of erythema and pruritus argues against this diagnosis.
D. Bullous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Noninflammatory vesicobullae are not characteristic of lupus, and this patient lacks other features suggestive of connective tissue disease.
E. Lichen planus pigmentosus – Incorrect. Lichen planus pigmentosus may cause facial hyperpigmentation but would not exhibit associated hypertrichosis or result in crusted papules on the hands.

### An update on drug-induced pigmentation [^111p2ArZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced pigmentation accounts for up to 20% of all cases of acquired pigmentation. A thorough review of medical history and previous and ongoing medications as well as a complete skin examination can guide diagnosis. Implicated agents include alkylating/cytotoxic agents, analgesics, antiarrhythmics, anticoagulants, antiepileptics, antimalarials, antimicrobials, antiretrovirals, metals, prostaglandin analogs, and psychotropic agents, among others. Confirming true drug associations can be challenging, especially in the setting of delayed onset of pigmentation and coexisting polypharmacy.

### Trichotillomania due to pica in a 23-month-old patient with concomitant iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning [^113UiTMa]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In young children, lead poisoning is most often caused by ingestion of lead-based paint. While classically associated with IDA, pica is often a normal manifestation of exploring the surrounding environment among young children. Children from lower-income families are at an increased risk of lead poisoning because they have increased pica and are sometimes exposed to peeling lead-based paint. Epidemiologically, lead-based paint is ubiquitous in areas of Bronx, where the patient lives, and continues to be a source of lead poisoning in that community. To cut costs, landlords presumably paint over lead-based paint rather than remove it.

Young children with the following risk factors should be screened for lead toxicity using venous blood measurements: being at or below the federal poverty line, pica, poor nutritional status, and a family history of lead poisoning. If the venous blood lead level is higher than 5 μg/dL, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends repeating the venous blood lead measurements at intervals specific to the degree of toxicity to ensure that the lead levels are not rising. Lead levels higher than 20 μg/dL can occur in parallel with IDA and can independently cause microcytic anemia. Lead levels higher than 20 μg/dL should prompt iron concentration tests and a complete blood count as well as an abdominal X ray to detect lead-containing substances. Oral chelation therapy is considered with blood lead levels of 45 μg/dL and higher. Chelation therapy entails risks of fever and neutropenia and only improves neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with lead levels higher than 45 μg/dL. A risk-benefit ratio favors no treatment for lead levels lower than 45 μg/dL. High lead levels in an index case should prompt lead level measurements in the patient's family and friends.

Lead poisoning is often asymptomatic, making it difficult to diagnose without regular screening and a known history of lead paint ingestion. The occurrence of trichotillomania in an atypically young age prompted our search for organic causes. The elicitation of a history of trichophagia prompted the consideration of pica, which is commonly caused by IDA and is commonly a cause of lead poisoning.

### Cutaneous signs of systemic disease [^114viE3A]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

### Lead toxicity and genetics in flint, MI [^111cYAxj]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

It has been well established that lead poisoning, as defined by the CDC as blood lead levels (BLLs) at or above 5 μg/dl, can lead to long-term neurotoxic effects in children and requires immediate treatment. As such, the CDC has long recommended clinicians' assess to all patients for lead exposure and test BLLs for all at-risk patients. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that there is no safe level of lead for children due to the irreversible lifelong detrimental effects of lead exposure. Since the disaster of lead contaminated drinking water in Flint, MI has been uncovered, action has been taken to test children for lead poisoning. However, when children are tested and results show that lead levels are below the 5 μg/dl criteria no further follow-up is conducted with these children, as they are deemed 'healthy'. This practice is problematic, given that other studies have shown that blood lead levels, even at rates lower than the poison range can be detrimental to a child's health. The estimated population of Flint is ~99,002, with about 27% of the residents categorised as children under the age of 18 years. Therefore, more than ~26,730 children, of whom 60% are African Americans (N = 16,038), have been exposed to environmental lead in the drinking water.

### Melanoderma: uncommon presentation of a common condition [^117UvzKc]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old man presented with blackish pigmentation of skin and tongue for more than 2years that did not improve with local remedies. He had no history of comorbid medical or surgical illnesses. General examination showed severe hyperpigmentation of skin and mucosa and also showed anaemia. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for Romberg sign and mild hyperreflexia. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out by normal cortisol levels and haemogram showed macrocytosis with hypersegmented neutrophils suggestive of severe vitamin B12 deficiency which confirmed by low serum B12 levels. After 3months of parenteral vitamin B12 treatment, the pigmentation and anaemia improved significantly. The mechanism of hyperpigmentation due to B12 deficiency is postulated to be increased melanin deposition in the basal layer of the epidermis. Since vitamin B12 deficiency is not uncommonly encountered in general practice, atypical presentation of this easily diagnosable and treatable condition is emphasised.

### Facial hyperpigmentation in skin of color: special considerations and treatment [^112AFQyV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Differences in cutaneous diseases in people of color call for nuanced evaluation and management. One of the most common dermatological complaints from patients with skin of color is dyspigmentation, particularly hyperpigmentation. The challenge for clinicians is to establish correct diagnoses along with consistently successful treatments to meet the needs of the increasingly diverse population served. This review focuses on facial hyperpigmentation and outlines the most common skin disorders and treatment options.

### Facial hyperpigmentation: causes and treatment [^115WsVbX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

By midcentury, the U.S. A. will be more ethnically and racially diverse. Skin of colour will soon constitute nearly one-half of the U.S. population, and a full understanding of skin conditions that affect this group is of great importance. Structural and functional differences in the skin, as well as the influence of cultural practices, produce variances in skin disease and presentation based on skin type. In the skin of colour population, dyschromia is a growing concern, and a top chief complaint when patients present to the physician. A thorough understanding of the aetiology and management strategies of facial hyperpigmentation is of importance in caring for those afflicted and also in the development of new therapies.

### Drug-induced hyperpigmentation: review and case series [^113oXCzj]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperpigmentation is a common dermatologic problem that may have substantial impact on the patient, since it affects the appearance and quality of life, and may influence treatment adherence. There are few studies of drug-induced hyperpigmentation.

Methods

We studied drug-induced hyperpigmentation in patients attending an outpatient dermatology clinic in the Western Area of Valladolid (Spain) from August 1, 2017 to April 20, 2018.

Results

The incidence of drug-induced hyperpigmentation was 1.31% in patients attending a first dermatology consultation in the study period. Of the 16 patients, 8 were taking more than 1 drug. The most frequent drugs identified were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (25%), antihypertensive agents (18.75%), antimalarials (12.5%), antibiotics, antineoplastic agents, psychoactive agents, simvastatin, allopurinol, amiodarone and mucolytic (6.25% each). Hyperpigmentation was found in the mucosa in 25% of patients and in photograph-exposed areas in 37.5%.

Discussion

Diagnosing drug-induced hyperpigmentation is a dermatologic challenge. A differential diagnosis with hyperpigmentation caused by endocrine and metabolic disorders, the most closely-related disorders to drug-induced hyperpigmentation, and with hyperpigmentation of idiopathic origin, should be conducted. Drug-induced hyperpigmentation is a relatively frequent reason for consultation, especially in polypharmacy patients. The sample may have been biased as many patients receiving treatments frequently associated with drug-induced hyperpigmentation, such as antineoplastic drugs, are diagnosed and treated by other specialties, such as oncologists.

Conclusion

Family physicians and specialists should consider drugs as a cause of hyperpigmentation to facilitate the correct diagnosis and treatment.

### Update on the clinical management of childhood lead poisoning [^113eXwhr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Childhood lead poisoning is still an enormous public health issue in the United States, affecting thousands of children and their families. New evidence suggests that even very low blood lead levels, less than 10 microg/dL, can be associated with neurologic injury. This article discusses characteristics of children at high risk for lead poisoning, unusual sources of lead contamination, and new aspects of lead's pathophysiology. It includes current thinking on the clinical management and prevention of childhood lead poisoning.

### ACMT position statement: No evidence that tampons cause metal poisoning [^114HtYMn]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). High credibility.

Tampon metal exposure — lead dose estimation relative to CDC intake thresholds — is detailed as follows: The page states, "The CDC uses a blood lead reference value of 3.5 µg/dL as threshold to determine action", that in a "female of childbearing age" "the dietary intake of lead corresponding to this reference value is 88 µg/d" and that "CDC uses an Interim Reference Level of 8.8 µg/d derived by dividing this by 10". Using product measurements, "In a tampon weighing 9 g, a median concentration of 173 ng/g would result in 1557 ng (1.557 µg) of lead in total". The narrative adds that "vaginal mucosal bioavailability is much less than from the oral route", that exposure is intermittent due to menses so "the predicted average daily 'dose' from a tampon becomes lower", and that "we would expect similarly low doses from other metal exposures in a tampon".

### Minocycline (Zilxi) [^112T9Jz6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.12 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction

Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with oral minocycline use. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported with oral minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, discontinue ZILXI immediately.

5.13 Tissue Hyperpigmentation

Oral tetracyclines are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as pigmentation over sites of scars or injury.

5.14 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

ZILXI has not been evaluated in the treatment of infections. Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using ZILXI, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of ZILXI, it should be used only as indicated.

5.15 Superinfection/Potential for Microbial Overgrowth

Use of ZILXI may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue ZILXI and institute appropriate therapy.

### Causes of lead toxicity in a Nigerian city [^115ojv7Z]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 70% of young Nigerian children have been reported to have blood lead concentrations ≥ 10 microg/dl.

Aims

To better elucidate risk factors for lead toxicity among Nigerian families with children at risk for lead toxicity.

Methods

Two geographic wards in Jos, Nigeria were selected for study, one previously reported to have a high mean blood lead level (37 (SD 13) microg/dl) and one with a lower mean blood lead level (17 (SD 10) microg/dl) in young children. Data pertaining to potential risk factors for lead exposure were collected from children and adults in 34 households.

Results

The mean (SD) blood lead concentration of 275 subjects, aged 3 weeks to 90 years, was 8.7 (5.7) microg/dl (range 1–34 microg/dl); 92 (34%) had concentrations ≥ 10 microg/dl. In multivariate analysis, an age of 5 years and under, flaking house paint, residence near a gasoline seller, male gender, increasing maternal and paternal education, and use of a lead ore eye cosmetic were independently associated with greater blood lead concentration. Vehicle ownership was associated with reduced lead concentration. Compared with the low-lead ward, residence in the high-lead ward remained significantly associated with greater lead values, indicating that additional factors likely contribute to lead exposure.

Conclusion

Although the cause of increased lead levels in Jos appears to be multi-factorial, several remediable sources contribute to lead exposure in Nigeria.

### Chronic lead poisoning in an adult battery worker [^114JU5i6]. Occupational Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Lead poisoning is a common environmental health hazard in developing countries. Incidences of lead poisoning are seen in all age groups, especially in adults working in lead-based industries, where many still remain unaware of the adverse effects of exposure to unusually high levels of lead.

Methods

We report the case of an adult battery worker, who initially received symptomatic treatment because of clinical misdiagnosis. Later, he was treated with appropriate chelators, which helped to decrease blood lead levels drastically. However, being unable to change his occupation, he continues to be exposed to potentially lethal doses of lead.

Conclusions

A key role for health agencies, besides providing opportunities for diagnosis and therapy, should be to increase public awareness about this widespread environmental hazard through education, documentation and communication.

### Folk prescription for treating rhinitis as a rare cause of childhood lead poisoning: a case series [^113jsEeM]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of lead intoxication

Despite intestinal and neurological symptoms the diagnosis of lead poisoning was delayed. Hepatotoxicity was observed in our patients as evidenced by elevated transaminase levels. Both DMSA and CaNa 2 EDTA can be hepatotoxic; pretreatment evaluation of liver function is necessary. With DMSA, a transient mild rise of hepatic transaminases is the most common adverse effect reported, generally resolving on discontinuation of treatment without long-term sequelae. Published studies on the frequency of this transaminase increase differ, varying between < 1.5 and 60% of patients. In a multicenter placebo controlled DMSA trial conducted in children with initial BLLs between 20 and 45 μg/dL, no difference in the rate of elevated ALT levels in treated versus untreated children was observed.

Although hepatic damage is not a common feature of childhood lead poisoning, animal studies have found that chronic lead poisoning caused mild histological and histochemical changes in the liver. The very high liver enzyme levels in case 3 delayed chelation. With the conservative approach taken, liver function recovered quickly and BLLs declined. Spontaneous excretion of lead in patients with acute lead poisoning may have a greater impact on BLLs than those with more chronic lead poisoning since lead has not had time to accumulate in bone.

### Lead poisoning as possible cause of deaths at the Swedish house at kapp thordsen, spitsbergen, winter 1872–3 [^112rDSi3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Lead poisoning

Lead is a poisonous heavy metal that has acute and chronic effects on the body. Metallic lead is poorly dissolved in an alkaline environment but is readily dissolved in acid. After absorption it is deposited in the skeleton. According to the inventory list, the men at Kapp Thordsen consumed large amounts of tinned food. They probably reheated the tins on the stove, exposing the lead alloy to acid and dissolving the lead in the food.

Lead poisoning typically leads to stomach pains and cramps, anorexia, weight loss, a blue line of the gingival margin, neuropathy particularly affecting the extensor muscles, joint pain, and a curious condition called "debility" — inertia and complete loss of incentive and interest.

The content of lead in our samples was 102.05 μg/g. Samples of soil from outside the burial grounds showed 16 μg/g of lead. The lead content in the bones from the Franklin expedition ranged from 97.6 to 188.6 μg/g, accumulated over about three years. In our case, the lead accumulated over a few weeks. The first men were sick by 2 December. As the accumulation of lead in bone occurs slowly, at a rate of 1 mg a year if the blood concentration is 1.8 μmol/l in cases of chronic lead poisoning, our victim must have had high blood concentrations of lead. To our knowledge, there are no cases in the literature examining simultaneous blood and bone concentrations of lead. The blood concentrations must therefore be extrapolated.

In the Franklin expedition, if half the bone lead content had been accumulated during the expedition, the cumulative blood lead concentration over this time must have been 29.0–75.5 μmol/l, giving a mean concentration of 29.0–24.2 μmol/l. This is three to 10 times higher the recommended upper concentrations of lead in the blood to prevent neurological damage. When our "patient" had accumulated 102.6 μg/g in 13–14 weeks, he must have been suffering from acute as well as subacute lead poisoning.

Interpretation

The evidence gives strong indications that our "patient" died of lead poisoning. The other man in the grave also probably suffered the same fate. Possibly lead poisoning, because of its "debilitating" effect and anorexia, worked with other factors, contributing to the men's deaths.

### Hyperpigmented macules in the oral mucosa and melanonychia [^111dDGg9]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What is the most common extra-oral site of pigmentation in this condition?
A. Palms and soles
B. Nails
C. Sclera
D. Anogenital mucosa
E. Small bowel

Answers:

A. Palms and soles – Incorrect. There have been few reported cases involving the palms and soles. Addison's disease is characterized by pronounced hyperpigmentation of the palms and soles in addition to the perineum, axillae, and areaolae.
B. Nails – Correct. Melanonychia has been described in up to 60% of cases of Laugier-Hunziker syndrome. Nail involvement usually presents as single- or double-striped longitudinal lines. Fingernails are more commonly affected than toenails.
C. Sclera– Incorrect. Cases involving hyperpigmentation of the sclera and conjunctiva have rarely been reported. Nail pigmentation has been reported in more than half of all Laugier-Hunziker syndrome cases.
D. Anogenital mucosa – Incorrect. Cases involving hyperpigmentation of the anogenital mucosa have been reported, although these findings occur less frequently than nail involvement.
E. Small bowel – Incorrect. Small bowel pigmentation is not associated with Laugier-Hunziker syndrome. However, in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, polyps have a predilection for the small bowel.

### Lead poisoning; a neglected potential diagnosis in abdominal pain [^114dwcL9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, all 28 patients with confirmed diagnosis of lead poisoning also had a history of opium addiction and opiate use disorder (OUD). Although some patients were polysubstance users, all poisoned patients had the history of OUD. There was no significant correlation between consumption of herbal medicines, eating habits, and occupation and lead poisoning as many of our patients had jobs that did not predispose them to lead exposure. This suggests adulterated opium as the main source of lead poisoning. Patients who took daily amounts of more than 2.75 g of opium had a 5.2-time greater risk of development of lead poisoning. There was also a correlation between lead poisoning and OUD in this study. Persons continued to abuse opium after being aware of its consequences although this correlation was not statistically significant. This may be due to the fact that this innate feeling will result in taking greater amounts of opium. A correlation between the duration of opium addiction and lead poisoning was evident.

### Chemotherapy-associated tongue hyperpigmentation and blue lunula [^114Wc6dv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Combination chemotherapy is associated with cutaneous and mucosal side effects. Antineoplastic agents have been associated with mucosal and nail pigmentation. We describe a 16-year-old Saudi Arabian girl with combination chemotherapy-associated black tongue hyperpigmentation and blue lunula. The diagnosis of drug-associated pigmentary changes is based on correlating the onset of the clinical observations with the temporal initiation of the patient's chemotherapy agents.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^113oyWV2]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

### Chronic lead poisoning induced abdominal pain and anemia: a case report and review of the literature [^114EjBay]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
The clinical laboratory results of the patient

During his hospitalization, the abdominal pain was aggravated, but some acute abdominal diseases, including pancreatitis, cholecystitis and appendicitis were excluded, based on the normality of inflammatory indicators and CT examination. Kidney stones and abdominal allergic purpura could not reasonably explain this patient's pain symptoms, suggesting that there must be other etiology. Upon inquiring into the patient's medical history in detail, it was learned that the patient was a warehouse keeper who had been working in the children's new book warehouse for more than 2 years, meaning he has been in close contact with new children's picture books for a long time. Physical examination revealed Burton's lines over the gums, which is a classical feature of CLP (Fig. 1). Moreover, blood examination showed that his blood lead level had increased to 52.8 μg/dl (normal range < 10 μg/dl) (Fig. 2). Hematological manifestations of heavy metal poisoning and basophilic stippling of erythrocytes are found in marrow and blood smear (Fig. 3). Therefore, CLP was highly suspected. He immediately received dimercaptosuccinic acid (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) therapy 10 mg kg − 1 by mouth every 8 hour, taking the drug on first third days of the week, with 1 week as a course of treatment. During the first week of hospitalization, supportive treatment with water-soluble vitamins was also given. His abdominal pain was relief significantly within 2 days after treatment. After 1 month treatment, Hemoglobin (Hb) was increased from 74 g/L to 157 g/L and serum total bilirubin (TBil) was decreased from 31.2 μm/L to 13.2 μm/L, Blood lead was reduced from 52.8 μg/dl to 17.2 μg/dl in 5 months (Fig. 2). Above all indictors were normal after 8 months treatment.

### Hyperpigmented macules in the oral mucosa and melanonychia [^116QXiAW]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old woman presented with a 15-year history of asymptomatic, dark spots gradually increasing in number on the lips and oral mucosa. Physical examination found coalescing, hyperpigmented macules on the buccal mucosa, palate, and lower lip mucosa (Figs 1 and 2). Longitudinal melanonychia was noted on the right great toe (Fig 3). Medical history was unremarkable. Social history was significant for a 40 pack-year smoking history. All age-appropriate routine screenings were up to date and unremarkable. Family history was negative for oral pigmentation, colon polyps, and cancer. A punch biopsy specimen was taken from the buccal cheek (Fig 4).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
B. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome
C. Addison disease
D. Smoker's melanosis
E. LAMB Syndrome

Answers:

A. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome – Incorrect. Although Peutz-Jeghers syndrome has a similar presentation, the patient lacked a family history of the disease, gastrointestinal polyps, and pigmented macules in infancy or early childhood. Additionally, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome typically spares the tongue, palate, and fingernails.
B. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome – Correct. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is a benign, acquired condition that involves gradual progression of asymptomatic macular hyperpigmentation of the mucocutaneous surfaces and nails.
C. Addison disease – Incorrect. Hyperpigmentation in Addison disease is found in areas subject to pressure. In addition, this patient did not exhibit any signs of insufficient cortisol or aldosterone production.
D. Smoker's melanosis – Incorrect. Smoker's melanosis presents with diffuse patches or numerous small melanotic macules in the anterior labial gingiva of the mandible. The oral distribution and nail involvement makes smoker's melanosis unlikely.
E. LAMB Syndrome – Incorrect. LAMB syndrome, now referred to as Carney complex, is a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome characterized by lentigines, atrial myxomas, and blue nevi. Lentigines in LAMB syndrome typically manifest in the first 2 decades of life, and there is no mention of blue nevi or cardiac findings in this patient's history.

### Minocycline (Amzeeq) [^111XhQ4P]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.12 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction

Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with oral minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported with oral minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, discontinue AMZEEQ immediately.

5.13 Tissue Hyperpigmentation

Oral tetracyclines are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as pigmentation over sites of scars or injury.

5.14 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

AMZEEQ has not been evaluated in the treatment of infections. Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using AMZEEQ, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of AMZEEQ, it should be used only as indicated.

5.15 Superinfection/Potential for Microbial Overgrowth

Use of AMZEEQ may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue AMZEEQ and institute appropriate therapy.

Facial hypermelanosis is a clinical feature of a diverse group of disorders, the most common of which is melasma. Exposure to sunlight, genetic predisposition, the use of cosmetics, and certain drugs are implicated in the pathogenesis of most facial hypermelanoses. A detailed personal and family history and the histopathologic findings are, in most cases, enough for establishing the correct diagnosis. Systemic disorders such as Addison's disease should always be suspected and excluded in clinically relevant cases.

### Diagnosing disorders of hypopigmentation and depigmentation in patients with skin of color [^111VuiTu]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Skin hypopigmentation and depigmentation disorders are a top concern for patients with skin of color seeking care from a dermatologist. The visual contrast between involved and uninvolved skin in these disorders makes them particularly burdensome for patients with skin of color. These disorders may have a wide differential of diagnosis, as patients with skin of color may present differently or more frequently than White patients for certain conditions. Clues from a comprehensive history and physical examination with standard lighting and a Wood's light are essential for clinching the diagnosis, although a biopsy may be warranted in special cases.

### Approach to hypopigmentation disorders in adults [^117D8tyD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired hypopigmentation disorders in adults can be classified on the basis of lesion extent, and can generally be divided into disorders with localized, widespread or generalized lesions. Clinical findings, comprising the degree of pigment loss (hypopigmentation and depigmentation) and associated morphological findings (e.g. epidermal changes, infiltration and induration), are used to further distinguish the disorders. Diagnosing the disorders is important because the underlying causes may be treatable and some of the disorders are associated with malignancies. A systemic approach is useful for this clinical condition, as the causes are heterogeneous and investigations are usually nondiagnostic.

### Acquired disorders with hypopigmentation: a clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment [^112K2CaB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acquired hypopigmented skin changes are commonly encountered by dermatologists. Although hypopigmentation is often asymptomatic and benign, occasional serious and disabling conditions present with cutaneous hypopigmentation. A thorough history and physical examination, centered on disease distribution and morphologic findings, can aid in delineating the causes of acquired hypopigmented disorders. The second article in this 2-part continuing medical education series focuses on conditions with a hypopigmented phenotype. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of these disorders can improve a patient's quality of life, halt disease progression, and prevent irreversible disability.

### Lead poisoning as a differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with chronic abdominal pain: a case-control study in tehran-iran [^113dShjh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lead is a toxic metal with no critical physiological role in the human body. Due to its characteristics, it is broadly applied in industry, which has led to widespread environmental pollution. Gastric and pulmonary absorptions are the chief routes of contamination with lead; however, it can enter the body through dermal and prenatal exposures. About 90% of lead is stored in mineralized and soft tissues, with a maximum half-life of ≤ 30 years, hence, regarding its circulation between different tissues, individuals may show high levels of lead from a few months to several years after exposure.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 1 million individuals die from lead poisoning each year. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), around 800 million children worldwide, which is equivalent to one-third of all children, have blood lead levels that are equal to or exceed 5 µg/dl.

Lead poisoning is one of the oldest and most persistent health risks in Iran. Iran's evidence demonstrates clearly that lead toxicity and exposure provide a serious risk to human health. Since, a country-scale study in 2020, the mean of lead blood levels was remarkably high between patients with probable signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in Iran.

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have established a blood lead cut-off of 3.5 µg/dL as the point at which medical interventions should be considered for children aged 1–5 years, no specific reference value for a safe blood lead level has been determined to prevent adverse effects. Lead intoxication is a multisystem disease with non-specific symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose and screen. Patients suffering from lead intoxication may experience neurological symptoms (e.g. ataxia, seizures, hyperirritability), hematological manifestations, renal impairments, and gastrointestinal disorders like anorexia, vomiting, constipation, and chronic abdominal pain.

### Two cases of acute lead poisoning due to occupational exposure to lead [^114ZrmPt]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Case Reports

We experienced two cases of acute lead poisoning due to occupational exposure to lead. The patients were engaged in stripping off antirust compounds including Pb from a bridge and re-painting it at the same work place. Both patients exhibited colic, arthralgia, and anemia. Blood lead levels were 73.1 microg/dl and 96.3 microg/dl. Intravenous CaEDTA chelation therapy was therefore performed. After chelation, blood lead levels decreased and symptoms gradually disappeared.

Discussion

Although the patients were working with protective equipment, the workplace was in the mountains and there was no water for washing. The patients were thus unable to washing their hands and faces. We assume that they swallowed lead dust left on their hands and faces when they removed their clothing, and believe that this poisoning occurred due to lack of knowledge sufficient for protection.

Cases of severe childhood lead poisoning (a blood lead level (BLL) ≥ 45 mcg/dL) in the United States have decreased with time. Clinicians will encounter such cases only rarely. When such cases arise, however, recognizing their complexities and identifying resources that can help in management are important. We present here a case of severe childhood lead poisoning, highlighting the variable presentation, the rebound phenomenon of BLL after chelation, the usefulness of the zinc protoporphyrin as an adjunctive monitoring parameter, and the importance of early involvement of an inter-professional team.

### Trichotillomania due to pica in a 23-month-old patient with concomitant iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning [^116wsNSx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 23-month-old girl with atopic dermatitis and presumed autism spectrum disorder presented with patchy hair loss, which lasted for 1 week. She had been pulling out hair from the frontal aspect of her scalp despite preventive measures, including hair braiding. Upon questioning, the mother reported finding hair in her daughter's stool. In addition to trichophagia, the mother also noted the patient's chewing on nonfood items, such as paint chips. The patient had no recent stressors and no other relevant family history. The patient's pediatrician had recently started an autism spectrum disorder workup for behavioral changes and sensorineural hearing deficiencies. Physical examination revealed multiple alopecic areas with hairs of varying length and linear excoriations on the frontal aspect of the scalp (Fig 1), which was consistent with trichotillomania.

Fig 1
Patchy hair loss from the frontal aspect of the scalp due to trichotillomania.

This presentation of trichotillomania was atypical because of the patient's young ageand pica. Due to pica, workups for IDA and lead poisoning were pursued. Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL (reference range, 10.3–13.2 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume of 56.6 fL (reference range, 69.5–81.2 fL), iron level of 19 μg/dL (reference range, 50–200 μg/dL), and total iron binding capacity of 429 μg/dL (reference range, 250–400 μg/dL), which were consistent with IDA. The blood lead levels was 14 μg/dL (reference range, 0–4 μg/dL), indicating lead poisoning. The patient was started on iron supplements. Lead chelators were deferred because her blood lead level was less than 45 μg/dL. The New York State Department of Health was notified of the presence of lead paint in the patient's home. A search for a specific etiology of the patient's IDA is ongoing; however, we suspect inadequate iron intake and, perhaps, concomitant thalassemia. After discussion with the patient's pediatrician, it seems likely that her recent development of behavioral changes and sensorineural deficiencies were a result of lead poisoning.

### Lead poisoning in children [^115aKgND]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence and severity of childhood lead poisoning have been greatly reduced since the removal of lead from paint and gasoline in the 1970s. Despite these efforts, approximately 310,000 U.S. children younger than five years have elevated blood lead levels. Health care professionals should perform targeted screening for lead poisoning in children who are Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible, foreign born, or identified as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) location-specific recommendations or by a personal risk questionnaire. Venous sampling is the preferred method for measuring blood lead levels, but a carefully collected finger-stick sample is an acceptable alternative. Capillary samples of elevated levels should be confirmed by a venous sample. The CDC recommends that the threshold for follow-up and intervention of lead poisoning be a blood lead level of 10 microg per dL or higher. Recommendations for treatment of elevated blood levels include a thorough environmental investigation, laboratory testing when appropriate, iron supplementation for iron-deficient children, and chelation therapy for blood lead levels of 45 microg per dL or more. Prevention consists of education and avoidance of lead-contaminated products.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is heterogeneous group of disorder transmitted as autosomal recessive trait. It is characterised by photosensitivity, freckled pigmentation and premature skin ageing and malignant tumour development. The manifestations are due to a cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet light resulting from a defect in DNA repair. Multiple cutaneous neoplasms develop at a young age in persons with XP. Two important causes of mortality are metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We report a case of XP in a 22 year-old male patient who developed SCC of lower lip with in a short period of 1 month.

### Notes from the field: childhood lead poisoning associated with turmeric spices-las vegas, 2019 [^116EofGn]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Additional family members of both children were screened. Child A's father had a venous BLL of 49 μ g/dL, and child B's sister (aged 2 years) had a venous BLL of 13 μ g/dL. Interviews with both families indicated that the family of child A reportedly consumed larger quantities of turmeric-containing food than did the family of child B. Both families were advised to discontinue use of the lead-containing turmeric, obtain turmeric from reputable brands, and were provided nutritional counseling stressing the importance of a diet consisting of foods rich in calcium, iron, and vitamin C. Child A's BLL was 18 μ g/dL in April 2019 after initiation of chelation therapy and was 9 μ g/dL by December. Repeat testing of BLLs in child B and her sister found that their BLLs had both declined to 3 μ g/dL by September.

These findings support other reports of lead-contaminated turmeric in the United States and highlight the diverse pathways through which children can be exposed to lead. They underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and communication between health care providers and health department staff members in identifying potential links among lead poisoning cases, and the need for health care facilities to be prepared to respond to cases of lead poisoning.

The national blood lead reference level had been 5 μ g/dL but was lowered to 3.5 μ g/dL in October 2021. There is no safe BLL in children; BLLs once thought to pose little to no risk have shown to be risk factors for reading problems, intellectual delays, school failure, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and antisocial behavior (, –). Whereas the impact of lead exposure might be irreversible, exposure is preventable., ** Clinicians and public health professionals should be aware of risks outside traditional lead exposures (e.g. paint, dust, and contaminated soil). Adulteration of turmeric has reportedly been a source of lead exposure in other countries, where lead is purposefully added to enhance weight and color. Referrals for lead-risk assessments should emphasize same-day assessments when possible to reduce continued exposure to and absorption of lead. Public health officials and health care providers should work together to ensure the sources of lead exposure have been identified and controlled before chelation therapy is started. Health care providers who are unfamiliar with chelation therapy should consult with their regional pediatric environmental health specialty unit or poison control center for assistance.

### Hyperpigmented macules and patches on the face: exogenous ochronosis or lichen planus pigmentosus? [^117AEfZS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a patient with a 10-year history of blue-black macules and patches on the face and an associated history of skin-lightening cream usage. The skin lightening cream contained hydroquinone, which is often associated with exogenous ochronosis (EO). Interestingly, the biopsy did not show characteristic findings of ochronosis, confusing the final diagnosis, however discontinuing the skin-lightening creams halted the progression of the patient's skin lesions supporting a diagnosis of EO. EO presents as asymptomatic hyperpigmentation after using products containing hydroquinone. This condition is most common in Black populations, likely due to the increased use of skin care products and bleaching cream containing hydroquinone in these populations. Topical hydroquinone is FDA-approved to treat melasma, chloasma, freckles, senile lentigines, and hyperpigmentation and is available by prescription only in the US and Canada. However, with the increased use of skin-lightening creams in certain populations, it is important for dermatologists to accurately recognize the clinical features of exogenous ochronosis to differentiate it from similar dermatoses. An earlier diagnosis can prevent the progression to severe presentations with papules and nodules. We summarize the clinical presentations diagnostic features, and treatment pearls, concluding with a discussion of the differential diagnoses.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(7):567–568.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.8248.

### Lead poisoning in children [^111FE8RD]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic lead poisoning has become more common in children. Blood lead levels of less than 5 µg per dL are associated with impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral development that are irreversible. Risk factors for lead poisoning include age younger than five years, low socioeconomic status, living in housing built before 1978, and use of imported food, medicines, and pottery. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a recommendation in 2019 citing insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of universal screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. Local risk factors can be substantial, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that states and cities formulate their own targeted screening guidelines. In the absence of local guidance, the CDC recommends screening all Medicaid-eligible children at 12 months and again at 24 months, or at least once between 36 and 72 months if not previously screened. The CDC also recommends universal screening in areas where more than 27% of the housing was built before 1950, or where at least 12% of children 12 to 36 months of age have blood lead levels greater than 10 µg per dL. Life-threatening lead levels are treated with chelation therapy, and lower levels should prompt case management and environmental investigations to identify and remove the source of exposure. Primary prevention strategies are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of lead on child development.

### Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism [^112u9AcY]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias

The most common neurovisceral complaints in acute hepatic porphyrias are abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, mental symptoms, head/neck/chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, convulsions, sensory loss, fever, respiratory paralysis, and diarrhea.

Chronic hepatic porphyria

Patients with chronic hepatic porphyria, such as Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), are associated with significant chronic cutaneous photosensitivity but they do not accompany neurological symptoms. Petechiae and purpuric lesions may occur. Skin lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, and nail changes can be pronounced. Chronic blistering lesions may develop; the fluid-filled vesicles rupture easily and the denuded areas become crusted and heal slowly; secondary infection is common. Previous areas of blisters may appear atrophic, or brownish. Facial hypertrichosis, scarring, and hyperpigmentation can also occur.

Psychiatric symptoms

Psychiatric symptoms in porphyria have led to controversial discussion. In the past, reported psychiatric manifestations have included hysteria, anxiety, depression, phobias, psychosis, organic disorders, agitation, delirium, and altered consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma. Some patients were described with psychosis similar to schizophrenia. Psychiatric manifestations may be divided into two groups. First, an association between chronic porphyria and mild anxiety and depression has been postulated; the nature of this association is yet to be explained. Second, during the active phase of the acute attack, clinically obvious psychiatric symptoms such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, agitation, and delirium are common and may be present in up to 30% of patients. The cause of these manifestations is almost certainly multifactorial and may include common effects of medication used in the management of the acute attack, such as sedation and disorientation arising from the use of opioids, and the effects of metabolic disturbances associated with the attack (e.g. hypernatremia). Acute psychotic manifestations such as paranoia and hallucinations can occur but are very uncommon.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of an acute attack of porphyria requires the demonstration of increased urinary excretion of the heme precursor, porphobilinogen (PBG). Molecular diagnostic testing is powerful and useful in kindred evaluation and genetic counseling when a disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family. It is also the only proper way to screen asymptomatic gene carriers.

### Disorders of hyperpigmentation. part I. pathogenesis and clinical features of common pigmentary disorders [^1178ZPp4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disorders of hyperpigmentation are common and, depending on the extent and location of involvement, can affect the quality of life and pose a significant psychologic burden for patients. Given the similarities in presentation of the various causes of hyperpigmentation, it is often difficult to elucidate the etiology of these conditions, which is important to guide management. Furthermore, certain disorders, such as lichen planus pigmentosus and ashy dermatosis, have similar clinical and/or histologic presentations, and their classification as distinct entities has been debated upon, leading to additional confusion. In this review, the authors selected commonly encountered disorders of hyperpigmentation of the skin, subdivided into epidermal, dermal, or mixed epidermal-dermal disorders based on the location of pigment deposition, along with disorders of hyperpigmentation of the mucosa and nails. Melanocytic nevi, genetic disorders, and systemic causes of hyperpigmentation were largely excluded and considered to be outside the scope of this review. We discussed the pathogenesis of hyperpigmentation as well as the clinical and histologic features of these conditions, along with challenges encountered in their diagnosis and classification. The second article in this 2-part continuing medical education series focuses on the medical and procedural treatments of hyperpigmentation.

### Infantile lead poisoning from an Asian tongue powder: a case report&subsequent public health inquiry [^115sMNmz]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lead poisoning from novel environmental sources continues to present a challenge to clinicians who treat infants and children.

Case Report

A 12 month old infant of Thai parents was found during well child care to have a venous blood lead concentration of 61 mcg/dL. He was hospitalized for parenteral chelation with CaNa2EDTA and subsequently managed as an outpatient with oral succimer, with a reduction in blood lead concentration to 23 mcg/dL. Chronic lead poisoning was attributed to the use of a Thai tongue powder by the parents for the first seven months of the infant's life. This ethnic remedy was applied to the tongue to absorb toxins, reduce white patches present after milk feedings, and preserve the infant's health.

Investigations

Lead contaminated the powder at 109,000 ppm as measured by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Two poison centers in Thailand were contacted and initiated a public health inquiry with the Thai Food & Drug Administration (Thai FDA) to remove contaminated products from the marketplace. Their investigation found six additional contaminated tongue powders (of 10 tested) in a Bangkok shop offering Chinese remedies, some with lead levels > 9000 ppm. These products, unregistered with the Thai FDA, were confiscated and the shop closed. Local media attention and case-finding activities of health officials identified one additional infant suffering from lead poisoning due to tongue powders.

Conclusions

Asian tongue powders can be a source of lead poisoning. Medical toxicologists, poison centers, and public health agencies can work together internationally to accomplish effective post-marketing product surveillance.

### International environmental health for the pediatrician: case study of lead poisoning [^112sacSi]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Childhood lead poisoning is a preventable illness. In the past 3 decades, removal of key lead sources and prevention of exposure in the United States have led to dramatic decreases in population blood lead concentrations and also in instances of severe lead poisoning requiring treatment. From an international perspective, childhood lead poisoning seems to be of greatest concern in developing countries. The phasing out of lead from gasoline is a critical first step in decreasing worldwide blood lead concentrations. However, many focal sources that can cause lead poisoning remain, such as lead from flour mills, lead-glazed ceramics, mining and smelting, and battery repair and recycling. A large and diverse country, such as India, may have many sources of lead. The challenge will be for developing countries to implement effective national and regional efforts to address their specific sources of lead.

### Hyponatraemia and hyperpigmentation in primary adrenal insufficiency [^116itkKj]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Our patient had a hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium 124 mmol/L, serum osmolality 255 mOsm/kg, calculated serum osmolality 260.3 mOsm/kg) combined with a urinary osmolality of 678 mOsm/kg and a urinary sodium of 219 mmol/L. Pseudohyponatraemia, for example as a result of jaundice, was excluded as cause because the hyponatraemia was hypotonic hyponatraemia.

She was initially assessed as euvolaemic, leading to a differential diagnosis of SIADH. In daily practice, SIADH is often assumed to be the cause of hyponatraemia, even before the diagnostic work-up is completed. This was also the case in our patient, in whom treatment for SIADH was initiated before the adrenal insufficiency was adequately ruled out. Recent guidelines also state that a SIADH diagnosis requires exclusion of other possible causes of hyponatraemia, like adrenal insufficiency. In our case, the assumed diagnosis SIADH resulted in delay in the final diagnosis.

### Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis: a report of a case with delayed onset alopecia and onychodystrophy [^112wzyMV]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We report a 24-year-old Iraqi man with diffuse reticulate hyperpigmentation that presented at birth and continues throughout adulthood that is associated with diffuse nonscarring alopecia together with onychodystrophy. The latter 2 features have had an onset after 19 years of age. These 3 clinical features collectively represent the diagnostic triad of DPR, which was first described by Hauss and Oberste-Lehn in 1958.

The reticulate hyperpigmentation and nail abnormalities can also be seen in NFJS and DKC. The clinical features of NFJS include dental abnormalities and, in many cases, the hyperpigmentation fades or disappears after puberty or in adulthood; in addition, nonscarring alopecia is not a feature of NFJS. In DKC, the hyperpigmentation is associated with leukoplakia of the oral mucosa, bone marrow dysfunction, and the patient may have abnormal dental findings.

In addition to the diagnostic triad of DPR, our patient also has adermatoglyphics, sweating abnormalities, and heat intolerance, which are also features of this syndrome. The patient refused genetic testing. This is not an issue, because the diagnosis of DPR can be made clinically based on its characteristic diagnostic criteria — namely, generalized reticulate hyperpigmentation, noncicatricial alopecia, and onychodystrophy. Genetic testing aids in confirmation of the diagnosis when not all diagnostic criteria are present. In our case, not only these diagnostic criteria are present, but also the other features of the condition mentioned above. These features, supported by the typical histopathology of the reticulate hyperpigmentation, compelled us to make the diagnosis of DPR.

Based on previous studies, our case differs in the late onset of both alopecia and onychodystrophy. This suggests that the reticulate hyperpigmentation may be the only presented feature of DPR before puberty and, therefore, it is wise to consider the diagnosis of DPR in any child with diffuse reticulate hyperpigmentation that begins in early childhood, even in the absence of the other 2 sides of the diagnostic triangle (alopecia and onychodystrophy). Furthermore, an elevated serum cortisol level and hepatomegaly may be associated or coincidental findings. Therefore, correlation with future reported cases will be required.

### Committee opinion no. 533: lead screening during pregnancy and lactation [^113NTeKa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Prenatal lead exposure has known adverse effects on maternal health and infant outcomes across a wide range of maternal blood lead levels. Adverse effects of lead exposure are being identified at lower levels of exposure than previously recognized in both children and adults. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the first guidelines regarding the screening and management of pregnant and lactating women who have been exposed to lead.

### Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: a case series of a rare uroporphyrinogen III synthase gene mutation in Nepalese patients [^114C88xF]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Some genotype–phenotype correlations are well established in CEP. For example, the c.217T > C mutation is associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis. The GATA1 gene mutation is associated with a sex-linked pattern of inheritance, the hematologic phenotype of beta thalassemia intermedia, and marked thrombocytopenia. Mild hematologic manifestations seen in all of our patients, similar to those in the Chinese patient with c.416T > G mutation, may signify a probable correlation. However, given the lack of overall consistency in genotype–phenotype correlations, other factors, including environment, photoprotective behavior, and unknown genetic components, have been considered as contributors.

The clinical presentation of CEP is phenotypically heterogeneous and of varying severity. Severe cutaneous photosensitivity usually begins shortly after birth or in early infancy. However, current literature suggests that the age of onset ranges from 30 weeks of gestation to 60 years of age. Increased friability and blistering of the epidermis over light-exposed areas are characteristic findings. Photoexposure may be associated with burning, itching, tingling, or pinprick sensations and development of signs such as erythema, blisters, and mild swelling of the lips and skin.

Recurrent blistering and secondary infections eventually lead to cutaneous scarring and sclerodermatous changes with areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation. As evident in our cases, hypertrichosis of the face and extremities, along with progressive deformities of the eyelids, nose, and ears and mutilation of digits, is characteristic. Ocular manifestations may include scleral necrosis, necrotizing scleritis, seborrheic blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and sclerokeratitis. Noncutaneous symptoms associated with exposure to direct sunlight can last for up to 24 hours and may include excess tears, photophobia, rhinorrhea, headache, vasovagal symptoms, diarrhea, and vomiting. Milder symptoms of photophobia and headache were reported by our patients; however, other noncutaneous manifestations were not evident. Other distinctive manifestations include erythrodontia along with microstomia, gum recession, dental caries, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia. Mild asymptomatic anemia to severe transfusion-dependent pancytopenia may be present. Bone loss due to demineralization and expansion of the hyperplastic bone marrow may be evident.

### Neuropathies associated with excessive exposure to lead [^112aE1V2]. Muscle & Nerve (2006). Low credibility.

Exposure to lead is a ubiquitous problem of the modern era. The majority of cases of all forms of lead intoxication, especially lead neuropathy, result from industrial exposure. In the Western world meticulous monitoring in industry has reduced the risk of overt lead neuropathy. The classic form of lead neuropathy consists of weakness that primarily involves the wrist and finger extensors but which later spreads to other muscles. There is only minimal sensory involvement. Less commonly, there is a more typical toxic neuropathy with distally accentuated sensory and motor involvement. The motor neuropathy is more likely to develop following relatively short-term exposure to high lead concentrations and evolves in a subacute fashion. Prognosis for recovery is good as long as exposure is terminated promptly. The distal sensory and motor neuropathy develops after many years of exposure, evolves more slowly, and recovery is less certain. There is a generally weak relationship between the development of lead neuropathy and blood lead levels, at least for the subacute motor neuropathy, leading to speculation that the metabolic basis for the neuropathy is interference with porphyrin metabolism. Lead intoxication in humans causes axonal degeneration, but in some other species it causes a primarily demyelinating neuropathy. It should be possible to prevent lead neuropathy by good industrial hygiene. Close monitoring should identify excessive lead exposure before it causes overt neuropathy. If evidence of excessive exposure is found or if overt neuropathy develops, exposure must be terminated immediately. The role of chelation therapy in the treatment of lead neuropathy is controversial.

### Notes from the field: lead poisoning in an infant associated with a metal bracelet-Connecticut, 2016 [^111uMrg6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In September 2016, routine screening of a female infant aged 9 months in Manchester, Connecticut, showed normocytic anemia and a blood lead level of 41 μ g/dL (levels exceeding 5 μ g/dL are abnormal). The child was cared for only in the home, which was built in 1926. Epidemiologic investigation identified two interior window wells with peeling lead-based paint; however, the health department concluded that the windows were unlikely the source of exposure, given the lack of accessibility to these areas by the child. The child's three siblings, ranging in age from 3–5 years, had blood lead levels of < 3 μ g/dL.

The parents reported that the child intermittently wore a handmade "homeopathic magnetic hematite healing bracelet" that they had purchased from an artisan at a local fair (Figure). The child wore the bracelet for teething related discomfort and was sometimes noted to chew on it. Small spacer beads from the bracelet tested at the Manchester Health Department were positive for lead (17,000 ppm). No identifying marks indicating metal content or manufacturer were found on the bead. The vendor records were not available, and the bracelet maker could not be located.

Lead poisoning occurs primarily through oral ingestion of lead containing products. Lead paint, dust, and contaminated soil are the most common sources of lead exposure in children; however, nonpaint sources are often identified in acute poisonings. Cases of severe lead poisoning and death were linked to lead-containing charms and jewelry marketed to children in 2003 and 2006, resulting in large-scale recalls. In 2010, the Consumer Product Commission set the limit of lead content in items manufactured and marketed for children at 100 ppm. * This standard results in numerous recalls of children's jewelry each year †, § but does not apply to items that are not intended for use by or in children's products.

### Happle-tinschert syndrome variable phenotype as part of the mosaic Hedgehog spectrum: report of three cases [^111LheLo]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Happle-Tinschert syndrome is a rare genodermatosis caused by a postzygotic mutation in SMO gene. The most recognized clinical findings include segmentally arranged basaloid follicular hamartomas, nevoid hypertrichosis, linear atrophoderma, and hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation following Blaschko lines associated with osseous, dental, and cerebral alterations. We report three additional cases, two of which lacked the pathognomonic basaloid follicular hamartomas, with genetic confirmation and detailed clinical characterization and describe new cutaneous features of this infrequent syndrome.

### Longitudinal melanonychia and skin hyperpigmentation associated with hydroxychloroquine therapy [^116uJhny]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

After drug rash/eruption (52%), gray/blue skin hyperpigmentation (17%) is the most common dermatologic manifestation of HCQ treatment. Since there is an increased iron concentration in hyperpigmented skin, it has been hypothesized that trauma and bruising with increased levels of hemosiderin activate melanocytes. In a retrospective case-control study including 24 and 517 HCQ-treated systemic lupus erythematosus patients with and without HCQ-induced skin hyperpigmentation, respectively, 96% (23/24) of the patients with hyperpigmentation had a predisposition to bruising, including the use of platelet antiaggregants and/or oral anticoagulants. Although there is no significant dose-dependent relationship, HCQ-induced melanonychia and skin hyperpigmentation have been reported with cumulative dosages of ≥ 230 g and ≥ 452 g, respectively. The histopathologic findings of HCQ-induced hyperpigmentation are yellow-to-brown granules within macrophages and fibroblasts and extracellularly in the dermis. The granules stain positive for either melaninor both melanin and hemosiderin, typically demonstrating hemosiderin around capillaries and melanin in the deeper layers of the dermis.

### Flagellate dermatitis in bleomycin chemotherapy: a causality? [^1155i9kt]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of flagellate erythema includes bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, shiitake mushroom intake, dermatomyositis, adult-onset Still's disease and dermatitis artefacta. Skin manifestations which appear following bleomycin administration and hyperpigmentation which occurs after drug suspension are associated with bleomycin-induced skin disorders. The patients did not experience any skin complaints after the administration of other chemotherapy agents.

Treatment

The first patient was given one dose of 16 mg of methylprednisolone daily for 3 days and 10 mg of cetirizine also once per day. In the second patient, cetirizine and desoximetasone ointment in oleum cocos was applied topically two times per day.

Outcome and follow-up

After a week of treatment, the lesion turned into linear hyperpigmentation with flagellate arrangement and the patients no longer complained about itching. The first patient died while undergoing treatment so the therapy was discontinued. The second patient was still given bleomycin considering there was only one administration left.

Discussion

The diagnosis in these two cases was based on clinical diagnosis which discovered a temporal relationship between the use of bleomycin and the appearance of skin lesions. Skin lesions in the first case appeared on the body after the third bleomycin administration, while in the second case it appeared after the first bleomycin administration. In the first case, some of the lesions on the body initially took the form of urticaria which turned into erythematous patches and then became hyperpigmented patches. In the second case, the lesion first appeared as an erythematous patch which then became a hyperpigmented patch. Dermatological examination on the body showed erythematous patches and hyperpigmented patches, linear in shape, multiple, with flagellate arrangement. Various other case reports have also mentioned the occurrence of flagellate dermatitis after the administration of bleomycin (table 1).

### The clinical toxicology of sodium hypochlorite [^116kB2Zm]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium hypochlorite is used as a bleaching and disinfecting agent and is commonly found in household bleach.

Objective

The objective is to review critically the epidemiology, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of hypochlorite poisoning.

Methods

PubMed was searched from January 1950 to June 2018 using the terms "Hypochlorite", "Sodium Hypochlorite", "Sodium Oxychloride", "Hypochlorous Acid", "Bleach", "Chlorine Bleach", in combination with the keywords "poisoning", "poison", "toxicity", "ingestion", "adverse effects", "overdose", and "intoxication". In addition, bibliographies of identified articles were screened for additional relevant studies including non-indexed reports. Non-peer-reviewed sources were also included. These searches produced 110 citations which were considered relevant.

Epidemiology

There is limited information regarding statistical trends on world-wide poisoning from sodium hypochlorite. In the United States of America, poison control center data have shown that enquiries regarding hypochlorite bleaches have ranged from 43,000 to 46,000 per year over the period 2012–2016. Mechanisms of toxicity: Hypochlorite's potential to cause toxicity is related to its oxidizing capacity and the pH of the solution. Toxicity arises from its corrosive activity upon contact with mucous membranes and skin. Features following ingestion: While small accidental ingestions are very unlikely to cause clinically significant toxicity, large ingestions may cause corrosive gastrointestinal injury and systemic effects, including metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, and hyperchloremia. Features following dental exposure: Hypochlorite is used extensively by dentists for cleaning root canals and is safe if the solution remains within the root canal. Extrusions into the periapical area can result in severe pain with localized large and diffuse swelling and hemorrhage. Features following skin exposure: Prolonged or extensive exposure may cause skin irritation and damage to the skin or dermal hypersensitivity. Such exposures can result in either immediate or delayed-type skin reactions. High concentration solutions have caused severe chemical skin burns. Features following inhalation: Although there are only limited data, inhalation of hypochlorite alone is likely to lead to no more than mild irritation of the upper airways. Features following ocular exposure: Corneal injuries from ocular exposure are generally mild with burning discomfort and superficial disturbance of the corneal epithelium with recovery within 1 or 2 days. With higher concentration solutions, severe eye irritation can occur.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis can typically be made on the basis of a careful history, including details of the specific product used, its hypochlorite concentration, and the amount involved. As hypochlorite bleach produces a characteristic smell of chlorine, this may provide a diagnostic clue. In severe cases, corrosive injury is suggested on presentation because of hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, retrosternal pain or hematemesis.

Management

Symptom-directed supportive care is the mainstay of management. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not beneficial. Local corrosive injury is the major focus of treatment in severe cases. Fiberoptic endoscopy and CT thorax/abdomen are complimentary and have been shown to be useful in corrosive injuries in assessing the severity of injury, risk of mortality and risk of subsequent stricture formation and should be performed as soon as possible after ingestion. Dental periapical extrusion injuries should be left open for some minutes to allow bleeding through the tooth and to limit hematoma development in tissue spaces. Once the bleeding has ceased, the canal can be dressed with non-setting calcium hydroxide and sealed coronally.

Conclusions

Accidental ingestion of household bleach is not normally of clinical significance. However, those who ingest a large amount of a dilute formulation or a high concentration preparation can develop severe, and rarely fatal, corrosive injury so prompt supportive care is essential as there is no specific antidote. Treatment primarily consists of symptom-directed supportive care.

### An asymptomatic draining lesion on the cheek [^114o4h1q]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the preferred treatment?
A. Root canal therapy or extraction
B. Intravenous vancomycin
C. Incision and drainage
D. Radiation therapy
E. Discharge home with oral antibiotics

Answers:

A. Root canal therapy or extraction – Correct. The preferred treatment is root canal therapy (for a restorable tooth) or extraction (for a nonrestorable tooth), after which the sinus tract and associated cutaneous lesion usually resolve within 5 to 14 days. Dental sinuses tend to heal with mild dimpling and hyperpigmentation, which usually improve over time.
B. Intravenous vancomycin – Incorrect. Intravenous vancomycin is the preferred treatment for osteomyelitis but would not be effective in treating a cutaneous sinus of dental origin.
C. Incision and drainage – Incorrect. Nearly 50% of patients reported as having a dental sinus have undergone multiple courses of antibiotics, along with incision and drainage attempts. However, these do not lead to permanent resolution of the sinus.
D. Radiation therapy – Incorrect. This patient does not exhibit signs of squamous cell carcinoma or other forms of cancer that would require radiation therapy.
E. Discharge home with oral antibiotics – Incorrect. The patient has had a draining lesion for many years because of tooth decay. He requires definitive (root canal or tooth extraction) treatment; oral antibiotics will not permanently treat the sinus.

### Association of melanin pigmentation in the gingiva of children with parents who smoke [^115HtEBj]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The association between gingival pigmentation and active smoking has been established. This investigation is the first to address the relationship between gingival pigmentation in children and passive smoking.

Methods

A case-control study was performed involving 59 nonsmoking children who were selected from patient records of a dental clinic in a rural town in Japan. The number of subjects was based on a power calculation. Two calibrated examiners independently observed labial gingiva via oral photographs.

Results

An interview determined that 61% of children had at least 1 smoking parent. Gingival pigmentation was observed in 71% to 78% of children. Interexaminer agreement was satisfactory (kappa = 0.73). Percentage of smoking parents was higher in children with gingival pigmentation (70–71%) than in those who lacked pigmentation (35%). Odds ratios of parental smoking adjusted by age and gender were 5.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.5–20.0) and 5.4 (1.4–21.2) for the 2 examiners.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that excessive pigmentation in the gingiva of children is associated with passive smoking. The visible pigmentation effect in gingiva of children could be useful in terms of parental education.
