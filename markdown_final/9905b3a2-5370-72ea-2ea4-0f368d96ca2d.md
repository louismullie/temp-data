## Question

Active management of infertility

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about active management of infertility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining active management and distinguishing it from expectant care. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide when to escalate to active therapy. Next, I will examine evidence-based strategies by etiology, including unexplained infertility, ovulatory disorders such as PCOS, male factor infertility, endometriosis, and oncofertility. After that, I need to consider special populations and lifestyle-first approaches. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I anchor each claim to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Active management refers to interventions beyond counseling and advice, encompassing ovulation induction, IUI, IVF/ICSI, surgical correction of identifiable causes, and fertility preservation, whereas expectant management relies on education, timing, and lifestyle modification without pharmacologic or procedural therapy, and this distinction is consistently used in contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews [^49268fbc] [^5b916748].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to act. I should verify the general principles that trigger active management: duration of infertility, female age and ovarian reserve, identifiable causes, and patient preference, with parallel evaluation of both partners to avoid delays and to align choices with prognosis and values. This parallel approach is emphasized in male and female evaluation algorithms and in reviews of unexplained infertility management [^cc647e70] [^d86e0a2a] [^5b916748].

> Next, I will examine unexplained infertility, where the balance between expectant and active management is most debated. Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence: a pragmatic RCT showed no significant advantage of clomiphene or unstimulated IUI over expectant management for live birth, though patients preferred active treatment, and a network meta-analysis found insufficient evidence for superiority of OS, IUI, OS-IUI, or IVF versus expectant care overall, but suggested benefit of OS-IUI and IVF in poor-prognosis subgroups. ASRM guidance recommends a short course of OS-IUI before moving to IVF, acknowledging the evidence gap and the need to individualize by age and prognosis [^c0aba33c] [^a06f7cef] [^49268fbc] [^0a00b706].

> I need to check ovulatory disorders next, especially PCOS, where guidance has evolved. Let me verify first-line pharmacotherapy: contemporary international guidelines recommend letrozole as first-line ovulation induction, with clomiphene or metformin as alternatives or adjuncts, and they position gonadotropins as second-line and IVF as third-line when prior strategies fail. They also emphasize lifestyle modification as foundational and single embryo transfer to mitigate multiple pregnancy risk, which I should explicitly note given OHSS and twin risks [^3c5c2de2] [^0f7b3006] [^b6718a98].

> But wait, what if the patient has functional hypothalamic amenorrhea? I should confirm that ovulation induction is deferred until energy balance is restored and BMI is at least 18.5 kg/m² to reduce fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery risks, which is a key safety principle in endocrine guidelines [^2d9f7e44].

> Now, male factor infertility. I will now examine surgical and medical options and where ART fits. Guidelines support varicocele repair when clinically indicated, microsurgical reconstruction for obstruction, and medical therapy such as hCG, SERMs, or aromatase inhibitors for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, while ART, including IUI, IVF, and ICSI with surgical sperm retrieval, is indicated for severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, azoospermia, or after failed reconstructive options. I should also remember to evaluate the female partner in parallel to avoid delays in care [^0fbfdabc] [^cc647e70] [^71660bf5].

> Let me consider endometriosis-associated infertility carefully. Management should be individualized by age, duration of infertility, pain, and stage, with surgery considered for pain or when endometriomas or adhesions are likely to impair reproductive function, while ART is often appropriate when infertility persists or when there is advanced disease. I should double-check that this aligns with committee opinions and that we avoid overpromising surgery for fertility alone [^fb2b46ac] [^bc787989].

> For patients facing gonadotoxic cancer therapy, I need to ensure timely fertility preservation counseling and action. ASCO and FIGO recommend early discussion of risks, offering sperm banking for males and oocyte, embryo, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation for females, with consideration of GnRH analogs in select contexts, and they stress multidisciplinary coordination and equitable access. I should confirm that counseling before treatment reduces regret and improves quality of life, which is supported by survivor data [^51e0babd] [^77bea1fb] [^9bec2eea] [^5d300608].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and preconception care because active management often builds on these foundations. Obesity, smoking, alcohol, and inactivity impair fertility, and structured lifestyle interventions can modestly improve outcomes. In PCOS, weight loss and exercise are first-line, and in unexplained infertility, a short period of lifestyle optimization may be reasonable before pharmacologic therapy. I need to ensure I cite the obesity and reproduction guidance and PCOS guidelines accurately [^7a205302] [^43448b1d] [^3c5c2de2].

> I will now examine special populations where active management may be prioritized. In advanced female age, immediate IVF is often considered first-line due to declining ovarian reserve, and in low-resource settings, ovulation induction with timed intercourse or IUI may be the most feasible active option. For transgender and gender-diverse patients, I should confirm that gender-affirming hormones are not contraceptive and that fertility preservation discussions are offered when relevant [^5b916748] [^261e8301] [^ed185dcd].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while I double-check alignment with guidelines. First, confirm infertility duration and perform parallel evaluation of both partners to identify treatable causes. Second, optimize lifestyle and preconception health. Third, tailor active management to etiology: for unexplained infertility, offer a limited course of OS-IUI before IVF; for PCOS, use letrozole-first ovulation induction with escalation as needed; for male factor, correct identifiable causes and use ART when indicated; for endometriosis, integrate surgery and ART based on stage and symptoms; for oncofertility, prioritize timely preservation. Throughout, incorporate shared decision-making and consider patient values, cost, and access [^cc647e70] [^d86e0a2a] [^0a00b706] [^3c5c2de2] [^0fbfdabc] [^51e0babd].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and explicitly state them. Evidence quality varies, with many recommendations supported by low to moderate certainty. Gaps include the optimal number of OS-IUI cycles, the added value of advanced sperm function tests, and cost-effectiveness across settings. ASRM and international consensus studies highlight these research priorities, and I should note them to avoid overstating benefits [^c13b3f1f] [^98e7ef0f] [^e0523b94].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and counseling points are front and center. Multiple pregnancy risk rises with gonadotropins and OS-IUI, so careful monitoring and single embryo transfer in PCOS are essential. OHSS remains a concern with gonadotropins. And patients should be counseled that semen analysis informs severity and treatment response but does not reliably predict natural conception probability, which shapes expectations and sequencing of active therapies [^5b916748] [^3c5c2de2] [^e0523b94].

Active management of infertility involves **timely, evidence-based interventions** beyond expectant management, including ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), and surgical correction of identifiable causes [^5b916748]. It is indicated when couples fail to conceive after 12 months (or 6 months if the female partner is ≥ 35 years), or when a specific cause is identified [^cc647e70]. Active management improves pregnancy rates and reduces time to conception, but **must be individualized** based on age, duration of infertility, diagnosis, and patient preferences [^0a00b706] [^d86e0a2a]. Risks include multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which are mitigated by careful monitoring and adherence to guidelines [^5b916748] [^49268fbc].

---

## Definition and scope

Active management encompasses **interventions beyond expectant management**, including:

- **Ovulation induction**: Clomiphene citrate, letrozole, gonadotropins [^5b916748].
- **Intrauterine insemination (IUI)**: With or without ovulation stimulation [^49268fbc].
- **In vitro fertilization (IVF)**: Including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [^0cf32b8c].
- **Surgical interventions**: Correction of anatomical abnormalities (e.g. tubal surgery, varicocele repair) [^0fbfdabc].

---

## Indications for active management

Active management is indicated in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for active management** |
|-|-|
| Unexplained infertility | Failure to conceive after 12 months (≤ 35 years) or 6 months (> 35 years) [^cc647e70] |
| Identified causes | - Ovulatory disorders <br/> - Tubal factor <br/> - Male factor <br/> - Endometriosis [^5b916748] |
| Advanced maternal age | ≥ 35 years due to declining fertility [^50382920] |
| Patient preference | Request for expedited treatment after counseling [^d86e0a2a] |

---

## Evidence supporting active management

- **Unexplained infertility**: OS-IUI and IVF improve live birth rates compared to expectant management, especially in poor-prognosis patients [^49268fbc].
- **Ovulatory disorders**: Letrozole is first-line for PCOS-related infertility, with higher live birth rates than clomiphene [^3c5c2de2].
- **Male factor infertility**: Surgical correction, IUI, and IVF/ICSI are effective based on severity [^0fbfdabc].
- **Endometriosis**: Surgery and IVF improve fertility outcomes in moderate-to-severe disease [^notfound].

---

## Risks and limitations

- **Multiple pregnancy**: Increased risk with gonadotropins and OS-IUI; mitigated by careful monitoring and single embryo transfer [^5b916748] [^49268fbc].
- **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)**: Rare but serious; risk reduced by individualized protocols and antagonist regimens [^5b916748].
- **Emotional and financial burden**: Counseling and shared decision-making are essential [^d86e0a2a].

---

## Patient selection and individualized care

Active management should be **tailored** to age, duration of infertility, diagnosis, ovarian reserve, and patient preferences. Shared decision-making is critical to align treatment with patient values and goals [^d86e0a2a].

---

## Comparison with expectant management

Expectant management may be appropriate for select couples with unexplained infertility, particularly younger patients with a short duration of infertility. However, active management **reduces time to conception** and may improve cumulative pregnancy rates, especially in older patients or those with prolonged infertility [^5b916748] [^49268fbc].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **ASRM**: OS-IUI for 3–4 cycles, then IVF for unexplained infertility; IVF first-line for advanced maternal age or severe male factor [^0a00b706] [^5b916748].
- **PCOS guidelines**: Letrozole first-line for ovulation induction; IVF as third-line after failed ovulation induction [^3c5c2de2].
- **Male infertility guidelines**: Surgical correction, IUI, and IVF/ICSI based on severity and cause [^0fbfdabc].

---

Active management of infertility employs **evidence-based interventions** to address specific causes and expedite conception, with treatment individualized to patient factors and preferences. It offers significant benefits over expectant management but requires careful counseling to balance efficacy, risks, and costs.

### Interventions for unexplained infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^49268fbc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical management for unexplained infertility includes expectant management as well as active treatments, including ovarian stimulation (OS), intrauterine insemination (IUI), OS-IUI, and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Existing systematic reviews have conducted head-to-head comparisons of these interventions using pairwise meta-analyses. As this approach allows only the comparison of two interventions at a time and is contingent on the availability of appropriate primary evaluative studies, it is difficult to identify the best intervention in terms of effectiveness and safety. Network meta-analysis compares multiple treatments simultaneously by using both direct and indirect evidence and provides a hierarchy of these treatments, which can potentially better inform clinical decision-making.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different approaches to clinical management (expectant management, OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF/ICSI) in couples with unexplained infertility.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL, up to 6 September 2018, as well as reference lists, to identify eligible studies. We also searched trial registers for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing at least two of the following clinical management options in couples with unexplained infertility: expectant management, OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF (or combined with ICSI).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. We obtained the full texts of potentially eligible studies to assess eligibility and extracted data using standardised forms. The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of cumulative live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and the primary safety outcome was multiple pregnancy. We performed a network meta-analysis within a random-effects multi-variate meta-analysis model. We presented treatment effects by using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For the network meta-analysis, we used Confidence in Network Meta-analysis (CINeMA) to evaluate the overall certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 27 RCTs (4349 couples) in this systematic review and 24 RCTs (3983 couples) in a subsequent network meta-analysis. Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate: the main limitations were imprecision and/or heterogeneity. Ten RCTs including 2725 couples reported on live birth. Evidence of differences between OS, IUI, OS-IUI, or IVF/ICSI versus expectant management was insufficient (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.98; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.43; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.94; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.88, 95 CI 0.81 to 4.38; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following expectant management is assumed to be 17%, the chance following OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF would be 9% to 28%, 11% to 33%, 15% to 37%, and 14% to 47%, respectively. When only including couples with poor prognosis of natural conception (3 trials, 725 couples) we found OS-IUI and IVF/ICSI increased live birth rate compared to expectant management (OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.00 to 10.1; moderate-certainty evidence; OR 4.99, 95 CI 2.07 to 12.04; moderate-certainty evidence), while there was insufficient evidence of a difference between IVF/ICSI and OS-IUI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.60; low-certainty evidence). Eleven RCTs including 2564 couples reported on multiple pregnancy. Compared to expectant management/IUI, OS (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 9.41; low-certainty evidence) and OS-IUI (OR 3.34 95% CI 1.09 to 10.29; moderate-certainty evidence) increased the odds of multiple pregnancy, and there was insufficient evidence of a difference between IVF/ICSI and expectant management/IUI (OR 2.66, 95% CI 0.68 to 10.43; low-certainty evidence). These findings suggest that if the chance of multiple pregnancy following expectant management or IUI is assumed to be 0.6%, the chance following OS, OS-IUI, and IVF/ICSI would be 0.6% to 5.0%, 0.6% to 5.4%, and 0.4% to 5.5%, respectively. Trial results show insufficient evidence of a difference between IVF/ICSI and OS-IUI for moderate/severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.92 to 6.76; 5 studies; 985 women; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of moderate/severe OHSS following OS-IUI is assumed to be 1.1%, the chance following IVF/ICSI would be between 1.0% and 7.2%.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence of differences in live birth between expectant management and the other four interventions (OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF/ICSI). Compared to expectant management/IUI, OS may increase the odds of multiple pregnancy, and OS-IUI probably increases the odds of multiple pregnancy. Evidence on differences between IVF/ICSI and expectant management for multiple pregnancy is insufficient, as is evidence of a difference for moderate or severe OHSS between IVF/ICSI and OS-IUI.

### Basics of practice management: managing many for the care of one [^53371ae4]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

In today's changing health care landscape, it has become necessary that providers have a fundamental understanding of practice management as pertinent to the care they provide. The reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) practice is a uniquely complex setting with many component parts, necessitating frequent assessment and collaboration to provide safe, quality, and cost-effective care. In this review, we aim to describe the basics of medical practice management, divided into six sections: practice models; operations; patient safety; patient experience; employee recruitment; development, and satisfaction; and technology. These topics will be presented with a focus on the application of these principles to the REI practice.

### A public health focus on infertility prevention, detection, and management [^12b588ce]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

In 2002, 2 million American women of reproductive age were infertile. Infertility is also common among men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts surveillance and research on the causes of infertility, monitors the safety and efficacy of infertility treatment, and sponsors national prevention programs. A CDC-wide working group found that, despite this effort, considerable gaps and opportunities exist in surveillance, research, communication, and program and policy development. We intend to consult with other federal agencies, professional and consumer organizations, the scientific community, the health care community, industry, and other stakeholders, and participate in the development of a national public health plan for the prevention, detection, and management of infertility.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^4bb5d32f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

10 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

The intersection of cancer and fertility management is dynamic and requires ongoing research to address gaps and challenges. Priorities include:
Early diagnosis and risk prediction: Develop better tools to assess individual infertility risk based on cancer type, treatment regimen, and reproductive biomarkers (e.g. AMH, FSH).
Fertility‐sparing interventions: Refine medical and surgical strategies to preserve fertility without compromising oncologic outcome, particularly in early‐stage or rare cancers.

11 LEGAL AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

The implementation of effective fertility preservation in cancer care requires supportive legal and political infrastructure. Key recommendations include:
National frameworks: Establish national policies that define infertility prevention as a core component of oncology care, including timely access to fertility preservation.
Equity of access: Enact legislation to ensure publicly funded or insurance‐covered access to fertility preservation for medically indicated cases, including for adolescents and individuals with rare cancers.
Regulatory oversight: Develop clear legal guidance on the use, ownership, and disposition of cryopreserved gametes and embryos, especially in cases of death, separation, or loss of capacity.
Ethical governance: Align national laws with international ethical standards regarding surrogacy, use of donor gametes, and access for individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes.
National registries and data collection: Support centralized tracking systems to monitor utilization, outcomes, and safety of fertility preservation and subsequent pregnancies in cancer survivors, guiding future policy and funding decisions.

Table 4 summarizes key recommendations for both clinicians and health policy makers to further advance oncofertility care.

3.1 Preconception care

To improve fertility and promote healthy pregnancy, optimizing health at preconception is of great importance for women with PCOS. It is recommended that all women see their health practitioner for common preconception risk assessments with enough time before conception to intervene. These assessments are particularly important where the risk for infertility may be higher such as for increased BMI and diabetes in women with PCOS. Recommendations for preconceptional care are presented in Table 2.

Table 2
Preconception care in women with and without PCOS

In the international evidence‐based guidelines for the assessment and management of PCOS, lifestyle and weight management are recommended as an initial treatment strategy in PCOS. Lifestyle interventions can be defined as interventions aimed at improving dietary intake or physical activity through behavioural strategies and support. Weight management can be defined as prevention of weight gain, achieving modest weight loss, and maintaining this reduced weight. The PCOS guidelines recommend for women with excess weight to achieve modest weight loss, an energy deficit of 30% or 500–750 kcal/day (1200–1500 kcal/day) tailored to individual energy requirements, body weight, food preferences, physical activity levels, and preferred approach could be considered. This could be achieved with a lower energy intake through diet, with a higher energy expenditure through increased physical activity level, or a combination of these two lifestyle components. Dietary recommendations are for a range of balanced dietary approaches as per the general population guidelines. There is not one recommended type or composition of diet specific to women with PCOS, due to limited evidence of benefit.

The physical activity recommendations are also consistent with the general population guidelines and recommend a minimum of 150 min/week moderate or 75 min/week vigorous intensity exercise for prevention of weight gain and general health and that women minimize sedentary time and include muscle‐strengthening exercises on two nonconsecutive days/week. A range of behavioural components can also be incorporated into lifestyle interventions to optimize weight management, healthy lifestyle, and emotional wellbeing in women with PCOS including using strategies such as SMART (specific, measurement, achievable, realistic, and timely) goals, goal setting, self‐monitoring, stimulus control, problem solving, assertiveness training, slower eating, reinforcing changes, and relapse prevention. With regard to preconception and lifestyle in women with PCOS, these guidelines also state that factors including weight, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors such as sleep and mental and emotional health need to be optimized in women with PCOS to improve reproductive and obstetric outcomes aligned with recommendations in the general population (Clinical Practice Point 5.1.1).

7 FERTILITY TREATMENT OPTIONS AFTER CANCER

Fertility loss is nearly as significant a concern for reproductive‐aged women diagnosed with cancer as survival itself. Initial fertility assessments after cancer treatment typically include serum levels of FSH, estradiol, and AMH. Ideally, transvaginal ultrasound to assess antral follicle count provides insight into ovarian reserve and reproductive potential. For male survivors, a semen analysis is the standard evaluation.

Clinicians should adopt a holistic approach to counseling, considering factors such as patient age, initial diagnosis, medical history, body mass index, life expectancy, treatment modalities, pregnancy‐associated risks, and reproductive history. All pregnancies achieved following cancer diagnosis and treatment require high‐risk obstetric surveillance.

7.1 Spontaneous pregnancy

Pregnancy rates among cancer survivors are lower than those of age‐matched peers. When couples achieve spontaneous pregnancy, an individualized approach regarding the interval between treatment and conception is essential. Current evidence lacks consensus on the most effective interval; some guidelines recommend postponing pregnancy for 6–12 months, while others suggest a delay of up to 2 years in case there is early recurrence during pregnancy. Pregnancy should not be attempted during active cancer therapy, as short intervals between treatment and conception are associated with increased risks of preterm birth and low birth weight. One study indicated that survivors who delayed conception for 1 year after starting chemotherapy (without radiation), 2 years after starting chemotherapy (with radiation), and 1 year after cervical cancer diagnosis experienced the lowest risks of preterm birth. Survivors of childhood or adolescent cancer are less likely to achieve pregnancy and face higher risks of severe maternal morbidity and preterm birth. Delaying conception is also advised to allow time for detection of recurrences (as these patients may not be suitable for fertility‐sparing surgery or treatment), to minimize potential toxic effects of treatment on gametes, and to mitigate complications from immunosuppression, anemia, cardiovascular effects, physical stress, or insufficient weight gain during pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach and consultation with the treating team are crucial for optimizing survival likelihood while maintaining the chance of pregnancy.

3 EFFECT OF CANCER THERAPIES ON FERTILITY ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER

The impact of cancer therapies on fertility varies significantly depending on the type of cancer, the treatment regimen, and patient‐specific factors such as age and baseline reproductive health. Table 1 summarizes the fertility risks associated with common cancer types and therapies, as well as the recommended fertility preservation options based on current evidence and international guidelines. Factors such as chemotherapy regimen, radiation field and dose, surgical extent, and patient age all contribute to gonadal toxicity.

### Can semen parameters predict pregnancy outcomes? [^e0523b94]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Semen analysis is an integral component of the evaluation and management of men with infertility. Although it is important for patient counseling and clinical decision making, a conventional semen analysis cannot reliably predict the chance of pregnancy or differentiate fertile vs. infertile men (except in the most extreme cases). Advanced, nonstandard sperm functional tests may provide additional discriminatory and prognostic power; however, further research is needed to determine how to best incorporate these tests into modern clinical practice. Therefore, the primary applications of a conventional semen analysis should be to judge the severity of infertility, estimate the effects of future therapy, and measure the response to current therapy.

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^c0aba33c]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Our results also show that women with infertility are reassured by active treatment and are less satisfied with an expectant approach. Similar concerns in the past have limited the number of fertility trials with a control arm. Comparable anxiety and depression scores in the randomised groups suggest that preference for active treatment did not translate into greater mental wellbeing in those randomised to clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination. As both active treatments have resource implications, information on the costs of the two treatments is important to consider and will be reported elsewhere.

Interpretation of our findings needs to take into account the population sampled. We are unable to provide demographic information on those women who did not agree to participate in this trial as we had no ethical approval to collect such data. Criteria for the diagnosis of "true" unexplained infertility are still debatable. Accurate diagnosis is influenced by the nature, number, and precision of the tests used. The present trend towards a less invasive approach to tubal patency testingis supported by data showing that additional laparoscopy after hysterosalpingography does not enhance the success of unstimulated intrauterine insemination. Without routine laparoscopy, however, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of endometriosis.

Statistical approach

An approach commonly adopted in multi-arm trials involves undertaking one global test across all treatment groups. Such tests do not identify which treatments are different and can have limited power to detect genuine differences. We designed our trial to make direct comparisons with a control (expectant management); therefore, there was a logical basis for performing separate significant tests for each active treatment versus expectant management. Knowing which of the active treatments is the more effective is clinically relevant only if both treatments prove to be superior to expectant management.

As recommended and planned a priori, we adjusted our results for the minimisation and stratification factors used in the randomisation schemebut have also presented crude results so that the impact of these adjustments can be assessed. As some women did not receive their randomised treatment, we presented a per protocol analysis of live birth rates, along with the intention to treat analysis, to investigate what effects this might have on our conclusions. We found that unstimulated intrauterine insemination did not enhance live birth, though the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the number needed to treat to benefit was 7, a figure that might be perceived to be clinically worthwhile.

AUA/ASRM male infertility guideline part II — scope, search methods, and evidence grading are outlined. Part II addresses management of the male partner in an infertile couple and presents updated, evidence-based recommendations on the management of male infertility, with recommendations summarized in an associated algorithm. The evidence review searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline from January 2000 to May 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was graded A (alto), B (moderado), or C (bajo) to support strong, moderate, or conditional recommendations; when evidence was insufficient, additional guidance was provided as Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions (Table 1). The document is published simultaneously in Fertility and Sterility and The Journal of Urology. The conclusion notes that male contribution to infertility is prevalent and that specific treatments and assisted reproductive techniques are effective, and the document will undergo additional literature reviews and updates.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^73c42840]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

ART interventions

All couples, either from the experimental arm or from the control arm, will benefit from a personalised follow-up in the context of usual fertility care, which includes:
A consultation with a physician specialist in reproductive biology who programs a standardised clinical and biological evaluation of infertility causes
A multidisciplinary clinical and laboratory staff meeting leading to a decision of a therapeutic strategy, e.g. ovarian stimulation, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

This usual routine program actually will take at least 3 months and the first ART attempt will occur between three and 12 months since the initial visit (M0).

Materials and Methods

Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full Guideline and the technical report, which are available online. In brief, extensive healthcare professional and consumer or patient engagement informed the Guideline priority areas. International society-nominated panels from across three leading entities, four partner organizations and thirty-two collaborating entities included consumers and experts in paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, sleep, bariatric/ metabolic surgery, public health, other co-opted experts, project management, evidence synthesis and translation. Governance included an international advisory and a management committee, five guideline development groups (GDGs) with 56 members, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. The five GDGs covered i) Screening, diagnostic and risk assessment and life stage; ii) Psychological features and models of care; iii) Lifestyle management; iv) Management of nonfertility features; and v) Assessment and management of infertility. The leading entities; the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centres for Research Excellence in Women's Health in Reproductive Life and in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, led by Monash University, partnered with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Endocrine Society, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and collaborated with 32 other entities. With international meetings over 12 months fifty-five prioritized clinical questions involved 52 systematic and three narrative reviews, generating evidence-based and consensus recommendations with accompanying practice points. Committee members nominated by partner and collaborator organizations provided international peer review, and independent experts reviewed methods which were then submitted to NHMRC for independent review. The target audience includes multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, consumers or patients, policy makers, and educators. The Guideline includes a focus on equity, cultural and ethnic diversity, avoidance of stigma and inclusivity (see full guideline for details).

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^ff2c9d8b]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

If both active treatments (clomifene citrate and unstimulated intrauterine insemination) were found to be more effective than expectant management, we anticipated having over 85% power at the 5% level of significance to detect an absolute difference of 15% (15% to 30%) in live birth rates between the active treatment groups.

Data were entered on a computer held database and analysed with SPSS for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL; version 14). The analysis strategy was defined a priori and addressed the clinically relevant comparisons. Our primary aim was to compare clomifene citrate versus expectant management and unstimulated intrauterine insemination versus expectant management. We intended to compare the two active treatments only if both were found to be superior to expectant management. We decided not to conduct a global test across all three groups as the direct comparisons were of clinical relevance. We used intention to treat analyses throughout, with a secondary per protocol analysis conducted on live birth rates only. We analysed categorical variables with χ² tests, used logistic regression models to adjust for maternal age, parity, duration of infertility, and recruitment centre, and calculated odds ratios with confidence intervals (95% for the primary outcome, 99% for secondary outcomes). On the basis of the crude live birth rates and 95% confidence intervals for the absolute risk reductions calculated with Newcombe's method for two unpaired proportions, we computed the numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNB) or harm (NNH) as appropriate, along with their 95% confidence intervals. We initially compared time to pregnancy leading to a live birth with log rank tests, then used Cox proportional hazards models to make adjustments. Interaction tests for subgroup analyses (planned a priori) were obtained with logistic regression modelling live birth per woman. Responses to the questions regarding the acceptability of treatment were grouped into "acceptable" or "unacceptable" for the purposes of analysis. A P value of 0.05 was considered significant for the primary outcome, while a value of 0.01 was used for all secondary outcomes.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^0f7b3006]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Letrozole is the preferred first line pharmacological infertility therapy, with clomiphene in combination with metformin; gonadotrophins or ovarian surgery primarily having a role as second line therapy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be offered, potentially with in vitro maturation, as third line therapy, where other ovulation induction therapies have failed and in the absence of an absolute indication for IVF in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Given the underlying risk for pregnancy complications in PCOS, single embryo transfer should be preferred.

Overall, evidence in PCOS is low to moderate quality. Based on high prevalence and significant health impact, greater priority, education, models of care, funding, and research are recommended. Guideline translation will be extensive including multilingual education outputs and evidence-based resources for consumers (the ASKPCOS app), healthcare professionals and policy makers.

The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however a clear process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available by contacting the author for correspondence online. The translation program will be free and internationally accessible, building on the existing range of codesigned resources including the patient focused, evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), used in 186 countries and based on a rigorously developed question prompt list. Multi-faceted patient codesigned resources will aim to enhance health literacy with comprehensive PCOS-related health information available in multiple formats and in 15–20 languages. Internationally accessible resources include education modules for healthcare professionals at different career stages and disciplines, healthcare professional accredited courses, practice resources and tools, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources that will be available online. Importantly, the Guideline and translation of the Guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, of accessible evidence-based information and of improved multi-disciplinary support. Ultimately, this international initiative may serve as an exemplar for large scale collaborative engagement, pooling of resources, avoidance of duplication and inconsistency with consensus-based statements, and codesign of best quality consistent guidelines with processes for local adaption and healthcare impact. Key elements include extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation, consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation, and evaluation. We sincerely thank the partner and collaborating organizations, consumer groups and members of the GDGs for their substantive commitment to the international partnership to optimize health outcomes for women with this common, heterogeneous, and much neglected condition.

### Cancer and fertility management: FIGO best practice advice [^960c3396]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

For adolescents and young adults facing a cancer diagnosis, the fight for survival is often intertwined with concerns about their future, particularly the ability to have children. Among women of reproductive age, approximately 1 million cancers are diagnosed every year. In 2021, over 383 000 new cancer cases were diagnosed in women aged 15–39 years globally, causing over 81 000 deaths. Epidemiological data indicate a concerning rise in incidence among this demographic over the past three decades. Adolescents and young adults (15–39 years) face a disproportionate burden, with an incidence twice as high in women (52.9 vs. 28.3 per 100 000) and higher mortality (13.1 vs. 10.6 per 100 000) compared with men in 2022.

The most common cancers in adolescents and young adults include breast, cervical, ovarian, endometrial, thyroid, and colorectal cancers, as well as leukemia, lymphomas, and melanoma. Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, can pose a substantial threat to fertility by causing premature ovarian failure and diminished ovarian reserve. In affected males, these treatments can result in azoospermia. For young patients, the ability to conceive and give birth is critical for quality of life and long‐term well‐being, making fertility preservation an essential component of comprehensive cancer care.

Chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents, can severely impact female fertility by damaging ovarian follicles, with the risk of infertility increasing with age and specific drugs used; cyclophosphamide for breast cancer is notably linked to premature ovarian insufficiency. While younger women are less likely to experience permanent amenorrhea, they still face a heightened risk of premature menopause, even if menstruation resumes after treatment. Radiation therapy also threatens fertility, especially when the pelvic region is targeted. The extent of ovarian damage depends on the dose and treatment area. Pelvic radiation can also impair uterine function through fibrosis and reduced myometrial elasticity, raising the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight — even when ovarian function remains intact. The increasing incidence of young‐onset colorectal cancer presents unique challenges concerning treatment and reproductive function. Recognizing that fertility concerns are often second only to survival for these young individuals underscores the necessity of integrating fertility preservation into oncological care.

### Review of the different treatments and management for prostate cancer and fertility [^26631ace]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the options available for prostate cancer management and their consequences on fertility for men, in order to best advise these men to choose their treatment, especially if they are young, with no child with their current partner.

Methods

A literature review on prostate cancer and fertility over the last 26 years was carried out on PubMed database. The literature was based on evidence and practical considerations. Twenty-nine articles were selected according to their relevance.

Results

After prostatectomy, there is an obstructive infertility in 100% of the cases. In external radiotherapy, doses more than 15 cGy induced reduction in sperm count. Direct irradiation between 15 and 35 cGy caused oligozoospermia and doses between 35 and 50 cGy caused reversible azoospermia. The calculated projected doses on testicles were 196 cGy (± 145 cGy). The brachytherapy effects on fertility seems to be less harmful. The irradiation dose received by testicles is less important (less than 20 cGy) after brachytherapy than after external radiotherapy. Infertility induced by hormonal therapy alone should be reversible. Fertility and focal therapy have not been well evaluated yet. Active surveillance is the management of prostate cancer which allows to keep at best men's fertility.

Conclusion

Urologists should consider approaching the topic of infertility when discussing the pros and cons of various prostate cancer management with their younger patients. If a patient with prostate cancer expresses interest in future fertility, a semen analysis should be performed. Cryopreservation represents the only preemptive accompanying possibility to preserve fertility in young cancer patients.

4 FERTILITY OUTCOMES AFTER CANCER TREATMENT

Improved cancer survival often comes at the cost of fertility, which is a key concern for adolescents and young adults. This section explores the factors affecting the postcancer reproductive potential of this population.

4.1 Impact of cancer on subsequent pregnancy

Studies involving both childhood cancer survivors and population‐based cohorts have demonstrated a markedly decreased chance of pregnancy. Azoospermia may cause permanent sterility in male survivors without prior sperm banking. A recent cohort study in Scotland found a 38% reduction in pregnancy likelihood after a cancer diagnosis compared with the general population. This decrease was consistent across all age groups and cancer types. Beyond conception rates, pregnancies in cancer survivors carry specific risks, with a meta‐analysis showing a 45% higher risk of preterm labor for breast cancer survivors compared with the general population.

FIGO's Best Practice Advice on pregnancy after cancer highlights that survivors, depending on their cancer type and treatment, may face increased risks for various obstetric and perinatal complications, including cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, renal, and hepatic issues.

4.2 Impact of cancer treatments on fertility

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may impair fertility based on treatment type, dose, and radiation site. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines classify risk by treatment protocol and patient‐specific factors (e.g. characteristics, drug dosages). Alkylating agents, for example, reduce primordial follicle counts, with greater ovarian damage in older patients. Pelvic radiation can damage reproductive organs, including the uterus, leading to scarring and reduced flexibility that may affect future pregnancies. Cranial radiation can disrupt hormonal regulation. The likelihood and timing of ovarian failure depend on ovarian radiation dose.

4.3 Estimation of ovarian reserve after cancer

Predicting ovarian function after cancer treatment involves assessing reduced follicle counts using ultrasound and endocrine evaluations of follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), AMH, inhibin B, and luteinizing hormone. While AMH has been identified as a clinically useful indicator of gonadotoxicity in young women undergoing cancer treatment, recent research suggests that oocyte quality, rather than solely AMH levels, may be a critical factor in fertility potential. Furthermore, it is important to note that AMH levels do not directly and definitively correlate with the chance of spontaneous conception; women with low AMH may still conceive. Accurate fertility prediction in survivorship is crucial, highlighting the importance of fertility preservation strategies like oocyte vitrification and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, especially for individuals at high risk of treatment‐induced infertility. For males, semen analysis is the standard and critical method for assessing fertility status.

### Top 10 priorities for future infertility research: an international consensus development study [^98e7ef0f]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Question

Can the priorities for future research in infertility be identified?

Summary Answer

The top 10 research priorities for the four areas of male infertility, female and unexplained infertility, medically assisted reproduction, and ethics, access, and organization of care for people with fertility problems were identified.

What Is Known Already

Many fundamental questions regarding the prevention, management, and consequences of infertility remain unanswered. This is a barrier to improving the care received by those people with fertility problems.

Study Design, Size, Duration

Potential research questions were collated from an initial international survey, a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines, and Cochrane systematic reviews. A rationalized list of confirmed research uncertainties was prioritized in an interim international survey. Prioritized research uncertainties were discussed during a consensus development meeting. Using a formal consensus development method, the modified nominal group technique, diverse stakeholders identified the top 10 research priorities for each of the categories male infertility, female and unexplained infertility, medically assisted reproduction, and ethics, access, and organization of care.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Healthcare professionals, people with fertility problems, and others (healthcare funders, healthcare providers, healthcare regulators, research funding bodies and researchers) were brought together in an open and transparent process using formal consensus methods advocated by the James Lind Alliance.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The initial survey was completed by 388 participants from 40 countries, and 423 potential research questions were submitted. Fourteen clinical practice guidelines and 162 Cochrane systematic reviews identified a further 236 potential research questions. A rationalized list of 231 confirmed research uncertainties were entered into an interim prioritization survey completed by 317 respondents from 43 countries. The top 10 research priorities for each of the four categories male infertility, female and unexplained infertility (including age-related infertility, ovarian cysts, uterine cavity abnormalities, and tubal factor infertility), medically assisted reproduction (including ovarian stimulation, IUI, and IVF), and ethics, access, and organization of care, were identified during a consensus development meeting involving 41 participants from 11 countries. These research priorities were diverse and seek answers to questions regarding prevention, treatment, and the longer-term impact of infertility. They highlight the importance of pursuing research which has often been overlooked, including addressing the emotional and psychological impact of infertility, improving access to fertility treatment, particularly in lower resource settings, and securing appropriate regulation. Addressing these priorities will require diverse research methodologies, including laboratory-based science, qualitative and quantitative research, and population science.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

We used consensus development methods, which have inherent limitations, including the representativeness of the participant sample, methodological decisions informed by professional judgement, and arbitrary consensus definitions.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

We anticipate that identified research priorities, developed to specifically highlight the most pressing clinical needs as perceived by healthcare professionals, people with fertility problems, and others, will help research funding organizations and researchers to develop their future research agenda.

Secondary outcomes

Table 4 shows other clinical outcomes in the three randomised groups. Clinical pregnancy rates were comparable between expectant management and clomifene citrate (17% v 15%) and expectant management and unstimulated intrauterine insemination (17% v 23%). Rates of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy were also similar in the two comparisons, as were rates of multiple pregnancy.

Side effects including abdominal pain, bloating, hot flushes, nausea, and headaches were more common in the clomifene citrate group than in the other groups, affecting about 10–20% of women. Despite this, women on active treatments found the process of treatment more acceptable than those randomised to expectant management. The proportion of women scoring 11 or more on the anxiety or depression subscales at six months was similar across the three groups.

Stages iii and iv: international PCOS Guideline Network consensus and international peer review

Via a series of international GDG meetings over nine months, a clinical research priority roadmap consisting of over 150 research recommendations throughout the life course of women with PCOS was generated to guide future clinical research (Table 3). These were categorised across the five topic areas in the International PCOS Guideline: 1) Screening, diagnostic assessment, risk assessment, and life stage; 2) Psychological features and models of care; 3) Lifestyle management; 4) Management of non-fertility features; and 5) Assessment and treatment of infertility. Clinical research priorities revolved around five key themes: 1) greater insights into accurate diagnosis, deeper understanding of natural history and complication prevention of PCOS across diverse subgroups, age groups including adolescence and post menopause, ethnicities and weight categories; 2) developing evidence-based resources and tools and exploring optimal modes for information provision (e.g. AskPCOS app), developing optimal models of care and strategies for shared decision making; 3) exploring effective lifestyle and other weight management strategies and minimising weight stigma in PCOS; 4) examining impact of interventions on the interconnected aspects of PCOS across reproductive, metabolic, and psychological well-being; and conducting thorough comparisons of treatment efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness with a focus on long-term follow-up assessments; and 5) optimising preconception care and fertility treatments in PCOS. Finally, public and stakeholder feedback during the international peer review process informed refinement of the final International PCOS Guideline clinical research priority roadmap, providing valuable external validation of the relevance of the roadmap to the global PCOS research community (Table 3).

### The nairobi summit and reproductive justice: unmet needs for people with infertility [^261e8301]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The Nairobi Summit, held in November 2019 and convened by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, claims to have represented "all nations and peoples, and all segments" of society during its high-level conference. The overall aim of the summit was to mobilize political will and financial commitments that are urgently needed to "finally and fully" implement the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Program of Action. Despite the recommendation by ICPD to incorporate infertility care in reproductive health services, the new Nairobi Statement largely neglects the topic of infertility. This is particularly troublesome as infertility is a global health problem affecting between 52.6 and 72.4 million couples worldwide, with a high prevalence in low- and middle-income settings. For many people around the world, infertility constitutes an emotional, social, and financial burden, yet appropriate services directed toward preventing and addressing infertility are often inaccessible, unaffordable, or nonexistent. With the impetus of a wider reproductive justice community, we call for the integration of infertility into global reproductive health research and practice, urging policy makers, practitioners, researchers, activists, and funders worldwide to bring focused attention to addressing challenges posed by a lack of safe, effective, and dignified fertility management among those in need.

Management of Infertility

Overall LSTs were considered the optimal first-line treatment for anovulation in women with PCOS and infertility for 3 to 6 months. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline considered pharmacological ovulation induction a contraindication in obese women (body mass index > 35 kg/m²) with PCOS. Three CPGs recommended the use of letrozole as the primary method of pharmacological ovulation induction. This represented a shift in evidence compared to older CPGs such as the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guideline, which considered it optional, and the Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline which recommended clomiphene citrate as first-line treatment. Most CPGs recommended ovulation induction with gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling as a second-line treatment. The Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline recommended ovulation induction with a follicle stimulating hormone starting dose of 37.5 to 50 IU/day used up to a 14-day stimulation period with close ovulation monitoring and a maximum of 6 stimulation cycles. In vitro fertilization was suggested as last option with a preference for gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocols and metformin to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although there were limited recommendations on the best in vitro fertilization protocols in women with PCOS.

### Diagnosis and management of infertility: a review [^5b916748]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, approximately 12.7% of reproductive age women seek treatment for infertility each year. This review summarizes current evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of infertility.

Observations

Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Approximately 85% of infertile couples have an identifiable cause. The most common causes of infertility are ovulatory dysfunction, male factor infertility, and tubal disease. The remaining 15% of infertile couples have "unexplained infertility". Lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity, can adversely affect fertility. Ovulatory disorders account for approximately 25% of infertility diagnoses; 70% of women with anovulation have polycystic ovary syndrome. Infertility can also be a marker of an underlying chronic disease associated with infertility. Clomiphene citrate, aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole, and gonadotropins are used to induce ovulation or for ovarian stimulation during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Adverse effects of gonadotropins include multiple pregnancy (up to 36% of cycles, depending on specific therapy) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (1%-5% of cycles), consisting of ascites, electrolyte imbalance, and hypercoagulability. For individuals presenting with anovulation, ovulation induction with timed intercourse is often the appropriate initial treatment choice. For couples with unexplained infertility, endometriosis, or mild male factor infertility, an initial 3 to 4 cycles of ovarian stimulation may be pursued; IVF should be considered if these approaches do not result in pregnancy. Because female fecundity declines with age, this factor should guide decision-making. Immediate IVF may be considered as a first-line treatment strategy in women older than 38 to 40 years. IVF is also indicated in cases of severe male factor infertility or untreated bilateral tubal factor.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 1 in 8 women aged 15 to 49 years receive infertility services. Although success rates vary by age and diagnosis, accurate diagnosis and effective therapy along with shared decision-making can facilitate achievement of fertility goals in many couples treated for infertility.

FERTILITY MANAGEMENT BEFORE INITIATION OF CHEMOTHERAPY

Fertility Preservation Counseling

Guidelines from both the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology state that health care providers should discuss infertility risks and fertility preservation options with all reproductive-aged patients before they undergo oncology treatment. Such discussions typically address associated infertility risk, desire for future childbearing, complications of delaying or altering treatment for fertility preservation, life stage (eg, age and partner status), options for fertility preservation, costs, and potential long-term risks of treatment to future offspring. Despite these recommendations, many women do not receive fertility counseling because oncologists often report discomfort in having these conversations with patients owing to their lack of knowledge and the perception that it may not be of benefit to the patient. - In a recent systematic review, providers' knowledge of fertility preservation options was found to be as low as 22%, depending on provider type and specific methods of preservation. Additional barriers to counseling include a lack of training and resources, time constraints, and the need for timely referral options to reproductive specialists. Time-sensitive fertility discussions can be overwhelming in the context of a new cancer diagnosis, but they are an important component of cancer-related care.

The reports from young adult female cancer survivors have shown that receiving fertility preservation counseling reduces long-term regret and dissatisfaction. Improved quality of life was observed in patients who received external fertility preservation counseling and in patients who chose to preserve fertility, compared with patients counseled by an oncology team alone. Optimally, patients should be informed about the effect of cancer treatment on their reproductive future, even when fertility preservation may not be feasible, because the counseling and an increased understanding of the treatment plan carries a demonstrated benefit.

It is also important to highlight that while lifestyle management is a first-line treatment for PCOS, the addition of pharmacological therapies to further improve clinical features of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity and infertility are often indicated. In these instances, prescribing physicians should consider how medical management and lifestyle change can be used in adjunct to optimise treatment. For example, the use of combined oral contraceptive pills may have detrimental effects on weight gain and mental health, which can be mitigated by appropriate lifestyle intervention. Further, the combination of lifestyle modification and metformin has been shown to lower BMI, subcutaneous adipose tissue and improve menstruation compared with lifestyle modification alone, and hence may have an additive effect on improving cardio-metabolic outcomes in high risk groups.

2 PATIENT COUNSELING

Beyond immediate medical needs and emotional strain, a cancer diagnosis can severely impact fertility. The narrow timeframe for fertility preservation often conflicts with the urgency of cancer treatment, making timely, collaborative counseling essential. This counseling, ideally provided at diagnosis before treatment, should involve oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists, and fertility specialists to ensure personalized patient support.

Balancing urgent cancer therapy with the limited window for fertility preservation necessitates compassionate, personalized counseling. Even in highly urgent clinical scenarios requiring immediate therapy, where options may be limited, rapid multidisciplinary coordination remains critical to explore any feasible options, such as emergency sperm banking or ovarian suppression during chemotherapy. This approach aims to integrate treatment with fertility preservation considerations while addressing patient burdens, including financial concerns, and respecting individual parenthood desires.
Education on gonadotoxicity: Initiate timely discussions about potential reproductive risks, emphasizing their time‐sensitive nature: ⚬ High‐risk therapies: Clearly explain the significant risks of ovarian failure or azoospermia associated with alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide), pelvic radiation, and total body irradiation. ⚬ Emerging therapies: Acknowledge the uncertain long‐term gonadotoxic effects of newer agents such as PARP inhibitors and TKIs, necessitating tailored fertility preservation strategies and ongoing research.
Fertility preservation options: Provide comprehensive information regarding realistic fertility preservation options: ⚬ Female patients: Standard options include oocyte, embryo, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation, with success rates influenced by age and ovarian reserve markers (e.g. anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels). Discuss potential protective role of GnRH agonists, particularly in breast cancer. ⚬ Male patients: Offer sperm banking as the standard. In cases of azoospermia, inform patients about the availability of TESE. ⚬ When gamete collection is not feasible or is unsuccessful, discuss the use of donor gametes and related ethical, legal, and psychological implications, including potential cross‐border treatment and relevant regulations.
Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT‐M): Patients with hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g. BRCA, Lynch syndrome) may benefit from PGT‐M to reduce the transmission risk to offspring, requiring coordination with genetic counselors or clinical geneticists.
Psychosocial and financial support: Recognize the significant emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis and the potential for infertility. Counseling should address the psychological and emotional aspects of fertility preservation, ensuring patients have access to mental health resources and relevant support networks. Financial barriers often limit access to fertility preservation options, particularly in low‐resource settings. Therefore, it is crucial to provide transparent information about the costs of fertility preservation and explore available options if appropriate, including insurance coverage, charitable programs, or institutional support.
Legal and ethical considerations: Patients should be informed about the legal frameworks governing fertility preservation in their region, including issues related to ownership and disposition of cryopreserved gametes or embryos, as well as the legal implications surrounding the use of donor gametes.

International glossary on infertility — working methodology describes WHO-led consultations, consensus procedures, and external review. In December 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) held an expert consultation to review progress in developing guidelines for infertility diagnosis, management and treatment through a systematic review process. A consensus expert consultation meeting was held in September 2015, and when disagreements were not resolved, the final decision was reached after a vote, defined before the meeting as consensus if passed with 75%. Adhering to internationally accepted procedures, over the next 9 months an external expert group, which included representatives from non-governmental organizations, reviewed and provided final feedback on the glossary; in addition to the lead organization (ICMART), collaborative organizations included The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), ESHRE, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Thus, this 2017 glossary covers a broad spectrum of terms currently being used in infertility and fertility care.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^0a00b706]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — summary recommendations and future directions state that "For most couples with unexplained infertility, the best initial therapy is a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of OS and IUI, either with clomiphene or letrozole, followed by IVF for those couples unsuccessful in achieving a pregnancy with OS and IUI". The document further notes, "There is a pressing need for additional therapies to bridge the wide gap in effectiveness between OS with oral medications and IVF", and "Further research is needed into methods to improve access to care, including ART treatments".

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^a06f7cef]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Results

A total of 580 couples were recruited between September 2001 and September 2005 (fig 1).

Fig 1 Trial flow chart

Baseline characteristics

The three groups (expectant management, clomifene citrate, and intrauterine insemination) were comparable in terms of women's age, men's age, BMI, semen variables, and proportion of couples with primary infertility (table 1). The median duration of infertility was 30 months in each of the randomised groups and only a few individuals (under 10%) had endometriosis or mild male factor infertility problems.

IQR = interquartile range; BMI = body mass index; HADS = hospital anxiety and depression scale.

*Percentage of those who had mild endometriosis.

Active treatments

Of the 194 women randomised to clomifene citrate, 93 (48%) received six completed cycles of clomifene citrate and 18 (9%) received none over the six month trial period. During the trial period, 37/193 (19%) women randomised to unstimulated intrauterine insemination received six completed cycles of intrauterine insemination and 26 (13%) received none. The median (interquartile range) number of treatment cycles received was 5 (2–6) for the clomifene citrate group and 4 (2–5) for the intrauterine insemination group.

Of the 883 cycles where the intention was for the women to receive clomifene, 31 (4%) cycles in 20 women resulted in an exaggerated response (three or more follicles). There were 785 cycles where the intention was for the women to receive intrauterine insemination; 25 (3%) of these cycles resulted in missing the luteinising hormone surge and 13 women missed the surge at least once.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^d86e0a2a]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation approach — Subsequent diagnostic evaluation should be conducted in a systematic, expeditious, and cost-effective manner to identify all relevant factors, with an initial emphasis on the least invasive methods for the detection of the most common causes of infertility. The pace and extent of evaluation should take into account the couple's preferences, patient age, the duration of infertility, and the unique features of the medical history and physical examination.

### Advanced reproductive age and fertility: no. 269, November 2011 [^50382920]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To improve awareness of the natural age-related decline in female and male fertility with respect to natural fertility and assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and provide recommendations for their management, and to review investigations in the assessment of ovarian aging.

Options

This guideline reviews options for the assessment of ovarian reserve and fertility treatments using ART with women of advanced reproductive age presenting with infertility.

Outcomes

The outcomes measured are the predictive value of ovarian reserve testing and pregnancy rates with natural and assisted fertility.

Evidence

Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or Medline, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library in June 2010, using appropriate key words (ovarian aging, ovarian reserve, advanced maternal age, advanced paternal age, ART). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated into the guideline to December 2010.

Values

The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice were ranked according to the method described in that report (Table).

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

Primary and specialist health care providers and women will be better informed about ovarian aging and the age-related decline in natural fertility and about options for assisted reproductive technology.

### Infertility-prevention and management [^0490bd87]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Infertility and subfertility, menstrual irregularities, and decreased parity may occur in women with autoimmune diseases due to multiple factors, including underlying inflammatory disease, gonadotoxic medications, and psychosocial issues related to living with chronic disease. Awareness of these factors, as well as validation and support of patients confronting reproductive challenges, is important for providing comprehensive care to these women. An understanding of the expanding options for fertility preservation strategies during gonadotoxic medications is essential. Referral to a reproductive endocrinology clinic is indicated in this patient population.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^b6718a98]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

### How effective are the components of active management of the third stage of labor? [^91272435]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Our analysis also provided an opportunity to examine the effect of route of oxytocin administration on post-partum blood loss. The results indicate that the longstanding assumption of equivalent effect may be incorrect, and that intravenous administration is superior to intramuscular administration. The evidence for this can be found in the large differences in hemorrhage risk among those who received oxytocin only. The fact that route of administration had no discernible effect on hemorrhage risk when oxytocin was combined with other active management interventions suggests that any underlying differences due to route of administration are mediated by the presence of controlled cord traction and possibly also by uterine massage.

While one of the key strengths of this analysis was the large number of participants in each AMTSL group with objectively measured blood loss post-partum, there were also several limitations. The studies were carried out in hospital facilities only, and thus may not be generalizable to other delivery settings. In addition, the provision of AMTSL components was not randomly assigned. Finally, there was some variation in procedures for administering AMTSL interventions, and these differences occurred both within- and between-sites. This variation is also a strength, however, since it reflects real differences in implementation of active management of the third stage of labor.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2d9f7e44]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for amenorrhea, more specifically with respect to management of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (management of infertility), ES 2017 guidelines recommend to consider inducing ovulation only in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea having a BMI of at least 18.5 kg/m² and only after attempts to normalize energy balance, due to the increased risk for fetal loss, small-for-gestational-age babies, preterm labor, and delivery by C-section for extremely low weight.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^83d6512b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^51e0babd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for fertility preservation, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to offer an evaluation and counseling regarding the risk of reproductive function impairment and infertility in patients with cancer to ensure they are informed and supported in managing the potential reproductive impacts of their cancer treatment. Take into account the following in the assessment:

- specific patient groups at high risk due to the gonadotoxic nature of therapies they receive or could receive in the future, and those on longer-term treatments delaying or precluding the ability to conceive

- patients for whom the risk remains uncertain due to the unknown reproductive toxicity of many cancer-directed therapies

- the effect of chronologic age for females due to increased infertility risk with concomitant aging.

### Review of pregnancy in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^67344c5e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of IBD during pregnancy

Preconception management

Preconception counseling is an important component of IBD management (Figure 2). Gastroenterologists should proactively initiate preconception counseling conversations with all men and women of childbearing age. In addition to providing standard antenatal education, counseling should address patient misconceptions about infertility, medication safety, maternofetal complications, and IBD heritability, which are common concerns in IBD patients and contribute toward VC. – This is associated with improved medication adherence, folic acid supplementation, smoking cessation, reduced disease flares during pregnancy, and improved neonatal outcomes. – In women actively contemplating pregnancy, medication review for risk of teratogenicity and objective assessment of disease activity should be performed prior to conception, aiming to confirm disease remission to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Patients should be encouraged to join IBD support organizations, with membership predictive of significantly higher pregnancy-specific IBD knowledge.

Figure 2.
Considerations for pregnancy management in women with inflammatory bowel disease.

IBD, inflammatory bowel disease.

Folic acid can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by 72%, without adverse neonatal effects; therefore, supplementation should be provided to all pregnant women and women contemplating conception. The recommended dose is 400–800 µg/day in combination with adequate dietary intake, commencing at least 1 month prior to conception and continuing at least throughout the first trimester. Higher doses of 2 mg/day are recommended for patients taking sulfasalazine, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thus impairing absorption and metabolism of folic acid. – Other congenital defects associated with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, such as cardiovascular and oral cleft deformities, may also be mitigated by folic acid supplementation.

### First and second stage labor management: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 8 [^1a77f5e7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Active labor — start threshold and application of management standards are specified. ACOG recommends that cervical dilation of 6 cm be considered the start of the active phase of labor. (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE) Based on the 2010 Zhang labor curve, the inflection point at which latent labor transitions to active labor is at approximately 6 cm dilation. Although this reflects an average starting point, there may be a range of dilation between 4 cm and 6 cm at which the rate of cervical change rapidly increases. However, standards of active-phase management and active-phase arrest should not be applied until at least 6 cm dilation.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^448b6582]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology reproductive health guideline — introduction emphasizes that management of reproductive health in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) differs from healthy persons and requires clinician counseling on contraception, pregnancy and lactation, assisted reproductive technology (ART), fertility preservation, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), with collaboration across obstetrics-gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Pregnancy in women with RMD may lead to serious maternal or fetal adverse outcomes, and contraception tailored to the individual patient with emphasis on safety and efficacy should be discussed and encouraged; risk for pregnancy complications depends on diagnosis, disease activity and damage, medications, and the presence of anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies. Not all medications are safe for preconception use by men and women or during pregnancy and lactation, but uncontrolled systemic inflammatory disease is itself associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and patients are vulnerable to disease flare postpartum; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for 6 months. Medication safety is often uncertain because most data are from case reports, small series, and observational studies, and randomized controlled trial data are scarce, making appropriate screening and management (including medication use) challenging; some patients also seek advice about oocyte preservation and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Conclusion statements note that the guideline provides evidence-based recommendations, many recommendations are conditional, and it is intended to inform a shared decision-making process that incorporates patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^77bea1fb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Risks of infertility from cancer treatment — clinicians should offer an evaluation and counseling regarding the risk of reproductive function impairment and infertility to ensure that all patients are appropriately informed and supported in managing the potential reproductive impacts of their cancer treatment (Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). This assessment should consider specific patient groups known to be at increased risk due to the gonadotoxic nature of the therapies they receive or could receive in the future, and those on longer-term treatments that delay or preclude the ability to conceive. It should also consider those for whom the risk remains uncertain due to the unknown reproductive toxicity of many cancer-directed therapies, and the effect of chronologic age should also be taken into account for females due to increased infertility risk with concomitant aging.

### Health care for transgender and gender diverse individuals: ACOG committee opinion, number 823 [^ed185dcd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gender dysphoria, more specifically with respect to management of adults, counseling, ACOG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that gender-affirming hormone therapy is not effective contraception. Counsel sexually active individuals with retained gonads not wishing to become pregnant or cause pregnancy in others about the possibility of pregnancy if thet have a sexual activity involving sperm and oocytes.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^d8ad8277]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Table 3 — strength of evidence grading provides three categories. Grade A is "High confidence in evidence. Larger or further study very unlikely to change reported effect", with the "Majority of evidence supported by well-constructed RCTs or extremely strong and consistent observational studies" and appropriate design safeguards. Grade B indicates "Moderate confidence in evidence. Larger or further studies not likely to change reported effect but may more precisely identify magnitude of effect", with evidence "comprised of RCTs with potential weaknesses" or "moderately strong and consistent observational studies" meeting design criteria. Grade C reflects "Low confidence in evidence. Evidence lacking to support reported effect", with "observational studies with significant methodological flaws and/or inconsistent findings" leading to "conclusions that cannot be drawn, and/or high risk of bias".

### Updates to male infertility: AUA / ASRM guideline (2024) [^f0d41a49]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for male infertility, more specifically with respect to management of ejaculatory dysfunction, ASRM/AUA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering sympathomimetics (with or without alkalinization and/or urethral catheterization), induced ejaculation, or surgical sperm retrieval in patients with infertility associated with retrograde ejaculation.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^351e9cf0]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Paradigm shift in the pathway for investigations and diagnosis of male factor infertility

Semen analysis, along with physical examination and history, is the cornerstone in the diagnosis of male factor infertility. Currently, the analysis needs to be performed in a laboratory. However, in the 6th edition, there is a discussion on emerging technologies (Chapter 4.6 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen), which may widen the availability of semen analysis into the community. One aspect identified was the potential use of home assays for the assessment of sperm motility. With the recent implementation of widespread telemedicine for several types of clinical office visits, it is not surprising that home assays for a variety of clinical diagnostic tests would be created. At-home testing in andrology has a long history, and several new tests that assess sperm motility and/or concentration were recently launched. A number of kits commercially available today have yet to be rigorously evaluated in large-scale trials, including comprehensive comparisons with standardized laboratory methods, so their current clinical value in diagnosis is limited. However, technology is rapidly evolving, and as the assays improve, it is very likely that men assessing their own samples (providing robust and acceptable diagnostic information) will be a reality in the next 5 years. Therefore, patients will have a pivotal role to play in their own health management as witnessed in several other arenas, for example, blood glucose levels for diabetes and retinal imaging. Once the technologies are demonstrated to be accurate and precise, there is a need to determine the role these assays play in the patient diagnostic pathway, for example, are they additional, complementary, or replacement tests, and can they be used to triage patients? The tests may be cheaper and easier to use than traveling to andrology laboratories for semen analysis. They can be used in large-population–based studies of lifestyle changes or potential environmental exposures and may help to identify infertility in men. Certainly, these at-home or mail-in test kits could be particularly important for those living in rural or underdeveloped areas lacking sufficient healthcare, and at the very least, they may provide the patient with some data on their semen parameters pointing to the need for a clinical evaluation and diagnostic semen analysis if abnormalities are present. If positive answers are forthcoming, this will significantly increase effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has indicted that we can do more at-home testing to manage our healthcare than previously recognized.

### Male sexual dysfunctions in the infertile couple-recommendations from the European society of sexual medicine (ESSM) [^6d28fd30]. Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for male infertility, more specifically with respect to management of ejaculatory dysfunction, ESSM 2021 guidelines recommend to offer penile vibratory stimulation (with a frequency of 100 Hz and an amplitude of 2.5 mm) or electroejaculation for anejaculation in patients with infertility.

### Management of female infertility from hormonal causes [^e65a14c1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Hormonal causes of female infertility involve ovulatory dysfunctions that may result from dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, peripheral endocrine glands, nonendocrine organs, or metabolic disorders. It is important to think of anovulation not as a diagnosis but as a symptom of a metabolic or endocrine disorder that requires a thorough diagnostic evaluation to identify the specific cause and to implement effective therapies that assure the best possible pregnancy outcome and avoid long-term adverse health consequences. In most instances, the medical history points to the underlying dysfunction, which can usually be confirmed with laboratory or imaging tests. For more challenging cases, more extensive evaluations may be needed, including perturbation studies. Nevertheless, the management of anovulatory infertility is gratifying because its causes are often manifest and the treatment usually results in resumption of ovulatory cycles, restoration of fertility, and healthy offspring through natural conception without requiring expensive and intrusive assisted reproductive technologies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part I [^20f87630]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Male infertility algorithm — initial evaluation and branching are outlined as follows: One year of failure to conceive if female < 35 years old or if female > 35 years old, 6 months of failure to conceive prompts parallel assessment in which male and female are evaluated in parallel including male reproductive history, with counselling re: post-vasectomy fertility options for post-vasectomy cases. If there is at least one abnormal semen analysis or abnormal male reproductive history, complete male evaluation with history and physical follows; otherwise, primary evaluation/ management of female partner proceeds. Subsequent steps include initial hormonal evaluation (FSH, T), and for azoospermia, to categorize azoospermia with FSH, exam. The algorithm lists options such as genetic testing (karyotype and Y microdeletion), genetic (CF) testing for congenital cases of obstruction, and sperm retrieval or microsurgical reconstruction, and also states to consider diagnostic and therapeutic biopsy if FSH & testicular volume normal but no clinical evidence of obstruction.

### Standardizing definitions and reporting guidelines for the infertility core outcome set: an international consensus development study [^9687bf17]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Question

Can consensus definitions for the core outcome set for infertility be identified in order to recommend a standardized approach to reporting?

Summary Answer

Consensus definitions for individual core outcomes, contextual statements, and a standardized reporting table have been developed.

What Is Known Already

Different definitions exist for individual core outcomes for infertility. This variation increases the opportunities for researchers to engage with selective outcome reporting, which undermines secondary research and compromises clinical practice guideline development.

Study Design, Size, Duration

Potential definitions were identified by a systematic review of definition development initiatives and clinical practice guidelines and by reviewing Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group guidelines. These definitions were discussed in a face-to-face consensus development meeting, which agreed consensus definitions. A standardized approach to reporting was also developed as part of the process.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Healthcare professionals, researchers, and people with fertility problems were brought together in an open and transparent process using formal consensus development methods.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

Forty-four potential definitions were inventoried across four definition development initiatives, including the Harbin Consensus Conference Workshop Group and International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies, 12 clinical practice guidelines, and Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group guidelines. Twenty-seven participants, from 11 countries, contributed to the consensus development meeting. Consensus definitions were successfully developed for all core outcomes. Specific recommendations were made to improve reporting.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

We used consensus development methods, which have inherent limitations. There was limited representation from low- and middle-income countries.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

A minimum data set should assist researchers in populating protocols, case report forms, and other data collection tools. The generic reporting table should provide clear guidance to researchers and improve the reporting of their results within journal publications and conference presentations. Research funding bodies, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement, and over 80 specialty journals have committed to implementing this core outcome set.

### Development and validation of the infertility self-efficacy scale [^a85068c3]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop and validate a scale of perceived self-efficacy for people coping with infertility treatment.

Design

Self-efficacy scale development involved: [1] item generation with medical experts in reproductive health; [2] a principal components analysis with varimax rotation to identify underlying item components; [3] test-retest reliability and construct (convergent and discriminant) validity with infertility patients, who were administered the Infertility Self-Efficacy (ISE) scale with other measures; and [4] expert acceptability, as determined by reproductive health professionals.

Setting

Recruitment at a fertility center, a national infertility organization, and medical trials web pages.

Patient(S)

A total of 213 participants (159 women; 54 men) with a diagnosis of infertility in the past 2 years were recruited for the various study phases.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Participants' infertility self-efficacy was assessed with an online assessment battery using the ISE scale; comparison mental health measures assessed current levels of fertility problem distress, perceived stress, and coping style. Reliability, validity, and component structure of the ISE was assessed.

Result(S)

Measurement development yielded a brief 16-item ISE scale that taps an infertility patient's perception about his or her ability to engage in a set of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral skills related to the medical treatment of infertility. The single component of "cognitive/affect regulation" suggests this core set of skills is relevant to successfully managing the experience of infertility. The ISE correlations with comparison mental health measures were as expected, suggesting good convergent and discriminant validity.

Conclusion(S)

The ISE scale appears to be a reliable and valid measure of an individual's self confidence in areas related to health promotion during infertility treatment. Assessing an infertility patients' self-efficacy with the ISE may be useful in clinical research and as a counseling tool to help guide patients in actively managing their fertility treatment.

### Early pregnancy loss management in the emergency department vs outpatient setting [^c7cbf892]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

EPL management remained significantly associated with location of initial EPL diagnosis when controlling for demographic characteristics, prior pregnancy care, and comorbidities (Table 2). Presenting initially to the ED (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44–0.47), urban location (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.91), and being a dependent on an insurance policy (vs primary policy holder) (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67–0.74) were associated with decreased odds of receiving active management. Factors associated with increased odds of active management of EPL included older age (aOR per 1-year increase 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01–1.01) or living outside of the West coast (eg, Northeast: aOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15–1.25). A history of infertility (aOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76–0.84) or threatened EPL earlier in the pregnancy (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.67–0.71) was associated with decreased odds of active management, whereas having established prenatal care (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.29–2.42) and the presence of medical comorbidities (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.09) were both associated with increased odds of active management.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^81be16c3]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — metformin could be used alone in women with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, with counselling that there are more effective ovulation agents; women should be counselled on potential mild gastrointestinal side-effects, healthcare and resource burden are lower with metformin, and consideration of age and screening for other fertility factors needs discussion before prescribing metformin.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^cc647e70]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Male infertility algorithm — initial evaluation begins after 'One year of failure to conceive if female < 35 years old or if female > 35 years old, 6 months of failure to conceive', followed by 'Male and female evaluated in parallel including male reproductive history'. A decision node 'At least one abnormal semen analysis or abnormal male reproductive history' directs either to 'Primary evaluation/ management of female partner' or to 'Complete male evaluation with history and physical'; subsequent steps include 'Initial hormonal evaluation (FSH, T)' and, for azoospermia, 'Categorize azoospermia with FSH, exam' leading to 'Genetic testing (karyotype and Y microdeletion)' with an 'Option for microTESE and ICSI' or to 'Genetic (CF) testing for congenital cases of obstruction' with 'Sperm retrieval or microsurgical reconstruction'. The algorithm advises 'Consider diagnostic and therapeutic biopsy if FSH & testicular volume normal but no clinical evidence of obstruction'.
