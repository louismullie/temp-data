## Question

What aspirin dose should be administered in the emergency department for chest pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what aspirin dose should be given in the emergency department for chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core guideline recommendations for aspirin loading and maintenance. Then, I should verify key clinical trial evidence comparing different aspirin doses. Next, I will check formulation and route considerations that affect onset of platelet inhibition. After that, I must reconcile special scenarios like prior aspirin use, fibrinolysis, high bleeding risk, and true allergy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation for ED implementation and confirm it aligns with the broadest consensus across sources [^113u9Tgt] [^113UnMg9] [^115iiq2g].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing. In the ED, undifferentiated chest pain is managed as possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise, so early platelet inhibition with aspirin is foundational pending ECG and troponin, while balancing bleeding risk and contraindications; this is consistent with contemporary ACS guidance and emergency medicine policies recommending immediate antiplatelet therapy when ACS is suspected [^113u9Tgt] [^111EEK9W] [^1127vgAN].

> I should verify the most authoritative guideline dosing. The 2023 ESC ACS guidelines recommend an initial oral loading dose of 150–300 mg aspirin followed by maintenance 75–100 mg daily for both STEMI and NSTE-ACS, which applies broadly to suspected ACS absent contraindications; the FDA labeling for STEMI and NSTEMI permits a 162–325 mg PO load with maintenance 81–325 mg (often 81 mg in U.S. practice), and ACCP 8th edition explicitly recommends immediate 162–325 mg PO followed by 75–100 mg daily in NSTE-ACS; taken together, a pragmatic ED loading range of 162–325 mg is on-label and guideline-concordant, with maintenance in the 75–100 mg range thereafter [^113u9Tgt] [^116BDFA4] [^115iiq2g] [^113UnMg9].

> Wait, I need to be careful not to conflate different ACCP documents. I initially thought all ACCP 8th edition content carried equal weight; hold on, the specific ACCP NSTE-ACS antithrombotic guideline carries the high-credibility dosing recommendation of immediate 162–325 mg then 75–100 mg daily, whereas the separate ACCP antiplatelet pharmacology chapter is descriptive and tagged as lower credibility here; I should rely on the former for dosing recommendations in suspected ACS and use the latter for mechanistic context only [^113UnMg9] [^1114gdge].

> Next, I will examine comparative dose-outcome data. Large ACS datasets show no mortality advantage of an initial 325 mg versus 162 mg aspirin dose in fibrinolytic-treated STEMI after adjustment, and randomized comparisons of higher- versus lower-dose aspirin for maintenance in ACS (OASIS-7) showed no difference in 30-day cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke but a signal toward more gastrointestinal bleeding with higher maintenance dosing; observational PCI-era data similarly link higher maintenance doses to more bleeding without ischemic benefit, supporting the use of lower maintenance doses after the acute load [^114KG7L4] [^116YXYgo] [^111V9634].

> But wait, what about speed of platelet inhibition in the ED, which can influence early outcomes. I need to check formulation effects. Chewable, non–enteric-coated aspirin achieves faster platelet inhibition than solid or enteric-coated tablets, with soluble forms also outperforming solid tablets; therefore, in the ED when rapid effect is desired, a chewable, non–enteric-coated load is preferred if the patient can safely take oral medication [^115eKKet].

> I should also confirm the importance of prompt administration. Time-to-aspirin matters; although dosing ranges overlap, earlier administration closer to symptom onset is associated with more benefit, and population modeling of 325 mg within several hours of chest pain suggests substantial lives saved at low cost, underscoring the principle that immediate ED dosing upon suspicion of ACS is appropriate when not contraindicated; this complements guideline directives for rapid initial therapy even as definitive diagnosis is ongoing [^117EuFXL] [^113u9Tgt].

> Now, let me synthesize a practical ED loading recommendation. Given the convergence of ESC, ACCP, and FDA sources and the neutral comparative efficacy between 162 and 325 mg on hard endpoints, a single 162–325 mg oral loading dose is appropriate; in many U.S. EDs, 325 mg chewable is operationally simple and rapidly acting, while selecting 162 mg may be reasonable in patients with higher bleeding risk without compromising antithrombotic efficacy in the acute phase; either approach should be immediately followed by low-dose maintenance beginning the next day or later the same day if the load was early [^113u9Tgt] [^113UnMg9] [^115iiq2g].

> I should confirm the maintenance strategy after the initial load. The consistent target across guidelines is low-dose aspirin, 75–100 mg daily (commonly 81 mg in the U.S.), balancing ischemic protection with bleeding risk, and this is supported by both trial data and labeling; maintenance above 100 mg generally does not improve ischemic outcomes and increases bleeding, so 81 mg daily is a reasonable default unless specific clinical circumstances dictate otherwise [^113u9Tgt] [^115iiq2g] [^116YXYgo].

> Hold on, I should review special scenarios. For patients already on chronic aspirin, platelet hyperfunction can persist during acute MI; an additional loading dose has been shown to further suppress thromboxane and increase closure time, so administering a load in the ED remains appropriate if no contraindications exist; in fibrinolytic-treated STEMI, initial outcomes did not differ between 162 mg and 325 mg loads, so fibrinolysis alone does not mandate a higher aspirin dose; in patients at elevated bleeding risk, leaning toward the lower end of the loading range and ensuring low-dose maintenance is prudent given observed increases in bleeding with higher doses without incremental ischemic benefit [^113E383U] [^114KG7L4] [^111V9634].

> I need to ensure I address true hypersensitivity and GI risk. Documented aspirin allergy warrants desensitization pathways or alternative antiplatelet strategies rather than dose escalation, and concomitant GI bleeding risk should be mitigated when possible; these considerations do not change the acute dosing range but may influence whether aspirin is given at all and the need for gastroprotection in appropriate patients [^112pmciP] [^111Xd7gW].

> Finally, let me state the ED-ready recommendation and double-check it against the consensus. For suspected ACS with chest pain and no contraindication, give aspirin immediately as 162–325 mg PO, preferably chewable and non–enteric-coated for faster absorption, then continue 75–100 mg daily thereafter; if bleeding risk is high, consider loading at 162 mg and maintain at 75–100 mg daily; this aligns with ESC 2023, ACCP 8th edition for NSTE-ACS, and FDA labeling, while leveraging formulation data for rapid effect and trial evidence showing no ischemic advantage to higher dosing but more bleeding with higher maintenance [^113u9Tgt] [^113UnMg9] [^115iiq2g] [^115eKKet] [^116YXYgo].

---

The recommended aspirin dosage in the emergency room for chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome is a **loading dose of 150–325 mg** given immediately [^112GXxZp], preferably as chewable or non–enteric-coated tablets to ensure rapid absorption and platelet inhibition [^115eKKet]. If the patient has already taken aspirin before arrival, administer an additional dose to reach the total loading dose [^113E383U]. After the loading dose, continue with a **maintenance dose of 75–100 mg daily** [^113u9Tgt] [^112GXxZp] [^115iiq2g]. Aspirin should be withheld only in cases of true allergy, active major bleeding, or severe thrombocytopenia [^112pmciP] [^113UnMg9].

---

## Recommended aspirin dosage in the emergency room

### Loading dose

- **Recommended loading dose**: 150–325 mg orally, administered immediately upon presentation [^112GXxZp].

- **Preferred formulation**: Chewable or non–enteric-coated tablets to ensure rapid absorption and platelet inhibition [^113u9Tgt] [^115eKKet].

- **If already taken**: If the patient has already taken aspirin prior to arrival, administer an additional dose to reach the total loading dose of 150–325 mg [^113E383U].

---

### Maintenance dose

Administer a **maintenance dose of 75–100 mg** orally once daily [^1149a9Fn], starting immediately after the loading dose [^113u9Tgt] [^112GXxZp].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting aspirin use in acute coronary syndromes

Aspirin's benefit in ACS derives from **rapid, irreversible COX-1 inhibition** and consequent thromboxane A2 suppression, which reduces platelet aggregation and thrombosis [^1114gdge].

- **ISIS-2 trial**: Early aspirin reduced 28-day vascular mortality by ~23% in suspected AMI [^116Au9eT] [^1127vgAN].

- **CURRENT-OASIS 7**: No difference in 30-day cardiovascular death/MI/stroke between high-dose (300–325 mg) and low-dose (75–100 mg) aspirin; higher GI bleeding with high-dose [^116YXYgo] [^115iCqaP].

- **ESC 2023 guidelines**: Recommend a 150–300 mg loading dose and 75–100 mg daily maintenance for STEMI and NSTEMI [^113u9Tgt] [^112GXxZp].

---

## Timing of aspirin administration

Early administration is **critical**; giving aspirin as soon as possible — ideally within 4 hours of symptom onset — significantly reduces mortality and morbidity [^117EuFXL]. Prehospital administration is strongly recommended when feasible to maximize benefit.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Aspirin should be **withheld or used cautiously** in specific clinical scenarios:

| **Contraindications** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|
| - True allergy (e.g. anaphylaxis, severe bronchospasm) [^112pmciP] | - Active gastrointestinal bleeding [^113UnMg9] |
| - Severe thrombocytopenia [^113UnMg9] | - Recent major surgery [^113UnMg9] |
| - Active major bleeding [^113UnMg9] | - Known bleeding disorders [^113UnMg9] |
| - Severe hepatic impairment | - Concurrent anticoagulant therapy (monitor closely) [^112rMvKi] |

## Risks and benefits of aspirin administration

### Benefits

Aspirin **reduces mortality and morbidity** in acute coronary syndromes, decreasing the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke [^1127vgAN]. It is widely available, inexpensive, and cost-effective [^117EuFXL].

---

### Risks

- **Bleeding**: Increased risk of gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding, especially in high-risk patients [^116YXYgo] [^111V9634].

- **Allergy**: Rare hypersensitivity reactions [^112pmciP].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Dyspepsia and gastritis.

---

## Special considerations

### Patients already on chronic aspirin therapy

Patients already taking aspirin should receive an **additional loading dose** on presentation to ensure immediate, adequate platelet inhibition [^113E383U].

---

### Patients with aspirin resistance

If aspirin resistance is suspected, consider **alternative or additional antiplatelet therapy**, such as P2Y12 inhibitors, to address inadequate platelet inhibition [^1127vgAN] [^11543dBE].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended aspirin dose** | **Formulation** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial presentation of chest pain suggestive of ACS | 150–325 mg | Chewable or non–enteric-coated | Immediately upon presentation [^113u9Tgt] |
| Maintenance therapy after loading dose | 75–100 mg daily | Oral tablet | Daily thereafter [^112GXxZp] [^1149a9Fn] |
| Patient already on chronic aspirin therapy | Additional loading dose to total 150–325 mg | Chewable or non–enteric-coated | Immediately upon presentation [^113E383U] |

---

The recommended aspirin dosage in the emergency room for chest pain suggestive of ACS is a **loading dose of 150–325 mg** given immediately, preferably as chewable or non–enteric-coated tablets. After the loading dose, continue with a **maintenance dose of 75–100 mg daily** [^1149a9Fn].

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. BET 1: Which form of aspirin is the fastest to inhibit platelet aggregation in emergency department patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115eKKet]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

A short cut review was conducted to determine which form of aspirin has the most rapid onset of action in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes presenting to the emergency department. Papers comparing the speed of onset of chewable, soluble, and solid aspirin were included. This summary presents all three parts of a combined best evidence topic report (BET). The clinical conclusion is that chewable aspirin may act faster than soluble aspirin in reducing the time to achieve platelet inhibition. Soluble aspirin works faster than whole solid aspirin, which in turn is faster than enteric-coated aspirin.

### Prehospital antiplatelet therapy in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest suspected of acute coronary syndrome [^113VKAXM]. Resuscitation (2025). Low credibility.

There are currently no specific guidelines for prehospital antiplatelet therapy in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a prehospital antiplatelet loading dose in patients with OHCA suspected of ACS referred to a cardiac catheterization laboratory (cath lab).

- **Methodology**: We included consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography within 24 hours after OHCA from 2012 to 2024. Prehospital antiplatelet treatment was defined as prescribing aspirin alone and/or a P2Y12 inhibitor before admission to the cath lab. Outcomes included all-cause death at 30 days, in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) — defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or stroke — and in-hospital major bleeding (BARC ≥ 3). An inverse probability weighting approach was used to compare outcomes between the two groups.

- **Results**: Of the 411 patients admitted to the cath lab within 24 hours after OHCA, 217 (52.8%) received prehospital antiplatelet therapy, either aspirin alone (44.5%) or aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (8.3%). There was no difference in 30-day all-cause death between patients who received prehospital treatment and those who did not (56.7% [50.0%; 63.1%] vs. 59.8% [52.8%; 66.4%], p = 0.280). Rates of in-hospital MACE and major bleeding were not significantly different between the two strategies. Results appear to be consistent in subgroups of patients with ST-segment elevation or successfully resuscitated patients.

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138MnKD]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Single or dual antiplatelet therapy was in this analysis based on treatment at randomization, but antiplatelet therapy was persistent throughout most of the observation periods for these studies, including the phase III studies. Another limitation is the lack of separately evaluable results for the small proportions of patients on single antiplatelet treatment, i.e. 2%, 5%, and 7%, in REDEEM, RUBY-1, and ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 studies, respectively.

In patients with a recent ACS, the addition of a new oral anticoagulant to antiplatelet therapy leads to a modest reduction in cardiovascular events but a substantial increase in bleeding. These results are most pronounced when oral anticoagulants are combined with dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. No new oral anticoagulant has been evaluated in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and any of the more efficacious novel P2Y12 inhibitors ticagrelor or prasugrel, a combination which might expose the patients to even larger risks of major bleeding with even lower expectations for further reductions in ischemic events. Further studies evaluating new oral anticoagulants in combination with effective single antiplatelet therapy or shorter duration of triple antithrombotic therapy are warranted.

- Aspirin > 500 mg/kg more than 1 hour ago (as an alternative to gastric lavage)

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rMvKi]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of the patients and events in this meta-analysis were accrued from the two Phase III trials. The bleeding results in these two large trials were consistent with the Phase II experiences. The bleeding outcomes were also very similar between the two Phase III trials, albeit with a numerically larger relative increase in bleeding in the concluded ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 trial than the prematurely terminated APPRAISE-2 trial. A modest reduction in MACEs was also seen in both these Phase III trials, significant only in the ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 trial but not in the APPRAISE-2 trial, although the premature termination and shorter duration of treatment in the latter trial may have limited the statistical power to detect associations with both bleeding and MACE outcomes. As both rivaroxaban and apixaban are factor Xa inhibitors, it is likely that the meta-analysis result is the most plausible outcome when taking these treatments into real-life healthcare.

This information might be useful when considering patients with a combination of atrial fibrillation and ACS, where a combination of anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet treatment is currently recommended for at least 1–6 months. Notably, the rivaroxaban doses, 2.5 or 5 mg twice daily, used in the ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 trial in combination with ASA and clopidogrel were lower than the 20 mg once-daily dose shown to be efficacious for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, a setting where most patients are not receiving antiplatelet therapy.

### Platelet hyperfunction is decreased by additional aspirin loading in patients presenting with myocardial infarction on daily aspirin therapy [^113E383U]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Currently, 162–325 mg of aspirin is recommended for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. We tested the effect of an additional loading dose of 250 mg aspirin at the onset of acute coronary syndrome in patients who were already on chronic therapy with 100 mg aspirin.

- **Design**: This was a prospective trial in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome that included a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial subgroup.

- **Setting**: An emergency department in a tertiary care center.

- **Patients**: Consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome were enrolled, including a cohort already on chronic aspirin therapy.

- **Interventions**: Patients received an intravenous infusion of 250 mg aspirin.

- **Measurements and main results**: Platelet function was measured with a platelet function analyzer in 234 patients before and after aspirin infusion. Aspirin infusion prolonged collagen epinephrine closure times in almost all patients. Aspirin infusion further lowered thromboxane B(2) levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were on chronic aspirin therapy before admission. Concomitantly, collagen epinephrine closure times increased by 22% from 223 seconds (95% confidence interval, 192–255 seconds) before to 273 seconds (95% confidence interval, 252–294 seconds) after aspirin infusion (p < .01). Eleven patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction on daily aspirin therapy (53%) displayed platelet hyperfunction (collagen epinephrine closure times < 193 seconds). Additional aspirin infusion further decreased platelet function.

### Novel antiplatelet agents in acute coronary syndrome [^11543dBE]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

For more than 10 years, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has remained the cornerstone of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The novel oral P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12)-receptor inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor, were approved by the FDA for clinical use in 2009 and 2011, respectively. These agents have a faster-acting, more potent, and more predictable antiplatelet effect than clopidogrel, which translates into improved clinical outcomes in patients with ACS, albeit at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding.

However, some patients continue to experience adverse ischaemic events despite treatment with aspirin and a P2Y12-receptor antagonist, because platelets can remain activated via pathways not inhibited by these agents, such as the protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 platelet activation pathway stimulated by thrombin. Emerging antiplatelet therapies that might address these limitations include intravenous P2Y12 antagonists, oral PAR-1 antagonists, and thromboxane-receptor inhibitors.

In this review, we provide an overview of these novel antiplatelet drugs, including newly approved agents and emerging compounds currently under clinical development, and also discuss evolving concepts and unmet needs related to antiplatelet therapy for the treatment of ACS.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^114vZKHh]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically in relation to anticoagulant therapy with revascularization, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering aspirin plus clopidogrel for more than one week and up to one month. This recommendation applies to patients treated with oral anticoagulation who have a high ischemic risk or other anatomical/procedural characteristics that are judged to outweigh the bleeding risk.

### Dose comparisons of clopidogrel and aspirin in acute coronary syndromes [^116YXYgo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Clopidogrel and aspirin are widely used for patients with acute coronary syndromes and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, evidence-based guidelines for dosing have not been established for either agent.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned, in a 2-by-2 factorial design, 25,086 patients with an acute coronary syndrome who were referred for an invasive strategy to either double-dose clopidogrel (a 600-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 150 mg daily for 6 days and 75 mg daily thereafter) or standard-dose clopidogrel (a 300-mg loading dose and 75 mg daily thereafter) and either higher-dose aspirin (300 to 325 mg daily) or lower-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg daily). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 30 days.

- **Results**: The primary outcome occurred in 4.2% of patients assigned to double-dose clopidogrel compared with 4.4% assigned to standard-dose clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.06; P = 0.30). Major bleeding occurred in 2.5% of patients in the double-dose group and in 2.0% in the standard-dose group (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.46; P = 0.01). Double-dose clopidogrel was associated with a significant reduction in the secondary outcome of stent thrombosis among the 17,263 patients who underwent PCI (1.6% vs. 2.3%; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P = 0.001). There was no significant difference between higher-dose and lower-dose aspirin with respect to the primary outcome (4.2% vs. 4.4%; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.09; P = 0.61).

This article about currently available antiplatelet drugs is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of aspirin, reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitors, thienopyridines, and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 receptor antagonists. The relationships among dose, efficacy, and safety are thoroughly discussed, with a mechanistic overview of randomized clinical trials. The article does not provide specific management recommendations; however, it does highlight important practical aspects related to antiplatelet therapy, including the optimal dose of aspirin, the variable balance of benefits and hazards in different clinical settings, and the issue of interindividual variability in response to antiplatelet drugs.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: What it means for clinical practice [^116b9UiC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), including unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012. They now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and update the terminology related to the noninvasive management to an ischemia-guided strategy.

The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy — the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them.

Where appropriate, similarities and differences between the recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS, and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned. In contrast, the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: A population-based analysis [^117EuFXL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin, an effective, low-cost pharmaceutical, can significantly reduce mortality if used promptly after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, many AMI survivors do not receive aspirin within a few hours of symptom onset. Our aim was to quantify the mortality benefit of self-administering aspirin at chest pain onset, considering the increased risk of bleeding and costs associated with widespread use.

- **Methods and results**: We developed a population simulation model to determine the impact of self-administering 325 mg aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset. We created a synthetic cohort of adults aged 40 years and older experiencing severe chest pain using 2019 US population estimates, AMI incidence, and the sensitivity/specificity of chest pain for AMI. The number of annual deaths delayed was estimated using evidence from a large, randomized trial. We also estimated the years of life saved (YOLS), costs, and cost per YOLS. Initiating aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset delayed 13,016 (95% CI, 11,643–14,574) deaths annually, after accounting for deaths due to bleeding (963; 926–1003). This translated to an estimated 166,309 YOLS (149,391–185,505) at the cost of $643,235 (633,944–653,010) per year, leading to a cost-effectiveness ratio of $3.70 (3.32–4.12) per YOLS.

- **Conclusions**: For less than $4 per YOLS, the self-administration of aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset has the potential to save 13,000 lives per year in the US population. Benefits of reducing deaths post-AMI outweighed the risk of bleeding deaths from aspirin ten times over.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to postprocedural antithrombotic therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin (75–100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) daily for up to 6 months. This is recommended as the default antithrombotic strategy after PCI-stenting in patients with chronic coronary syndrome who have no indication for oral anticoagulation.

### Pre-hospital aspirin for suspected myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes: a headache for paramedics [^115So7vv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

To ascertain the frequency with which paramedics follow protocols for the administration of aspirin to patients to whom an ambulance is called for chest pain associated with suspected ischaemic heart disease, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Ambulance services in England as well as Wales that had conducted a recent aspirin administration audit were identified through the National Clinical Effectiveness Programme for the Ambulance Service Association. Data were requested from each of these services with a 100% return rate.

- **Results**: Nine services out of a total of 35 had collected appropriate data. The proportion of patients who were given aspirin by a paramedic varied from 11% to 74%. The range of proportions of patients receiving pre-hospital aspirin increased after adding those patients who had already received aspirin from an alternative health provider to 19% to 78%. It is estimated that at least 15% to 74% of patients who should have been given aspirin by the various ambulance services did not receive it. The proportion of patients for whom aspirin was judged to be inappropriate ranged from 4% to 35%. The reason for these widely varying and generally poor levels of compliance is not known. However, the range of indications and contraindications to the administration of aspirin varied considerably by ambulance service, making the comparison of data from different sources difficult.

- **Conclusions**: Aspirin has been shown to be beneficial following a myocardial infarction and for other acute coronary syndromes. However, variances in the proportion of patients with suspected ischaemic heart disease who receive it highlight the need for standardized protocols.

### Antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome (ACS): applying new science to clinical decisions [^113eq1f5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The platelet is central to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and antiplatelet therapy has demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk for ischemic events in patients with ACS. For patients with unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions, regardless of whether a conservative or invasive (i.e. percutaneous intervention) treatment approach is used, guidelines recommend combination antiplatelet therapies. These combinations include aspirin with the thienopyridines clopidogrel or prasugrel and/or a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

However, there remains a significant incidence of arterial thrombosis in patients receiving currently available antiplatelet therapy, indicating the need for improved and/or alternative agents and targets. Recent landmark clinical trials of new oral antiplatelet therapies, including the thienopyridine prasugrel and the investigational reversible oral adenosine diphosphate antagonist ticagrelor, indicate they have a faster onset of action, result in a more predictable response, and provide improved efficacy compared to clopidogrel, the standard of care.

- **Potential targets under investigation**: These include von Willebrand factor, thromboxane A(2), and protease-activated receptor-1. Of these, the protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist vorapaxar (SCH 530348) is furthest along in clinical development, with phase II data showing profound inhibition of platelet aggregation and a large phase III development program underway.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have updated their guidelines for the management of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome for the first time since 2002. In the interim, several important studies affecting choices of therapy, potentially begun in the emergency department, have been completed, and care patterns have changed and matured significantly. In this review, we present the new recommendations that are pertinent to emergency medicine practice and comment on their potential implementation into an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation and management of this challenging patient population.

### Low-dose anticoagulation for secondary prevention in acute coronary syndrome [^1168AsLa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

After acute coronary syndrome (ACS), long-term dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y(12) platelet receptor antagonist is the standard of care for secondary prevention. Despite the introduction of more potent P2Y(12) receptor antagonists, the risk of a revascular event within 12 months remains at approximately 10%, indicating a need for improved secondary prevention strategies.

A recent phase III trial found that the addition of a third antiplatelet agent, vorapaxar, in patients with atherosclerosis might benefit those who have previously experienced a myocardial infarction. However, a trial in patients with ACS found this strategy led to increased bleeding without significant efficacy improvement. Previously, data from patients with ACS given vitamin K antagonists in addition to acetylsalicylic acid demonstrated significant reductions in vascular events, but this was associated with an unacceptable bleeding risk.

As expected, phase II trials of newer oral anticoagulants in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy also found an increased bleeding risk, with only the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, continuing to phase III. The phase III trial of full-dose apixaban was stopped early for safety concerns because the major bleeding rates were significantly increased, with minimal improvement in efficacy. However, the phase III trial of low-dose rivaroxaban demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of revascular events without an increased risk of fatal bleeding. In conclusion, these trials underline the potential importance of finding the optimal balance in anticoagulation therapy for secondary prevention in ACS.

### 2000 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a practical summary for emergency physicians [^117Xroes]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

There have been numerous significant clinical advances in both the diagnosis and therapy of acute coronary syndrome during the past several years. Even the term "acute coronary syndrome" is a recent creation meant to expand clinical attention in patients with chest pain of coronary origin beyond identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy. It also includes the evaluation and management of those patients with unstable angina (UA) or myocardial injury that does not cause ST-segment elevation. Many of these advances have been studied and first implemented outside the emergency department, leading some emergency physicians to be slow to embrace them and leaving others without a viable practical option to use them outside of the cardiac catheterization laboratory or the coronary care unit.

In September 2000, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued practice guidelines for the care of patients with UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The guidelines specifically address the diagnosis and management of UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the emergency department, suggesting evidence-based standards for risk stratification. They recommend the use of biologic markers of myocardial damage and other adjunctive diagnostic tests, and the appropriate use of antiplatelet and antithrombin therapeutic agents. This article provides an overview of the emergency department-pertinent analyses and recommendations from the 93-page document.

### Diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome: an evidence-based update [^112DEibv]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes the range of myocardial ischemic states that include unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (MI), or ST-elevated MI. ACS is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and places a large financial burden on the health care system. The diagnosis of ACS begins with a thorough clinical assessment of a patient's presenting symptoms, electrocardiogram, and cardiac troponin levels, as well as a review of past medical history.

Early risk stratification can assist clinicians in determining whether an early invasive management strategy or an initial conservative strategy should be pursued, and can help determine appropriate pharmacologic therapies. Key components in the management of ACS include coronary revascularization when indicated; prompt initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and consideration of adjuvant agents including β blockers, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, and HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. It is essential for clinicians to take an individualized approach to treatment and consider long-term safety and efficacy when managing patients with a history of ACS after hospital discharge.

### Refining the role of antiplatelet therapy in medically managed patients with acute coronary syndrome [^116gAKsD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower-risk patients, high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations, and those at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age and frailty.

For such patients, there remains an unmet need to evaluate alternatives to currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed patients with ACS. Thus, this group of patients would benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for those not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those targeted for pharmacologic management only.

In conclusion, the investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy for patients with ACS. They examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed patients with ACS, that could potentially benefit from more potent platelet inhibition after ACS.

### Oral antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndrome: A review [^1127vgAN]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with an annual incidence of approximately 1 million. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), which consists of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel), reduces cardiovascular event rates after ACS.

In 2016, the updated guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommended aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months for patients with ACS. Since these recommendations were published, new randomized clinical trials have studied different regimens and durations of antiplatelet therapy. Recommendations vary according to the risk of bleeding. If bleeding risk is low, prolonged DAPT may be considered, although the optimal duration of prolonged DAPT beyond 1 year is not well established. If bleeding risk is high, a shorter duration of DAPT (i.e. 3–6 months) may be reasonable.

A high risk of bleeding traditionally is defined as a 1-year risk of serious bleeding (either fatal or associated with a ≥ 3-g/dL drop in hemoglobin) of at least 4% or a risk of intracranial hemorrhage of at least 1%. Patients at higher risk are those who are 65 years old or older, have low body weight (BMI < 18.5), diabetes, or prior bleeding, or are taking oral anticoagulants. The newest P2Y12 inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor, are more potent, with high on-treatment residual platelet reactivity of about 3% versus 30% to 40% with clopidogrel and act within 30 minutes compared with 2 hours for clopidogrel.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: A population-based analysis [^112Axg9n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We estimated significant population-level benefits to self-administering aspirin within 4 hours of onset of severe chest pain, resulting in over 10,000 net annual deaths delayed in adults aged 40 years and older in the United States in 2019. Bleeding deaths due to aspirin use were small and did not outweigh the substantial benefits of deaths delayed post-AMI. The use of aspirin was cost-effective overall and within age-sex groups, with an average estimated cost per YOLS under $4 US dollars. The costs are orders of magnitude lower than the thresholds of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year used in many cost-effectiveness analyses.

Several studies have recommended the need for more research quantifying the effect of aspirin self-administration given the potential for significant population-level benefits. Low self-administration (8%–24%) has been reported in a few studies examining prehospital aspirin use among patients with AMI admitted to the hospital with suspected cardiac chest pain. A randomized trial was conducted in the late 1990s aimed at increasing the use of emergency medical services and aspirin among adults over the age of 65 experiencing symptoms of AMI. The intervention involved a door-to-door campaign by firefighters who provided a Heart Attack Survival kit that included educational resources and a packet of high-dose, 325 mg aspirin. The intervention was moderately successful, increasing health care–seeking behavior, including 911 calls, as well as reports of aspirin use during chest pain. Longer-term health impacts were not evaluated, similar to other research.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, the ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining repeat measurements in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This applies when the initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or conventional cardiac troponin result is nondiagnostic. The guidelines specify that repeat measurements should be taken at 1–2 hours for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and 3–6 hours for conventional cardiac troponin after the initial sample collection.

### Initial aspirin dose and outcome among ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy [^114KG7L4]. Circulation (2008). High credibility.

Although treatment with immediate aspirin reduces morbidity and mortality in ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the optimal dose remains unclear. Therefore, we compared the acute mortality and bleeding risks associated with the initial use of 162 mg versus 325 mg aspirin in fibrinolytic-treated ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients.

- **Methods and results**: Using combined data from the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO I) and Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO III) trials (n = 48,422 ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients), we compared the association between initial aspirin doses of 162 mg versus 325 mg and 24-hour and 7-day mortality, as well as rates of in-hospital moderate/severe bleeding. Results were adjusted for previously identified mortality and bleeding risk factors. Overall, 24.4% of patients (n = 11,828) received an initial aspirin dose of 325 mg, and 75.6% (n = 36,594) received 162 mg. The 24-hour mortality rates were 2.9% versus 2.8% (P = 0.894) for those receiving an initial aspirin dose of 325 mg versus 162 mg. Mortality rates at 7 and 30 days were 5.2% versus 4.9% (P = 0.118) and 7.1% versus 6.5% (P = 0.017) among patients receiving 325 mg versus 162 mg aspirin. After adjustment, aspirin dose was not associated with 24-hour (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25), 7-day (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.17), or 30-day (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.12) mortality rates. No significant difference was noted for myocardial infarction or the composite of death or myocardial infarction.

### Low-risk patients with chest pain and without evidence of myocardial infarction may be safely discharged from emergency department [^112bQLKN]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

This study is an audit of the risk stratification of patients admitted to a university hospital emergency department with a suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The main aim of the study was to investigate the prognosis of those patients who were discharged to home from the emergency room (ER) or adjacent chest pain observation unit (CPU).

- **Methods and results**: Three thousand one hundred and seven consecutive patients admitted to the ER with a suspected ACS were retrospectively identified. Seven hundred and sixty-four (25%) patients were discharged from the ER, and 417 (13%) from the CPU after observation and ruling out myocardial infarction (MI) and high-risk ACS. One thousand seven hundred and two patients were hospitalized. Follow-up end-points were cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for ACS, and incidence of any cardiovascular disease event during six months. During four weeks after discharge from the ER and CPU, cardiovascular mortality was 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively, and during six months, 0.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Within six months, 4.2% and 8.4% of the patients were hospitalized for ACS, and 9.3% and 11.5% had a cardiovascular disease event.

- **Conclusions**: Patients admitted with chest pain may be safely discharged from the emergency department if there is no evidence of MI or high-risk ACS. However, further examination and appropriate treatment must be arranged.

### Low adherence to national guidelines for proton-pump inhibitor prescription in patients receiving combination aspirin and anticoagulation [^111Xd7gW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence has long supported the use of low-dose aspirin, defined as 75–325 mg, in both primary and secondary treatment of cardiovascular disease. At low doses, aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 and inhibits platelet aggregation. This mechanism produces beneficial antithrombotic effects that help prevent acute cardiovascular events. Despite its clear role in cardiovascular disease prevention, aspirin has been shown to double the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and the risk of GIB persists in people who take aspirin for more than 1 year. Aspirin is thought to promote gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal injury by blocking the COX-1 pathway, depleting necessary prostaglandins that protect GI mucosa.

Patients who require aspirin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease may also require anticoagulation such as warfarin, unfractionated heparin, or low molecular weight heparin for acute coronary syndrome, valvular, arrhythmic, or vascular indications. When anticoagulation therapy is used in combination with aspirin, the risk of clinically significant GIB increases further. Therefore, a trade-off must be made between the benefits of cardiovascular disease prevention and the increased risk of GIB. Collaborative guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) Task Force, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and the American Heart Association (AHA) have focused on combining the goals of the cardiologist and gastroenterologist.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: A population-based analysis [^113KDhDQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin, an effective, low-cost pharmaceutical, can significantly reduce mortality if used promptly after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, many AMI survivors do not receive aspirin within a few hours of symptom onset. Our aim was to quantify the mortality benefit of self-administering aspirin at chest pain onset, considering the increased risk of bleeding and costs associated with widespread use.

- **Methods and results**: We developed a population simulation model to determine the impact of self-administering 325 mg aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset. We created a synthetic cohort of adults aged 40 years and older experiencing severe chest pain using 2019 US population estimates, AMI incidence, and sensitivity/specificity of chest pain for AMI. The number of annual deaths delayed was estimated using evidence from a large, randomized trial. We also estimated the years of life saved (YOLS), costs, and cost per YOLS. Initiating aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset delayed 13,016 (95% CI, 11,643–14,574) deaths annually, after accounting for deaths due to bleeding (963; 926–1,003). This translated to an estimated 166,309 YOLS (149,391–185,505) at the cost of $643,235 (633,944–653,010) per year, leading to a cost-effectiveness ratio of $3.70 (3.32–4.12) per YOLS.

- **Conclusions**: For less than $4 per YOLS, self-administration of aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset has the potential to save 13,000 lives per year in the US population. Benefits of reducing deaths post-AMI outweighed the risk of bleeding deaths from aspirin 10 times over.

### Clinical policy: Critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^111EEK9W]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). High credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians addresses key issues in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions:

1. In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events?

2. In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events?

3. In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (e.g. provocative stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events?

4. Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events?

Evidence was graded, and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents in acute coronary syndromes: What is the current status and what does the future hold [^115oxztc]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality and morbidity in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), caused principally by plaque erosion or rupture leading to thrombus formation and myocardial ischemia, have been reduced by a combination of antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants) and early revascularization. Aspirin is the foundational antiplatelet agent. New P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, show clear benefits compared with clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy. Additionally, agents like cangrelor or vorapaxar, a thrombin receptor inhibitor, may be valuable in specific settings.

Anticoagulation involves choosing from four options: bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux. Furthermore, some patients, such as those with chronic atrial fibrillation, require triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, plus an anticoagulant, often a vitamin K antagonist. New oral anticoagulants have demonstrated at least equivalent efficacy to vitamin K antagonists in atrial fibrillation while resulting in fewer bleeding complications.

The combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and low-dose rivaroxaban has been recently approved by the European Medicines Agency, though not by the Food and Drug Administration, for secondary prevention after ACS. Several strategies have been developed to balance the potential benefits of antithrombotic therapy against the risk of bleeding complications. These strategies include radial access in coronary angiography and restricted use of combination therapy. Other strategies, such as the discontinuation of aspirin, are under investigation.

This overview summarizes the status of antithrombotic therapy in acute coronary syndromes and explores future directions in the field.

### Platelet aspirin resistance in ED patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^116QQJjR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Platelet aspirin resistance is reported to be as high as 45%. However, the prevalence of emergency department (ED) platelet aspirin resistance in suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been previously described. Our purpose was to determine this prevalence.

- **Methods**: We assessed platelet aspirin resistance in a convenience sample of ED patients suspected of having ACS. Eligible patients experienced chest pain or an ischemic equivalent lasting longer than 10 minutes. Blood was assessed for platelet function two hours after receiving 325 mg of aspirin (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA). Definitions included aspirin resistance as at least 550 aspirin reaction units; positive troponin T as greater than 0.1 ng/mL; and significant coronary lesion as at least 70% stenosis. The composite endpoint was prospectively defined as a 30-day revisit, positive cardiac catheterization, or hospital length of stay (LOS) longer than 3 days.

- **Results**: Of the 200 patients, 50.5% were male and 50.0% were black. Troponin T was positive in 7.5%, cardiac catheterization was performed in 10.5%, and 33.3% had significant stenosis. Final diagnoses were non-cardiac in 83.4%, stable angina in 8.0%, and unstable angina in 8.5%. Overall, 6.5% were resistant to aspirin. High-risk patients tended to more aspirin resistance than non-high-risk patients (23.1% vs. 9.1%; 95% confidence interval, -0.0929 to 0.373). One-month follow-up found ED revisits in 12.5% of aspirin-resistant patients versus 4.9% of non-aspirin-resistant patients (95% CI, -0.114 to 0.182). Rehospitalization occurred in 12.5% of aspirin-resistant patients.

### Variability of antithrombotic dosing among veterans presenting with acute coronary syndrome [^115JcJZt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a significant cause of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for over 600,000 hospitalizations a year. Antithrombotic therapy is part of the standard of care for the treatment of patients presenting with ACS. As outlined in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) ST-elevated myocardial infarction/non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) clinical practice guidelines and performance measures, there are specific dosing recommendations for anticoagulants in the ACS setting. Previous studies have shown that as much as 32.8% of patients receive excess dosing of antithrombotic therapy among ACS patients.

- **Potential benefits of an electronic health record (EHR)**: Improved quality of care, reduced medical errors, increased efficiency through improved accessibility, and reduced cost. EHRs can reduce medication errors and improve the efficiency of the medication ordering process through the implementation of computerized physician order entry (CPOE). An earlier systematic review demonstrated decreases in medication errors after implementation of CPOE. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is an integrated health care delivery system with an EHR and CPOE. However, the impact of such tools on antithrombotic dosing among patients presenting with ACS is unknown.

Accordingly, we conducted a mixed-methods study to evaluate the dosing of antithrombotic therapy across VHA hospitals for ACS patients and determine whether specific processes of care at hospitals are associated with…

### Prior aspirin use and outcomes in acute coronary syndromes [^117HtyG7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients taking aspirin before an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at higher risk of recurrent events or mortality. Controversy exists regarding whether prior aspirin use is an independent predictor of worse outcomes in patients who experience an ACS.

We evaluated 66,443 ACS patients from a merged database of previous Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trials. We assessed the differences in ACS type, total mortality, and the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI), re-ischemia, or stroke between prior aspirin and nonprior aspirin users. Multivariate analysis was used to control for differences in baseline characteristics.

Prior aspirin users (n = 17,839) were older (63 years vs. 59 years) and had more coronary risk factors and evidence of coronary artery disease (MI, angina, prior intervention) than nonprior aspirin users (n = 48,604). Differences were particularly significant for non-ST-segment elevation MI compared to ST-segment elevation MI, with prior aspirin users showing higher instances (p < 0.0001). After multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in total mortality between prior aspirin users and nonaspirin users at day 30 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90 to 1.13) or by the last follow-up visit (mean 328 days) (hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.11). Prior aspirin use was modestly associated with recurrent MI (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.43) and the composite endpoint.

### Double-dose versus standard-dose clopidogrel according to smoking status among patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^113Y6qns]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The patients were randomized by a 24-hour central automated voice response system using permuted block randomization stratified by center. A statistician set up a computer-generated random allocation sequence for the data safety and monitoring board. For the clopidogrel dose allocation, patients, those performing interventions, those evaluating events, and those analyzing the data were masked to group assignment. The aspirin dose allocation was open label, with blinded adjudication of outcomes.

After randomization and before cardiac catheterization, patients assigned to double-dose clopidogrel received a 600 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 150 mg once daily on days 2 to 7. Those assigned to standard-dose clopidogrel received a 300 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 75 mg once daily on days 2 to 7. Subsequently, on days 8 to 30, both groups received 75 mg once daily.

All participants received a loading dose of aspirin (≥ 300 mg) on day 1. On days 2 to 30, patients randomly allocated low-dose aspirin received 75 to 100 mg daily, whereas those allocated high-dose aspirin received 300 to 325 mg daily. The administration of vitamin K antagonists concurrently with the study drugs was strongly discouraged during the first 7 days. Other therapies, including anticoagulants, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, and applied stents, were left to the discretion of the treating physician.

Our primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke from randomization.

### Aspirin dose and six-month outcome after an acute coronary syndrome [^114b1TaH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was designed to compare the efficacy of low and intermediate aspirin doses in acute coronary syndromes. Little is known of the comparative efficacy of low and intermediate aspirin doses in this setting.

Patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (MI) discharged while receiving low (≤ 150 mg) aspirin therapy were analyzed from the GUSTO IIb and PURSUIT trials (n = 20,521). Six-month outcomes including death, MI, and stroke were compared using multivariable analysis. Propensity analysis was performed to adjust for baseline imbalances between groups.

- **Results**: Aspirin doses ≤ 150 mg (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.19], p = 0.35) showed no significant effect on the composite endpoint at six months after adjusting for baseline imbalances and the propensity score for discharge aspirin dose (HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.79 to 1.07], p = 0.28). However, the higher aspirin dose was associated with a reduction in six-month MI (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.64 to 0.98], p = 0.03). The outcome was similar when patients were matched based on the propensity score for aspirin dose (HR for death/MI/stroke 0.94 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.12], p = 0.51). Nevertheless, stroke occurred significantly more frequently among patients receiving the higher aspirin dose (HR 1.74 [95% CI 1.01 to 3.

The analysis highlights the complexities in determining the optimal aspirin dose for patients after acute coronary syndromes.

### Evidence-based antithrombotic therapy for acute coronary syndromes [^116eoeN1]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

In this issue of *Diabetes*, DiNicolantonio and Serebruany address the issue of aspirin dosing after acute coronary syndromes in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The authors challenge the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, and the FDA by arguing that a low dose of aspirin, when treated with ticagrelor, is inappropriate for these patients.

The protocol of the PLATO trial specified a single loading dose (160–500 mg allowed, ≤ 325 mg preferred) for patients not previously on aspirin, just before randomization, and a maintenance treatment with open-label aspirin, 75–100 mg daily, except when contraindicated or not tolerated. After coronary stenting, the protocol allowed 325 mg daily aspirin for ≤ 6 months.

A large number of preplanned exploratory analyses were performed in the PLATO trial, and a nominally significant treatment interaction for geographic region (P = 0.045) was observed. Clopidogrel was associated with a nonsignificant trend of better outcomes for North America alone, while ticagrelor was associated with better outcomes in the other regions combined. Within the ticagrelor group, the lowest event rates were observed in patients receiving low-dose aspirin and highest in those receiving high-dose aspirin. In contrast, event rates in clopidogrel-assigned patients were similar with high- or low-dose aspirin. The interaction was independently evaluated in exploratory analyses performed by the sponsor and the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Both analyses showed that the aspirin maintenance dose accounted for 80–100% of the observed effects.

### Evolution of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association cardiology clinical practice guidelines: A 10-year assessment [^111aE7kc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

There has been a reduction in the number of recommendations in the ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines published between 2013 and 2017, compared to those published from 2008 to 2012. This reduction is most notable in the areas of acute and stable ischemia, arrhythmia, and valvular heart disease. It is mainly driven by the decrease in the proportion of recommendations based on the lowest quality of evidence, LOE C. Although the guidelines now include fewer recommendations, they are proportionally based on higher-quality evidence, with an increase in LOE B from 42.4% to 53.1%. However, the proportion of the highest level of evidence, LOE A, remains low, making up only about 15% of the total recommendations.

This study offers an update to the pivotal article by Tricoci et al, which demonstrated a nearly 50% increase in the number of recommendations between 1984 and 2008. Since this study, there appears to have been a shift over the past decade towards condensed recommendations underpinned by higher-quality LOE. Our findings are also consistent with a 2017 analysis of changes in the quality of evidence from 2001 to 2014 for atrial fibrillation ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. Although this previous study only investigated one cardiology topic, the outcomes were analogous: (1) a decrease in LOE C recommendations, (2) an increase in LOE B recommendations, and (3) a low and unchanged proportion of LOE A recommendations.

Many useful and beneficial cardiology clinical practice guidelines exist, but with growing knowledge and evidence, it is imperative to continue refining these guidelines to maintain their relevance and quality.

### New antithrombotics for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome [^112iU65x]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) usually receive acetylsalicylic acid plus an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor to reduce the long-term risk of recurrent events. However, patients receiving standard antiplatelet prophylaxis still face a substantial risk of recurrent events. Strategies involving three antithrombotic agents with different modes of action have now been tested.

- **Thrombin receptor antagonists for clinical event reduction (TRA-CER)**: Compared with standard care alone, bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), were increased with the addition of vorapaxar, without an efficacy benefit.

- **Trial to assess the effects of SCH 530348 in preventing heart attack and stroke in patients with atherosclerosis (TRA 2°P-TIMI 50)**: The addition of vorapaxar reduced recurrent events compared with standard care in stable patients with prior myocardial infarction. This study was terminated early in patients with prior stroke owing to excess ICH, though an increased risk of ICH or fatal bleeding was not detected in patients with prior myocardial infarction.

- **Apixaban for prevention of acute ischemic and safety events 2 (APPRAISE-2)**: The trial of standard-dose apixaban added to standard care in patients with ACS was also stopped early owing to excess serious bleeding.

- **Rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin alone or with aspirin and a thienopyridine in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51)**: Fatal bleeding or fatal ICH did not increase with low-dose rivaroxaban added to low-dose acetylsalicylic acid-based standard.

### Aspirin hypersensitivity: A practical guide for cardiologists [^112pmciP]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Aspirin has been known for a long time and remains a cornerstone of antithrombotic therapy in cardiovascular disease. In patients with either acute or chronic coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is mandatory in a dual antiplatelet therapy regimen for the prevention of stent thrombosis and/or new ischemic events. Aspirin is also a first-option antithrombotic therapy after an aortic prosthetic valve replacement and is occasionally required in addition to oral anticoagulants after the implantation of a mechanical valve.

Presumed or demonstrated aspirin hypersensitivity is a main clinical problem, limiting the use of a life-saving medication. In the general population, aspirin hypersensitivity has a prevalence of 0.6%-2.5% and presents with a plethora of clinical manifestations, ranging from aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease to anaphylaxis. Although infrequent, when encountered in clinical practice, aspirin hypersensitivity poses a clinical dilemma for cardiologists, which should never be trivialized. It is important to avoid, as much as possible, the omission of the drug.

We review the epidemiology of aspirin hypersensitivity, provide an outline of pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical presentations, and review management options. This begins with a characterization of true aspirin allergy — in contrast to intolerance — and suggestions for desensitization protocols.

In the classification and risk stratification for aspirin overdose, particularly regarding severity grading, the NPIS 2002 guidelines recommend that moderate poisoning is indicated by a salicylate level of 600–800 mg/L in adults or 450–700 mg/L in children or the elderly. Clinical features include mild tachypnea, hyperpyrexia, sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, and restlessness.

### Expert position paper on the role of platelet function testing in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^115iCqaP]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Although there is no dedicated RCT that has evaluated the clinical relevance of increased doses of aspirin based on platelet reactivity testing, findings from a large RCT comparing low-dose and high-dose aspirin in patients with ACS without platelet function testing suggest no benefit for using high doses (> 100 mg) of aspirin. The Randomized Trial of Optimal Clopidogrel and Aspirin Dosing in Patients with ACS Undergoing an Early Invasive Strategy with Intent For PCI (OASIS-7 trial) compared low-dose (75–100 mg) and high-dose (300–325 mg) aspirin in 25,087 patients with ACS and found no difference in the 30-day risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in both the overall ACS population (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.85–1.08, P = 0.47) and in the subgroup of patients who underwent PCI (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.84–1.13, P = 0.76). There was a higher rate of gastrointestinal bleeding in the high-dose aspirin group (0.24% vs. 0.38%, P = 0.051).

Similarly, a higher risk of bleeding with high-dose aspirin was observed in the post hoc analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) Trial. Post hoc analysis of the PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, prompted by regional differences between North America and other countries in the primary endpoint of the trial, suggested a possible interaction between ticagrelor and high-dose aspirin. After extensive statistical modeling, investigators suggested that the use of high-dose aspirin might explain the trend.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in persons with diabetes and multiple risk factors [^112CLtrV]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The investigation reflects this approach. All patients had a first clinical presentation of CHD documented by a diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. The outcome of interest was STEMI, since it is a marker of poorer short-term prognosis. A requirement of the study was that the outcomes of patients exposed to aspirin could not be influenced by other potential prevention therapies. This task was achieved by matching concomitant medications using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Aspirin users versus nonusers had a similar pattern of exposure to concomitant medications.

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zWsBR]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The reduction of ischaemic events by the new oral anticoagulants was most promising when added to single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. However, single antiplatelet treatment is rarely used because many acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are treated with percutaneous coronary interventions and stents, and guidelines recommend that all post-ACS patients should receive up to 12 months of dual antiplatelet treatment. Thus, the most striking results of this meta-analysis concern the high bleeding rates in combination with only modest reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the large groups of patients receiving combinations of new oral anticoagulants with dual antiplatelet therapy.

The reviewed trials were all designed and performed at a time when clopidogrel was the only available P2Y12 inhibitor. Recently, acute and long-term treatment combining aspirin and new P2Y12 inhibitors, either prasugrel or ticagrelor, have been shown to be more effective than clopidogrel for the prevention of MACEs during and after ACS. Prasugrel or ticagrelor is now considered the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor in patients with ACS. Long-term treatment with any of these new antiplatelet agents was, compared with clopidogrel, associated with a modest increase, up to 35%, in major non-CABG-related bleedings. This contrasts with the findings of the present study, which indicates more than a three-fold increase in major bleeding events when adding the new oral anticoagulants to aspirin and clopidogrel.

The addition of a new oral anticoagulant to aspirin and any of ticagrelor or prasugrel has not been thoroughly evaluated and might expose the patients to elevated risks of bleeding.

### Is there an association between aspirin dosing and cardiac and bleeding events after treatment of acute coronary syndrome? A systematic review of the literature [^113qTtWo]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) dosing algorithms for the prevention of secondary thrombotic events in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are inconsistent and lack sufficient data support.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of the literature for studies that assessed clinical outcomes in patients with ACS following coronary stent insertion (SI) or medical treatment (MT). Acetylsalicylic acid dosing was stratified into low- (< 160 mg) and high- (≥ 160 mg) dose categories. Outcomes were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months and included major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and all-cause death. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the value of the mean for each outcome variable.

- **Results**: Of 12,472 publications identified, 136 studies with 289,330 patients were analyzed. In the 1-month SI analysis, proportions of patients (95% CI) in the low- and high-dose ASA categories experiencing major bleeding were 2.1% (1.5–2.6) and 1.9% (0.0–3.8); proportions with myocardial infarction were 2.1% (1.3–2.8) and 1.8% (0.9–2.6); and proportions of all-cause death were 2.8% (2.2–3.4) and 2.4% (1.3–3.5), respectively. Results were similar in the MT analysis, except that major bleeding rates for low and high doses were 1.7% (1.3–2.2) and 4.0% (2.2–5.8), respectively. Regression analyses suggested that the proportion of patients reporting each of the outcomes evaluated were not significantly different between the low- and high-dose categories, with the exception of the 1-month major bleeding following MT.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest no improved clinical outcomes with differing ASA dosing in the treatment of ACS patients, except for a noted difference in major bleeding at the 1-month interval following MT.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: A population-based analysis [^114ioExD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We quantified the net impact of early self-administration of aspirin on mortality post-AMI by subtracting aspirin-related bleeding deaths from deaths delayed from AMI for each age-sex group. The number of YOLS was estimated as the product of net deaths delayed and life expectancy at the midpoint of the 5-year age interval from the CDC's National Vital Statistics Life Expectancy Tables. Total cost of aspirin was calculated as the product of the cost of a 28-day daily 325 mg aspirin regimen (US $0.10 per tablet in 2021) and the number of individuals eligible for the early aspirin intervention. We reported the cost per YOLS by age and sex and for the entire adult population of the United States.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: We varied the ICD-10 codes used to define AMI-related deaths (i.e. deaths directly due to AMI or deaths from consequences of an AMI). In our most conservative approach, we restricted AMI-related deaths to include only acute AMI and cardiac arrest (ICD-10 codes I21 and I49), resulting in an estimated 347,232 cases of incident AMI in 2019. In our least conservative approach, we added a proportion of deaths from heart failure (ICD-10 code 50.9) using 34% as the best estimate of heart failure cases attributable to coronary artery disease, resulting in an estimated 516,192 cases of incident AMI in 2019. We also restricted the meta-analysis for the PPV of severe chest pain for AMI to include only studies conducted in the United States (n = 5) and explored using the less conservative estimate.

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116cU1X9]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The collected data items included inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, interventions (the randomized anticoagulant treatment as well as treatment with antiplatelet drugs aspirin and/or clopidogrel), effect estimates from the comparisons made, follow-up time, and definition of outcomes (MACEs and major bleeding events).

In the ESTEEM study, only single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin was allowed, while the APPRAISE-1, APPRAISE-2, and ATLAS ACS-TIMI 46 recruited patients either on single (aspirin) or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. These patients were analyzed stratified on their antiplatelet therapy status at the time of randomization in the present study. In the REDEEM, RUBY-1, and ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 studies, the vast majority of patients received dual antiplatelet therapy at randomization, i.e. 98%, 95%, and 93%, respectively, and all patients in these studies were thus considered as receiving dual antiplatelet therapy in the present analysis.

Eligible patients were men or women with ACS with or without ST-elevation within 7–14 days before randomization. In addition, patients had one or more of the following additional risk factors: age ≥ 65 years, prior myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, no revascularization for the index event, mild to moderate renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, or previous ischemic stroke in all studies except the ATLAS ACS-TIMI 46.

### Adult chest pain in the pediatric emergency department: Treatment and timeliness from door in to door out [^113exmPB]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) recommend immediate aspirin (ASA) administration, an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 minutes, and a door-in to door-out (DIDO) time under 30 minutes for interfacility transfer. This study sought to determine if compliance with these guidelines is hindered when adults with suspected ACS present to pediatric facilities.

Visits to the two tertiary care emergency departments of a pediatric healthcare system using an adult chest pain protocol were examined from October 2006 to September 2012. Patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis suggestive of ACS and an initial ECG interpretation were identified. Researchers calculated the proportions of patients receiving ASA, as well as median times to ECG and DIDO. A bivariate analysis of ECG and DIDO time and the proportion of patients receiving ASA was conducted for ECG findings both positive and negative for ACS.

A total of 113 patients were identified. Aspirin was administered in 69% of eligible cases. Electrocardiogram and DIDO times met recommended intervals in 42% (median, 12 minutes) and 5% (median, 59 minutes) of the patients, respectively. No significant differences between the positive (22% of total) and negative (78% of total) ECG findings groups were detected in median DIDO time (57 vs. 59 minutes, P = 0.99), time to ECG (14 vs. 12 minutes, P = 0.45), or the proportion receiving ASA (84% vs. 64%, P = 0.08).

Despite the use of the emergency department protocol, compliance with the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines was found to be lacking.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: A population-based analysis [^116Au9eT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States, with more than 300,000 deaths in 2019. The American Heart Association estimated that approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has an AMI, translating into 605,000 incident cases. Aspirin is a cost-effective pharmaceutical for reducing mortality after AMI. The International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2), one of the largest randomized control trials (RCTs) of aspirin use, found that 28-day aspirin use initiated within 4 hours of symptom onset reduced cardiovascular mortality by 25%. The relative risk (RR) reduction of aspirin has been found to be highest when aspirin is administered earlier, closer to symptom onset.

Yet, more than three-quarters (78%) of AMI deaths occur outside the hospital. Only 45.5% of patients with chest pain, who were later diagnosed as experiencing an AMI, accessed medical care within 4 hours of symptom onset. Less than half of emergency medical dispatchers or technicians recommended or gave aspirin to patients with chest pain, though the 2007 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline for the Management of Patients with Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction recommends that emergency medical dispatchers administer aspirin to patients experiencing chest pain. These guidelines do not encourage self-administration of aspirin by patients after chest pain, possibly due to the low specificity of chest pain as a symptom of AMI and for fear of side effects. Aspirin increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications.

### Antithrombotic therapy for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^113UnMg9]. Chest (2008). High credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease is part of the "Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition)". Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions are weaker, as there is uncertainty regarding the benefits, risks, and costs, such that individual patients' values may lead to different choices. For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation for Antithrombotic Agents" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S.

Among the key recommendations are the following:

- **Initial treatment**: For all patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), without a clear allergy to aspirin, we recommend immediate aspirin (162 to 325 mg po) followed by daily oral aspirin (75 to 100 mg) [Grade 1A].

- **Moderate risk NSTE ACS with early invasive strategy**: For patients who are at moderate risk for an ischemic event or higher, and who will undergo an early invasive management strategy, we recommend "upstream" treatment either with clopidogrel (300 mg po bolus, followed by 75 mg/d) or a small-molecule IV glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide or tirofiban) [Grade 1A].

- **Moderate risk NSTE ACS with early conservative or delayed invasive strategy**: For patients who are at least moderate risk for an ischemic event and for whom an early conservative or a delayed invasive strategy of management is to be used, we recommend "upstream" treatment with clopidogrel (300 mg oral bolus, followed by 75 mg/d) [Grade 1A].

- **Post-PCI management**: For NSTE ACS patients who undergo PCI, we recommend continuation of therapy according to the guidelines.

### Association of discharge aspirin dose with outcomes after acute myocardial infarction: Insights from the treatment with ADP receptor inhibitors: Longitudinal assessment of treatment patterns and events after acute coronary syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) study [^111V9634]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug post-myocardial infarction, yet its optimal maintenance dose after percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting remains uncertain.

- **Methods and results**: We compared outcomes of 10,213 patients with myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and were discharged on dual-antiplatelet therapy at 228 US hospitals in the Treatment with ADP Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) study from 2010 to 2012. Major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding within 6 months post-discharge were compared between high-dose (325 mg) and low-dose aspirin (81 mg) using regression models with inverse probability-weighted propensity adjustment.

Overall, 6,387 patients (63%) received high-dose aspirin at discharge. Major adverse cardiovascular events risk was not significantly different between groups (high versus low: unadjusted 8.2% versus 9.2%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–1.17). High-dose aspirin use was associated with a greater risk of any Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-defined bleeding events (unadjusted 24.2% versus 22.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.33), driven mostly by minor Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 1 or 2 bleeding events not requiring hospitalization (unadjusted 21.4% versus 19.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.34). Bleeding events requiring hospitalization were similar across aspirin dosing groups.

### Dual antiplatelet agent failure: A new syndrome or clinical nonentity [^114yQRq1]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aspirin resistance is a well-documented laboratory finding, but the effects of clinical aspirin (ASA) failure on patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been debated. Likewise, there is recognition of clopidogrel resistance, but the clinical effects of clopidogrel failure are not well understood. We sought to determine the 6-month outcomes of patients who developed an ACS while on ASA or dual antiplatelet agents.

- **Methods**: Of all patients admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, between 1999 and 2005 with a diagnosis of ACS, 6-month follow-up data were available for 3126. The cohort was divided into three groups based on medication history: no prior antiplatelet agent, ASA only, and ASA with clopidogrel (or ticlopidine). The primary endpoint was the rate of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, or composite major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) at 6 months.

- **Results**: Aside from a lower rate of myocardial infarction in patients without any prior antiplatelet agent use, there were no significant differences in 6-month stroke, death, or MACE between the three medication cohorts. In the propensity-adjusted model, whereas dual antiplatelet status was not an independent predictor of 6-month mortality or MACE, there was a trend toward lower 6-month death rates for patients with prior ASA use (odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.51–1.04, P = .08).

- **Conclusions**: Patients who "fail" antiplatelet therapy do not have an overall worse prognosis. Our data do not support ASA or dual antiplatelet agent failure as a distinct clinical entity.
