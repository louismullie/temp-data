## Question

What are the potential side effects of fluoxetine at this dose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential side effects of fluoxetine at a specific dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what dose "this dose" refers to and confirm the context. Then, I should verify the dose–response relationship for efficacy and tolerability to anchor risk. Next, I will extract and categorize side effects by frequency and severity from authoritative sources. After that, I should consider special populations and drug–drug interactions that modify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and outline monitoring and mitigation strategies, making sure I cite the best available evidence throughout.

> Let me first confirm the dose in question. Wait, let me verify the context: the user is asking about fluoxetine side effects at "this dose", but the dose itself is not specified in the query. Given the evidence base and labeling, I will assume a standard adult dose of 20 mg daily, which is the typical starting and maintenance dose for depression and aligns with the dose range where efficacy and tolerability are optimized in meta-analyses, with many trials and labels using 20–40 mg as the therapeutic sweet spot [^4b078700] [^694b972c] [^834f8b61].

> Next, I should review the dose–response relationship to frame risk. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: higher doses can increase efficacy modestly but worsen tolerability. The Lancet dose–response meta-analysis shows efficacy rises up to about 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents and then plateaus, while dropouts due to adverse effects increase linearly to exponentially with dose, roughly doubling at 40 mg and tripling near 80 mg, underscoring that 20 mg sits in the optimal balance zone for most adults [^4b078700] [^694b972c] [^bd7eade6]. I should double-check that this applies across SSRIs; yes, systematic reviews of reviews converge on a flat efficacy curve and poorer acceptability at higher doses, reinforcing caution with dose escalation beyond 40 mg unless clearly indicated and well tolerated [^cc60d03d] [^9ab2efba].

> I will now examine very common side effects at 20 mg. Let me think about frequency thresholds: the FDA labeling typically flags reactions occurring in more than 10% of patients as "very common". At 20 mg, these include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea), neuropsychiatric activation (anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, tremor), autonomic symptoms (dry mouth, sweating), and sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, ejaculatory delay), with headache, asthenia, somnolence, and yawning also frequent; this pattern is consistent across multiple FDA sources and clinical summaries [^834f8b61] [^6c83708a] [^ec00fb12]. Hold on, I should verify that these are indeed the dominant early adverse effects; yes, large clinical experience and labeling consistently place these at the top of the list at therapeutic doses [^834f8b61].

> Next, I should review common side effects, roughly 1–10% in many series. I need to check the FDA listings for 20–40 mg contexts: these include dizziness, dyspepsia, constipation, visual disturbances, emotional lability, mania/hypomania, palpitations, QT prolongation, and dermatologic reactions such as rash and pruritus; weight loss and decreased appetite are also reported, with weight change more often loss early on rather than gain at standard doses [^834f8b61] [^8f9c1152]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought weight gain would be common at 20 mg; let me reconsider — weight gain is more characteristic of long-term therapy and higher doses, whereas early treatment more often shows appetite suppression and modest weight loss, so I should correct that assumption here [^notfound].

> I will now examine uncommon and rare but clinically important adverse effects. I should confirm the serious risks: suicidal ideation can occur, particularly early in treatment or during dose changes, warranting close monitoring; serotonin syndrome is a key risk, especially with serotonergic combinations; QT prolongation is possible, though fluoxetine's risk is lower than citalopram's and generally modest at 20 mg; hyponatremia, particularly in older adults or those on diuretics; bleeding risk due to platelet effects, amplified with NSAIDs or anticoagulants; and rare hepatic injury, seizures, and severe cutaneous reactions including SJS/TEN; sexual dysfunction can persist after discontinuation in some cases, which I should explicitly note [^834f8b61] [^607f084d] [^990a016a] [^e8a02394] [^e3ed8567]. Hold on, I should verify the QT signal: yes, fluoxetine has a weaker QT signal than citalopram, but caution is prudent in patients with cardiac risk factors or interacting drugs [^990a016a].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers of risk. In older adults, I should confirm that lower starting doses and slower titration are advised due to higher susceptibility to hyponatremia, falls, and cognitive effects; indeed, geriatric guidance supports lower or less frequent dosing, and case literature documents reversible cognitive adverse effects in some elderly patients on 20 mg, so I need to ensure vigilance for neurocognitive changes [^1ac30ef9] [^0dc9819a]. In hepatic impairment, reduced dosing is recommended because fluoxetine is metabolized in the liver; in pregnancy, third-trimester exposure carries neonatal adaptation risks, so shared decision-making and potential tapering late in gestation are advised; in pediatrics, monitor growth and for activation symptoms, and note that only fluoxetine and escitalopram have adolescent approvals for depression in some regions [^1ac30ef9] [^513276a0] [^83d79ab2]. I should double-check CYP2D6 considerations: fluoxetine is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, so coadministration with narrow-therapeutic-index drugs like thioridazine or certain antiarrhythmics is contraindicated, and dose adjustments may be needed for other CYP2D6 substrates [^aaef4edb].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions that amplify risk at 20 mg. MAOIs are contraindicated due to serotonin syndrome risk, with a 5-week washout required after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI because of norfluoxetine's long half-life; linezolid and IV methylene blue also pose serotonin syndrome risk and require careful management if unavoidable; serotonergic agents like triptans, tramadol, lithium, and St. John's wort increase serotonin syndrome risk and warrant monitoring; NSAIDs and warfarin increase bleeding risk; and CYP2D6 substrates may need dose reductions, including TCAs and certain antipsychotics or antiarrhythmics [^56044214] [^f36dfdb5] [^e8a02394] [^aaef4edb]. Hold on, I should verify the washout: yes, at least 5 weeks off fluoxetine is advised before MAOI initiation, longer if high dose or chronic use, given norfluoxetine persistence [^56044214].

> I will now synthesize a practical, prioritized side-effect profile at 20 mg. Very common and usually early, often transient effects include nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, insomnia or somnolence, anxiety/nervousness, tremor, sweating, yawning, and sexual dysfunction; these often improve over 1–2 weeks but should be monitored closely because early side-effect burden predicts poorer outcomes [^834f8b61] [^34e59768]. Common effects include dizziness, dyspepsia, constipation, visual disturbances, emotional lability, palpitations, and rash; weight loss and appetite suppression are more likely early than gain, and activation symptoms can emerge, particularly in younger patients or those with anxiety disorders [^834f8b61] [^54e15b50]. Serious but uncommon risks include suicidal ideation, serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation in susceptible patients, hyponatremia in older adults, bleeding with antiplatelets/anticoagulants, and rare hepatotoxicity or seizures; persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation is also described [^834f8b61] [^607f084d] [^e3ed8567].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a higher dose or a different formulation? I should confirm that dose escalation beyond 40 mg tends to increase adverse effects without proportional gains in efficacy, so if tolerability is poor at 20–40 mg, switching strategies rather than simply increasing dose is often wiser; this is supported by dose–response meta-analyses and clinical guidelines emphasizing optimization within the 20–40 mg range before considering higher doses or alternative agents [^4b078700] [^694b972c] [^cc60d03d]. I need to ensure I also note that delayed-release formulations have broadly similar adverse-event profiles to immediate-release, so the dose principle remains the same [^8f9c1152].

> Finally, I should outline monitoring and mitigation. Early follow-up within 1–2 weeks helps assess tolerability and adherence; screen for suicidality, activation, and functional impairment; counsel on GI upset timing with food, sleep hygiene for insomnia, and sexual dysfunction management strategies; monitor blood pressure and heart rate in those with cardiac risk; check sodium in older adults or on diuretics; and review all concomitant medications for serotonergic and CYP2D6 interactions at each visit; if discontinuation is needed, taper slowly given norfluoxetine's long half-life, even though fluoxetine has a lower discontinuation syndrome risk than shorter-half-life SSRIs [^54e15b50] [^834f8b61] [^f6df268a] [^6a324b8d]. Hold on, I should verify the taper advice: yes, gradual tapers are recommended, and hyperbolic tapering over months may further reduce withdrawal symptoms in sensitive patients, though fluoxetine's kinetics already blunt withdrawal compared with agents like paroxetine [^ef991365] [^6a324b8d].

---

At 20 mg/day, fluoxetine commonly causes **nausea, insomnia, headache, dry mouth, diarrhea, and sexual dysfunction** (decreased libido, delayed ejaculation/orgasm) [^834f8b61] [^6c83708a]. These effects are usually **mild and transient**, resolving within 1–2 weeks; starting low and titrating slowly can reduce early activation or GI upset [^54e15b50]. Less common effects include anxiety, tremor, sweating, and appetite/weight changes; rare risks include serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation, and suicidal ideation, especially with interactions or predisposing factors [^607f084d] [^990a016a]. Monitor for **worsening mood, agitation, or unusual symptoms**, and seek care if severe or persistent.

---

## Common side effects (≥ 10%)

- **Nausea**: Very common; often transient, improving with food or dose titration [^834f8b61].
- **Insomnia**: Very common; consider morning dosing or sleep hygiene [^834f8b61].
- **Headache**: Very common; usually mild and self-limited [^834f8b61].
- **Dry mouth**: Very common; hydration and sugarless gum help [^834f8b61].
- **Diarrhea**: Very common; monitor hydration [^834f8b61].
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Very common (decreased libido, delayed ejaculation/orgasm); discuss management if persistent [^834f8b61] [^f6df268a].

---

## Less common side effects (1–10%)

- **Anxiety or nervousness**: Can occur early; often resolves with time or dose adjustment [^834f8b61].
- **Tremor**: Usually mild; monitor if progressive [^834f8b61].
- **Sweating**: Excessive sweating is reported [^834f8b61].
- **Dizziness**: Occurs in a minority; caution with driving or machinery [^834f8b61].
- **Fatigue or somnolence**: Less frequent but possible [^834f8b61].
- **Appetite/weight changes**: Loss of appetite or modest weight loss is common; weight gain is less frequent at 20 mg [^834f8b61].

---

## Rare but serious side effects

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Potentially life-threatening with serotonergic drugs; monitor for agitation, confusion, fever, rigidity, and autonomic instability [^607f084d].
- **QT prolongation**: Rare at 20 mg; risk rises with high doses, cardiac disease, or interacting drugs [^990a016a].
- **Suicidal ideation**: Rare; monitor closely, especially in younger patients or during dose changes [^834f8b61].
- **Seizures**: Rare; use caution in seizure disorders [^834f8b61].
- **Hyponatremia**: Particularly in older adults or those on diuretics [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing side effects

- **Age**: Older adults are more prone to hyponatremia, falls, and cognitive effects [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiac disease, epilepsy, and renal/hepatic impairment increase risk [^990a016a] [^1ac30ef9].
- **Drug interactions**: MAOIs, triptans, tramadol, and other serotonergic drugs raise serotonin syndrome risk; CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase fluoxetine levels [^607f084d] [^aaef4edb].
- **Genetics**: CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may have higher exposure and more side effects [^b8130f8a].

---

## Management strategies

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at 10 mg for 1 week, then increase to 20 mg to reduce early activation or GI upset [^notfound].
- **Dose timing**: Morning dosing can reduce insomnia; evening dosing may help if somnolence occurs [^notfound].
- **Supportive measures**: Hydration, dietary fiber, and sleep hygiene mitigate GI and sleep effects [^notfound].
- **Switching or augmentation**: For persistent sexual dysfunction or intolerance, consider bupropion, mirtazapine, or a different SSRI [^437e16d0].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess mood, suicidality, vitals, and electrolytes in at-risk patients [^475bf3f7].

---

## Long-term considerations

Long-term use is **generally safe** at 20 mg, with sustained sexual dysfunction and modest weight change as the most persistent issues; withdrawal is uncommon due to fluoxetine's long half-life, but tapering is still prudent when stopping [^73ec4cc6] [^f6df268a] [^6a324b8d]. Routine labs are not required unless clinically indicated, though periodic monitoring of weight, blood pressure, and electrolytes is reasonable in vulnerable patients [^notfound].

---

At 20 mg/day, fluoxetine's side effects are **typically mild and transient**, with nausea, insomnia, headache, dry mouth, diarrhea, and sexual dysfunction being most frequent. Serious adverse effects are rare but require vigilance for serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation, and suicidal ideation, especially with interactions or comorbidities.

### A mega-analysis of fixed-dose trials reveals dose-dependency and a rapid onset of action for the antidepressant effect of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^f3dfc274]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have since long been extensively used for the treatment of depression, it remains controversial whether they display a dose–response relationship. Thus, while a number of individual studies and meta-analyses do suggest a dose-dependency to be at hand, several authors systematically reviewing the outcomes of individual studies have concluded that high doses are no more effective than low, the dose–response curve often being described as flat. This possible lack of a dose–response relationship for the SSRIs has recently gained renewed interest, as it has been put forward as an argument for the claim that they are devoid of specific, pharmacological antidepressant actions. To clarify whether the antidepressant effect of the SSRIs is indeed unrelated to dose has, for this reason, emerged as a task of considerable theoretical importance.

This matter has obvious bearing on clinical practice. If high doses are no more effective than the lowest recommended one, the commonly applied dose escalation strategy in cases of non-response may be counterproductive by needlessly increasing the burden of side effects. In addition, if the effect of an SSRI is an all-or-nothing phenomenon, the SSRIs should perhaps preferably be prescribed at doses even lower than those currently recommended. On the other hand, if these drugs do display dose-dependency, the widespread assumption that they do not may prompt clinicians to use suboptimal dosage. Illustrating the unfortunate ambiguity of the current evidence on this matter, two British guidelines state that no dose-dependency has been established, whereas the American Psychiatric Association recommends dose escalation in cases of non-response.

The effect sizes (ES) for comparisons of SSRIs versus placebo in drug company-sponsored trials using the conventional measure of efficacy are usually small (0.3–0.4). Regardless of whether such modest outcomes are true reflections of a relatively poor efficacy, or whether they are artificially low because of the methodological shortcomings marring company-sponsored trials, they justify the conclusion that detecting significant differences between two doses that are both superior to placebo would require a large number of subjects. Most individual dose–response studies being marred by too low statistical power to detect differences between doses might, hence, partly explain why previous systematic reviews have reached the conclusion that no dose–response relationship is at hand. Supporting this possibility, three, out of fourmeta-analyses addressing this issue do, in fact, suggest the antidepressant effect of the SSRIs to be dose-dependent.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^d50ccdcf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and some medicines may interact with each other and may not work as well, or cause possible serious side effects. Your doctor can tell you if it is safe to take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with your other medicines. Do not start or stop any medicine while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules without talking to your doctor first.

If you take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, you should not take any other medicines that contain:

olanzapine (the active ingredient in Zyprexa®and Zyprexa®Zydis®) or
fluoxetine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in Prozac®, and Sarafem®).

You could take too much medicine (overdose).

How should I take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules?

Take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may need to change (adjust) the dose of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules until it is right for you.
If you miss a dose of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules at the same time.
To prevent serious side effects, do not stop taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules suddenly. If you need to stop taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, your doctor can tell you how to safely stop taking them.
If you take too many olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, call your doctor or poison control center right away, or get emergency treatment.
Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules can be taken with or without food.
Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are usually taken one time each day, in the evening.
If you do not think you are getting better or have any concerns about your condition while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, call your doctor.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^019fbbce]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

In all cases, it is important to discuss and document potential benefits and harms with patients and their families, and the lack of robust evidence or marketing authorisation for any drug treatment other than fluoxetine 20 mg once daily. The practicality of blood monitoring in local services may imply that it is not feasible to prescribe antipsychotics and (especially) lithium. It is also important to discuss marketing authorisation regulations for potential antidepressants in your own country (for example in the United Kingdom, marketing authorisation for adolescent depression is only present for fluoxetine). If you are unsure, it is important to discuss cases with your consultant peers and to document this.

If a patient has severe side effects (such as suicidality) on one SSRI, is it safe to try a second SSRI?

While the majority of adolescents given an SSRI have mild, transient side effects, a small number of patients have rarer and more dangerous side effects, including suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, and clotting abnormalities. Many patients and their families (and their prescribers) will choose to stop the medication in this situation.

There is then the question of whether another SSRI should be used. There is no published evidence regarding this. However, in consensus discussions, several psychiatrists have tried the patient on a second SSRI and this has not led to the same side effect. It is likely the patient will have increased risk of, for example, suicidality on a second SSRI compared to a patient who has never had an SSRI, but it could be worth trying, especially in more severe depression which itself carries significant suicide risk. As always, it is important to discuss potential benefits and risks with patients and families and make decisions jointly. It is essential to document these discussions. It is also especially important to follow these patients up regularly when starting a second SSRI and have a clear plan in place for what is to be done if these side effects recur. If unsure, discuss the case with consultant peers and document this.

It is also important to take into account the pharmacological profile of the first and second SSRI. Among the SSRIs, sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram have significantly higher 5-HT specificity than fluoxetine. So, if sertraline caused dangerous side effects, it would be better to try the more different fluoxetine than citalopram as second line.

5.15 Discontinuation Adverse Reactions

During marketing of fluoxetine, SNRIs, and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug.

5.16 Fluoxetine and Olanzapine in Combination

When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax.

5.17 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of fluoxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^4b078700]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^269bdbf8]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the USA, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the USA and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^bc8463ce]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Two studies examined the relationships between doses and side-effects. Bollini and colleaguesfound a monotonic increase in adverse event rates, from 20% to 50%, as the dose increased, from zero to more than 50 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Jakubovski and colleaguesfound a monotonic dose relationship for dropouts due to side-effects, but an almost flat relationship for all-cause dropouts. These findings might be confounded by the inclusion of both fixed-dose and flexible-dose studies. By contrast, by focusing on fixed-dose studies and using flexible spline curves, we found a linear to exponential relationship between dose and dropouts due to side-effects, and a curvilinear relationship between dose and all-cause dropouts for SSRIs.

Our study is not without limitations. First, the findings mainly pertain to patients with major depression who were judged eligible for placebo-controlled trials. For patients who suffer from physical comorbidities or for older (ie, age ≥ 65 years) patients, the optimal dose might be lower than 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. In this context, the positive dose-efficacy association through zero to 30 mg of fluoxetine equivalents is clinically relevant. Second, the fixed-dose regimen might be regarded as not reflecting clinical practice, especially when no or rapid titration scheme is used, and might overestimate withdrawal due to adverse effects. Tolerability might then confound efficacy because interventions with high dropouts are likely to show lower endpoint efficacy because the majority of patients leave the study early and therefore have less time to improve; however, strict examination of dose dependency is possible only with fixed-dose studies. Third, there is some uncertainty about how best to calculate dose equivalency among antidepressants. We used the most comprehensive empirically derived conversion algorithms, which were similar to the ones used in previous systematic reviews on this topic. We tested our results via sensitivity analyses that used alternative conversion algorithms and confirmed the primary results. Fourth, spline curves for individual drugs were based on a few studies, resulting in wide CIs. We therefore meta-analysed all SSRIs because they share a key therapeutic mechanism. The curves for individual SSRIs provided little evidence of heterogeneity. For venlafaxine and mirtazapine, the numbers of available trials were few and the resultant wide CIs, particularly regarding tolerability and acceptability, warn against overinterpreting the results. Fifth, we used dropouts for side-effects from the acute-phase treatment as an index of tolerability: these numbers do not necessarily reflect rare but severe adverse events, nor do they include long-term side-effects, including withdrawal symptoms. Lastly, the search date for the relevant studies could be considered old; however, an update search for eligible trials in PubMed on March 21, 2019 revealed only one additional eligible study with a small sample size (55 patients randomly assigned to paroxetine 10 mg and 49 to placebo), which would not change the results of our analysis with 19 364 patients.

### Fluoxetine: a suitable long-term treatment [^73ec4cc6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A review of fluoxetine's safety profile, especially during long-term treatment, is presented. Key safety advantages for fluoxetine include lower adverse events and dropout rates compared with tricyclic antidepressants and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), safety in overdose, and safe use in special population groups such as women in pregnancy. Prospectively ascertained pregnancy outcomes following exposure to SSRIs, mainly fluoxetine, consistently show no teratogenic effects as assessed in the postnatal period and in comparison with controls. An additional advantage of fluoxetine is the absence or mildness of discontinuation symptoms following treatment interruption, probably a consequence of fluoxetine's long half-life in comparison with other SSRIs. The available data on these topics confirm the suitability of long-term fluoxetine treatment.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^9ab2efba]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Another difficulty with imipramine dose equivalents is that researchers have used irregular dose groupings: imipramine doses of < 100, 100–199, 200–250, and > 250 mg/day. Introducing these groupings reduces sensitivity to detect dose-response differences, and gives greater weight to those patients that can tolerate higher doses. Imipramine dose equivalents are also based on arbitrary SSRI doses that cannot routinely be prescribed in clinical practice (eg, 45 mg citalopram, 125 mg sertraline, and 33.3 mg fluoxetine). However, other dose standardisation techniques have different limitations; for example, Braun et al compared non-equivalent low (potentially subtherapeutic) SSRI daily doses with standardised doses of the same compound (eg, ≤ 10 mg citalopram (equivalent to 5 mg escitalopram) v ≤ 9 mg escitalopram (equivalent to 18 mg citalopram)). Citalopram is a racemic 50:50 mixture of active S-enantiomer (escitalopram) and inactive R-enantiomer, such that 2 mg of citalopram contains 1 mg of S-citalopram (escitalopram) and 1 mg of R-citalopram. Conversely, Braun et al also categorised a wide range of doses as high in their study, which could have affected their findings — for example, ≥ 40 mg citalopram with ≥ 80 mg fluoxetine. But other systematic reviews have focused on individual SSRIs, using the actual drug dose — therefore, removing interclass and intraclass variations.

Few reviews focus on primary care (ie, general/family practice and outpatients). While some reviews combine primary and secondary care inpatient studies, most lack clarity regarding the study settings. Therefore, the inclusion of inpatient studies could limit the generalisability of their findings to wider primary care populations, as demonstrated by Cheng et al. Other methodological limitations include: inclusion of mild depression studies; non-placebo controlled studies; narrative reviews that might lack a systematic approach; use of data on file, which misses search strategies and misses references, preventing others from replicating the review; assessing and reporting on efficacy but not on adverse effects or dropout rates; and assessing response without reporting remission effects. However, even after considering the potential limitations of previous reviews, this systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis shows an overall consensus that SSRIs demonstrate a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and poorer acceptability and tolerability as SSRI doses are increased for the treatment of depression.

### Exploring treatment alternatives: weekly dosing of fluoxetine for the continuation phase of major depressive disorder [^a92697dc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Antidepressant medications are typically taken on a daily basis owing to both tradition and the pharmacokinetics of these agents. Because fluoxetine and its primary metabolite norfluoxetine have long half-lives and flat dose-response curves, we examined the tolerability of a weekly dose and its equivalence to daily dosing during the continuation phase of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Open-label treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 7 weeks began with 114 subjects. Subsequently, 70 subjects who met criteria for response were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to 1 of 3 treatment groups (20 mg of fluoxetine daily [N = 21], 60 mg of fluoxetine weekly [N = 28], or placebo [N = 21]) and followed for 7 weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed in several clinical measures. Tolerability in the 3 groups was similar; there was no difference in dropout rates or adverse events. Hence, weekly dosing of fluoxetine appears to be well tolerated and possibly as effective as daily dosing in the treatment of MDD. It is proposed that less frequent dosing could potentially benefit patients by enhancing adherence and minimizing the risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions.

### Guidelines for adolescent depression in primary care (GLAD-PC): part II. treatment and ongoing management [^dc00daa8]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment — indications, dosing cautions, approvals, and monitoring specify that when indicated by clinical presentation (ie, clear diagnosis of MDD with no comorbid conditions) and patient and/or family preference, an SSRI should be used, and once the antidepressant is started, and if tolerated, the clinician should support an adequate trial up to the maximum dose and duration. Deliberate self-harm and/or suicide risk is more likely to occur if the SSRI is started at higher doses (rather than normal starting doses), so the patient and family should be informed about these possible adverse effects (clinicians may use checklist), including possible switch to mania or the development of behavioral activation or suicide-related events. Generally, the effective dosages for antidepressants in adolescents are lower than would be found in adult guidelines; note that only fluoxetine has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents with depression, and only escitalopram has been approved for use in adolescents aged 12 years and older. Clinicians should know the potential drug interactions with SSRIs, and in addition, all SSRIs should be slowly tapered when discontinued because of risk of withdrawal effects. Because medication RCTs for depression in adolescents generally only included subjects with MDD, medication-specific guidelines apply only to fully expressed MDD.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility.

7.1. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI)

There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) in patients receiving fluoxetine in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and in patients who have recently discontinued fluoxetine and are then started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Therefore, fluoxetine should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see Contraindications (4)]. Since fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks perhaps longer, especially if fluoxetine has been prescribed chronically and/or at higher doses should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2. CNS Acting Drugs

Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of fluoxetine and such drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3. Serotonergic Drugs

Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when fluoxetine is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's Wort [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The concomitant use of fluoxetine with SNRIs, SSRIs or tryptophan is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.4), (7.5)].

7.4. Triptans

There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of fluoxetine with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Fluoxetine [^b736fabb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Accumulation and Slow Elimination — The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, because fluoxetine's metabolism is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.

The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine.

The dose-outcome relationship for treatment response, dropout due to adverse effects, and dropout for any reason for all SSRIs after the dose equivalence conversion are presented in figure 2. The RR for efficacy gradually increased from 1.0 for placebo, to 1.24 (95% CI 1.18–1.30) for 20 mg, 1.27 (1.19–1.36) for 40 mg, and then showed a flat to decreasing trend through the higher doses (ie, 41–80 mg). Above 50 mg only a few doses were examined, resulting in less precise estimates with wider CIs in the upper dose range. The association between the dose and the dropouts due to adverse effects was linear to exponential, increasing from 1.0 for placebo, to 1.94 (95% CI 1.63–2.31) at 40 mg, and to 3.73 (2.42–5.76) at the upper limit of the licensed range (80 mg). The association between the dose and the dropouts for any reason, reflecting dropouts for lack of efficacy and low tolerability, indicates optimal acceptability in the lower range between 20 mg and 40 mg. The point estimates and their 95% CIs of RRs and risk differences (RDs) for response, dropouts due to adverse effects, and dropouts for any reason at 10–80 mg of fluoxetine equivalents of SSRIs are presented in table 2.

Introduction

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The number of people living with depression increased by around 18% between 2005 and 2015, and depression affects 322 million people, or about 4% of the world's population. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are the two mainstays of depression treatment. In particular, second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the first-line options in the pharmacological management of major depression.

However, there is still uncertainty about the dose dependency and optimal target dose of second-generation agents. Current practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations: the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline in UK states that no dose dependency has been established within the therapeutic range of SSRIs, whereas the American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline recommends titration up to the maximum tolerated dose: "Initial doses should be incrementally raised as tolerated until a therapeutic dose is reached… doses of antidepressant medications should be maximized, side effects permitting". Systematic and comprehensive reviews of the literature examining dose dependency of antidepressants should clarify the issue and inform the guideline recommendations. Unfortunately, the available reviews are few and their conclusions disagree. Moreover, they addressed mainly dose-efficacy relationships and gave little attention to the balance between efficacy, tolerability, and overall acceptability of treatment.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay in the pharmacological management of major depression; however, current practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations as to their optimum target dose. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline in the UK states that no dose dependency has been established within the therapeutic range of SSRIs, whereas the American Psychiatric Association guideline recommends titration up to the maximum tolerated dose. We searched for reviews that analysed dose-response relationships for second-generation antidepressants in PubMed using the search terms "depressive disorder", "antidepressive agents, second-generation", and "dose-response relationship, drug", and in the references of the identified studies, up to March 21, 2019. We identified three systematic reviews: one concluded 21–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents provided maximum efficacy, another found 40–50 mg fluoxetine-equivalent dose category offered the greatest efficacy, and the third confirmed a linearly increasing dose-efficacy relationship from placebo, to low doses, to high doses of SSRIs. Only two studies examined dose dependency for adverse effects, and only one examined dose dependency for acceptability of treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^43fe8d78]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP guideline — SSRI switching, monitoring, discontinuation, and treatment duration in children and adolescents with depressive disorders notes that there is "no definitive empirical guidance for switching from one SSRI to another", and while tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second (with a fluoxetine washout) is the most conservative strategy, "Cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored". When a concerning adverse effect could be linked to medication, the dose "would be reduced", and if it persists, the medication "would be discontinued", with monitoring recommended and "no specific laboratory tests" in the absence of relevant comorbidities. For continuation, a generally accepted approach is to continue an effective dose for "approximately 6 to 12 months after remission", with discontinuation "during a relatively stress-free period", and longer maintenance "from more than 1 year to several years or longer" in higher-risk presentations. Discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or abrupt stopping of short-acting SSRIs "notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline", warranting "close adherence… and a slow discontinuation taper", whereas "fluoxetine… is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome" and has not shown withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^af137d6c]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Accumulation and slow elimination - The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, because fluoxetine's metabolism is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.

The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^cc60d03d]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To assess and clarify the relations between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dose efficacy, acceptability (early treatment discontinuation (dropouts)), and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects), and critically evaluate methods previously used to examine SSRI dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults.

Design

Systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration library, from 1975 to December 2021. Reference lists of national depression treatment guidelines were systemically searched by hand.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults (age ≥ 18 years) reporting efficacy, acceptability, or tolerability. Reviews meeting inclusion criteria had a high degree of heterogeneity, due to methodological diversity; therefore, a meta-narrative synthesis approach was applied. Standard daily doses were defined as 20mg citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine; 50mg sertraline; and 10mg escitalopram. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations.

Results

The search identified 9138 records; 387 full text reports were assessed for eligibility, 42 of which matched the inclusion criteria. The majority, 83% (n = 35), of reviews included data for studies with a duration of ≤ 12 weeks (ie, the acute phase of depression treatment). Of 39 reviews assessing efficacy, the majority (n = 26) indicated that individual SSRIs and SSRI class demonstrated flat dose-response effects; standard doses were optimal for efficacy. Acceptability or tolerability were assessed in 28 reviews. Higher than standard daily doses were associated with higher dropout rates and a greater incidence of adverse drug effects (eg, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety). Despite a range of methods being reported, there was an overall consensus regarding SSRI dose related efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects.

Conclusion

Standard daily doses of SSRIs for the treatment of depression in adults provide a favourable balance between efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. Patients are encouraged to talk to their prescriber or community pharmacist if they experience adverse effects or have any concerns about their drug treatments.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, also refer to the Adverse Reactions section of the package insert for olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules.

6.1. Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.

Multiple doses of fluoxetine had been administered to 10,782 patients with various diagnoses in US clinical trials as of May 8, 1995. In addition, there have been 425 patients administered fluoxetine in panic clinical trials. Adverse reactions were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a limited (i.e., reduced) number of standardized reaction categories.

In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that reactions reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it.

The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.

Critical evaluation of previous reviews

Most reviews indicated that SSRIs had a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and poorer acceptability and tolerability with higher doses for the treatment of depression. However, a range of methodological difficulties remain, which could explain some of the conflicting findings. Firstly, only a few reviews exclusively included or reported the effects of fixed dose studies, while the majority included flexible dose studies. A weakness of reviews including flexible dose studies is that it requires clinicians to make a judgment early in treatment to increase the dose, which creates additional placebo effects that might be associated with the dose change, sometimes after several weeks of treatment. This intervention could make drug response difficult or impossible to distinguish from spontaneous remission, because 50% of patients with clinical depression spontaneously remit within 12 weeks. Furthermore, increasing doses could fit with patient's expectations regarding dose effects, leading patients to receive higher than necessary doses, and potentially influencing the results of reviews using patient level data from flexible dose studies. Flexible dose studies might also select dose tolerant patients who are able to complete these studies, limiting generalisability and applicability to the wider population, and exposing patients to avoidable adverse drug effects. Newer reviews however, have compared the differences in effects between fixed and flexible dose studies, and report that no identifiable differences in efficacy between the groups, but that patients experience more adverse drug effects and dropouts with higher doses in both groups.

Secondly, dose standardisation and drug grouping techniques (eg, imipramine dose equivalents and fluoxetine dose equivalents) standardise individual drugs from different classes with different doses, or dose ranges, against the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine or the SSRI fluoxetine. Although standardisation might seem to have benefits, use of such grouping methods inadvertently oversimplifies antidepressant pharmacology, potentially missing differences between and within drug classes. It does not take account of, or even consider that, these grouping might be inappropriate. Unlike SSRIs that are highly specific for inhibiting serotonin transporter reuptake and increasing presynaptic serotonin levels, tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, and other non-SSRI antidepressants have mixed serotonin and non-serotonin (norepinephrine, dopamine, melatonin, muscarinic) effects that influence their dose-response efficacy and their adverse drug effect profiles. Therefore, grouping drugs with different dose-response characteristics might provide questionable findings. Nonetheless, a few of these reviews have also presented their findings for individual SSRIs that aid clarity and could help to better inform practitioners.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^83d79ab2]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — pediatric depression FDA approvals, dosing, and response timing — include that medications from the SSRI class marketed in the United States are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone, and currently only 2 SSRIs are FDA approved for depression in youth: fluoxetine for youth aged 8 years and older and escitalopram for youth aged 12 years and older; most SSRIs have long half-lives permitting single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine youth may require twice-daily dosing to avoid withdrawal side effects; modeling suggests early improvement with two-thirds of benefits by week 2 and maximal benefit by week 4, and this pharmacodynamic profile suggests that 2-month clinical SSRI trials may unnecessarily prolong an ineffective treatment if response or remission is not observed within the first 4 to 6 weeks.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^be9118f0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — SSRI discontinuation and switching highlight that a discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or acute discontinuation of shorter-acting SSRIs, notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline; accordingly, these medications warrant close adherence to the prescribed regimen and a slow discontinuation taper. In contrast, fluoxetine is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome and has not been associated with withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed. For switching, the most conservative approach would entail tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second, with a washout interval if the first SSRI is fluoxetine; cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored.

### Low dosage tricyclic antidepressants for depression [^a60b44d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Tricyclic antidepressants are still extensively prescribed worldwide. Evidence for the recommended dosage of tricyclics, however, is poor.

Objectives

To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression.

Search Strategy

Electronic search of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966-), EMBASE (1980-), CINAHL (1982-), PsycLIT (1974-), PSYNDEX (1977-) and LILACS (1982–1999) and hand searches of major psychiatric and medical journals. Reference search and SciSearch of the identified studies. Personal contact with authors of significant papers.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials 1) comparing low dosage TCA (= < 100 mg/d on average at the end of trial) with placebo or 2) comparing low and standard dosages of the same TCA, in acute phase treatment of depressive disorder

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers examined eligibility of the identified studies, and extracted data for outcomes at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6–8 weeks and later. Main outcome measures were relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors' definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression according to the last-observation-carried-forward intention-to-treat method, and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Other outcome measures included worst-case-scenario intention-to-treat analysis of response as defined above (in which dropouts were considered non-responders in the active treatment group and as responders in the comparison group), and standardised weighted mean scores of continuous depression severity scales (usually calculated by last-observation-carried-forward method).

Main Results

35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6–8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of varying dosages.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^475bf3f7]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for fluoxetine should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

It should be noted that fluoxetine is approved in the pediatric population only for Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

Safety and effectiveness of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^3931f779]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) after stroke — time to effect, dosing, adverse effects, patient preferences, and evidence quality are summarized as follows: Interim analyses showed improvement at day 30 and day 45, but differences were not statistically significant until day 90, and if a significant motor benefit occurs it likely takes at least three months; studies were relatively short (three to six months), making durability of FMA score benefit difficult to assess. Maintenance doses were relatively low (fluoxetine 20 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day) and within safe dosing limits for adults older than 60. Adverse events data were mixed: one review did not report significant differences versus placebo, while another reported higher incidence in the fluoxetine group than placebo of hyponatremia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.01), seizure (OR: 1.46), and fracture (OR: 2.34). A rare but serious adverse effect is bleeding when combined with antithrombotic therapy; assessment of risk should be made, particularly if the patient is on an antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or both. More common (at least 10% reported incidence) but less serious side effects include insomnia, anxiety, headache, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and dry mouth. Patient preferences vary; some might already be prescribed an SSRI or be candidates for an antidepressant and might be able to obtain two benefits from one medication, whereas others might wish to avoid an antidepressant due to stigma or might not prefer adding another oral medication; SSRIs are prescription medications but are easily accessible because many providers are familiar with their use. The evidence for this recommendation was categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low with limitations including small sample size and short duration.

### International committee on mental health in cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety [^52b6db1c]. Thorax (2016). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — pharmacologic management of depression and anxiety prioritizes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are recommended by virtually all published guidelines as first-line medications for both depression and anxiety; among options, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are described as more likely to be available inexpensively, covered by health plans, have regulatory approvals in a variety of age groups and minimise the potential for medication interactions and side effects. Because the pharmacokinetics of medications may be altered in cystic fibrosis (CF), optimal dose adjustment requires close monitoring of therapeutic benefits, adverse effects and medical status; dose reduction may be required in individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, treatment-emergent adverse effects or drug–drug interactions, whereas dose increases may be required for those with impaired absorption or enhanced hepatic metabolism, partial response to treatment or drug–drug interactions, and therapeutic drug monitoring of blood levels, when available, may supplement clinical monitoring. Clinicians should address the medical and psychiatric history and ensure that patients are informed of medications used for CF; when used with lumacaftor, the doses of citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline may need to be increased. Linezolid is not recommended for use with serotonergic antidepressants when alternatives are readily available; when both are clinically necessary, the lowest effective doses should be used, with informed consent and monitoring for serotonin syndrome. QTc prolongation is more likely with citalopram than other SSRIs, and electrocardiogram (EKG) and electrolyte monitoring can be considered when simultaneous use of multiple medications known to prolong the QTc is clinically necessary.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^6a324b8d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation evidence across psychotropic medication classes

In the following section, we examine the three key clinical discontinuation questions (summarized in Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of the major discontinuation evidence across medication classes.

Antidepressants

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Continuing antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who responded to acute treatment halves the relapse risk compared to placebo (from 40 to 20%), in both specialized and primary care. The most recent meta-analysis on this topic found that the number needed to treat (NNT) was 6, favouring continuation of antidepressants. A landmark study pointed in the same direction in the context of primary care. An important limitation of double-blind placebo-controlled discontinuation studies is their relatively short follow-up period (study duration averaging 40 weeks) and often rapid or abrupt antidepressant discontinuation, although the absolute relapse risk gradually decreases over time in discontinued patients.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

DS of antidepressants include a range of somatic (e.g. nausea, dizziness) and psychological (e.g. irritability, low mood) symptoms, and are summarized using the FINISH acronym, which stands for Flu-like symptoms, Insomnia, Nausea, Imbalance, Sensory disturbances, and Hyperarousal (anxiety/agitation). DS in SSRIs were found to be higher in both surveys of selected populations and open-label studies (55%), than in double-blind studies (30%), possibly due to smaller nocebo effects in double-blind studies and selection bias in surveys. DS especially occur during treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs that have relatively short elimination half-lives (< 24 h), such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, though other mechanisms unrelated to elimination contribute as well. For example, paroxetine has strong affinity for the M 1 receptor and also inhibits its own metabolism (just like fluvoxamine and fluoxetine). Abrupt discontinuation leads to higher DS incidence rates (35–100%) compared to tapering over several weeks (42–56%) for paroxetine. Conversely, fluoxetine has an elimination half-life of around 5 days (active metabolite 4–16 days), and is generally associated with fewer DS. It is hypothesized that most DS coincide with the largest reductions in serotonin transporter (SERT) occupancy, which particularly occur at lower doses. DS generally quickly resolve after dose increases or reinstatement of the antidepressant, which can aid in distinguishing DS from relapse.

### Venlafaxine [^f12b2e68]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Events

A comparison of adverse event rates in a fixed-dose study comparing venlafaxine tablets 75, 225, and 375 mg/day with placebo revealed a dose dependency for some of the more common adverse events associated with venlafaxine tablets use, as shown in the table that follows. The rule for including events was to enumerate those that occurred at an incidence of 5% or more for at least one of the venlafaxine groups and for which the incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence for at least one venlafaxine tablets group. Tests for potential dose relationships for these events (Cochran-Armitage Test, with a criterion of exact 2-sided p-value ≤ 0.05) suggested a dose-dependency for several adverse events in this list, including chills, hypertension, anorexia, nausea, agitation, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, yawning, sweating, and abnormal ejaculation.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: dose-response relationship of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in major depressive disorder [^2de6c038]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous studies suggested that the treatment response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in major depressive disorder follows a flat response curve within the therapeutic dose range. The present study was designed to clarify the relationship between dosage and treatment response in major depressive disorder.

Method

The authors searched PubMed for randomized placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of SSRIs for treating adults with major depressive disorder. Trials were also required to assess improvement in depression severity at multiple time points. Additional data were collected on treatment response and all-cause and side effect-related discontinuation. All medication doses were transformed into imipramine-equivalent doses. The longitudinal data were analyzed with a mixed-regression model. Endpoint and tolerability analyses were analyzed using meta-regression and stratified subgroup analysis by predefined SSRI dose categories in order to assess the effect of SSRI dosing on the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs for major depressive disorder.

Results

Forty studies involving 10,039 participants were included. Longitudinal modeling (dose-by-time interaction = 0.0007, 95% CI = 0.0001–0.0013) and endpoint analysis (meta-regression: β = 0.00053, 95% CI = 0.00018–0.00088, z = 2.98) demonstrated a small but statistically significant positive association between SSRI dose and efficacy. Higher doses of SSRIs were associated with an increased likelihood of dropouts due to side effects (meta-regression: β = 0.00207, 95% CI = 0.00071–0.00342, z = 2.98) and decreased likelihood of all-cause dropout (meta-regression: β = -0.00093, 95% CI = -0.00165 to -0.00021, z = -2.54).

Conclusions

Higher doses of SSRIs appear slightly more effective in major depressive disorder. This benefit appears to plateau at around 250 mg of imipramine equivalents (50 mg of fluoxetine). The slightly increased benefits of SSRIs at higher doses are somewhat offset by decreased tolerability at high doses.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^9be97b70]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.3 Dependence

Fluoxetine has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the premarketing clinical experience with fluoxetine did not reveal any tendency for a withdrawal syndrome or any drug seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of fluoxetine (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).

### A comparison of the risk of QT prolongation among SSRIs [^990a016a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report QT prolongation potential in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in order to advise clinicians on safe use of SSRIs other than citalopram in light of citalopram warnings.

Data Sources

Primary literature and case reports were identified through a systematic search. Data from drug manufacturers, package inserts, and the ArizonaCERT database were also utilized.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies and case reports were included.

Data Synthesis

Studies demonstrate possible dose-related clinically significant QT prolongation with escitalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline at traditional doses demonstrate a lack of clinically significant increases in QTc in the majority of studies. Further, paroxetine monotherapy shows a lack of clinically significant QTc prolongation in all studies. However, case reports or reporting tools still link these SSRIs with QTc prolongation. Fluoxetine, escitalopram, and sertraline used in post-acute coronary syndrome patients did not demonstrate risk of QTc prolongation.

Conclusion

For clinicians who choose not to use citalopram due to recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations, other antidepressants within this class may be considered. When citalopram is not utilized based on risk factors for TdP, use of escitalopram is not likely the safest alternative. Based on current literature, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline appear to have similar, low risk for QT prolongation, and paroxetine appears to have the lowest risk. However, there are significant limitations in interpreting the studies, including varying definitions of significant QT prolongation. Therefore, choice of an alternative SSRI should be based on individual risk factors for arrhythmias and other patient-specific factors.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation strategy note common, often transient side effects and a titration approach to mitigate early anxiety. Most SSRIs are generally well-tolerated but can cause nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, agitation or anxiety, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction, with most dissipating over time except sexual dysfunction; some patients report an initial exacerbation of agitation or anxiety that is often mitigated by starting with half of the lowest dose and gradually up-titrating over 4–10 days. Many experts consider dose titration to be a best practice for initiating treatment for perinatal depression, and activating antidepressants such as fluoxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion may exacerbate anxiety symptoms, so in someone with moderate-to-severe comorbid anxiety, alternatives to these medications should be considered when appropriate.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^56014466]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

In 2016, Jakubovski and colleaguesfound a statistically significantly greater response for high doses in a meta-regression analysis of 40 studies comparing SSRIs with placebo (n = 10 039); an accompanying editorialconcluded, "there is a modest but clear dose-response effect for SSRIs". However, when the findings were categorised into less than 20 mg, 20–39 mg, 40–50 mg, and more than 50 mg fluoxetine equivalents, the authors found the 40–50 mg dose category offered the greatest efficacy (ie, there was no general linear relationship between dose and efficacy over the whole dose range). Moreover, a majority of their included studies were flexible-dose studies and they took the maximum of the flexible range as the dose representing the treatment groups.

Our dose-dependency curves were based on models using splines, which treated dose as a continuous variable, and shed new light on the existing evidence. Our results for dose-efficacy relationships for SSRIs are largely in line with Bollini and colleagues. Hieronymus and colleagues'observation that there was a stepwise increase in efficacy from placebo, to low dose, to higher dose of SSRIs might be considered compatible with our finding of dose response up to 20–40 mg of fluoxetine equivalents; however, their categorisation of doses did not capture the change points identified in our analyses. Jakubovski and colleagues'conclusion that 40–50 mg of fluoxetine equivalents offered the greatest efficacy might be overstated if we take into account that most of their included studies used flexible-dose regimens and the prescribed doses could be significantly lower than 40–50 mg.

### Fluoxetine exposures: are they safe for children? [^cbd40885]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Although it is generally believed that unintentional ingestions of fluoxetine by children are relatively safe, there are no large published studies supporting this concept. The goal of this retrospective study is to determine the signs and symptoms of these children. Inclusion criteria included fluoxetine exposures from six certified regional poison centers: < 6 years old, known amount, single substance, 20 mg or more ingested, and follow up done to determine outcome. One hundred twenty cases met all inclusion criteria. Average age was 25 months ± 12 months. Median amount ingested was 20 mg. Mild signs and symptoms were noted in 3.3%, and no major signs or symptoms were reported. In 48 cases, a milligram per kilogram dose was calculated, and the median dose ingested was 2.26 mg/kg. In 92% of the cases, the amount ingested was 60 mg or below. These children will have no adverse effects or only minimal effects and require no emergency treatment or gastric decontamination.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

SSRIs act by selective blockade of the presynaptic 5-HT transporter, boosting 5-HT neurotransmission and consequently stimulating intestinal transit; however, by not acting on NA receptors, SSRIs do not treat pain. Their primary serotonergic effect, without noradrenergic effect, leads to more significant expected benefits in treating anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobic-related behaviors. They can be added to a TCA or SNRI in low doses when anxiety is dominant. Similarly SSRIss may be used instead of a TCA to manage a patient with IBS-C when pain is not dominant. SSRI are more likely to cause diarrhea, while TCAs tend to be constipating due to their NA effect.

The SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Although all act on 5-HT reuptake inhibition, each of them has specific pharmacologic properties, like greater 5-HT2C antagonism of fluoxetine and greater anticholinergic action of paroxetine, so unlike the other SSRIs, paroxetine may produce constipation.

Sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram tend to have the fewest pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they exhibit minimal effects on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, however, have an increased risk of pharmacokinetic drug interactions through their strong inhibition of the P450 isoenzymes 1A2 and 2D6; therefore, they should be administered with caution when used in conjunction with TCAs and beta-blockers like metoprolol, opioids, lithium, tryptophan and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

SSRIs are first-line pharmacologic agents for treating anxiety disorders, but they have the potential to induce restlessness and exacerbate anxiety when the drug is initiated. They are typically initiated at half of the usual starting dose to minimize these potential anxiogenic adverse effects. The dose may gradually increase to the regular starting dose after about 1 week (Table 3). The higher effect of the SSRI is usually delayed 3–4 weeks, which may represent a problem for those patients with significant anxiety that is complicating treatment and causing significant functional impairment. A useful strategy for this situation is to schedule a long-acting benzodiazepine to temporarily bridge this lag time and provide symptomatic relief for the patient's anxiety symptoms. The benzodiazepine should then be tapered after about 4 weeks of SSRI treatment.

SSRI dose range

Other side effects of SSRIs are agitation, sleep disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, night sweats, headache, weight loss, and sexual dysfunction.

### A mega-analysis of fixed-dose trials reveals dose-dependency and a rapid onset of action for the antidepressant effect of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^4b9e28d6]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The observation of a significant difference between active drug and placebo in reducing depressed mood (but not HDRS-17-sum) as early as after 1 week is in line with previous data regarding another SSRI, fluvoxamine, but contrasts to the common view that SSRIs require 2 weeks or more to exert any antidepressant effect. Although the symptom reduction observed after 1 week is small, and of questionable clinical relevance, it is of considerable theoretical interest as it casts doubt on the assumption that a likely mechanism of action of the SSRIs is one that requires prolonged administration, such as, for example, the formation of new nerve cells. Instead, our data suggest the antidepressant effect to be the result of a process that, although gradual and sluggish, is manifested already within the first week of treatment, a view gaining support also by studies addressing the influence of SSRIs on emotional processing. In this context, it should be noted that there are, in fact, a number of previous studies suggesting SSRIs to outperform placebo within a week also with respect to reducing HDRS-17-sum.

This study has certain limitations. One such is that not all SSRIs were included for reasons presented above. This drawback, however, does not preclude the major conclusions of the study, that is, that the antidepressant effect of SSRIs, in contrast to what has been claimed by others, may display a dose–response relationship, and that at least some SSRIs outperform placebo already after 1 week of treatment. A second limitation is that we had no possibility to relate serum levels of the given compound with response as such analyses unfortunately are seldom included in this kind of company-sponsored trials. It should also be noted that the fixed-dose design of the included trials does not allow for any definite conclusion regarding the possible benefit of increasing the dose in a subgroup of patients who have failed to respond to a given dose. Finally, for the individual patient, the possible benefit of giving a higher dose must, needless to say, be weighed against the possible drawback of a greater side effect burden; while the aim of this study was to shed light on the possible association between dose and efficacy, our analyses do not provide any information regarding the tolerability of higher doses as compared to lower.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^97b75d9f]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Literature inclusion process and data extraction

Article titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion. Subsequently, potentially relevant full text articles from the literature search were then screened for inclusion by a structured process and standard terms supporting inclusion and exclusion. Studies that did not meet the criteria outlined above were excluded.

We extracted the following data for each review article using a standardised data collection form specifically designed and tested for this systematic review: review characteristics (eg, lead author, type of review, protocol driven review, patient level data or not, type of depression being treated, review setting in primary or secondary care), antidepressant and comparator information (eg, SSRI used, fixed or flexible dose study, placebo controlled, dose standardisation technique, treatment duration), and dose-response effects (eg, efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects).

Risk-of-bias assessment

Each review article was assessed according to the ROBIS (risk of bias in systematic reviews) tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations. Reviews were assessed by CFJ using ROBIS and checked by SM. The ROBIS tool has been specifically developed and designed to assess reviews within healthcare settings, and has three phases: assessment of relevance, identification of concerns with the review process, and judgment of risk of bias. The second phase covers four domains: study eligibility criteria, identification and selection of studies, data collection and study appraisal, and synthesis of findings. The third phase assesses overall risk of bias (low, high, unclear) from interpretation of review findings, and considers limitations identified in any of the domains in the second phase.

No consensus exists on how best to assess and deal with overlap (ie, duplication), where primary studies are included more than once across two or more reviews that might bias findings; although a range of methods have been applied (such as only including meta-analysis or reviews assessed as being at low risk of bias), these could lead to loss of information. In order to avoid loss of information, and to demonstrate the diversity of reviews that met inclusion criteria, we conducted a subanalysis assessing the corrected covered area (CCA) for reviews assessed as being at low risk of bias. A citation matrix and pairwise CCA were calculated and tabulated according to Cochrane guidance. Grading was applied, as previously defined by Pieper et al. Similarly, no consensus exists regarding sensitivity analysis and how best assess sensitivity of findings; therefore, findings from the CCA analysis were analysed to identify discordant review findings and assess differences.

### Acute fluoxetine modulates emotional processing in young adult volunteers [^04087125]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoxetine is generally regarded as the first-line pharmacological treatment for young people, as it is believed to show a more favourable benefit:risk ratio than other antidepressants. However, the mechanisms through which fluoxetine influences symptoms in youth have been little investigated. This study examined whether acute administration of fluoxetine in a sample of young healthy adults altered the processing of affective information, including positive, sad and anger cues.

Method

A total of 35 male and female volunteers aged between 18 and 21 years old were randomized to receive a single 20 mg dose of fluoxetine or placebo. At 6 h after administration, participants completed a facial expression recognition task, an emotion-potentiated startle task, an attentional dot-probe task and the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Subjective ratings of mood, anxiety and side effects were also taken pre- and post-fluoxetine/placebo administration.

Results

Relative to placebo-treated participants, participants receiving fluoxetine were less accurate at identifying anger and sadness and did not show the emotion-potentiated startle effect. There were no overall significant effects of fluoxetine on subjective ratings of mood.

Conclusions

Fluoxetine can modulate emotional processing after a single dose in young adults. This pattern of effects suggests a potential cognitive mechanism for the greater benefit:risk ratio of fluoxetine in adolescent patients.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^aecea6b8]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

As with other SSRIs, decreased weight gain has been observed in association with the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescent patients. After 19 weeks of treatment in a clinical trial, pediatric subjects treated with fluoxetine gained an average of 1.1 cm less in height and 1.1 kg less in weight than subjects treated with placebo. In addition, fluoxetine treatment was associated with a decrease in alkaline phosphatase levels. The safety of fluoxetine treatment for pediatric patients has not been systematically assessed for chronic treatment longer than several months in duration. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the longer-term effects of fluoxetine on the growth, development, and maturation of children and adolescent patients. Therefore, height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Fluoxetine is approved for use in pediatric patients with MDD and OCD [see Box Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Anyone considering the use of fluoxetine in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.

Significant toxicity, including myotoxicity, long-term neurobehavioral and reproductive toxicity, and impaired bone development, has been observed following exposure of juvenile animals to fluoxetine. Some of these effects occurred at clinically relevant exposures.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^6c7b1feb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

If you take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, you should not take any other medicines that contain:

olanzapine (the active ingredient in Zyprexa®and Zyprexa Zydis®) or
fluoxetine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in Prozac®, and Sarafem®).

You could take too much medicine (overdose).

How should I take Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules?

Take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may need to change (adjust) the dose of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules until it is right for you.
If you miss a dose of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules at the same time.
To prevent serious side effects, do not stop taking Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules suddenly. If you need to stop taking Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, your doctor can tell you how to safely stop taking it.
If you take too much Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, call your doctor or poison control center right away, or get emergency treatment.
Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules can be taken with or without food.
Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are usually taken one time each day, in the evening.
If you do not think you are getting better or have any concerns about your condition while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, call your doctor.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e5c15b57]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder highlights practical dosing and response expectations: for most patients, "the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer", yet "for patients who are worried about side effects, the medication can be started at half the listed dose or less", and many SRIs "are available in liquid form or in pills that can be split". Lower initial doses and gradual titration "may also be needed in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders", and in the elderly "lower starting doses of medication and a more gradual approach to dose increase are often advisable". "Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks" and some responders may show "little improvement for as many as 10–12 weeks". Trial data "suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief", and "some patients… may benefit from even higher doses than those shown in the last column of Table 3", in which case "the patient should be closely monitored for side effects, including the serotonin syndrome"; moreover, patients "who have not responded to a known effective dose after 10–12 weeks may respond at higher doses".

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^835f79f0]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder — choosing a specific pharmacological treatment — clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, are recommended; although meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not support this impression; because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial; although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one medication and not to another; in choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider the safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions.

### Problems associated with long-term treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^c13f78d0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are now widely used as a first-line treatment for depression and many other psychiatric conditions, are generally well tolerated, they are not devoid of side effects. Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patient's quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode. This article is an overview of the more common adverse events, which are seen with non-acute treatment with the SSRIs.

2.7. Dosing in Specific Populations

Treatment of pregnant Women During the Third Trimester –When treating pregnant women with fluoxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and potential benefits of treatment. Neonates exposed to SNRIs or SSRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. The physician may consider tapering fluoxetine in the third trimester [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Geriatrics) – A lower or less frequent dosage should be considered for the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]

Hepatic Impairment) – As with many other medications, a lower or less frequent dosage should be used in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Concomitant Illness) – Patients with concurrent disease or on multiple concomitant medications may require dosage adjustments [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Fluoxetine and Olanzapine in Combination) – The starting dose of oral olanzapine 2.5 to 5 mg with fluoxetine 20 mg should be used for patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, patients with hepatic impairment, or patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow the metabolism of olanzapine or fluoxetine in combination (female gender, geriatric age, nonsmoking status), or those patients who may be pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. Dosing modifications may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow metabolism. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination have not been systematically studied in patients over 65 years of age or in patients less than 18 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) and Drug Interactions (7.9)].

2.8. Discontinuation of Treatment

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of fluoxetine, SNRIs, and SSRIs, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

### When should a trial of fluoxetine for major depression be declared failed? [^921062f9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Although the newer antidepressants are widely used, little is known about how long it takes to see their full effect. The authors sought to determine how many weeks a fluoxetine trial with no improvement should continue before treatment is changed.

Method

The data involved 840 patients in a 12-week open trial of fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, followed by a blinded, placebo-controlled discontinuation study. Outcomes at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks were classified as nonresponse, partial response, response, and remission and were based on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores. The rate of remission at week 12 was calculated for each group of patients without remission at the earlier time points. The time to relapse during weeks 13–26 of the discontinuation study was examined in patients taking placebo and fluoxetine in relation to status at week 6.

Results

Patients unimproved at week 6 had a remission rate at week 12 of 31%-41%. For patients with remission at week 12, level of improvement at week 6 did not affect prognosis in weeks 13–26. Of the unimproved patients at week 8, 23% had remissions by week 12. The week 12 remission rate for unimproved patients at week 4 was clearly high enough to justify continued treatment; the rate for unimproved patients at week 10 was too low.

Conclusions

These data suggest that nonresponse to fluoxetine should not be declared until 8 weeks of treatment have elapsed. Practitioners should discuss trial length with patients at the beginning of treatment.

### Factors associated with fluoxetine adherence among outpatients with common mental disorders in Western Kenya [^171d722d]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Treatment format: dispensing and duration

Fluoxetine treatment was initiated and monitored by trained clinical officers and nurses via eight treatment appointments occurring at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and then monthly until month 6. At the first treatment visit, participants were prescribed a daily dose of 20 mg capsule of fluoxetine. At each visit, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) was administered to assess the severity of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks. After 1 month, if there were no prohibitive side effects and the PHQ-2 had not improved from the prior visit and was not '0', then the dose was increased from 20 to 40 mg. If not, the participant continued with 20 mg of fluoxetine unless they had prohibitive side effects. At subsequent visits, if they did not have any prohibitive side effects and the PHQ-2 had not improved from the prior visit and was not '0', then the dose was increased by 20 mg from their previous visit up to a maximal dose of 60 mg. 99.4% (n = 5126) of delivered fluoxetine doses were 20 mg (the starting dose), 0.4% were 40 mg (n = 20) and 0.2% were 60 mg (n = 10). If participants missed or delayed treatment visits and subsequently returned to the study, they were dispensed medication as indicated and scheduled for return, but the duration of study treatment was not lengthened, so it was not possible for them to receive all 180 daily dosages of medication (6 months).

Adolescent major depressive disorder — additional pharmacotherapy guidance for initial treatment notes that information is lacking regarding other medication options for adolescents; thus, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care. This is a Conditional recommendation for use, and the stated rationale is that the recommendation is due to safety concerns such as increased suicide risk for adolescents when using other medications.

### Antidepressant use and risk of cardiovascular outcomes in people aged 20 to 64: cohort study using primary care database [^57acf76d]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications and future research

Prescription of antidepressants is a complex process, involving balancing of risks and benefits for different antidepressants and doses, accounting for severity of depression, and considering patients' risk factors, comorbidities, and preferences. The results of this study in adults aged 20 to 64 are reassuring in light of recent concerns about citalopram and potential risk of arrhythmia; however, as only small numbers of patients were treated with high doses of citalopram, we cannot rule out the possibility of an increased risk. We suggest that high doses of citalopram should not be prescribed without a strong indication, particularly in patients with any risk factors for an increased QT interval. We also found no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke/transient ischaemic attack in this age group; they may even be associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and arrhythmia, particularly for fluoxetine. The potential cardioprotective effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly fluoxetine, warrant further investigation.

The risk of arrhythmia was increased during the first 28 days of taking tricyclic and related antidepressants, and among the antidepressants studied lofepramine had the highest risks of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and stroke/transient ischaemic attack. This finding may reflect selective prescribing of lofepramine, as it is generally considered to be safer than other tricyclic and related antidepressants in overdose, but could also indicate increased risks when it is taken at doses typically prescribed in primary care. Further research using other designs such as the self controlled case series approach may help to elucidate this association.

Conclusions

This large observational study has found no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or stroke/transient ischaemic attack in people with depression aged 20 to 64, but some indication that they are associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and arrhythmia, particularly for fluoxetine. Citalopram was not significantly associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia, even at higher doses, although the confidence interval was wide. These findings are reassuring in light of recent safety concerns about selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### High-dose citalopram and escitalopram and the risk of out-of-hospital death [^9bf57c7a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies demonstrating that higher doses of citalopram (> 40 mg) and escitalopram (> 20 mg) prolong the corrected QT interval prompted regulatory agency warnings, which are controversial, given the absence of confirmatory clinical outcome studies. We compared the risk of potential arrhythmia-related deaths for high doses of these selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to that for equivalent doses of fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline.

Methods

The Tennessee Medicaid retrospective cohort study included 54,220 persons 30–74 years of age without cancer or other life-threatening illness who were prescribed high-dose SSRIs from 1998 through 2011. The mean age was 47 years, and 76% were female. Demographic characteristics and comorbidity for individual SSRIs were comparable. Because arrhythmia-related deaths are typically sudden and occur outside the hospital, we analyzed out-of-hospital sudden unexpected death as well as sudden cardiac deaths, a more specific indicator of proarrhythmic effects.

Results

The adjusted risk of sudden unexpected death for citalopram did not differ significantly from that for the other SSRIs. The respective hazard ratios (HRs) for citalopram versus escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.40–1.75), 1.24 (95% CI, 0.75–2.05), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.45–1.24), and 1.53 (95% CI, 0.91–2.55). There were no significant differences for sudden cardiac death or all study deaths, nor were there significant differences among high-risk patients (≥ 60 years of age, upper quartile baseline cardiovascular risk). Escitalopram users had no significantly increased risk for any study end point.

Conclusions

We found no evidence that risk of sudden unexpected death, sudden cardiac death, or total mortality for high-dose citalopram and escitalopram differed significantly from that for comparable doses of fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride (fluoxetine) [^aaef4edb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QT interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as Torsades de Pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. This risk is expected to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazine metabolism.

 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 — Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g. TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)].

### Memory loss in a patient treated with fluoxetine [^0dc9819a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severe memory loss in an elderly patient after initiation of fluoxetine.

Case Summary

An 87-year-old white woman was started on fluoxetine for depression, and the dose was titrated to 20 mg/d. She developed progressive memory loss over the next 6 weeks for which she ultimately was hospitalized. Other potential causes for her memory loss were ruled out. After fluoxetine was discontinued, the patient's memory improved significantly over the next 2 months. An objective causality assessment indicated a possible relationship between the memory loss and fluoxetine in this patient.

Discussion

Our report documents a case of severe reversible memory deterioration after initiating fluoxetine. Fluoxetine has a favorable adverse effect profile when compared with older classes of antidepressants. Postmarketing studies and isolated case reports, however, suggest that fluoxetine may harm memory in some patients. Some selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to cause memory loss more frequently than others.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of the possible effects of fluoxetine (and possibly other SSRIs) on memory.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^26b8722e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used for many years to manage depression and other mood disorders after stroke. The 2012 Cochrane Review of SSRIs for stroke recovery demonstrated positive effects on recovery, even in people who were not depressed at randomisation. A large trial of fluoxetine for stroke recovery (fluoxetine versus placebo under supervision) has recently been published, and it is now appropriate to update the evidence.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 16 July 2018), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, July 2018), MEDLINE (1946 to July 2018), Embase (1974 to July 2018), CINAHL (1982 July 2018), PsycINFO (1985 to July 2018), AMED (1985 to July 2018), and PsycBITE March 2012 to July 2018). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke survivors at any time within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, given at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. We excluded drugs with mixed pharmacological effects. The comparator was usual care or placebo. To be included, trials had to collect data on at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the trial early).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, type of stroke, time since stroke, our primary and secondary outcomes, and sources of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data from each trial. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) to estimate treatment effects for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous effects, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risks of bias and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified a total of 63 eligible trials recruiting 9168 participants, most of which provided data only at end of treatment and not at follow-up. There was a wide age range. About half the trials required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between trials. Only three of the included trials were at low risk of bias across the key 'Risk of bias' domains. A meta-analysis of these three trials found little or no effect of SSRI on either disability score: SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; P = 0.75; 2 studies, 2829 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or independence: RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; P = 0.99; 3 studies, 3249 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We downgraded both these outcomes for imprecision. SSRIs reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.11 lower, 0.19 lower to 0.04 lower; 2 trials, 2861 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a higher observed number of gastrointestinal side effects among participants treated with SSRIs compared to placebo (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.76; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 148 participants; moderate-quality evidence), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 0%). For seizures there was no evidence of a substantial difference. When we included all trials in a sensitivity analysis, irrespective of risk of bias, SSRIs appeared to reduce disability scores but not dependence. One large trial (FOCUS) dominated the results. We identified several ongoing trials, including two large trials that together will recruit more than 3000 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no reliable evidence that SSRIs should be used routinely to promote recovery after stroke. Meta-analysis of the trials at low risk of bias indicate that SSRIs do not improve recovery from stroke. We identified potential improvements in disability only in the analyses which included trials at high risk of bias. A further meta-analysis of large ongoing trials will be required to determine the generalisability of these findings.

### Tapering of SSRI treatment to mitigate withdrawal symptoms [^ef991365]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

All classes of drug that are prescribed to treat depression are associated with withdrawal syndromes. SSRI withdrawal syndrome occurs often and can be severe, and might compel patients to recommence their medication. Although the withdrawal syndrome can be differentiated from recurrence of the underlying disorder, it might also be mistaken for recurrence, leading to long-term unnecessary medication. Guidelines recommend short tapers, of between 2 weeks and 4 weeks, down to therapeutic minimum doses, or half-minimum doses, before complete cessation. Studies have shown that these tapers show minimal benefits over abrupt discontinuation, and are often not tolerated by patients. Tapers over a period of months and down to doses much lower than minimum therapeutic doses have shown greater success in reducing withdrawal symptoms. Other types of medication associated with withdrawal, such as benzodiazepenes, are tapered to reduce their biological effect at receptors by fixed amounts to minimise withdrawal symptoms. These dose reductions are done with exponential tapering programmes that reach very small doses. This method could have relevance for tapering of SSRIs. We examined the PET imaging data of serotonin transporter occupancy by SSRIs and found that hyperbolically reducing doses of SSRIs reduces their effect on serotonin transporter inhibition in a linear manner. We therefore suggest that SSRIs should be tapered hyperbolically and slowly to doses much lower than those of therapeutic minimums, in line with tapering regimens for other medications associated with withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms will then be minimised.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^0cb151a2]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Phenotype ascertainment

This study focuses on participant-reported antidepressant adverse side effects. Participants first confirmed they had taken any of the ten most commonly prescribed antidepressants in Australia (sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and paroxetine). For each antidepressant taken, participants were asked whether they had experienced side effects and, if they did, to select which from a checklist with the twenty-three most commonly reported antidepressant side effects, including reduced sexual drive or desire, weight gain, dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, sweating, headache, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, agitation, shaking, constipation, diarrhoea, suicide attempt, blurred vision, muscle pain, vomiting, weight loss, runny nose and rash.

Second-generation antidepressant dosing and trial durations — comparative adverse effects by agent: In trials, bupropion was used for 12–14 wk at 200–450 mg/d with a lower rate of sexual adverse events than escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline; citalopram was used for 8–20 wk at 20–40 mg/d with a possible increased risk for QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes at dosages > 40 mg/d; fluoxetine was used for 4–6 wk at 10–80 mg/d with the lowest rates of discontinuation syndrome compared with other SSRIs; paroxetine was used for 4–52 wk at 20–60 mg/d with the highest rates of sexual dysfunction among SSRIs, higher rates of weight gain, and the highest rates of discontinuation syndrome; and venlafaxine XR was used for 14 wk at 75–225 mg/d with higher rates of nausea and vomiting, higher rates of discontinuations due to adverse events than SSRIs as a class, and the highest rates of discontinuation syndrome. Common adverse effects associated with SGAs include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somnolence.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^472c7e2a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Weight Gain

Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered prior to starting olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients receiving olanzapine and fluoxetine should receive regular monitoring of weight.

Adults - In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, the mean weight increase for olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients was greater than placebo-treated patients [4 kg (8.8 lb) vs -0.3 kg (-0.7 lb)]. Twenty-two percent of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 6 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (1.8%). Approximately 3% of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (0%). Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.5% of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In long-term olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 6.7 kg (14.7 lb) (median exposure of 448 days, N = 431). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15% or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 66%, 33%, and 10%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1.2% of patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

### SSRI use during acute COVID-19 and risk of long COVID among patients with depression [^c9501a30]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We did not find evidence of heterogeneity of the relationship between SSRI use and Long COVID depending on SSRI type, which is consistent with previous findings. A previous study did not find a differential impact of moderate to high-affinity sigma 1 receptor agonist SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, and citalopram) versus non-high affinity SSRIs (sertraline and paroxetine) in their relationship with Long COVID. We caution readers to consider this finding in the context of a few limitations. Residual confounding due to indication, as different depressive symptomatology, comorbidities, side effects, and tolerance may lead providers to prescribe a specific SSRI over another SSRI. For instance, citalopram and paroxetine are often prescribed for obsessive–compulsive disorder, which may be associated with Long COVID symptoms. Furthermore, our analysis of paroxetine was limited by a small sample size of users (n = 7189). We also did not find evidence of a dose–response relationship between fluoxetine and Long COVID. This may be explained due to a large proportion of missingness of dose information leading to a small functional sample size. Future studies should further explore the possibility of a dose–response relationship.

Strengths and limitations

A strength of this study is its large, national sample size of patients and the broad range of high-dimensional data that we included via N3C. This rich data source allows us to construct a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of a depressive condition, assess their SSRI use at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and evaluate their probability of Long COVID diagnosis. Furthermore, the documentation of comorbidities, sociodemographic information, and other medical history allows for rigorous multivariate adjustment.

A second strength of this study is the analytic methods that we applied. A Targeted Learning approach, involving Super Learner and targeted maximum likelihood estimation, allows for efficient and flexible estimation while making minimal parametric assumptions. With this large sample size of high-dimensional data, this allows us to aggressively reduce bias due to measured, potentially high-dimensional confounding and to do so with nearly no model assumptions. These methods allowed us to intervene on participant observation during the outcome window, which is an important driver of differential outcome ascertainment. Furthermore, nonparametric sensitivity analyses allowed us to determine the extent to which our results are vulnerable to bias. Cumulatively, these methods provide a replicable framework for investigators to conduct rigorous observational analyses using electronic health record databases such as N3C.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^225c7fbc]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Depression in athletes — management and treatment considerations — emphasizes early recognition and team-based care, stating that health care providers should recognize that a concern about "performance", whether reported by an athlete or a coach, might be a symptom of depression or anxiety, and that unrecognized or undertreated depression can delay return to play. For the athlete with depression, there should be a multidisciplinary team approach; the team may include an MH care provider, a team physician, an AT, and family and coaching staff. When considering medication, prescribers should be aware of medications that may have a potential negative impact on performance and should also be familiar of side effects that may place an athlete at increased risk, including weight gain, sedation, and adverse cardiac effects; the health care team should also be aware of performance-enhancing effects, banned classes, and documentation needs, and a conservative approach to prescribing medication for depression is preferable. In an athlete without comorbid anxiety, bupropion can be considered; fluoxetine may be helpful if there is a comorbid ED, and there is some research that supports that fluoxetine does not have a negative impact on performance; other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be reasonable options, and if there is an anxiety comorbidity clinicians could also consider SSRIs such as citalopram, sertraline, or fluoxetine. Nonpharmacological treatment can play a critical role; cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness have all been used, none have been shown to be more effective than others in athletes, and the nonpharmacological approach should be tailored to the individual athlete and their clinical situation.

Patient characteristics at randomisation by allocated treatment

The primary measure of adherence was the estimated duration of study medication (interval in days from first to last dose of study medication) based on all available data, including a capsule count, which was available in 398 (25%) of 1564 patients allocated fluoxetine, and 410 (26%) of 1563 allocated placebo. Patients returned a median of 32 capsules (IQR 10–135) in the fluoxetine group and 33 (11–139) in the placebo group. Our primary measure of adherence was available in 1417 (91%) patients in each group. The median duration of treatment was 185 days (IQR 149–186) in the fluoxetine group, and 183 days (136–186) in the placebo group. The median delay between randomisation and first dose was 0 days (IQR 0–1) in both treatment groups. 1519 (97%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 1494 (96%) in the placebo group received their first dose by day 2 after randomisation. The number and proportion of patients meeting our eligibility criteria and with different levels of adherence to the study medication are shown in the appendix. 143 (9%) patients in the fluoxetine group stopped the trial medication because of perceived adverse effects within the first 90 days compared with 122 (8%) in the placebo group. Around two-thirds of patients took the study medication for at least 150 days.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^e8a02394]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The risks of using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. The drug-drug interactions sections of fluoxetine and olanzapine are applicable to olanzapine and fluoxetine. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.2 CNS Acting Drugs

Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of olanzapine and fluoxetine and other CNS-active drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with olanzapine and fluoxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of olanzapine and fluoxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics. Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when olanzapine and fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with fluoxetine treatment.

Symptoms of sexual dysfunction occasionally persist after discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment.

Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs.

While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, healthcare providers should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.

Other Reactions

Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with fluoxetine in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2) for which a drug cause was remote, (3) which were so general as to be uninformative, (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.

### Fluoxetine versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^a67bf52a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in primary care and is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, thus creating significant demands on service providers. The antidepressant fluoxetine has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison with other conventional and unconventional antidepressants. However, these studies have produced conflicting findings. Other systematic reviews have considered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) as a group which limits the applicability of the indings for fluoxetine alone. Therefore, this review intends to provide specific and clinically useful information regarding the effects of fluoxetine for depression compared with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamineoxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and newer agents, and other conventional and unconventional agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine in comparison with all other antidepressive agents for depression in adult individuals with unipolar major depressive disorder.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR)to 11May 2012. This register includes relevant RCTs from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. The pharmaceutical company marketing fluoxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs comparing fluoxetine with any other AD (including non-conventional agents such as hypericum) for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used) were included. For trials that had a cross-over design only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two review authors using a standard form. Responders to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: dropouts were always included in this analysis. When data on dropouts were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation, they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as treatment failures. Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed by including patients with a final assessment or with the last observation carried forward. Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study due to any causes and due to side effects or inefficacy. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

A total of 171 studies were included in the analysis (24,868 participants). The included studies were undertaken between 1984 and 2012. Studies had homogenous characteristics in terms of design, intervention and outcome measures. The assessment of quality with the risk of bias tool revealed that the great majority of them failed to report methodological details, like the method of random sequence generation, the allocation concealment and blinding. Moreover, most of the included studies were sponsored by drug companies, so the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be considered in interpreting the results. Fluoxetine was as effective as the TCAs when considered as a group both on a dichotomous outcome (reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Depression Scale) (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22, 24 RCTs, 2124 participants) and a continuous outcome (mean scores at the end of the trial or change score on depression measures) (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.14, 50 RCTs, 3393 participants). On a dichotomousoutcome, fluoxetine was less effective than dothiepin or dosulepin (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.20; number needed to treat (NNT) = 6, 95% CI 3 to 50, 2 RCTs, 144 participants), sertraline (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.74; NNT = 13, 95% CI 7 to 58, 6 RCTs, 1188 participants), mirtazapine (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.04; NNT = 12, 95% CI 6 to 134, 4 RCTs, 600 participants) and venlafaxine(OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 16, 12 RCTs, 3387 participants). On a continuous outcome, fluoxetine was more effective than ABT-200 (SMD -1.85, 95% CI -2.25 to -1.45, 1 RCT, 141 participants) and milnacipran (SMD -0.36, 95% CI-0.63 to -0.08, 2 RCTs, 213 participants); conversely, it was less effective than venlafaxine (SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0 to 0.19, 13 RCTs,3097 participants). Fluoxetine was better tolerated than TCAs considered as a group (total dropout OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96; NNT = 20, 95% CI 13 to 48, 49 RCTs, 4194 participants) and was better tolerated in comparison with individual ADs, in particular amitriptyline (total dropout OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85; NNT = 13, 95% CI 8 to 39, 18 RCTs, 1089 participants), and among the newer ADs ABT-200 (total dropout OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.39; NNT = 3, 95% CI 2 to 5, 1 RCT, 144 participants), pramipexole(total dropout OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42, NNT = 3, 95% CI 2 to 5, 1 RCT, 105 participants), and reboxetine (total dropout OR0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82, NNT = 9, 95% CI 6 to 24, 4 RCTs, 764 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

The present study detected differences in terms of efficacy and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain. Moreover, the assessment of quality with the risk of bias tool showed that the great majority of included studies failed to report details on methodological procedures. Of consequence, no definitive implications can be drawn from the studies' results. The better efficacy profile of sertraline and venlafaxine (and possibly other ADs) over fluoxetine may be clinically meaningful, as already suggested by other systematic reviews. In addition to efficacy data, treatment decisions should also be based on considerations of drug toxicity, patient acceptability and cost.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^b8130f8a]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Variability in medication response and tolerability may be inherited. For instance, genetic variation leading to changes in the function of antidepressant metabolising enzymes are believed to underlie side effects due to drug overexposure. Five to seven percent of European ancestry individuals are estimated to be poor CYP2D6 metabolisers, one of the major metabolising enzymes of fluoxetine, paroxetine and fluvoxamine. Furthermore, variants in genes such as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 have been linked to citalopramand sertralinedifferential metabolism and clearance. Metabolising enzymes are relevant hypotheses for understanding adverse side effects. Nonetheless, genetic variants within these enzymes have failed to reach significance in recent genome-wide association studies on treatment resistanceand response, suggesting that treatment outcomes might be more complex than previously thought. It is likely that genetic factors underlying antidepressant side effects are a product of drug-specific factors such as variation within drug-metabolising enzymes, as well as common (or non-drug-specific) factors, the nature of which remains elusive.

### Fluoxetine for adults who are overweight or obese [^3337bad6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluoxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor indicated for major depression. It is also thought to affect weight control: this seems to happen through appetite changes resulting in decreased food intake and normalisation of unusual eating behaviours. However, the benefit-risk ratio of this off-label medication is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine for overweight or obese adults.

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP Search Portal. The last date of the search was December 2018 for all databases, to which we applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of fluoxetine versus placebo, other anti-obesity agents, non-pharmacological therapy or no treatment in overweight or obese adults without depression, mental illness or abnormal eating patterns.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles for relevance. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed by one author and checked by the second. We assessed trials for the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. For additional information we contacted trial authors by email. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 1036 records, scrutinized 52 full-text articles and included 19 completed RCTs (one trial is awaiting assessment). A total of 2216 participants entered the trials, 1280 participants were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d) and 936 participants were randomly assigned to various comparison groups (placebo; the anti-obesity agents diethylpropion, fenproporex, mazindol, sibutramine, metformin, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, fluvoxamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptophan; no treatment; and omega-3 gel). Within the 19 RCTs there were 56 trial arms. Fifteen trials were parallel RCTs and four were cross-over RCTs. The participants in the included trials were followed up for periods between three weeks and one year. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low: the majority of trials had a high risk of bias in one or more of the risk of bias domains. For our main comparison group - fluoxetine versus placebo - and across all fluoxetine dosages and durations of treatment, the MD was -2.7 kg (95% CI -4 to -1.4; P < 0.001; 10 trials, 956 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -7.1 kg and 1.7 kg. The MD in body mass index (BMI) reduction across all fluoxetine dosages compared with placebo was -1.1 kg/m² (95% CI -3.7 to 1.4; 3 trials, 97 participants; very low certainty evidence). Only nine placebo-controlled trials reported adverse events. A total of 399 out of 627 participants (63.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 352 out of 626 participants (56.2%) receiving placebo experienced an adverse event. Random-effects meta-analysis showed an increase in the risk of having at least one adverse event of any type in the fluoxetine groups compared with placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.42; P = 0.07; 9 trials, 1253 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.74 and 1.88. Following fluoxetine treatment the adverse events of dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea were observed approximately twice as often compared to placebo. A total of 15 out of 197 participants (7.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 12 out of 196 participants (6.1%) receiving placebo experienced depression. The RR across all fluoxetine doses compared with placebo was 1.20 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.52; P = 0.62; 3 trials, 393 participants; very low certainty evidence). All-cause mortality, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects were not reported. The comparisons of fluoxetine with other anti-obesity agents (3 trials, 234 participants), omega-3 gel (1 trial, 48 participants) and no treatment (1 trial, 60 participants) showed inconclusive results (very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that off-label fluoxetine may decrease weight compared with placebo. However, low-certainty evidence suggests an increase in the risk for dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea following fluoxetine treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^a00282b5]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescribing and interactions include that concomitant administration of SSRIs with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome, SSRIs (especially citalopram) also may interact with drugs that prolong the QT interval, and fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline inactivate the enzymes that metabolize by CYP2D6, with fluvoxamine interacting with CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6; citalopram/escitalopram may have the least effect on CYP450 isoenzymes. Citalopram may cause QT prolongation with serious arrhythmias and sudden death at daily doses exceeding 40 mg/d and should be avoided in patients with long QT syndrome, paroxetine has been associated with increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to other SSRIs, and as noted below, fluvoxamine may have greater potential for drug–drug interactions. When starting a second non-MAOI serotonergic drug, caution entails starting at a low dose, increasing the dose slowly, and monitoring for symptoms, especially in the first 24 to 48 hours after dosage changes.

5.2 Serotonin Syndrome

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, meperidine, methadone, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of fluoxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate fluoxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking fluoxetine, discontinue fluoxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Monitor all patients taking fluoxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with fluoxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of fluoxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

Data acquisition

Patient-level data from all drug company-sponsored fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trials regarding the treatment of depression in adults that have been conducted for citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine and sertraline were requested from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK; paroxetine), Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA; fluoxetine), Lundbeck (Valby, Denmark; citalopram and escitalopram), Actavis (Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA; escitalopram) and Pfizer (New York, NY, USA; sertraline). Data for fluvoxamine were not requested, as it was deemed sufficient to include those SSRIs that are currently commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression. Whereas the manufacturers of citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline sent us the requested data, individual item data on fluoxetine were unfortunately not available in an electronic format and could hence not be delivered. Although we did obtain patient-level data also from the escitalopram trials conducted by Lundbeck, these were not relevant for this analysis since only one dose (10 mg) had been tested using a fixed-dose design. We have tried to obtain patient-level data from trials sponsored by the other company involved in the clinical trial program for escitalopram, that is, Forest, but the company that has since then acquired Forest, that is, Actavis, has unfortunately not been able to submit the requested information in electronic format. We confirmed that we had access to all pertinent studies regarding citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline by examining the Food and Drug Administration-approval packages for the relevant drugs.

Only two sertraline studies (PZ/101 and PZ/310) comprised a 400-mg dose, and these lasted for 4 weeks only; hence, no efficacy measures were available for this dosage beyond week 4. The polymeric matrix used in paroxetine-controlled-release (CR) releases ~80% of the active compound; the company hence used the doses 12.5 and 25 mg of paroxetine CR, assuming that they should correspond to 10 and 20 mg of paroxetine immediate-release. We have similarly assumed that patients medicating with paroxetine CR 12.5 or 25 mg per day received a daily paroxetine dose of 10 and 20 mg, respectively. None of the studies included a comparator SSRI given in a fixed-dose manner; therefore, for each study only data regarding one compound were obtained.

2.10 Use of Fluoxetine with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start fluoxetine in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see Contraindications (4.1)].

In some cases, a patient already receiving fluoxetine therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, fluoxetine should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for five weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with fluoxetine may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with fluoxetine is unclear. The healthcare provider should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### A mega-analysis of fixed-dose trials reveals dose-dependency and a rapid onset of action for the antidepressant effect of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^986b5e41]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Beyond the conclusion that doses of SSRIs below or at the lower end of the dose range usually recommended are inferior to higher doses, we caution against using our results for dosing recommendations, the number of patients given each dose of each compound being relatively low. In addition, it should be noted that the proportion of subjects given high and low doses differ between drugs; subjects given high doses of paroxetine were thus relatively few. Moreover, with respect to sertraline, only one of the three trials including the 50 mg dose lasted for 6 weeks. Taking these caveats into consideration, inspection of the data regarding the individual drugs (Figure 1), however, suggests that the effect of sertraline is likely to be augmented by dose escalation from the lowest recommended dose (50 mg), which is at odds with some previous reports. With respect to citalopram, a dose of 20 mg, which is a recommended dose in some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, but lower than the lowest recommended dose in the United States (40 mg), appeared less effective than doses of 40 mg and above; of note is however that citalopram doses higher than 40 mg should be avoided because of a possible risk for QTc prolongation. Paroxetine seems to display its maximum efficacy at the minimal recommended dose (20 mg), which is in line with a report suggesting that higher doses of this compound cause no further increase in serotonin transporter occupancy.

Whereas the pooled analyses revealed clear-cut differences between low (yet not ineffective) doses and higher ones, inspection of the dose–response curves for the individual drugs suggests these to plateau at 20 mg for paroxetine, 40 mg for citalopram and 100 mg for sertraline. These doses are all within the ranges generally recommended for the treatment of depression, e.g. by the FDA (sertraline: 50–200 mg, citalopram: 40 mg, paroxetine: 20–50 mg); however, for citalopram and sertraline, but not for paroxetine, they are higher than the World Health Organization's defined daily dose for moderately severe depression (sertraline: 50 mg, citalopram: 20 mg, paroxetine: 20 mg).

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^76fb1819]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination for treatment resistant depression in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

Anyone considering the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Olanzapine — Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children < 13 years of age have not been established.

Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents treated with oral olanzapine were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic aminotransferase levels.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

Fluoxetine — Juvenile animal toxicity studies were performed for fluoxetine alone. Significant toxicity on muscle tissue, neurobehavior, reproductive organs, and bone development has been observed following exposure of juvenile rats to fluoxetine from weaning through maturity. Oral administration of fluoxetine to rats from weaning postnatal day 21 through adulthood day 90 at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day was associated with testicular degeneration and necrosis, epididymal vacuolation and hypospermia (at 30 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures [AUC] approximately 5 to 10 times the average AUC in pediatric patients at the MRHD of 20 mg/day), increased serum levels of creatine kinase (at AUC as low as 1 to 2 times the average AUC in pediatric patients at the MRHD of 20 mg/day), skeletal muscle degeneration and necrosis, decreased femur length/growth and body weight gain (at AUC 5 to 10 times the average AUC in pediatric patients at the MRHD of 20 mg/day). The high dose of 30 mg/kg/day exceeded a maximum tolerated dose. When animals were evaluated after a drug-free period (up to 11 weeks after cessation of dosing), fluoxetine was associated with neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased reactivity at AUC as low as approximately 0.1 to 0.2 times the average AUC in pediatric patients at the MRHD and learning deficit at the high dose), and reproductive functional impairment (decreased mating at all doses and impaired fertility at the high dose). In addition, the testicular and epididymal microscopic lesions and decreased sperm concentrations found in high dose group were also observed, indicating that the drug effects on reproductive organs are irreversible. The reversibility of fluoxetine-induced muscle damage was not assessed.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The risks of using olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. The drug-drug interactions sections of fluoxetine and olanzapine are applicable to olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

[See Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.2 CNS Acting Drugs

Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and other CNS-active drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics. Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are initiated or discontinued.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^32e63e58]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): TCAs have numerous documented cardiovascular side effects, including sinus tachycardia and postural hypotension; they also prolong the duration of the QRS interval and QTc interval, and second- and third-degree heart block can develop. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a very low rate of adverse cardiovascular effects, and in prospective studies of patients with HF, post-MI, or unstable angina, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine had minimal to no effect on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic indices of cardiac function. However, in 2011 the FDA issued a safety announcement that citalopram should not exceed 40 mg/d because of the risk of dose-dependent QTc prolongation that could lead to TdP, and the FDA recommended avoiding use in patients with decompensated HF.

Regarding the use of fluoxetine hydrochloride DR PO in pregnant patients for third trimester: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for direct toxic effects of the drug, serotonin syndrome and discontinuation syndrome. The use of SSRIs in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and symptoms of poor adaptation in the neonate. The drug fluoxetine hydrochloride DR PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

Implementing pharmacotherapy — For most patients, the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer [I]. Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks after starting medication, and some will ultimately respond after 10–12 weeks. Medication doses may be titrated up weekly during the first month in increments recommended by the manufacturer [I], or when little or no symptom improvement is seen within 4 weeks of starting medication, the dose may be increased weekly or biweekly to the maximum dose comfortably tolerated and indicated [II], then continued at this dosage for at least 6 weeks [III]. Sexual side effects may be minimized by reducing the dose [II], waiting for symptoms to remit [II], trying a once-weekly, one-day "drug holiday" before sexual activity [II], switching to another SSRI [II], or adding a pharmacological agent such as bupropion [II]. The frequency of follow-up visits after a new pharmacotherapy is initiated may vary from a few days to two weeks and depends on severity, co-occurring conditions, suicidal ideation, and the likelihood of troubling side effects [I].

### Antidepressant side effects and their impact on treatment outcome in people with major depressive disorder: an iSPOT-D report [^34e59768]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Side effects to antidepressant medications are common and can impact the prognosis of successful treatment outcome in people with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have investigated the severity of side effects over the course of treatment and their association with treatment outcome. Here we assessed the severity of side effects and the impact of treatment type and anxiety symptoms over the course of treatment, as well as whether side effects were associated with treatment outcome. Participants were N = 1008 adults with a current diagnosis of single-episode or recurrent, nonpsychotic MDD. Participants were randomised to receive escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-extended release with equal probability and reassessed at 8 weeks regarding Hamilton Rating Scale Depression (HRSD 17) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR 16) remission and response. Severity of side effects were assessed using the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) scale and assessed at day 4 and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. Frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects were greatest at week 2, then only frequency and intensity of side effects gradually decreased up to week 6. Treatment type and anxiety symptoms did not impact the severity of side effects. A greater burden-but not frequency or intensity-of side effects was associated with poorer treatment outcome and as early as 4 days post-treatment. Together, this work provides an informative mapping of the progression of side effects throughout the treatment course and their association with treatment outcome. Importantly, the burden of side effects that are present as early as 4 days post-treatment predicts poorer treatment outcome and should be monitored closely. iSPOT-D: Registry name: ClinicalTrials.gov.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^9a2938fc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and adolescents — dosing and response patterns — generally permit single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine, youths may require twice-daily dosing; response may show statistically significant improvement within 2 weeks, clinically significant improvement by week 6, and maximal improvement by week 12 or later, supporting slow up-titration. Most adverse effects emerge within the first few weeks of treatment. At present, there is no clear role for pharmacogenomic testing in medication selection.

2.10 Use of Fluoxetine Capsules with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start fluoxetine capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
