## Question

Etiologies of abdominal pain in esrd patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of abdominal pain in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), organized by mechanism and modality, with attention to diagnostic and management considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how ESRD and dialysis modality reshape the differential. Then, I should categorize etiologies by pathophysiology. Next, I will prioritize life-threatening emergencies that must not be missed. After that, I will consider dialysis-modality–specific patterns. Finally, I will integrate diagnostic strategies, imaging choices, and pain management principles tailored to ESRD, while verifying where the evidence is strong versus limited.

> Let me first confirm the foundational premise: ESRD fundamentally alters the causes and presentation of abdominal pain compared with the general population, and the dominant etiologies differ between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), so I need to keep modality front and center as I build the differential [^114A9k2j].

> I will now examine vascular and ischemic causes, because these are disproportionately represented and often catastrophic in ESRD. Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is notably frequent in HD and can present with vague pain out of proportion to exam; I should maintain a high index of suspicion and proceed to CT angiography when concern exists, as labs can be misleading and delay is deadly [^114A9k2j] [^111kRbEc]. Wait, let me verify the imaging recommendation: triple-phase CT with non-contrast, arterial, and delayed phases is the modality of choice for mesenteric ischemia, which aligns with emergency care guidance in this population [^111kRbEc].

> Next, I should review spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage, which is a leading cause of acute abdomen in HD and carries high mortality. Spontaneous retroperitoneal or perinephric hematomas, including spontaneous renal hemorrhage in acquired cystic kidney disease, can present with flank or abdominal pain, hypotension, and falling hematocrit; CT has excellent sensitivity for retroperitoneal hematomas and active extravasation, and urgent intervention is often required [^114A9k2j] [^115ZPJdF]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence: these are largely observational and radiology series, but the signal is consistent across multiple reports and letters, so I will keep this high on the list for unstable HD patients with pain and anemia [^114A9k2j] [^115ZPJdF].

> Let me consider dialysis-specific mechanical and infectious complications in PD. PD-associated peritonitis remains the most frequent serious complication and should be suspected with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent; prompt effluent cell count, differential, and culture guide therapy, and delays increase mortality [^112tGRxa]. I need to check for rare pathogens too, such as Chryseobacterium indologenes or Histoplasma capsulatum, which have been reported and may require tailored antibiotics and catheter management [^112U9VqR] [^116tu6Ru]. But wait, what if the pain is positional or related to fills and drains? PD catheter–related pain, leaks, hernias, and hydrothorax can present with pain and should be differentiated from peritonitis using exam, imaging, and, when needed, peritoneography or pleural fluid analysis [^111sHEkg] [^113v1qRv].

> I should confirm the risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), a devastating late PD complication with progressive bowel encapsulation and high mortality. Early symptoms are nonspecific abdominal pain and distension; CT may show peritoneal calcifications, bowel wall thickening, and tethering, and management includes transfer to HD, nutritional support, and immunomodulation in select cases, ideally before extensive fibrosis develops [^116pJWjP] [^113EGHxV]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — early EPS can be radiographically subtle, so a high index of suspicion in long-term PD patients with persistent pain and distension is warranted [^116pJWjP].

> Now, I will review gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, which are common in ESRD and often silent or atypical. Endoscopic series show frequent erosions, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease, with H. pylori positivity in a majority, and many patients are asymptomatic despite significant lesions. Thus, unexplained anemia or pain should prompt endoscopic evaluation when stable [^1149S7uZ]. I should double-check medication contributors: sevelamer has been associated with recto-sigmoid ulcers and can mimic malignancy clinically and radiographically, so a careful medication history is essential [^113qbDxp].

> Let me think about pancreatitis, because enzyme interpretation is treacherous in ESRD. Lipase and amylase are renally cleared and may be normal despite pancreatitis. Therefore, clinical suspicion plus imaging, particularly contrast-enhanced CT, is decisive when pancreatitis is on the table, especially in PD where case series suggest a nontrivial risk and substantial mortality [^112PVo1E] [^113CkkGj]. I should confirm that normal enzymes do not exclude disease in this population, and I will not anchor on normal labs if the clinical picture fits [^112PVo1E].

> I need to ensure I include drug-induced and metabolic etiologies that masquerade as abdominal pain. Accumulation of renally cleared medications can precipitate mesenteric ischemia or severe dysmotility; atenolol toxicity with bradycardia and low-flow mesenteric ischemia has been described, and prolonged linezolid can cause lactic acidosis with abdominal pain and shock, so a meticulous medication reconciliation is mandatory [^115CKYPD] [^115ZiqQa]. But wait, what if the pain is uremic in origin? Uremic toxin–mediated gut inflammation and motility disturbances can produce diffuse abdominal pain and dysmotility, and although "uremic colitis" is rare, case series describe fulminant colonic necrosis in long-standing ESRD, reinforcing the need to consider ischemia and severe colitis in deteriorating patients [^114ugQXt] [^113zKFWA].

> Next, I should review structural and pressure-related causes unique to ESRD. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a leading cause of ESRD and often brings chronic or acute flank and abdominal pain from cyst hemorrhage, infection, or mass effect; pain patterns are common and can be multifocal, and cyst complications should be high on the list in ADPKD patients with new or changing pain [^114AaFGj] [^112JHQa7]. Let me verify that imaging is key here: ultrasound or CT can rapidly identify hemorrhagic cysts or infection, guiding drainage or analgesia as indicated [^notfound].

> I will now examine functional and motility disorders, which are prevalent yet underrecognized. Gastroparesis and delayed gastric emptying are common in ESRD and can drive early satiety, bloating, nausea, and upper abdominal pain; objective testing with scintigraphy or 13C breath tests can help when symptoms are severe or refractory, and guideline-based evaluation for alternative causes is prudent before labeling symptoms as primary gastroparesis [^111nzV1A] [^114YP3yu]. Hold on, I should verify that dyspepsia and IBS-like symptoms are indeed more frequent in dialysis cohorts; observational data support higher rates of dyspepsia, constipation, and IBS-like symptoms in HD and PD compared with controls, reinforcing the need to screen for modifiable contributors such as diet, binders, and acid suppression when appropriate [^117MbvCo] [^114UWq27].

> Let me reconsider the "can't miss" emergencies so I do not undercall time-critical disease. In any ESRD patient with acute abdominal pain, I should actively exclude spontaneous hemorrhage, mesenteric ischemia, perforated viscus, and severe pancreatitis, because delays in these diagnoses carry high mortality; unstable patients warrant immediate resuscitation and contrast-enhanced CT when feasible, recognizing contrast decisions must balance diagnostic yield and patient-specific risks in advanced CKD [^111kRbEc] [^112xn1EL]. I should double-check that CT remains the workhorse even in ESRD for most vascular and surgical emergencies, with modality tailored to the suspected pathology and renal function context [^112xn1EL].

> Next, I should review modality-specific patterns to refine pretest probabilities. In HD, spontaneous bleeding and NOMI dominate the acute abdomen, whereas in PD, peritonitis, perforation, and catheter-related mechanical complications predominate; this divergence should shape initial testing and consultation pathways in the emergency setting [^114A9k2j]. Wait, let me verify that PD patients also have meaningful rates of pancreatitis and perforation beyond peritonitis; yes, series and case reports document both, so I should not prematurely close the differential in PD patients with atypical pain or refractory symptoms [^113CkkGj] [^113x2nGj].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is pragmatic and safe. Bedside ultrasound can rapidly screen for free fluid or large hematomas, but CT is the definitive modality for most surgical emergencies; triple-phase CT angiography is preferred for mesenteric ischemia, and non-contrast or delayed imaging can characterize hemorrhage and calcifications when contrast is deferred [^111kRbEc] [^115ZPJdF]. For PD patients with pain, I should obtain effluent cell count, differential, and culture whenever peritonitis is suspected, and use imaging to distinguish infectious from mechanical causes when the presentation is atypical or refractory to initial therapy [^112tGRxa] [^111sHEkg].

> Finally, I should review pain management principles specific to ESRD, because undertreatment is common and unsafe. NSAIDs are generally avoided due to GI bleeding risk, fluid retention, and cardiovascular harm; acetaminophen is preferred for mild pain, while opioids that avoid active renally cleared metabolites, such as fentanyl and methadone, are favored for moderate to severe pain, with careful attention to dosing and monitoring for neurocognitive and respiratory effects; multimodal and nonpharmacologic strategies should be integrated whenever feasible [^113WXBcF] [^111ZdH3A]. Hold on, I should verify that current nephrology palliative care frameworks align with this approach; contemporary reviews emphasize tailored analgesic selection, proactive side-effect management, and coordination with dialysis schedules to optimize safety and efficacy [^112LxEE6] [^113tBmmN].

> In summary, abdominal pain in ESRD spans vascular catastrophes, dialysis-specific complications, uremic and drug-induced pathology, structural cystic disease, and functional motility disorders. Maintaining a modality-aware differential, prioritizing life-threatening emergencies, and leveraging CT-based imaging with modality-appropriate testing are the cornerstones of safe, effective care, while pain management must be individualized to renal pharmacokinetics and comorbidity burden [^114A9k2j] [^111kRbEc] [^111ZdH3A].

Abdominal pain in ESRD patients has a **distinct pattern** of causes, with **non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia** and **spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage** (especially retroperitoneal or renal) being the most common and dangerous [^114A9k2j] [^112vv9mB]. Other key etiologies include **peritonitis and bowel perforation** in peritoneal dialysis, pancreatitis with often normal enzymes, and uremic colitis; vascular calcification and calciphylaxis can cause severe ischemic pain [^114ugQXt] [^1122vu4s]. Functional disorders such as gastroparesis, dyspepsia, and constipation are common and often multifactorial [^111nzV1A] [^117MbvCo]. Evaluation must be **urgent and broad**, using contrast-enhanced CT when stable and peritoneal fluid analysis in PD, because ESRD patients have atypical presentations and high morbidity [^112xn1EL] [^112tGRxa].

## Gastrointestinal causes

### Ischemic and vascular complications

- **Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI)**: Common in HD; presents with diffuse pain, nausea, and diarrhea; mortality is high if missed [^114A9k2j] [^111kRbEc].

- **Mesenteric ischemia**: Arterial embolism/thrombosis or venous thrombosis; risk factors include atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis, and hypercoagulability [^111kRbEc].

- **Uremic colitis**: Severe ischemic colitis with patchy necrosis; rare but life-threatening [^113zKFWA].

- **Calciphylaxis**: Vascular calcification causing ischemic pain and necrosis; often severe and refractory [^1122vu4s].

---

### Infectious and inflammatory complications

- **Peritonitis**: Common in PD; presents with abdominal pain, cloudy effluent, and fever; requires urgent peritoneal fluid analysis and antibiotics [^112tGRxa].

- **Bowel perforation**: Higher risk in PD due to intraperitoneal pressure and diverticulosis; mortality is high if delayed [^113x2nGj].

- **Pancreatitis**: Occurs in HD/PD; enzymes may be normal due to renal clearance, so imaging is key [^112PVo1E] [^113CkkGj].

- **Diverticulitis**: Increased prevalence in ESRD; can perforate and cause peritonitis [^113x2nGj].

---

### Functional and structural gastrointestinal disorders

- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying causing nausea, vomiting, and early satiety; common in ESRD [^111nzV1A].

- **Dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease**: High prevalence; often related to uremia, medications, and H. pylori [^1149S7uZ].

- **Constipation**: Very common; contributes to pain and may worsen uremia [^115bYNxr].

- **Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis**: Late PD complication with severe pain, bowel obstruction, and malnutrition [^113EGHxV].

---

## Renal and retroperitoneal causes

Spontaneous **retroperitoneal hemorrhage** is common in HD — often from acquired cystic kidney disease or angiomyolipoma — and presents with sudden severe pain and shock [^112vv9mB] [^111qbraN]. Hemorrhagic cysts in **ADPKD** can rupture, causing acute pain [^notfound]. Nephrolithiasis remains a frequent cause of colicky pain despite ESRD [^notfound].

---

## Peritoneal dialysis-specific complications

- **Peritonitis**: Most common PD complication; urgent diagnosis and treatment are critical [^112U9VqR].

- **Catheter-related pain**: From malposition, infection, or adhesions [^notfound].

- **Hernias**: Incisional or inguinal; related to increased intra-abdominal pressure [^111sHEkg].

- **Dialysate leaks**: Cause localized pain and swelling [^notfound].

---

## Hemodialysis-specific complications

Hemodialysis-specific complications include **intradialytic hypotension**, which can precipitate mesenteric ischemia and abdominal pain, and **vascular access complications**, such as access infection or thrombosis causing localized pain [^114JWZR6] [^114A9k2j] [^115FFPCH].

---

## Medication-related causes

Medication-related causes include **phosphate binders** (sevelamer, calcium acetate), which can cause GI upset, constipation, and rarely bowel obstruction, and **erythropoiesis-stimulating agents**, which may cause abdominal pain and hypertension. Accumulation of renally cleared drugs can also cause toxicity and pain [^113qbDxp] [^115FZbYw] [^115CKYPD].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given atypical presentations and high morbidity, a **structured approach** is essential:

1. **History, exam, labs (CBC, chemistries, amylase/lipase, lactate)**: Initial assessment
2. **Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis**: Suspected ischemia, perforation, hemorrhage, pancreatitis [^111kRbEc]
3. **Peritoneal fluid analysis (cell count, culture)**: PD peritonitis [^112tGRxa]
4. **Endoscopy**: GI bleeding, ulcers, dyspepsia [^1149S7uZ]
5. **MRI or ultrasound**: Renal cysts, hemorrhage, stones [^notfound]

---

Abdominal pain in ESRD is **multifactorial and high risk**, with ischemia, hemorrhage, infection, and functional disorders predominating. Rapid, modality-specific evaluation and imaging are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^112vv9mB].

Background

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) often present to the Emergency Department with a multitude of complaints. Abnormal vital signs and a chief complaint of pain can produce a diagnosis ranging from a cardiac etiology to an infectious source.

Objectives

Our goal is to discuss a case in which an ESRD dialysis patient presented with a rare, life-threatening emergency.

Case Report

### The CT frequencies of various non-traumatic acute abdominal emergencies in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis patients and the general population [^114A9k2j]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the frequency of non-traumatic acute abdominal emergencies in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD)) patients and in the general population as diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) imaging.

Methods

The abdominal CT findings of ESRD patients with non-traumatic acute abdominal pain during the years 2001–2010 have been retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-three HD (14 females, 19 males, mean age: 62 ± 10.5) and 22 PD patients (12 females, 10 males, mean age: 59 ± 9.4) with acute abdominal pathology based on their CT scans have been included into the study. In addition, 127 individuals (68 females, 59 males, mean age: 40.7 ± 12.8) with normal renal functions who presented with non-traumatic acute abdominal pain diagnosed with an acute abdominal pathology based on their CT scans have been prospectively evaluated during the years 2009–2010.

Results

While the most frequent etiology in PD patients was peritonitis (45.4%), acute pancreatitis (13.6%) and perforation (18.1), and in HD patients it was nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (18.1%) and spontaneous intraabdominal bleeding (21.2%). The basic causes of acute abdomen in the general population were ureteral stone (34.6%) and appendicitis (18.1%).

Conclusions

The causes of acute abdominal pain in ESRD patients is significantly different when compared to the general population. And within this special patient population the etiology of acute abdomen differs depending on the renal replacement therapy modality they are receiving. Thus, the causes of acute abdomen in PD patients are mostly peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, and perforation, while being mostly nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia and spontaneous intraabdominal bleeding in patients receiving HD therapy.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116fYBjp]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In hemodialysis (HD) patients, the prevalence of chronic pain can be up to 92%. A survey of HD patients found 55% reported a severe pain episode in the previous 24 hours. Furthermore, ~75% of HD patients report inadequate pain management. Despite these shocking statistics there is no universally accepted guideline for the treatment of pain in HD patients. Nevertheless, poorly managed pain in HD patients promulgates psychological disturbances, impaired sleep, decreased dialysis compliance, and an overall decline in quality of life.

Providers may be hesitant to prescribe analgesics to patients on HD due to the significant differences in pharmacokinetics compared with their healthy counterparts. Pharmacokinetic variations of most drugs are generally well studied in "healthy" patients; however, physiochemical attributes in HD patients are fraught with uncertainty.

Due to decreased renal elimination of medications and metabolites, a common assumption in patients with renal disease is that estimated renal function is the main, and sometimes only, factor to consider when making dose adjustments. Although not entirely false, other physiologic changes must be considered when selecting medications and commensurate dosing. Table 1 demonstrates the various changes that occur to absorption, volume of distribution, and elimination that must be accounted for in this patient population.

The dialysis machine itself must also be considered among the many changes that HD patients undergo when selecting pharmacotherapy. Certain characteristics impact the removal of a drug by dialysis, including molecular weight, protein binding, volume of distribution, and water solubility. The least likely drugs to be removed by dialysis are those with large molecular weights that are highly protein bound, that have high volume of distribution, and with poor water solubility. Given the aforementioned complexities of selecting appropriate medications for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the potential for adverse events with inappropriate dosing, it is no wonder why providers are so uncomfortable prescribing analgesic therapy to patients with advanced CKD. Nonpharmacologic approaches should be optimized and used in conjunction with any chronic pain patient. If pharmacotherapy is required for adequate pain management, opioids are frequently thought to be first-line therapy when comparing toxicities to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Retention and destruction of data

Data will be stored for a minimum of 5 years post-publication of the results.

Potential biases

This research project has been designed to make sure the researchers interpret the results in a fair and appropriate way and avoids study doctors or participants jumping to conclusions. We do not believe there are any other potential biases that could arise during the conduct of this study.

### Dyspepsia and gastric emptying in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis [^111nzV1A]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The most common non-renal complaints in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea and dyspepsia. Dyspepsia is highly prevalent and characterized by upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal bloating, and early satiety. The prevalence of dyspepsia among HD patients varies between 48% and 70%. In the general population, dyspepsia has been shown to impair quality of life. Nevertheless, dyspeptic symptoms are not widely investigated among patients treated by HD, as is usually the case in relation to cardiovascular disease, osteodystrophy and nutritional status.

Dyspepsia may have organic and functional causes. Like in the general population, functional dyspepsia is the most frequent among ESRD patients. There are reports of the possible role of gastric emptying delay as a cause of dyspeptic symptoms in HD patients. Gastroparesis is better recognized in diabetics. However, its presence is also high in all-cause ESRD, varying between 36% to 62% among patients undergoing chronic HD. In these patients, delay in gastric emptying can be related to malnutrition and hormonal and electrolytic disturbances.

Dyspepsia can be easily evaluated through a questionnaire about characteristic symptoms, although gastric emptying time is not so easily assessed. The tools available to estimate gastric emptying time are: technetium-99 m scintigraphy (gold –pattern); time of appearance of acetaminophen in blood after its ingestion; imaging studies using 3D ultrasonography and nuclear resonance; the smart pill (which seems to be a practical and promising method); and octanoic acid breath test using 13 carbon (with 89% sensitivity compared to gold-standard technetium-99 m scintigraphy).

In our study, we looked for an association between dyspepsia and gastric emptying time in an experiment conducted with a sample of ESRD patients on maintenance HD.

### Comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings in renal replacement therapy modalities [^115ELzJ3]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As a result; GIS symptoms and signs are quite common in patients with CKD. The majority of patients have more than one gastrointestinal symptom. In addition, when evaluated in terms of frequency, some of the GI symptoms and diseases vary according to the renal replacement therapy method, while some do not. Further studies are needed to evaluate physiopathological changes in the gastrointestinal system in CKD, the effects of these changes on GIS symptoms and signs, and the effects of symptoms and diseases on quality of life, morbidity and mortality.

Main Points:
Gastrointestinal complaints and findings are common in CKD patients
Dyspepsia, gastritis, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux findings, hemorrhoids and constipation are the findings often seen in CKD.
Knowing the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms, signs and diseases that may occur in CKD patients is valuable for early diagnosis and treatment of GIS disorders.
Knowing the gastrointestinal symptoms, signs and diseases that may vary according to the treatment modality in CKD patients may help in the choice of renal replacement therapy model.

### An approach to pain management in end stage renal disease: considerations for general management and intradialytic symptoms [^115FFPCH]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence and severity of symptoms in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is higher than those of the general population and comparable to those with other chronic and serious medical conditions. Despite the prevalence and severity in this population, symptoms continue to be under-recognized and inadequately managed. The recognition of specific intradialytic pain syndromes such as pain related to arteriovenous access, headaches, muscle cramps or generalized pain by providers may aid in improving patient compliance and quality of life. The approach to pain management in end stage renal disease patients follows that of the general population with specific considerations regarding clearance and potential side effects guiding selection of agents. Overall, evidence is limited regarding the pharmacology of many medications in this population.

### Delayed bowel perforation after instilling over warmed peritoneal dialysate [^114XPkNC]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a safe and home-based treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The direct thermal damage of abdominal organs is very rare.

Case presentation

We report a peritoneal dialysis patient presented abdominal pain and feculent effluent 3 weeks after he instilled hot dialysis solution. In spite of emergency exploratory laparotomy and active treatment, the patient died of septic shock. Biopsy revealed necrosis and perforation of the intestines.

Conclusions

Delayed bowel perforation by hot fluid is very rare. Standardized performance is of the first importance for peritoneal dialysis patients.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^113wEQhv]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Renal colic analgesics — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus opioids and acetaminophen: In a meta-analysis of 36 randomized clinical trials with 4,887 subjects, compared with opioids, NSAIDs provided better pain relief at 30 min (MD −5.58, 95% CI −10.22 to −0.95), required fewer rescue treatments (23% vs. 31%, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94), and had lower rates of any adverse event (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69) and vomiting (5% vs. 20%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24–0.70); versus acetaminophen, pain relief was similar at 30 min but rescue analgesia was lower with NSAIDs (11% vs. 20%, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74).

### Association of constipation with risk of end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115PMuUZ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our longitudinal nationwide study showed that de novo constipation in CKD patients was a risk factor in progression to ESRD. The obvious constipation, with laxatives needed, increased the risk. The more severe constipation, with the longer duration of laxatives needed, increased the risk further. The patency issue of bowel should not be ignored in CKD patients. Dietary modification and some other interventions should be tried to avoid constipation. Avoidance or even shortened intervals of constipation might be helpful to lessen the progression of CKD.

### Ischaemic enteritis in a patient with chronic renal failure: diagnosis and management decisions [^113ugUnW]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Ischaemic enteritis is rare in patients with chronic renal failure not on dialysis. Here we report a case of ischaemic enteritis in an 81-year-old woman with chronic renal failure secondary to hypertension (not dialysis dependent) who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhoea and subsequent oliguria. The abdominal CT with angiography showed diffuse segmental wall thickening and decreased perfusion of the long segment of the ileum, with decreased enhancement of the vessels that supply the distal ileum. The clinical diagnosis of ischaemic enteritis was made. The patient responded initially to total parenteral nutrition and intravenous antibiotics. After the initiation of haemodialysis, because of the oliguria, the ischaemic enteritis progressed to bowel infarction, and an open laparotomy was performed. This report illustrates some of the difficult therapeutic decisions in a patient with ischaemic enteritis and chronic renal failure.

### The CKD bowel health study: understanding the bowel health and gastrointestinal symptom management in patients with chronic kidney disease: a mixed-methods observational longitudinal study (protocol) [^115KGFum]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastro-intestinal (GI) intolerance is a frequently reported outcome in patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis and those who have received kidney transplants. Symptoms of GI intolerance (diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, abdominal pain, heart burn, and reflux) are associated with significant reduction in quality of life, morbidity, and increased used of healthcare resources. Having chronic kidney disease (CKD), together with related changes in diet and medication, may alter the gut microbiota and the microbial-derived uraemic metabolites that accumulate in kidney failure, and contribute to various complications including chronic diarrhoea, opportunistic infections, and drug-related colitis. Despite the high disease burden among patients with kidney replacement therapies, GI symptoms are often under-recognised and, consequently limited resources and strategies are devoted to the management of gastrointestinal complications in patients with CKD.

Methods

The CKD Bowel Health Study is a multi-centre mixed-methods observational longitudinal study to better understand the bowel health and GI symptom management in patients with CKD. The program comprises of a longitudinal study that will assess the burden and risk factors of GI intolerance in patients treated with maintenance dialysis; a semi-structured interview study that will describe experiences of GI intolerance (including symptoms, treatment, self-management) in transplant candidates and recipients; and a discrete choice experience to elicit patient preferences regarding their experiences and perspectives of various intervention strategies for the management of GI symptoms after kidney transplantation.

Discussion

This proposed program of work aims to define the burden the GI intolerance in patients with kidney failure and generate evidence on the patients' experiences of GI intolerance and their perspectives on their clinical and own management strategies of these symptoms, ensuring a patient-centred approach to guide clinical decision making and to inform the best study design for intervention trials.

### Daprodustat (Jesduvroq) [^115FZbYw]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

JESDUVROQ was non-inferior to rhEPO on the time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with anemia due to CKD who were on dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was reported in 19% of patients treated with JESDUVROQ and 18% of patients treated with rhEPO. No specific adverse reaction resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation in > 1% of patients treated with JESDUVROQ.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% of JESDUVROQ-treated patients) were hypertension, thrombotic vascular events, and abdominal pain.

Table 4 lists the most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥ 5% of patients treated with JESDUVROQ).

rhEPO = Recombinant human erythropoietin.

aIncludes unspecified abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort.

bIncludes rash, urticaria and dermatitis.

Thrombotic Vascular Events

Adjudicated thrombotic vascular events (fatal and non-fatal) were observed in 9.8 per 100 PY of patients receiving JESDUVROQ and in 11.7 per 100 PY of patients receiving rhEPO (see Table 5).

PY = Person Years; rhEPO = Recombinant human erythropoietin.

These data are not an adequate basis for comparison of rates between the study drug and the active control.

### Exploring factors associated with pain in hemodialysis patients: a multicenter cross-sectional study from palestine [^114JWZR6]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality over the world. ESKD is considered the last stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that needs renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the form of renal transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, or hemodialysis (HD). ESKD prevalence and incidence are growing globally. Based on information on 120 countries that have dialysis programs, about almost two million people were on renal replacement therapy by the end of 2005, with 1,297,000 (68%) of them receiving HD. In Palestine, the overall number of people with HD in the West Bank in 2016 was 1119 patients. This number has increased to 1216 patients in 2017. In developed countries, diabetic glomerulopathy is responsible for around 44% of all new ESKD cases, followed by hypertensive nephrosclerosis, old age, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, as other notable factors. ESKD can result in kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.

HD is the most commonly used type of RRT, with over 90.0% of patients receiving it. It is also highly effective, halting most of the clinical complications and extending life expectancy. However, patients on HD still suffer from high mortality and morbidity rates due to its complications, including decreased blood pressure, increased blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, vascular access compromise, infections, and chronic pain. These complications require management and necessitate multiple hospital admissions that result in higher healthcare costs and demands on the national level. Pain is a common complication in patients with ESKD and impacts on the quality of life (QOL). A 2016 systematic review reported the prevalence of chronic pain in ESKD patients on HD, which was up to 82% and 92%.

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) describes pain as a physical or emotional unpleasant feeling associated with potential or actual harm and may cause weakened memory, inattention, problems with sleep, symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, impotence, diminishing physical activity, and interrupted social relations and duties. Pain could be acute, subacute, or chronic. Chronic pain lacks the warning of acute physiologic nociception function and stays or reoccurs for more than 3 to 6 months.

### Analgesia in patients with ESRD: a review of available evidence [^113WXBcF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe pain frequently accompanies chronic diseases in general and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in particular. Several analgesic agents and associated metabolites show altered pharmacokinetics in the presence of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Drug-related side effects may exacerbate symptoms frequently observed in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and constipation) or those often attributed to hemodialysis therapy (eg, orthostatic hypotension and impaired cognition). Persons with advanced CKD and ESRD are at increased risk for adverse effects of analgesic agents because of enhanced drug sensitivity, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medication use. Dose adjustment and avoidance of certain analgesics may be required in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. We review the available evidence on pharmacokinetics and adverse drug effects of various analgesic agents commonly used in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Determining an optimal approach to the control of pain in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD will require additional research.

### Immunoglobulin A nephropathy and ulcerative colitis. A focus on their pathogenesis [^111X1fBr]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

The immune response has largely been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. We present a 26-year-old woman with a long past history of asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria who later developed several episodes of bloody stools and abdominal pain. A colonic biopsy disclosed ulcerative colitis and a renal biopsy was consistent with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis, being end-stage renal disease a rare but the most serious complication. It can be primary or secondary, but the association between both entities is unusually observed. We discuss the possible immunologic mechanisms involved and believe the initial immunologic derangement originates in the bone marrow. We suggest both conditions must be considered when either a patient with ulcerative colitis and micro- or macrohematuria or with renal involvement and a past history of diarrhea or abdominal pain presents.

### A case report of sevelamer-associated recto-sigmoid ulcers [^113uQ5Dg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal phosphorous control is an important aspect of the care of patients with end-stage renal disease, and phosphate binders are usually needed.

Case Presentation

A 74-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis presented to the emergency room with abdominal discomfort, rectal pain, and blood-tinged stools. Initial concern was for a rectal carcinoma, based on the symptoms and imaging in initial computerized tomography of the abdomen showing rectal wall thickening, and her clinical presentation. She had been treated with the phosphate binder sevelamer for two months. In this case report, we explore the unique features of sevelamer-associated recto-sigmoid ulcers which led to her symptoms.

Conclusion

Sevelamer is widely used in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease patients with hyperphosphatemia. It is a crosslinked polymeric amine that binds phosphates and bile acids; it is not systemically absorbed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of recto-sigmoid ulcers associated with use of this phosphate binder. Nephrologists, pathologists, and gastroenterology sub-specialists should be aware of this recently-reported entity in patients on sevelamer with suggestive symptoms, as this medication is widely used in renal patients.

### A patient with acute kidney pain and high blood pressure [^116F4pFi]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

This case presented challenging diagnostic and management issues in a young healthy man who presented with abdominal pain and new-onset hypertension. The differential diagnosis evolved over the course of the clinical presentation. The patient had severe vascular involvement of his renal and basal cerebral arteries that initially was assumed to be due to a vasculitic process or hypercoagulable state. Finally it became apparent that the patient did not have a systemic illness but rather a localized vascular disease most likely due to segmental arterial mediolysis, a rare, under-recognized condition that can potentially be fatal. This condition is often difficult to distinguish from fibromuscular dysplasia. It is important to recognize and correctly diagnose the condition, particularly in the acute phase of the disease, because delay in diagnosis can contribute to morbidity and mortality.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms, inflammation and hypoalbuminemia in chronic kidney disease patients: a cross-sectional study [^113utgZv]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, increased prevalence of GI symptoms become apparent among CKD patients at relatively high eGFR levels, long before ESRD. GI symptoms, like inflammation, are risk factors for lower serum albumin levels. But the presence of GI symptoms (and inflammation) cannot fully explain the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in CKD patients. More studies are required to better understand the relationship between reduced kidney function and hypoalbuminemia.

### Nephrogenic ascites in the emergency department [^116QhkfY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Nephrogenic ascites is a rare occurrence with an extremely low incidence. It is easily misdiagnosed by both emergency physicians and nephrologists. Missed diagnosis contributes to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. We report a case of nephrogenic ascites presenting and diagnosed in the emergency department by confirming lack of alternative diagnoses coupled with point of care ultrasound of the abdomen and CT scan abdomen and pelvis. Familiarity with this rare complication of end-stage renal disease is important for emergency physicians, as the mortality rate is very high. Early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment has been demonstrated to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Spontaneous rupture of non-tumoral kidneys in patients with end stage renal failure: risks and management [^111wAqTB]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the risks and treatment modalities of spontaneous subcapsular or perinephric bleeding in end stage renal patients.

Methods

8 patients with end stage renal failure developed a spontaneous hemorrhage of one of their native kidneys and were referred to our institution. They were all men. Six of them presented an acquired renal cystic disease. Symptoms included sudden abdominal pain in 7 patients, vomiting in 2 and hematuria in 1. Symptoms were always associated with a hemoglobin decrease. Four patients were receiving oral anticoagulants for various reasons and one had thrombopenia. Bleeding was confirmed by computerized tomography and nephrectomy undertaken in all cases.

Results

3 patients died in the immediate post-operative period. Histologic findings confirmed bleeding and did not find any other abnormality than those related to renal insufficiency (cysts and atrophy).

Conclusion

Renal rupture should be considered in case of unexplained distress or sudden fall of the hemoglobin especially when patients are on anticoagulants. Surgery is our preferred treatment because of the frequency of unrevealed tumours and the potential mortality of massive hematomas.

### Bio-sociological and clinical factors of chronic pain and pain interference in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study [^115B3jUm]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is an irreversible and incurable alteration of kidney function threatening the person's survival. In the world, 3 million of the population suffer from ESKD. The prevalence steadily rises due to the epidemiological transition, strong demographic growth, and poor governance and vulnerability. Treatment of ESKD is based on renal replacement therapies, hemodialysis is the most widespread. In Morocco, one study estimated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease at 5.1% of the Moroccan population, of which ESKD represents 7.2%. Therefore, the prevalence of hemodialysis (HD) patients in 2015 was 571 per million inhabitants, increasing from 13,000 to 33,000 in 2013 and 2021 respectively, and reaching 50,000 patients in 2030. Patients undergoing HD are one of the most symptomatic of all chronic kidney disease groups, with symptom burden high in severity, frequency, and distress such as chronic pain (CP).

The high prevalence of CP and the lack of effective management are causing widespread concern. In the recent systematic review and meta-analysis, 60.5% of hemodialysis patients reported CP (52.3–68.3%), with 43.6% of this population describing their CP as moderate to severe (34.8–52.7%). This prevalence is similar to patients suffering from advanced cancer. The pain is located in different parts of the body (lower and upper limbs; shoulders; hips; back, and abdomen), and can be multifocal resulting in various types such as nociceptive, neuropathic, or mixed pain. The multiple pain conditions that complicate the experience of CP in this population are osteoarthritis, peripheral neuropathies, and osteoporosis as comorbidity. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, urinary tract infections, and vasculitis are primary renal diseases. Further, the complications related to end-stage renal disease include renal bone disease, and calcific uremic arteriolopathy, nevertheless, CP is considerably underestimated.

### The CKD bowel health study: understanding the bowel health and gastrointestinal symptom management in patients with chronic kidney disease: a mixed-methods observational longitudinal study (protocol) [^115G8zAQ]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal cohort study

Recruitment of participants will occur anytime pre-transplant and the following will be collected (Table 1):
General patient contact information, demographic characteristics, medical history, and CKD health status via the Observational Questionnaire (Baseline).
The baseline assessments, pre-transplant of observational data via the Observational Questionnaire (Baseline) which will collect transplant status, current medications and supplements, general health via the EQ-5D Questionnaire, faecal characteristics using the Bristol Stool Chart, gastrointestinal symptoms via the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), quality of life using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Scale (GIQLS), personal management strategies of gut health and GI symptoms, dietary patterns using the Food Frequency Questionnaire, and safety parameters and adverse events.
To repeat the instruments, the Observational Questionnaire (Follow-Up) will be administered at 4-, 12-, and 28-weeks post-transplant (28 weeks being the final follow-up time-points). This questionnaire contains the same instruments without the patient contact information and demographic sections.

Table 1
Study Visit Schedule

The primary outcomes are: (1) prevalence of GI intolerance (any severity) in patients with kidney failure and kidney transplants; and (2) change in GI symptom burden before and after transplantation. Secondary outcomes are: (1) risk factors of GI intolerance; (2) stool characteristics; (3) general health status, and (4) quality of life.

Instruments: the observational questionnaires (baseline and follow-up) will collect a broad range of both clinically important and patient-reported outcomes using a variety of validated instruments. The EQ-5D tool is a 5-question Likert scale for measuring general health status according to activities of daily living. The Bristol Stool Chart is a 7-point illustrative scale for identifying different categories of stool characteristics. The GSRS instrument comprises of 15 items combined into five symptom-domains of reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea and constipation. The GSRS is a graded scale, with a score of 1 representing the absence of any GI symptoms, whereas a score of 7 representing severe GI symptoms. The Food Frequency Questionnaire is a validated 131-item dietary assessment tool to capture a patient's content, frequency, and portion sizes of food and beverages over a specified time period, ranging from 1 to 12 months depending on the question.

### Acute pancreatitis in peritoneal dialysis: a case report with literature review [^113CkkGj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain with a discoloured dialysate in a patient on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is usually attributed to infective peritonitis. Although acute pancreatitis (AP) is not usually a complication of end-stage renal disease, some studies suggest an increased risk especially in patients on PD. We report a case of idiopathic AP in a 41-year-old female on PD who presented with abdominal pain, fever, vomiting and a clear dark dialysate. Initial diagnosis of PD-associated infective peritonitis was made but dialysate cultures proved negative. Serum amylase showed a mild rise and computed tomography revealed necrotising pancreatitis. No common risk factors for AP were identified and she was successfully treated with conservative therapy. A literature review was carried out using a PubMed search with the words 'acute pancreatitis and peritoneal dialysis'. The literature search found a total of 94 cases of AP in the setting of PD. In more than a quarter, no cause for AP was found. Serum amylase was normal in 12.8% of episodes. Complications developed in 25 cases, and 28 patients died from the condition. Therefore, AP can be a rare, but serious complication of PD with a high mortality and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in a PD patient.

### An emerging and devastating acute abdomen in a patient under peritoneal dialysis: encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis [^113EGHxV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been applied to patients with end-stage renal disease for more than 2 decades. It should raise physicians' concern about the serious complications of prolonged PD therapy, particularly encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), the most potentially life-threatening one. The prevalence and mortality rate of EPS increase as PD duration increases. We report a case of EPS presented with blood-tinged effluents and abdominal pain.

### Letter to the editor: spontaneous renal haemorrhage in end-stage renal disease [^115ZPJdF]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

SRH may present with the classical triad of acute lumbar or abdominal pain, a palpable mass and hypovolemic shock. Alternatively, manifestations may be nonspecific with variable degrees of haemodynamic compromise. Practically, SRH should be strongly suspected in every patient with ESRD (particularly on haemodialysis) presenting with more or less severe abdominal or flank pain, hypotension and haematocrit drop, and prompt imaging investigation is imperative. Ultrasound may promptly identify abnormal perinephric collections compressing or displacing the kidney, with decreasing echogenicity during their temporal evolution. However, ultrasound has limited diagnostic accuracy because of patient-related technical factors and does not reliably differentiate echogenic clotted blood from solid tissue.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) represents the imaging modality of choice to diagnose suspected intra-abdominal bleeding and differentiate from other causes of acute abdomen. CT has absolute (100%) sensitivity for the detection of retroperitoneal haematomas, which appear as more or less hyperattenuating (35 to 70 Hounsfield units) collections on precontrast scans depending on their more or less acute stage. In our experience, the typical appearance of SRH in ACKD includes small, poorly perfused kidneys with multiple cysts and a sizeable crescent- or biconvex-shaped subcapsular haematoma exerting compression on the adjacent renal parenchyma (Figs. 1 and 2). CT allows accurate size measurement and monitoring of haematomas, and differentiates subcapsular from perinephric haematomas which displace the kidney ventrally without compression. Furthermore, multiphase protocols, including corticomedullary and nephrographic acquisitions, allow identification of contrast medium (CM) extravasation isodense with the blood pool consistent with active bleeding (Figs. 1 and 2).

### Complications of abdominal and pelvic procedures: computed tomographic diagnosis [^112wXgo6]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The postprocedural period is a critical time in which serious complications can manifest. Localization of suspected complications following abdominal and pelvic procedures can be difficult on clinical evaluation alone. For example, abdominal pain after a colonoscopy may vary in etiology and can result from simple colonic spasm to colonic perforation, hemoperitoneum, or even splenic rupture. Vague abdominal pain following a renal biopsy may be due to minimal postprocedural bleeding into and around the kidney or may be due to potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. In such patients, computed tomography can play a crucial role in the rapid identification of complications as well guidance of subsequent patient management. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the benefit of computed tomography-assisted diagnosis of complications associated with routine procedures performed on or throughout the abdomen and pelvis, including cardiac catheterization, colonoscopy, endoscopy, percutaneous biopsy, and interventional radiology procedures.

### Unexplained colonic necrosis in a patient with end-stage kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis: case report and review of uremic colitis [^113zKFWA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, affecting approximately 350 million people worldwide and resulting in 500,000 to 1 million deaths every year. People with CKD require more medical and social care. Previous studies have suggested that patients with uraemia have common complications, such as cardiovascular disease, infection and cerebrovascular accidents, but there are few studies on intestinal problems in these patients. Many uraemic toxins may induce intestinal inflammation, which leads to intestinal motility disorders. However, little is known about the relationship between uraemia and intestinal inflammation. Previous studies have suggested that the common causes of intestinal necrosis are low cardiac output, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and drug use. A model for the cause of superior mesenteric artery syndrome has also been reported. Unexplained intestinal necrosis in patients with uraemia has not been reported. This article reports the case of a patient on maintenance haemodialysis who had total colonic lesions characterized by scattered flaky necrosis resulting in refractory shock. Additionally, this article reviews the literature on intestinal necrosis in uraemia patients.

### Abdominal catastrophe in a 43-year-old female with end stage renal disease [^115bZsjp]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath after missing hemodialysis. On admission, the patient was noted to have painful skin lesions consistent with calciphylaxis on biopsy. While undergoing aggressive wound care, she developed altered mental status and was found to be septic and started empirically on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient was intubated on day 4 of admission owing to worsening mental status and acidemia. She had persistent positive blood cultures throughout her hospitalization despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. On day 25 of admission, the patient was found to have abdominal distension. A radiograph revealed intra-abdominal free air, and the patient was taken to the operating room where she was found to have perforated necrotic bowel. The patient expired on day 26 of admission. An autopsy revealed calciphylaxis within the gut wall and within the dura of the central nervous system. While typically a disorder of subcutaneous tissue, calciphylaxis can affect internal organs, which in this case resulted in a catastrophic outcome.

### Clinical pharmacology considerations in pain management in patients with advanced kidney failure [^111ZdH3A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain is common and poorly managed in patients with advanced CKD, likely due to both under and over prescription of appropriate analgesics. Poorly managed pain contributes to patients' poor quality of life and excessive health care use. There is tremendous variability within and between countries in prescribing patterns of analgesics, suggesting that factors other than patient characteristics account for these differences. This article discusses the pharmacologic management of acute and chronic pain in patients with advanced CKD, and the role analgesics, including opioids, play in the overall approach to pain management.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: diagnosis and management [^117BogtF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic mesenteric ischemia:

- **Definition**: Chronic mesenteric ischemia is a clinical condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the mesenteric arteries, usually due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels, which can lead to ischemia to the intestinal tissues.
- **Pathophysiology**: The primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying chronic mesenteric ischemia is atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels. Rare causes include thromboangiitis obliterans, FMD, and aortic dissection.
- **Epidemiology**: Chronic mesenteric ischemia is a relatively rare condition, with a reported incidence of 9.2 per 100,000 person-years and a prevalence of 0.03%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia include age, smoking, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. These factors contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, which in turn leads to the narrowing or occlusion of the mesenteric arteries.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, chronic mesenteric ischemia presents with postprandial abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, and changes in bowel habits. These symptoms are progressive and can lead to fear of food due to the associated pain.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia can be severe if left untreated. Patients often develop severe malnutrition due to the associated weight loss and changes in eating patterns. Endovascular interventions have improved postoperative morbidity but have also resulted in early symptom recurrence and reintervention. Age > 80 years, diabetes, CKD stage IV or V, and home oxygen are independent predictors of any-cause mortality.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### Comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings in renal replacement therapy modalities [^114UWq27]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a pathophysiological process with many etiological causes, often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with a progressive and irreversible decrease in the number of nephrons and kidney functions. Uremia is a clinical and laboratory syndrome, that occurs because of renal failure and reflects dysfunction of all affected organs, including the gastrointestinal system (GIS).

Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs are quite common in patients with CKD. Studies have found that the frequency of symptoms is around 77–79%. Symptoms and findings are related to all departments from the upper gastrointestinal tract to the lower gastrointestinal tract and can be divided into 3 categories as membrane problems, functional problems and histopathological problems. Membrane problems such as glossitis, stomatitis, esophagitis, enteritis, colitis, ileitis; functional problems such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, reflux, ileus; histopathological changes such as ulcers, bleeding and pancreatitis may be observed. Complications like an increase in infectious diseases such as HBV, HCV, CMV, peritonitis, increased incidence of cancer, treatment-related gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and increased incidence of hernia are also frequently encountered in patients with CKD.

There are many causes of GIS symptoms and signs seen in CKD patients, but the underlying mechanisms in its formation have not been fully elucidated. Some studies suggest that some common complaints such as nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, bloating and constipation may be associated with delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric myoelectric activity.

However, the changes in GIS also show differences according to the stage of CKD and the type of renal replacement therapy (RRT) applied. Again, it is not clear whether the underlying causes of GI involvement in chronic kidney disease depend on uremia or the type of treatment administered. However, identifying CKD patients with gastrointestinal tract symptoms and signs and treating these patients with recommendations and medications are important in terms of improving gastrointestinal quality of life.

In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of GIS symptoms and signs in patients with CKD receiving conservative treatment or hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and also to compare the diversity of symptoms and signs in these patients who received different renal replacement therapy modalities.

### End-stage renal disease: symptom management and advance care planning [^116uhML9]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of end-stage renal disease continues to increase, and dialysis is offered to older and more medically complex patients. Pain is problematic in up to one-half of patients receiving dialysis and may result from renal and nonrenal etiologies. Opioids can be prescribed safely, but the patient's renal function must be considered when selecting a drug and when determining the dosage. Fentanyl and methadone are considered the safest opioids for use in patients with end-stage renal disease. Nonpain symptoms are common and affect quality of life. Phosphate binders, ondansetron, and naltrexone can be helpful for pruritus. Fatigue can be managed with treatment of anemia and optimization of dialysis, but persistent fatigue should prompt screening for depression. Ondansetron, metoclopramide, and haloperidol are effective for uremia-associated nausea. Nondialytic management may be preferable to dialysis initiation in older patients and in those with additional life-limiting illnesses, and may not significantly decrease life expectancy. Delaying dialysis initiation is also an option. Patients with end-stage renal disease should have advance directives, including documentation of situations in which they would no longer want dialysis.

### Mesenteric ischemia [^115Qc3Xq]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

MI remains a highly lethal entity. Improving survival requires an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. High-risk patients with severe abdominal pain and a paucity of physical findings should be undergo emergent imaging in a search for this disease. Improvements in laboratory tests and advances in imaging techniques may improve the ability to diagnose MI earlier in its course, before irreversible damage has occurred. Many treatment modalities are available and should be tailored to each individual case. By recognizing and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, the cycle of protracted complications may be broken. A decrease in the mortality from MI finally is occurring. Early recognition and aggressive treatment finally may allow clinicians to have a marked impact on patient survival.

### Intradialytic parenteral nutrition improves nutritional status in a complex cystic fibrosis patient with redo double lung transplant and end-stage renal disease [^113uE7dy]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

This case study reports on the use of intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) to address severe malnutrition in a 38-year-old woman, redo double lung transplant recipient with a complex medical history including cystic fibrosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. Gastroparesis and severe postprandial abdominal pain limited oral/enteral nutrition input. The addition of IDPN resulted in a dry weight increase of 13.6% over a 12-month period and an improvement in the patient's malnutrition status from severe (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG SGA) C24) to moderate (PG SGA B7). The patient stated she would recommend IDPN to others in a similar situation. Management of patients with coexisting cystic fibrosis and ESRD with or without haemodialysis requires patient engagement in treatment planning and a multidisciplinary team approach for clinical judgement in the absence of guidelines. As advances in medical care see more patients with these coexisting conditions, IDPN may provide an increasingly useful adjunct therapy.

Dear Sir,

We read with interest the comprehensive review of renal and extrarenal findings in haemodialysis patients by Degrassi et al. recently published in Insights into Imaging. In this paper, the authors comprehensively describe acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) and renal tumours in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) plus musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and miscellaneous extrarenal complications of haemodialysis. After mentioning the common haemorrhagic diathesis in patients with chronic renal failure, the authors state that "spontaneous non-traumatic bleeding may affect the perinephric and subcapsular spaces, renal parenchyma or collecting system".

Upon finishing reading the article, we thought that emphasizing the issue of spontaneous bleeding in ESRD could be useful for most general radiologists. In patients on chronic haemodialysis, acute abdominal pain is a common presentation which may herald a medical or surgical emergency and carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of the aetiologic spectrum of abdominal complaints and prompt imaging investigation are crucial to providing a correct and timely diagnosis: according to a recent retrospective study, in the haemodialysis population, the main causes of acute abdomen pain are spontaneous intra-abdominal haemorrhage (21.2% of patients) and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (18.1%) in descending order of frequency. Non-traumatic bleeding involving the intra-abdominal organs, retroperitoneum or muscles is significantly more common in ESRD than in the general population, invariably associated with haemodialysis rather than with peritoneal dialysis (PD), and is potentially fatal. Conversely, intestinal perforation and peritonitis largely predominate in patients on PD, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis in ESRD does not significantly differ from that in the general population.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^113v1qRv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Pain with peritoneal dialysis fluid instillation or drainage is recognized and attributed to shearing forces or a "jet" effect; management includes dialysate pH adjustment, slowing infusion, or not completely draining at the end of dialysis, and severe cases may require catheter repositioning or removal. Pain on instillation of PD fluid or draining is a known complication in patients undergoing PD, and the pain may resolve with time, but if it is debilitating, catheter repositioning or removal may be necessary.

### Novel conservative management of chronic kidney disease via dialysis-free interventions [^115maptd]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with progressive uremia, dialysis has traditionally been the dominant treatment paradigm. However, there is increasing interest in conservative and preservative management of kidney function as alternative patient-centered treatment approaches in this population.

Recent Findings

The primary objectives of conservative nondialytic management include optimization of quality of life and treating symptoms of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dietetic-nutritional therapy can be a cornerstone in the conservative management of CKD by reducing glomerular hyperfiltration, uremic toxin generation, metabolic acidosis, and phosphorus burden. Given the high symptom burden of advanced CKD patients, routine symptom assessment using validated tools should be an integral component of their treatment. As dialysis has variable effects in ameliorating symptoms, palliative care may be needed to manage symptoms such as pain, fatigue/lethargy, anorexia, and anxiety/depression. There are also emerging treatments that utilize intestinal (e.g., diarrhea induction, colonic dialysis, oral sorbents, gut microbiota modulation) and dermatologic pathways (e.g., perspiration reduction) to reduce uremic toxin burden.

Summary

As dialysis may not confer better survival nor improved patient-centered outcomes in certain patients, conservative management is a viable treatment option in the advanced CKD population.

### American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine expert panel recommendations on point-of-care ultrasound education and training for regional anesthesiologists and pain physicians-part II: recommendations [^111YzdgB]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Focused assessment with sonography (FAST) in perioperative patients — interpretation and caveats: A positive examination indicates that the patient has at least 300–500 mL of free fluid in the peritoneal space, and after abdominal surgery this amount is rarely benign and almost always indicates ongoing hemorrhage; an exception is intra-abdominal fluid extravasation (IAFE) following hip arthroscopy, which occurs in up to 15% of hip arthroscopy cases and is highly associated with increased pain; chronic pain procedures, such as celiac plexus block, have a risk for bleeding and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and patients will rarely have a positive FAST examination except in cases of chronic pathology; cirrhotic patients commonly accumulate enough ascites to produce a positive FAST examination, and the same applies to end-stage renal patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

### Unexplained colonic necrosis in a patient with end-stage kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis: case report and review of uremic colitis [^116AbmyT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The article has limitations. The lack of histopathology and the lack of advanced imaging (e.g. computed tomography) are major limitations of this case report. Using the visual appearance of the mucosa during colonoscopy to try to make a diagnosis introduces considerable uncertainty. The patient developed abdominal pain before the onset of shock and the necrosis seen on colonoscopy, but it cannot be ruled out that this was an atypical case of ischaemic colitis due to subclinical shock that became apparent only after the patient developed abdominal pain. Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile colitis was not tested. This, of course, can cause life-threatening pancolitis and refractory shock.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^116SMgWa]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an acute, systemic, immune complex-mediated, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. It is characterized by a triad of palpable purpura (without thrombocytopenia), abdominal pain, and arthritis. Most patients have an antecedent upper respiratory illness. More than 90 percent of Henoch-Schönlein purpura cases occur in children younger than 10 years; however, adults with this condition are more likely to experience complications than children. All patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura develop a purpuric rash, 75 percent develop arthritis, 60 to 65 percent develop abdominal pain, and 40 to 50 percent develop renal disease. Because Henoch-Schönlein purpura spontaneously resolves in 94 percent of children and 89 percent of adults, supportive treatment is the primary intervention. Oral prednisone at 1 to 2 mg per kg daily for two weeks has been used to treat abdominal and joint symptoms. A meta-analysis found that corticosteroid use in children reduced the mean time to resolution of abdominal pain and decreased the odds of developing persistent renal disease. Early aggressive therapy with high-dose steroids plus immunosuppressants is recommended for patients with severe renal involvement. Long-term prognosis depends on the severity of renal involvement. End-stage renal disease occurs in 1 to 5 percent of patients.

### Comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings in renal replacement therapy modalities [^113143sA]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The complaints of epigastric pain-burning, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, chronic diarrhea, constipation, dysphagia, odynophagia, burping, regurgitation, heartburn, dyspepsia, dry cough, weight loss, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, pain in the anal region, anal itching, rectal fresh bleeding, incontinence and icterus were questioned and evaluated.

The complaints, findings and existing GIS diseases of the patients in the last 6 months were questioned and compared. The causes and the duration of CKD, the type and duration of RRT, the drugs used and the history of the patients were recorded. The imaging methods applied to the cases in the last 6 months were scanned from the system. In the retrospective scan, the results of upper GIS endoscopy in 45 patients, colonoscopy in 13 patients, abdominal ultrasonography in 95 patients and abdominal tomography in 44 patients were obtained.

Blood samples for necessary laboratory investigations were taken from all patients after 12 hours of fasting. Blood collection was performed before routine hemodialysis seance in hemodialysis patients. Samples from the patients in the predialysis and PD groups were taken on an empty stomach in the morning during their routine controls. Blood samples taken from the antecubital vein were put into different tubes for the purpose of complete blood count, biochemical, hormonal and serological evaluation. Samples taken without anticoagulant for biochemical analyses were incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes and then turned at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes and serums were obtained. After separating the serums for biochemical and hormonal analyses, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density cholesterol (HDL- cholesterol), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) levels in all patients were worked automatically in an Abbott Aeroset (Sentinel Diagnostic, Milano, Italy) autoanalyzer with Abbott brand (Sentinel Diagnostic Milano, Italy) commercial kits.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults… [^1165DTYU]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Associated symptoms often allow the physician to further focus the differential diagnosis. For bowel obstruction, constipation is the symptom with the highest positive predictive value. For appendicitis, right lower quadrant pain has the highest positive predictive value, although migration from periumbilical to right lower quadrant pain and fever also suggest appendicitis. Some conditions that were historically considered useful in diagnosing abdominal pain have been found to have little predictive value. Colic is associated with numerous diseases of hollow viscera. The mechanism of pain is thought to be smooth muscle contraction proximal to a partial or complete obstruction. Although colic is associated with several diseases, the location of colic may help diagnose the cause.

The absence of colic is useful for ruling out diseases such as acute cholecystitis; less than 25 percent of patients with acute cholecystitis present without right upper quadrant pain or colic. 5 Peptic ulcer disease is often associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, 8 although most patients do not know their H. pylori status. In addition, many patients with ulcer disease and serology findings negative for H. pylori report recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include concurrent, episodic gnawing or burning pain; pain relieved by food; and nighttime awakening with pain. Symptoms in patients with abdominal pain that are suggestive of surgical or emergent conditions include fever, protracted vomiting, syncope or presyncope, and evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss.

11 or other gynecologic complications, such as salpingitis or a tuboovarian abscess. Abdominal pain in women may be related to pathology in the pelvic organs. Ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, tuboovarian abscesses, and endometriosis are common causes of lower abdominal pain in women. In women of reproductive age, special attention to pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, and loss of pregnancy is critical in forming an appropriate differential diagnosis. The possibility of pregnancy modifies the likelihood of disease and significantly changes the diagnostic approach.

### Chryseobacterium indologenes peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis [^112U9VqR]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis remains a major complication of peritoneal dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease. Chryseobacterium indologenes is a rare organism that has been reported to cause infections mostly in hospitalised patients with severe underlying diseases. We report the first case of C indologenes peritonitis in a patient on peritoneal dialysis outside of Asia. Our patient with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis grew C indologenes from peritoneal fluid when he presented with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent. The patient responded well to intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy. Tenckhoff catheter did not require removal. This case demonstrates the importance of considering rare causes of peritonitis, such as C indologenes, in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Given the resistance of such organisms to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics, antimicrobial susceptibility testing must be assessed as early as possible to assure appropriate antibiotic coverage to avoid untreated peritonitis leading to peritoneal dialysis failure.

### Hemodynamically unstable: accidental atenolol toxicity? [^115CKYPD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antihypertensive medications, including β-blockers, are widely used in patients with chronic kidney disease. Unlike most β-blockers, atenolol is excreted primarily by the kidney, and its clearance by peritoneal dialysis is poor. These pharmacokinetic factors may predispose patients to gradual accumulation of the drug over time.

Objectives

To review the management of a diagnostic dilemma, the role of glucagon therapy, and the clinical implications of atenolol clearance.

Case Report

A young woman with end-stage renal disease requiring peritoneal dialysis presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability with hypotension and relative bradycardia. The patient reported that she took her regular four antihypertensive agents, including atenolol, with no excess ingestion or recent dose changes. After resuscitation and consideration of a broad differential diagnosis, the most likely cause of the patient's illness was determined to be unintentional atenolol toxicity, with secondary mesenteric ischemia due to a low-flow state that caused her abdominal pain. Glucagon therapy led to rapid correction of the patient's hemodynamic instability and pain.

Conclusion

The unique pharmacokinetics of long-term medications must be considered in patients with impaired clearance, such as this patient with end-stage renal disease treated by peritoneal dialysis. Medications may gradually accumulate to supratherapeutic levels, which over time may lead to symptoms of significant toxicity.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adults with COVID-19 and Renal Impairment

Study GS-US-540–5912 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 163 hospitalized subjects with confirmed COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI; N = 60), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73m2; N = 44), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD; eGFR < 15 mL/minute/1.73m2; N = 59) on hemodialysis received VEKLURY for up to 5 days [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VEKLURY in adults. Adverse reactions (all grades) were reported in 13 (8%) subjects in the VEKLURY group and 3 (4%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions were nausea (1%), abdominal pain (1%), and diarrhea (1%). No subjects experienced serious adverse reactions. One subject permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction: lipase increased.

The frequencies of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3–4) occurring in at least 3% of subjects with COVID-19 receiving VEKLURY in Trial GS-US-540–5912 are presented in Table 13.

### Bowel perforation during peritoneal dialysis catheter placement [^117W9vfr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Interventional nephrologists and radiologists place peritoneal dialysis catheters using the percutaneous fluoroscopic technique in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Nephrologists caring for such patients may have to diagnose and manage the complications resulting from these procedures. Abdominal pain can occur following peritoneal dialysis catheter placement when the local and systemic analgesia wears off. However, abdominal pain with hypotension is suggestive of a serious complication. Bleeding into the abdomen and perforation of the colon or bladder should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In the case reported here, the peritoneogram showed contrast in the bowel, and correct interpretation by the interventionist would have prevented this complication. The characteristic pattern of peritoneogram images in this case will guide interventionists to avoid this complication, and the discussion of the differential diagnosis and management will assist nephrologists in taking care of such patients.

### Painful medial thigh ulcer [^113Z32SM]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and warfarin presented with a new, painful ulcer on her left inner thigh. Gross examination showed retiform purpura with central ulceration and black-brown crusting (Fig 1, A). A biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the lesion showed full-thickness ischemic necrosis with overlying ulceration and diffuse dermal angiomatosis with scattered calcification deposits around the subcutaneous vessels in the subcutaneous septae (Fig 1, B). Grocott methenamine silver and gram stains were negative for fungal or bacterial organisms.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Calciphylaxis
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis
E. Venous ulcer

Answer:
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis – Incorrect. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a condition characterized by a transient hypercoagulable state that causes thrombotic skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis on dorsal or distal extremities within days of initiating warfarin.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Affecting the skin and kidneys, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that often presents with asymmetric polyneuropathy and abdominal pain.
C. Calciphylaxis – Correct. Characterized by small- and medium-vessel calcification causing chronic, low-grade ischemia, calciphylaxis most often occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease, known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Calciphylaxis can also occur in the absence of renal disease (nonuremic calciphylaxis). Risk factors include elevated calcium and phosphate levels, female sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, high alkaline phosphatase, warfarin therapy, low serum albumin, and systemic corticosteroid use. Clinical manifestations include intense local pain with ulceration of the medial thighs from microthrombi causing local infarction with diffuse calcification of small capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue.
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis – Incorrect. Levamisole-induced vasculitis arises from cocaine that has been laced with levamisole, an anthelminthic drug that can be reduced to a fine white powder but has been discontinued for humans. Widespread ulcers often involve the ears and affect at least 10% total body surface area.
E. Venous ulcer – Incorrect. While venous ulcers are the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, they are often shallow and present on calves and ankles.

### Anterior quadratus lumborum block is superior to erector spinae plane block for analgesia after renal transplantation: a randomized controlled trial [^116WZ3VK]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal transplantation is the most effective surgical treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, most patients report moderate to severe pain after the procedure. Continuing perioperative pain causes excessive stress responses, prolongs recovery time, and delays functional recovery of the transplanted kidney. Anesthesiologists need to pay special attention to improve the quality of rehabilitation through the effective control of postoperative pain.

Analgesic methods and drugs are quite limited in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). NSAIDs are not suitable due to their effects on reducing renal blood flow. Opioids have a low clearance rate in patients with CKD and a risk of accumulation. Moreover, the side effects of opioids such as constipation and pruritus are prominent when used alone. The technique of interfacial block is simple to accomplish and does not interfere with renal function; it has been proven to provide obvious analgesic benefits in abdominal surgery. Therefore, interfacial blocks may have an important role in relieving postoperative pain in patients undergoing renal transplantation.

Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and quadratus lumborum block (QLB) are commonly used fascial plane blocks in abdominal surgery. ESPB has been used for postoperative analgesia in open epigastric hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy and has achieved good results. Although there has been no RCT study for ESPB in renal transplantation, Aytuluk performed ultrasound-guided ESPB (0.375% bupivacaine 30 mL) for 3 patients who underwent renal transplantation, and reported that the postoperative numerical rating scale (NRS) scores were lower than 3. Functional recovery of the transplanted kidney was good and no anesthesia-related complications were observed.

QLB is one of the other options for postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery. Since the clinical application of QLB from 2007, a variety of approaches has been developed and a range of different approaches tested. A significant effect on postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery has been demonstrated. In studies related to renal transplantation, patients were more satisfied with one-sided QLB type 2 over a one-sided TAPB with regard to postoperative analgesia.

### Care of the end-stage renal disease patient on dialysis in the ED [^115Tuu6Q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease is a major public health problem. In the United States, more than 350,000 patients are being treated with either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Given the high burden of comorbidities in these patients, it is imperative that emergency physicians be aware of the complexities of caring for acute illnesses in this population. This article reviews the common medical problems that bring patients with end-stage renal disease to the emergency department, and their evaluation and management.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: mesenteric ischemia [^111kRbEc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mesenteric ischemia is a rare, frequently misdiagnosed, serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of mesenteric ischemia, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Mesenteric ischemia is an abdominal vascular emergency that includes superior mesenteric arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, venous mesenteric ischemia, and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. It is associated with a variety of risk factors including older age, cardiovascular disease, hypercoagulable state, and end-stage renal disease. The presentation depends on the underlying pathophysiology. While arterial embolic disease may present with sudden, severe pain, the early stages of the disease and other forms can present with vague symptoms, including generalized abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory testing can suggest the disease with leukocytosis and elevated lactate, but normal values should not be used to exclude the diagnosis. The imaging modality of choice is triple phase computed tomography with non-contrast, arterial, and delayed phases. The initial ED management includes fluid resuscitation, symptomatic therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticoagulation. Emergent consultation with a multidisciplinary team including diagnostic and interventional radiologists and cardiovascular and general surgeons is necessary for definitive treatment.

Conclusions

An understanding of mesenteric ischemia can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### Pain patterns in patients with polycystic kidney disease [^112JHQa7]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common problem in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), but patterns have not been characterized as to frequency and severity. Physicians should be aware of pain problems so an approach to chronic pain management can be pursued.

Methods

One hundred seventy-one completed questionnaires out of 300 distributed to PKD patients whose renal function ranged from normal to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were analyzed. Age at diagnosis of PKD was documented, and patients noted how the diagnosis was made. Location, severity, and frequency of pain were characterized. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity.

Results

There were 94 females and 77 male respondents, with a mean age of 47.4 years. Initial diagnosis of PKD occurred at a mean age of 31.6 years. Caucasians comprised 92.2% of the respondents. Patients' symptoms, a family history of PKD, and discovery of PKD during evaluation for hypertension or hematuria were the most frequent factors that led to the diagnosis. Order of frequency of pain was: low back pain, abdominal pain, headache, chest pain, and leg pain. Severity of pain, documented by the VAS intensity, was 4 to 5/10 in the majority of patients.

Conclusion

Pain, which can be diffuse, is the most frequent symptom that led to the diagnosis of PKD in patients who responded to this questionnaire, and occurs with greater frequency than generally appreciated. Physicians need to obtain a detailed history about pain in their PKD population so as to allow an approach to pain management.

### A 59-year-old man with fatigue and abdominal pain [^115oXmPa]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man with a history of nephrolithiasis and gastroesophageal reflux who sought evaluation for fatigue and abdominal pain. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is iteratively refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### When ESKD complicates the management of pain [^113tBmmN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported by patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and negatively impacts their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), dialysis adherence, healthcare utilization, and mortality. There are a number of patient-related and health system-related barriers that make it very challenging to treat pain in these patients. Moreover, the limited availability of efficacious and safe nonopiate analgesic options has led to over-use of opioids in this population. We propose a framework for pain assessment and tailored treatment using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches to optimize pain management and opioid use. Additionally, we recommend system-level changes to improve care coordination and pain management in ESKD patients.

### Unexplained colonic necrosis in a patient with end-stage kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis: case report and review of uremic colitis [^116mznEC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

An enhanced abdominal CT scan can help pinpoint the cause of ischaemia. Colonoscopy is a very sensitive and specific way to assess colon ischaemia but does not always allow a doctor to make a definitive diagnosis; however, biopsy can distinguish between inflammatory, infectious, and ischaemic colitis. In early ischaemia, the mucosa may appear pale and oedematous with scattered congested areas. Severe ischaemia may be characterized by submucosal oedema, which is characterized by blue or black nodules, and bleeding. These submucosal lesions are most commonly observed in the first 2–3 days after an ischaemic attack and resolve rapidly. Colonoscopy should be performed as early as possible, preferably within the first 3 days after symptom onset, to ensure optimal diagnostic potential.

In this case, the patient was transferred to the ICU due to delirium. After adequate haemodialysis, the patient's neurological symptoms disappeared. Cerebral angiography performed two years earlier revealed no plaque or stenosis in the arteries, and uraemic encephalopathy was suspected. No abdominal distension was found during the physical examination, no painful expression was found when pressing the abdomen, and bowel sounds could be heard. Therefore, the abdomen was not the focus of treatment. During the 4 days of ICU treatment, the patient received two enemas to stimulate bowel movements, after which the patient passed stools. An abundance of intestinal gas was observed on plain abdominal film. The patient had total colonic oedema and patchy mucosal necrosis in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon to the end of the caecum. The colonoscopist speculated that the patient had the same problem in the entire digestive tract, and the surgeon was unable to operate. The patient did not develop hypotension during haemodialysis, and shock developed only after the onset of abdominal pain. The patient had history of constipation, had no history of diabetes, heart disease or connective tissue disease. After transfer to the ICU, continuous heparin anticoagulation was performed, and the D-dimer concentration was less than 1000 ng/mL. Unfortunately, no pathology was performed to determine the cause of his intestinal lesions. Previous studies have shown that ischaemic enteritis is characterized by segmental necrotic changes. This patient's colonoscopy revealed a lesion that affected his entire colon, which has not been previously reported. The cause of this patient's condition may not have been any of the above mentioned causes of ischaemic enteritis. Uremic colitis has been reported and there is (very old) experimental evidence that uremia can cause colitis. A previous study of endoscopy in patients with CKD suggested that ischaemic colitis may occur in up to 3% of patients with CKD, and an autopsy study of 78 patients with ESKD on haemodialysis suggested that colitis is common (although severe colitis is rare). We suspect that this is a case of fulminant uremic colitis.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing treatment by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [^117MbvCo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment.

Methods

Patients undergoing HD or chronic ambulatory PD in the Department of Renal Medicine of our hospital were asked to complete a locally validated Rome II questionnaire. The same questionnaire was also administered to age- and gender-matched medical outpatients without renal failure, and community subjects. Patients on HD and their outpatient controls also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Results

A total of 148 patients with end-stage renal disease (HD 100, PD 48) completed the study. Their results were compared with those of 148 age- and gender-matched medical outpatients without renal failure and 148 randomly selected community controls. Patients on dialysis treatment were more likely to have abdominal pain, use laxatives, and report symptoms consistent with functional vomiting and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (70%, 55%, 16%, and 25%) than age- and gender-matched medical outpatients without renal failure (21%, 11%, 1%, and 6%) and community controls (16%, 4%, 0%, and 8%). Among HD patients and their outpatient controls, the differences appeared to be unrelated to anxiety or depression.

Conclusions

Abdominal pain, laxative use, functional vomiting, and IBS were more common in uremic individuals than in controls without renal failure. Our data have not shown whether these differences are due to the uremic state itself, or, alternatively, its treatment.

### Complications of peritoneal dialysis part I: mechanical complications [^111sHEkg]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a form of KRT that offers flexibility and autonomy to patients with ESKD. It is associated with lower costs compared with hemodialysis in many countries. However, it can be associated with unexpected interruptions to or discontinuation of therapy. Timely diagnosis and resolution are required to minimize preventable modality change to hemodialysis. This review covers mechanical complications, including leaks, PD hydrothorax, hernias, dialysate flow problems, PD-related pain, and changes in respiratory mechanics. Most mechanical complications occur early, either as a result of PD catheter insertion or the introduction of dialysate and consequent increased intra-abdominal pressure. Late mechanical complications can also occur and may require different treatment.

A 53-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis (PD) presented with a 3-month history of intermittent numbness and paraesthesia over the anterior aspect of the right thigh. The patient noticed the pain was worse on walking and related to dialysis sessions. An examination revealed no neurovascular abnormalities or abdominal masses. However, there was subjective paraesthesia in the distribution of the right lateral cutaneous nerve. Subsequent nerve conduction studies revealed the cause of the patient's symptoms. She was diagnosed with meralgia paraesthetica. Her symptoms resolved when the dialysis regime was modified.

Gastrointestinal complications are known to commonly occur in patients with renal failure. Uremia and dialysis have long been speculated to increase the risk of lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and accessory organs. In addition, gastrointestinal procedures such as gastrointestinal bypass surgery and the administration of colonoscopy preparations can lead to the development of renal complications. Results from studies that have attempted to define the association between renal dysfunction and gastrointestinal complications are, however, conflicting and limited by small and varied sample populations. No clear management guidelines currently exist for many of the gastrointestinal problems that accompany renal failure. This Review examines the existing data on gastrointestinal complications in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease and aims to outline the etiology and management of common gastrointestinal disorders in such patients.

### "Cecal gangrene": a rare cause of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis [^1151rMVD]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report on a 58-year-old man with known diabetes, congestive heart failure, and need for chronic hemodialysis presenting with right lower abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Although initial clinical findings were highly suggestive of acute appendicitis, CT revealed marked circumferential wall thickening of the cecum, which was interpreted as cecal infarction by the radiologist. Intraoperatively, cecal necrosis was confirmed, but the ileocecal valve and, especially, the appendix showed no ischemia. No vascular occlusions were found. Histopathologic analysis of the resected cecum demonstrated isolated transmural cecal necrosis with marked infiltration of the cecal wall by numerous bacteria and neutrophils. We present the CT features and histopathologic findings of isolated cecal gangrene, review the pathogenesis of occlusive and nonocclusive cecal ischemia or infarction, and discuss the role of bacterial superinfection as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of isolated cecal necrosis which should be included in the differential diagnosis of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1122vu4s]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcaemic uremic arteriolopathy or calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The reported incidence in haemodialysis patients is variable and largely reliant on registry data with reported incidences of 0.04% in Germany and 0.35% in the United States. The mortality rate can be as high as 60–80%. It is characterised by the onset of a painful violaceous rash which progresses to ischaemic necrotic ulcers. The lesions are predominantly centrally distributed in areas of high adiposity (e.g. abdomen and thighs).

Pain is a hallmark of this disease and can be extremely difficult to control. Pain resulting from calciphylaxis is classically an acute ischaemic pain resulting from tissue damage as a consequence of arteriolar occlusion causing hypoperfusion, ischaemia and infarction of tissues. As with all acute pain the severity and characteristics of the pain will vary from patient to patient. The acute pain may be a continuous background pain or evoked by movement or procedures. In addition to the background level of pain there may be episodes of unprovoked exacerbations of breakthrough pain. Opioids have been a key component in managing pain.

Current management of calciphylaxis involves a multimodal approach including medical (stopping medications which have been associated with increased risk e.g. calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, vitamin K antagonists, and starting new medication e.g. sodium thiosulphate, cinacalcet, and antibiotics), surgical (e.g. parathyroidectomy, wound debridement, and amputation) and modification of dialysis regimens such as varying dialysate calcium concentrations and increasing dialysis frequency.

Available evidence suggests that pain management in calciphylaxis is unsatisfactory with differing practice across the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally. A knowledge and practice survey was conducted to obtain information on physicians current practice of the management of pain in patients with calciphylaxis in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The aim of the data collection was to describe practice patterns and in light of this data develop a practice guideline for pain management in patients with calciphylaxis. The guidelines described are the first step in developing a rationale for managing complex pain in a group of frail patients with multiple comorbidities.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1153bj9b]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 Question 4 (nonopioid analgesics) — evidentiary table summarizes emergency department (ED) studies with populations and eligibility criteria. Afshar 2015 evaluated "Randomized or quasi-randomized studies of adult patients with renal colic that included at least one nonopioid arm and reported a pain outcome" and reports "37 studies". Barnaby 2019 (2 affiliated academic EDs, Jun–Nov 2017) describes "220 patients, mean (± SD) age 42 (± 12) years" with inclusion "Age 21–64 years, pain severe enough to warrant IV opioids". Chinn 2019 (single ED in the United States, between Jan and Aug 2018) included "Age 18–64 years, weight 60–120 kg, < 7 days of severe abdominal pain (requiring opioids), requiring additional analgesia 1 h after receipt of ED pain medication". Farnia 2016 (ED in Iran, Aug 2012 through Aug 2013) lists "87, mean age 49 years" and included "Age 18–65, new-onset upper abdominal pain with concerns for biliary origin, VAS > 3, gallstones in bile duct evidenced by ultrasound and labs". Fraquelli 2016 summarizes "12 trials of 823 participants age ranges 18–86 years" as "RCTs recruiting participants presenting with biliary colic and comparing NSAIDs vs. no intervention, placebo, or other drugs".

### Unexplained colonic necrosis in a patient with end-stage kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis: case report and review of uremic colitis [^111xYy9g]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Intestinal necrosis in uremic patients has been reported but is rare.

Case presentation

A 56-year-old male patient who underwent long-term regular haemodialysis was admitted to the hospital due to involuntary shaking of the limbs and nonsense speech. The patient's symptoms improved after continuous blood purification under heparin anticoagulation, rehydration, sedation, and correction of electrolyte disturbances. However, the patient experienced a sudden onset of abdominal pain and a rapid decrease in blood pressure; high-dose norepinephrine were required to maintain his blood pressure. A plain abdominal radiograph performed at bedside showed intestinal dilation. Colonoscopy revealed inflammation and oedema of the entire colon, with purulent secretions and multiple areas of patchy necrosis. The cause of intestinal ischaemia was not clear.

Conclusions

Although rare, previous causes of uremic colitis have been reported. As the patient developed abdominal pain before the onset of shock and the necrosis was seen on colonoscopy, we suspect that this is a case of fulminant uremic colitis.

### Intestinal fistula accompanied by recurrent peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis: a case report [^113x2nGj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Discussion

Peritoneal dialysis is widely used in patients with chronic renal failure because of its safety and effectiveness. However, complications, such as peritonitis, abdominal pain, and intestinal fistula, may occur. Even with strict operating standards, complications cannot be avoided. The diagnostic features of intestinal perforation in peritoneal dialysis patients include watery diarrhea, difficulty in drainage of the peritoneal dialysis fluid, and symptoms and signs of peritonitis. If treatment is delayed, the consequences can be serious; the reported mortality rate is as high as 46–57%. Once an intestinal fistula occurs, it must be treated as soon as possible, and the peritoneal dialysis catheter should be removed promptly. Surgical repair of the fistula may be needed. Most dialysis-associated perforations occur in the colon, followed by the cecum and rectum, whereas perforation of the small intestine is rare.

Intestinal perforation associated with peritoneal dialysis can be divided into acute and chronic forms. Acute perforation may occur with implantation of the dialysis catheter. Extensive peritoneal calcification, which may develop after repeated peritonitis, can predispose to bowel perforation. In our patient, we suspect that repeated peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis led to the intestinal perforation, which has rarely been reported. Other factors include intestinal tumors, mesenteric ischemic diseases, which may also cause intestinal perforation. Patients with recurrent abdominal infections are prone to bacterial or fungal peritonitis and are also at high risk for intestinal perforation. Enlargement of the kidneys caused by polycystic kidney disease may lead to increased intra-abdominal pressure and intestinal perforation. Perforation of an inflamed intestinal diverticulum is regarded as a major cause of intestinal perforation. The reported incidence of colonic diverticula in patients with end-stage polycystic kidney disease is high, at approximately 80%.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^112xn1EL]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

CTAP contrast requirements — prior evaluation considerations for undifferentiated abdominal pain: The writing group discussed whether prior CTAP without contrast should count as adequate evaluation and noted that CTAP with intravenous (IV) contrast best detects most causes of abdominal pain, including vascular dissections and occlusions and conditions requiring preparation for diagnosis such as small malignancies or abscesses. IV contrast is not required for all conditions, and some patients may not receive IV contrast due to contrast allergy, inadequate vascular access, or renal dysfunction. When pain remains undifferentiated after noncontrast CTAP, physicians should consider the limitations of noncontrast CTAP relative to the differential diagnosis to determine whether CTAP with IV contrast is indicated.

### Association of constipation with risk of end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115bYNxr]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue. If CKD couldn't be adequately controlled, it would progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires costly intervention of renal replacement therapy and will be a great burden to family and government. There are many risk factors for CKD, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, analgesics, herbs, kidney stones, and infection, etc. However, even under strict control, CKD may still progress. Some other unknown risk factors may be ignored.

In the near decades, human gut was found to harbor 10 11 to 10 12 microbiota which influence the nutrition, metabolism, and immune function of the host and has been recognized as an endogenous organ inside the body. In healthy people, the gut microbiota interact harmoniously with the host in mutualistic relationship, so called symbiosis. However, many chronic diseases will disturb the gut microbiome and turn symbiosis to dysbiosis, which was related to some complications and the worsening of the chronic disease. The interaction between kidney and gut, so called kidney-gut axis, was one of the concerned. In the "kidney-to-gut" side, CKD is associated with fluid overload with intestinal wall edema, accumulation of uremic toxin, decreased consumption of dietary fibers, oral use of phosphate binders and/or iron, and so on. These factors all contribute to intestinal dysbiosis. Constipation is the most common gut abnormality in CKD patients. In the opposite "gut-to-kidney" side, gut microbiota also produce some uremia retention molecules, like indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, which are fully excreted by the normal kidney but would accumulate as kidney fails. The increased levels of these metabolites are associated with chronic inflammation, increased cardiovascular mortality and the progression of CKD. The interaction between kidney and gut would be a vicious cycle that worsen the kidney further. Constipation might be an indicator of gut dysbiosis in CKD patients and suggested an ongoing vicious cycle. However, the constipation in CKD patients was usually ignored and not even thought as a risk factor of the progression of CKD.

Whether the CKD patients with constipation had poor profiles of gut microbiome inside was not known yet. We hypothesized CKD patients with constipation may suffer from rapid progression of kidney disease for the negative effects of poor profiles of gut microbiome. The current study tried to explore the relationship between CKD progression and constipation by analyzing a nationwide database.

### When ESKD complicates disease management: GI bleeding and other GI illnesses [^116ae93A]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

The presentation of gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses is similar in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in the general population. However, there are several instances where kidney failure and renal replacement therapy (RRT) can affect the course of the disease and its management. In this section, we will focus on unique factors of GI illnesses that should be considered in the ESKD population with and without residual kidney function (RKF). We will also discuss the role of RRT modalities in the occurrence and treatment of GI disease.

### Exenatide (Byetta) [^111kv4VF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, including BYETTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. After initiation of BYETTA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue BYETTA and initiate appropriate management.

5.2 Never Share a BYETTA Pen Between Patients

BYETTA pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving BYETTA in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Drug Interactions (7)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.4 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, BYETTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to BYETTA that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of BYETTA.

BYETTA is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.5 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including BYETTA, has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. BYETTA is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis.

### The impact of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis on mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients [^112tGRxa]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study definitions

PD-related peritonitis was diagnosed based on at least two of the following criteria: (1) abdominal pain or cloudiness of PD effluent; (2) white blood cell count in PD effluent > 100/μL with > 50% polymorphonuclear leukocytes; and (3) a positive culture from PD effluent. CV death was defined as death due to ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, other heart disease, or cerebrovascular events. Death related to peritonitis was defined as death of a patient with active peritonitis, or admitted with peritonitis or within 2 weeks of a peritonitis episode. When discussing the causes of deaths, the PD team, which consists of three nephrologists in our PD centre, reviewed the details of the individual medical records. Regarding inherent difficulties in assigning cause of death to infection or cardiovascular events, we tended to assign the death to the primary reason for hospitalization when the two coexisted.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Differences in the clinical presentation, management, and in-hospital outcomes of acute aortic dissection in patients with and without end-stage renal disease [^117JtQYU]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics, clinical presentation, comorbidities, and laboratory and imaging findings in AAD patients with and without ESRD

A total of 217 patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of AAD between 1 May 2011–30 November 2018 were studied. A total of 71 patients were identified with a history of ESRD, and 51 patients underwent dialysis therapy. AAD was discovered by computerized tomography in most patients (93%). The imaging modality of choice did not differ between the patients with and without ESRD for diagnosing aortic dissection. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical presentations of the patients with and without ESRD are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Male patients were dominant in both groups (71.8 and 77.4%). There were no significant differences in the distributions of age and gender. Hypertension was significantly more common among the patients with ESRD. However, smokers and alcoholic individuals were significantly less common among the patients with ESRD. In a laboratory test performed on admission, the patients with ESRD had lower leucocyte and platelet counts than the patients without ESRD, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Typical presentations with chest or back pain, particularly those with an abrupt or migrating nature, occurred less commonly among the patients with ESRD. Type B aortic dissection was significantly more common among the patients with ESRD (76.1% versus 60.3%, p = 0.02).

### Alvimopan [^115dfrNu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Gastrointestinal-Related Adverse Reactions in Opioid-Tolerant Patients

Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of mu-opioid receptor antagonists, such as alvimopan. Since alvimopan acts peripherally, clinical signs and symptoms of increased sensitivity would be related to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea). Patients receiving more than 3 doses of an opioid within the week prior to surgery were not studied in the postoperative ileus clinical trials. Therefore, if alvimopan is administered to these patients, they should be monitored for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Alvimopan is contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately prior to taking alvimopan [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment

Patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of serious adverse reactions (including dose-related serious adverse reactions) because up to 10-fold higher plasma concentrations of alvimopan have been observed in such patients compared with patients with normal hepatic function. Therefore, the use of alvimopan is not recommended in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.5 End-Stage Renal Disease

No studies have been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease. Alvimopan is not recommended for use in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

5.6 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Complete Gastrointestinal Obstruction

No studies have been conducted in patients with complete gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients who have surgery for correction of complete bowel obstruction. Alvimopan is not recommended for use in these patients.

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pancreatic and Gastric Anastomoses

Alvimopan has not been studied in patients having pancreatic or gastric anastomosis. Therefore, alvimopan is not recommended for use in these patients.

### Rare, overlooked, or underappreciated causes of recurrent abdominal pain: a primer for gastroenterologists [^1119movR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common reason for repeated visits to outpatient clinics and emergency departments, reflecting a substantial unmet need for timely and accurate diagnosis. A lack of awareness of some of the rarer causes of recurrent abdominal pain may impede diagnosis and delay effective management. This article identifies some of the key rare but diagnosable causes that are frequently missed by gastroenterologists and provides expert recommendations to support recognition, diagnosis, and management with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes.

### Pancreatitis with normal lipase and amylase in setting of end-stage renal disease [^112PVo1E]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis with normal lipase and amylase level is a rare phenomenon. This is especially true in patient with end-stage renal disease as lipase and amylase are renally excreted. Literature review reveals previous case report of pancreatitis with normal lipase and amylase level, however, none of them occurred in the setting of end-stage renal disease. Our case is the first such reported case of pancreatitis in such setting. Here we report a 30year old male with past medical history of end-stage renal disease who presented in emergency department with acute abdominal pain. Laboratory work up revealed normal lipase and amylase level. However, radiological work up was consistent with pancreatitis. This case report highlight the importance of taking the overall clinical picture rather than laboratory work up to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Furthermore, this should also serve an important reminder for clinicians to further investigate where clinical suspicion for pancreatitis is high.

### Abdominal pain in special populations [^115JAmDF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation and management of acute abdominal pain in special populations can be challenging for the emergency physician. This article focuses on two specific populations: patients with altered immunologic function and postprocedural patients. Recognition of life-threatening abdominal diseases may be delayed in immunosuppressed patients because of the atypical presentations of these conditions. In postprocedural patients, evaluation of acute abdominal symptoms requires an understanding of the complications of procedures often performed by others. The unique characteristics of abdominal pain in these two populations and, more specifically, which diseases to consider and how to use appropriate testing to detect life-threatening conditions, are discussed.

### Patient-centred approaches for the management of unpleasant symptoms in kidney disease [^112LxEE6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently experience unpleasant symptoms. These can be gastrointestinal (constipation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), psychological (anxiety and sadness), neurological (lightheadedness, headache and numbness), cardiopulmonary (shortness of breath and oedema), dermatological (pruritus and dry skin), painful (muscle cramps, chest pain and abdominal pain) or involve sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders and fatigue. These symptoms often occur in clusters, with one of them as the lead symptom and others as secondary symptoms. Uraemic toxins (also called uremic toxins) are often considered to be the main cause of CKD-associated symptom burden, but treatment of uraemia by dialysis often fails to resolve them and can engender additional symptoms. Indeed, symptoms can be exacerbated by comorbid conditions, pharmacotherapies, lifestyle and dietary regimens, kidney replacement therapy and ageing. Patients with kidney disease, including those who depend on dialysis or transplantation, should feel actively supported in their symptom management through the identification and targeting of unpleasant symptoms via a tailored palliative care approach. Such an approach may help minimize the burden and consequences of kidney disease, and lead to improved patient outcomes including health-related quality of life and better life participation.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^111xnHqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Atkinson et al thoroughly reviewed literature on commonly used opioids in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and ultimately hypothesized that opioids primarily undergoing hepatic phase II metabolism that yields inactive metabolites (such as tapentadol) are highly protein bound, have larger molecular weights, and have higher lipophilicity (to avoid being dialyzed), should be considered first in this population of patients.

NSAIDs have well-documented renal toxicities that can cause acute kidney injury and influence progression of CKD.–They have been shown to increase sodium retention and edema, cause hyperkalemia through decreased delivery of potassium to the distal tubule, cause acute renal failure through disruption of the renal hemodynamic balance, cause nephrotic syndrome by increasing lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and cause acute and chronic renal papillary necrosis through direct toxicity. Nonrenal toxicities include increased blood pressure, decreased antihypertensive effects of several medications, and increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleed risk.

The totality of these toxicities led the American Society of Nephrology to recommend that all patients with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes avoid NSAID use, in their "Choosing Wisely" campaign published in 2012. This recommendation should further be extended to patients on dialysis. Residual renal function has proven to be important even after commencement of dialysis, because of its implication on dialysis adequacy.NSAIDs have been shown to negatively impact residual renal function, and dialysis patients are more susceptible to fluid and electrolyte changes, have blood pressures that are more difficult to control, and are at higher risk for GI bleeds; thus dialysis patients may be at an even greater risk of harm from NSAID use than the general population.,

Acetaminophen is most commonly used to alleviate mild pain symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, or backaches. The mechanism in which acetaminophen provides analgesia remains unclear; however, it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly the spinal cord, with minimal effects on the kidneys. The majority of data supports its renal safety when used in lower, intermittent doses, and only few cases have reported acute renal toxicity after ingestion of larger doses. Chronic high-dose acetaminophen may cause renal function decline (decrease in glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min) and has been reported in women who consumed > 3,000 g of acetaminophen over 11 years and has also been associated with tubular necrosis with long-term use (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.28–3.24).

### Rationale and study protocol of ACQUIRE, a prospective, observational study measuring quality of life, treatment preference and treatment satisfaction of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients in Europe [^114AaFGj]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited renal disease, affecting 3.29/10,000 people in Europe. ADPKD is caused by genetic mutations in one of two genes: polycystin 1 (PKD1) or polycystin 2 (PKD2), with approximately 10% of cases caused by an apparent de novo mutation. The disease is characterized by the progressive increase in the number and size of bilateral renal cysts, causing hypertension, kidney pain and eventually kidney failure. Symptoms of ADPKD can range from mild to severe, and worsen as disease progresses. Early symptoms can include: abdominal pain, high blood pressure, hematuria, increased vulnerability to urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis, and urine concentrating defects. ADPKD is a leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD); by the age of 60 approximately 50% of ADPKD patients will progress to ESRD and will require either dialysis or a kidney transplant. ADPKD accounts for 5–10% of all ESRD patients.

Until recently, all treatments targeted the signs and symptoms of ADPKD, such as high blood pressure and pain, as a patient progressed to ESRD. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, is the first licensed ADPKD treatment shown to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency. Tolvaptan promotes aquaresis and fluid loss, reducing the amount of fluid stored in the kidneys. Additionally, it reduces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, reducing the rate of kidney cell cyst proliferation. Treatment with tolvaptan during early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been shown to slow total kidney volume growth and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline. Based on clinical trial data, long-term treatment models indicate tolvaptan may delay ESRD by up to 6.5 years. However, tolvaptan treatment can lead to hepatotoxicity and higher doses are not well tolerated due to a range of side effects, including aquaresis and polydipsia. In order to limit the impact of side effects, a large number of patients take a maximum tolerated dose, rather than the highest dose available, however the effect of tolvaptan on patient quality of life (QoL) has not yet been investigated.

### Peritonitis within a patient on automated peritoneal dialysis [^113SvNdM]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old Caucasian woman was hospitalised on the 10 October 2016, reporting abdominal pain that had been constant for 4 days prior to hospitalisation and exacerbated by physical activity. The patient had been on APD since 2014 due to end-stage renal disease and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and was on a waiting list for kidney transplantation. The patient had never experienced dialysis-related infections or other complications before the hospitalisation described in this report.

The patient had a prior history of hypertension and psoriasis, but no history of liver cirrhosis.

In April 2016, the patient was hospitalised with pyelonephritis and was treated with intravenous cefuroxime. She was also treated empirically with intraperitoneal gentamicin (80 mg) and vancomycin (2 g), because peritonitis could not be excluded at the time of admission. Peritoneal fluid was collected and did not show any growth, therefore the intraperitoneal antibiotics were discontinued. The cause of the infection was not determined, but it was likely related to an infected cyst in her kidney. On the 12 April, the patient was discharged with oral ciprofloxacin.

Five months later, on the 10 October 2016, the patient was hospitalised reporting of constant abdominal pain for 4 days prior to hospitalisation. She had a 39.4°C fever, nausea and had vomited once. Her vital signs were blood pressure of 152/87 mm Hg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute and 96% oxygen saturation without supplementation.

The peritoneal fluid was cloudy and turbid and a urine test strip was positive for leucocytes. These findings raised the suspicion of peritonitis and prompted the clinician to send the peritoneal fluid for microbiological examinations. The patient's dry body weight was 87.5 kg. At admission, the weight was 89.2 kg. The patient was treated empirically with vancomycin (2 g) and gentamicin (80 mg) intraperitoneally as in the previous hospitalisation. The patient was also treated empirically with intravenous cefuroxime 1.5 g daily and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day.

### Bloody ascites in a patient after transfer from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis [^116pJWjP]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presented with bloody ascites. She had been maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 7 years and had eight episodes of peritonitis. She was eventually transferred to hemodialysis (HD) because of ultrafiltration failure. This was associated with "high" peritoneal transport by peritoneal equilibration test (PET). A period of "peritoneal rest" did not improve PET results. Within a year of transfer to HD, ascites developed, which was hemorrhagic upon evaluation. A computed tomography (CT) scan suggested encapsulating sclerosing peritonitis, which was confirmed upon peritonoscopy. The patient was treated with prednisone and tamoxifen. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a devastating complication of PD. Although it is rare and its development often unpredictable, this case demonstrates several clinical features commonly observed in the condition. These include more than 6 years on PD, a high transporter status, recurrent peritonitis, and the development of blood-stained dialysis effluent (or ascites if PD has been discontinued, as was the case in this patient). The initial presentation is often incipient with vague abdominal pain. Symptoms are progressive, however, and EPS has a high mortality rate, with most patients dying within 1 year of diagnosis, usually from malnutrition and sepsis. Treatment options include systemic immunosuppression and regular peritoneal irrigation after transfer to HD. Response to treatment is more likely to occur in the early inflammatory stage of EPS, when symptoms are nonspecific and imaging is relatively normal. Hence a high degree of suspicion for the diagnosis should be present in patients "at risk" of this condition, as early diagnosis is essential if progressive encapsulation of the abdominal viscera is to be prevented.

### Endoscopic findings in end-stage renal disease [^1149S7uZ]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may demonstrate a number of gastrointestinal lesions and suffer subsequent complications. Our aim was to investigate the endoscopic findings in these patients and identify the predisposing factors.

Patients and Methods

During a 1-year period (February 2000 to January 2001), we studied consecutive patients with end-stage renal disease who were undergoing routine endoscopy before renal transplantation. The rapid urease test was also performed to detect Helicobacter pylori infection. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for important endoscopic lesions, including esophagitis, gastroduodenal erosions, and peptic ulcers.

Results

We studied 206 patients (124 male, 82 female, mean age 38.9). Of the patients 73.8% were asymptomatic but some patients experienced nausea (12.6%), heartburn (8.7%), and abdominal pain (7.3%). Endoscopy was normal in 74 patients (35.9%). Abnormal endoscopic findings were duodenal erosions (32.0%), antral erosions (22.8%), diffuse antral erythema (27.8%), duodenal ulcer (7.3%), esophagitis (5.8%), angiodysplasia (4.4%), nodular duodenum (2%), and inflammatory gastric polyps (1.5%). The rapid urease test was positive in 58.8% of patients. Important endoscopic lesions were more common in men and in H. pylori-infected patients. Age, duration of dialysis, cause of the ESRD, presence of any symptoms, and hemoglobin levels were not found to be related to these lesions. Most patients with peptic ulcers were asymptomatic.

Conclusions

Duodenal erosions (32.0%), gastric erosions (22.8%), diffuse antral erythema (27.8%) and duodenal ulcer (7.3%) are common lesions in patients with end-stage renal disease. Male gender and H. pylori infection are associated with a higher risk of these lesions. As there is no association between patients' symptoms and gastroduodenal lesions, which may increase the risk of post-transplant complications, the development of diagnostic strategies for the detection of these lesions is recommended.
