## Question

How do you decide which first line therapy to initiate on a patient with diabetic neuropathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to decide which first-line therapy to initiate for a patient with painful diabetic neuropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should verify which medication classes are truly first-line and how their efficacy compares. Next, I will examine patient-specific factors that shift the balance toward one class over another. After that, I need to check dosing, titration, and how to define a therapeutic trial. Finally, I will consider what to do if the first agent fails, including switching, combination therapy, and when to use topical options, while ensuring I integrate glycemic control and nonpharmacologic strategies throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity before jumping into medication selection, because misclassification of pain etiology or underestimation of severity can derail treatment. I should screen for distal symmetric polyneuropathy at least annually and confirm neuropathic pain characteristics such as burning, tingling, allodynia, and sleep or mood impact, using a numeric rating scale to anchor severity and track response, and I should also assess for concurrent mood and sleep disorders since they influence pain perception and treatment choice [^114NCFFK] [^notfound] [^111tF8Bt].

> Wait, let me verify which medication classes are truly first-line and how their efficacy stacks up. The AAN 2022 guideline identifies four classes with comparable effect sizes for pain reduction: gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs, and sodium channel blockers, and the ADA 2025 Standards similarly recommend these as initial pharmacologic options, while AAFP 2024 highlights duloxetine and pregabalin as preferred first-line agents within those classes, reflecting FDA approval and clinical experience [^111MM89j] [^1168nP2x] [^116ji9na].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about picking a single "best" drug; I should confirm that head-to-head superiority is not established. The AAN meta-analytic update shows similar standardized mean differences across classes, making it reasonable to choose based on patient-specific factors rather than presumed class superiority, and I need to ensure I communicate that approximately 30% pain reduction is a realistic goal and that multiple trials may be needed to find the right match [^113gWvDY] [^111m3RdG] [^116PU6Qu].

> I will now examine patient-specific factors that tilt the balance toward one class, but I should double-check each potential contraindication before deciding. For coexisting depression or anxiety, duloxetine or venlafaxine may be advantageous because they treat mood and pain concurrently; for significant renal impairment, I should avoid renally cleared agents like duloxetine and prefer gabapentin with dose adjustment; for hepatic disease, I should avoid duloxetine; for older adults at fall risk or with orthostasis, I should avoid TCAs; for patients with prominent sleep disturbance, TCAs may help; for those prioritizing minimal systemic adverse effects, a topical agent such as the 8% capsaicin patch can be considered early or as adjunct therapy [^1159BCr1] [^112PGeiQ] [^116gb4YW].

> Let me think about dosing and titration, because underdosing and premature abandonment are common pitfalls. I should start low and titrate slowly to a demonstrably effective dose over about 12 weeks, recognizing that many patients in trials received higher-end doses; for example, duloxetine 60 mg daily, pregabalin 300–600 mg daily in divided doses, and gabapentin 1800–3600 mg daily in divided doses are typical effective ranges, and I should confirm tolerability at each step before escalating [^112dCQTK] [^116t5N1B] [^111m3RdG].

> I should confirm how to define a therapeutic trial and when to call it a failure. A reasonable definition is at least 12 weeks at an adequate dose, with failure defined by lack of clinically meaningful pain reduction or intolerable adverse effects; I need to ensure I document baseline pain scores and functional goals so I can judge response objectively and avoid anchoring bias from vague impressions [^112dCQTK] [^111m3RdG].

> Next, I should review what to do if the first agent fails or is not tolerated. If there is no meaningful improvement or adverse effects predominate, I should switch to a different class rather than persist or merely increase dose. If there is partial improvement, I should consider combination therapy using agents with different mechanisms, while counseling that evidence for combination benefit is limited and not all combinations outperform optimized monotherapy [^116NzG9t] [^111giWQS] [^111gLXN2].

> But wait, what if oral therapy is limited by side effects or polypharmacy? I should consider topical options. The 8% capsaicin patch is FDA-approved for painful DPN and can be used as monotherapy or adjunct, particularly when systemic adverse effects are a concern or when oral agents are only partially effective; topical lidocaine can be considered for focal pain, though evidence is less robust than for capsaicin [^116gb4YW] [^111Zn41Z].

> I need to ensure I integrate disease-modifying and supportive care, even though they do not directly relieve neuropathic pain. Optimizing glycemic control slows progression in type 1 and may slow progression in type 2 diabetes, and addressing weight, blood pressure, and lipids is prudent; I should also incorporate foot care education and consider nonpharmacologic options such as exercise and CBT for patients who prefer them or need adjuncts, while setting expectations that complete pain elimination is uncommon [^113soaDA] [^114GzJEj] [^114RQest] [^111m3RdG].

> Let me reconsider the practical flow to ensure nothing is missing. Confirm diagnosis and baseline severity, screen for mood and sleep comorbidity, select a first-line class tailored to comorbidities and preferences, start low and titrate to an effective dose over about 12 weeks, reassess efficacy and tolerability rigorously, switch class if failure or add a second class if partial response, consider topical capsaicin as adjunct or alternative, and maintain comprehensive diabetes care and foot surveillance throughout [^111tF8Bt] [^1168nP2x] [^112dCQTK].

---

First-line therapy for diabetic neuropathy should be **individualized** based on comorbidities, side effects, cost, and patient preferences [^1159BCr1], with **duloxetine or pregabalin** as preferred initial options [^116ji9na] because of their FDA approval and strong evidence [^117K8wQz]. Gabapentin, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine are **alternatives** [^1168nP2x] if duloxetine or pregabalin are unsuitable [^111tF8Bt]. Start low, titrate slowly, and reassess at 2–4 weeks; if there is inadequate response after 12 weeks, switch to a different class or combine agents from different classes [^112dCQTK] [^111giWQS]. Avoid opioids [^112bymCr] and prioritize glycemic control [^113soaDA] to slow progression [^115LHpiU].

---

## Recommended first-line pharmacological options

The ADA 2025 and AAN 2022 guidelines recommend the following **first-line classes** for diabetic neuropathic pain:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) | - Duloxetine <br/> - Venlafaxine | - Duloxetine is FDA-approved for DPN [^117K8wQz] <br/> - Effective for pain and mood [^116t5N1B] <br/> - Avoid in hepatic impairment |
| Gabapentinoids | - Gabapentin <br/> - Pregabalin | - Pregabalin is FDA-approved for DPN [^117K8wQz] <br/> - Effective and well-tolerated <br/> - Dose adjust in renal impairment |
| Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) | - Amitriptyline <br/> - Nortriptyline | - Effective but anticholinergic <br/> - Use cautiously in elderly [^112PGeiQ] |
| Sodium channel blockers | - Carbamazepine <br/> - Oxcarbazepine | - Alternative when first-line agents are not tolerated [^111tF8Bt] |

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety profiles

- **Duloxetine and pregabalin**: Comparable efficacy; duloxetine may be preferred with coexisting depression; pregabalin with renal impairment or when antidepressants are undesirable [^113gWvDY].
- **Gabapentin**: Similar efficacy to pregabalin; preferred if cost is a concern [^notfound].
- **TCAs**: Effective but more side effects (sedation, anticholinergic effects); use cautiously in elderly [^111MM89j].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing medication choice

- **Comorbidities**: Avoid duloxetine in hepatic impairment; adjust gabapentinoids for renal function [^112PGeiQ].
- **Age**: Prefer gabapentinoids or SNRIs over TCAs in elderly due to side effects [^117TGa6U].
- **Cost and access**: Gabapentin is often preferred for cost reasons [^notfound].
- **Patient preferences**: Consider side-effect profiles, dosing frequency, and prior responses [^1159BCr1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Both the ADA 2025 and AAN 2022 recommend a **stepwise approach**, starting with one first-line agent and switching or combining if needed [^113XCGtW]. Opioids are not recommended for initial therapy because of limited efficacy and significant risks [^116fQXXg].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

- **Initial monitoring**: Reassess at 2–4 weeks for efficacy and tolerability.
- **Dose titration**: Increase gradually to effective doses (e.g. duloxetine 60 mg/day; pregabalin 300–600 mg/day) [^111gLXN2].
- **Inadequate response**: Switch to a different class or combine agents after 12 weeks [^112dCQTK].
- **Adverse effects**: Manage proactively (e.g. constipation with TCAs, sedation with gabapentinoids) [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological options should be considered, particularly when medications are contraindicated or as adjuncts. Exercise programs can **improve pain, function, and quality of life** [^114RQest], and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps manage pain and improve coping. Topical agents such as capsaicin 8% patch or lidocaine 700 mg plaster are options for localized pain or when oral therapy is not tolerated [^111Zn41Z] [^116gb4YW].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Preferred first-line agents**: Duloxetine or pregabalin due to FDA approval and strong evidence [^116ji9na].
- **Alternative options**: Gabapentin, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine if preferred agents are unsuitable [^114pHkgo].
- **Individualize therapy**: Based on comorbidities, side effects, cost, and patient preferences [^1159BCr1].
- **Monitor and adjust**: Reassess at 2–4 weeks; switch or combine if inadequate response after 12 weeks [^112dCQTK].
- **Avoid opioids**: Not recommended for initial therapy [^112bymCr].

---

First-line therapy for diabetic neuropathy should be **individualized**, with duloxetine or pregabalin as preferred options, and alternatives such as gabapentin, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine considered based on patient-specific factors. Regular monitoring, dose titration, and switching or combining therapies are essential for optimal outcomes [^111tF8Bt].

Several other international and national clinical practice guidelines on the management of neuropathy are available, including those from the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Pain Society, the German Society for Neurology, and the German National Disease Management Guideline for Diabetic Neuropathy. However, in light of their publication date (before 2016), and/or focus on the management of neuropathic pain in general, any guidance specific to painful DPN may be incomplete, especially as it relates to newer treatment options.

Key AAN, ADA, and AACE recommendations for managing painful DPN are summarized in Table 1. All three organizations advocate a customized stepwise approach, with the choice of pharmacological agent guided by factors such as comorbidities, cost, and potential for DDIs and ADRs.

Table 1
Summary of Current American Academy of Neurology, American Diabetes Association, and American Association of Clinical EndocrinologyGuidelines for the Management of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

Guideline-recommended (although not necessarily FDA-approved) first-line oral options to treat painful DPN include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentinoids, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); the AAN guideline also includes sodium channel blockers. Based on the results of a meta-analysis of Class I and II trials showing comparable estimated effect sizes, the AAN states that it is difficult to recommend any one drug class over another. Later-line therapy involves switching first-line agents or using combinations of pharmacological agents from different classes or pharmacological plus non-pharmacological options.

Capsaicin 8% topical system, the only FDA approved non-oral pharmaceutical to treat painful DPN, is a first-line treatment option in the AACE guidelinesand is recommended in the ADA compendium. The German Diabetes Association (Deutsche Diabetes Gesellschaft, DDG) also positions capsaicin 8% topical system as a first-line treatment for painful DPN, whereas an international expert consensus group considers it a third line analgesic treatment for painful DPN in clinical practice.

### From guideline to patient: a review of recent recommendations for pharmacotherapy of painful diabetic neuropathy [^115Lbnan]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2014). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, affecting, by some estimates, up to one quarter of diabetic patients. Since 2010, no fewer than 5 major international treatment guidelines for painful DPN have been issued, and there are meaningful differences among them. Duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstays of treatment, but the choice of which class or agent to use in any given patient should be informed by patient characteristics. This review seeks to describe the differences among the recently issued guidelines, to assess the evidence on which they are based, and to offer insight into the most appropriate treatment choices based on patient characteristics.

Objective

To update the 2011 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guideline on the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) with a focus on topical and oral medications and medical class effects.

Methods

The authors systematically searched the literature from January 2008 to April 2020 using a structured review process to classify the evidence and develop practice recommendations using the AAN 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual.

Results

Gabapentinoids (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.67), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (SMD 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34–0.60), sodium channel blockers (SMD 0.56; 95% CI, 0.25–0.87), and SNRI/opioid dual mechanism agents (SMD 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38–0.86) all have comparable effect sizes just above or just below our cutoff for a medium effect size (SMD 0.5). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (SMD 0.95; 95% CI, 0.15–1.8) have a large effect size, but this result is tempered by a low confidence in the estimate.

Recommendations Summary

Clinicians should assess patients with diabetes for PDN (Level B) and those with PDN for concurrent mood and sleep disorders (Level B). In patients with PDN, clinicians should offer TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, and/or sodium channel blockers to reduce pain (Level B) and consider factors other than efficacy (Level B). Clinicians should offer patients a trial of medication from a different effective class when they do not achieve meaningful improvement or experience significant adverse effects with the initial therapeutic class (Level B) and not use opioids for the treatment of PDN (Level B).

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy: epidemiology, diagnosis, and pharmacotherapy [^117K8wQz]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the commonest cause of neuropathy worldwide, and its prevalence increases with the duration of diabetes. It affects approximately half of patients with diabetes. DPN is symmetric and predominantly sensory, starting distally and gradually spreading proximally in a glove-and-stocking distribution. It causes substantial morbidity and is associated with increased mortality. The unrelenting nature of pain in this condition can negatively affect a patient's sleep, mood, and functionality and result in a poor quality of life. The purpose of this review was to critically review the current literature on the diagnosis and treatment of DPN, with a focus on the treatment of neuropathic pain in DPN.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review was undertaken, incorporating article searches in electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, OVID) and reference lists of relevant articles with the authors' expertise in DPN. This review considers seminal and novel research in epidemiology; diagnosis, especially in relation to novel surrogate end points; and the treatment of neuropathic pain in DPN. We also consider potential new pharmacotherapies for painful DPN.

Findings

DPN is often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated. Other than improving glycemic control, there is no licensed pathogenetic treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Management of painful DPN remains challenging due to difficulties in personalizing therapy and ascertaining the best dosing strategy, choice of initial pharmacotherapy, consideration of combination therapy, and deciding on defining treatment for poor analgesic responders. Duloxetine and pregabalin remain first-line therapy for neuropathic pain in DPN in all 5 of the major published guidelines by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Academy of Neurology, European Federation of Neurological Societies, National Institute of Clinical Excellence (United Kingdom), and the American Diabetes Association, and their use has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Implications

Clinical recognition of DPN is imperative for allowing timely symptom management to reduce the morbidity associated with this condition.

Recommendation 7 and Statements 7a–7d — trialing, switching, and combining medications: A series of medications may need to be tried to identify the treatment that most benefits a given patient with PDN, and a treatment to reduce neuropathic pain should be considered ineffective when titrated to a demonstrated effective dose and duration without significant pain reduction; the typical duration in which efficacy is demonstrated is approximately 12 weeks, with a range from 4 to 16 weeks. An intervention should be considered intolerable when medication causes adverse effects that outweigh any benefit, and overall failure is defined as either ineffective after 12 weeks or intolerable; choosing a different mechanism or class is expected to increase the likelihood of achieving new pain relief, and if only partial efficacy is achieved, adding a second medication of a different class may provide combined efficacy greater than that provided by each medication individually. Clinicians should counsel patients that a series of medications may need to be tried (Level B), should determine failure as approximately 12 weeks without clinically significant pain reduction or when side effects outweigh benefit (Level B), should offer a trial of a medication from a different effective class when there is no meaningful improvement or significant adverse effects with the initial therapeutic class (Level B), and should offer a trial of a medication from a different class for patients with partial improvement with an initial therapeutic class (Level B).

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^112up3V1]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology Institute (AANI) painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) — prevalence context, effective medication classes, and opioid guidance are outlined as follows: Peripheral neuropathy affects ∼5% of the population and diabetes is the most common cause, and given the effect of PDN on patients' quality of life, appropriate treatment is essential. To increase effective management, the American Academy of Neurology Institute published and recently updated a PDN treatment guideline and the American Academy of Neurology provides quality measures to implement. Based on a meta-analysis, the guideline identified gabapentinoids, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers as having the highest efficacy for PDN, and noted that topical, nontraditional, and nonpharmacologic interventions are available. Based on the considerable potential harms of opioids, the practice guideline update suggested against starting opioids and recommends offering the option of a safe taper of opioids for those already taking them.

### Diagnosing and managing diabetic somatic and autonomic neuropathy [^111sekfr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of diabetic neuropathy can be a major challenge. Late diagnosis contributes to significant morbidity in the form of painful diabetic neuropathy, foot ulceration, amputation, and increased mortality. Both hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors are implicated in the development of somatic and autonomic neuropathy and an improvement in these risk factors can reduce their rate of development and progression. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying treatments for either somatic or autonomic neuropathy, as a consequence of multiple failed phase III clinical trials. While this may be partly attributed to premature translation, there are major shortcomings in trial design and outcome measures. There are a limited number of partially effective FDA-approved treatments for the symptomatic relief of painful diabetic neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^113wtJ85]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Painful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDN) — research needs are highlighted, noting key gaps that should be addressed in future studies, including that few studies have investigated the effect of interventions on quality of life, patient functioning, mood, or sleep and few comparative effectiveness studies have been performed; studies with an active comparator have rarely included more than one other intervention, limiting data to support one intervention over another. Another limitation to the current evidence is the lack of data beyond 16 weeks for any intervention, and future studies should focus on the long-term effects (positive and negative) of opioids in this population to determine whether there is any role for these medications in this population.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111SjetJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^113gWvDY]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) pharmacologic therapy — Level B: In patients with PDN, clinicians should offer TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, and/or sodium channel blockers to reduce pain (Level B). Supporting rationale notes that four classes of oral medications have demonstrated evidence of pain reduction in meta-analyses (TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, and sodium channel blockers), and that the best estimates of the effect sizes and the corresponding CIs are comparable for all of these drug classes, which makes recommendations for one over another difficult.

### The pathogenesis and management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a review [^116N1Ppv]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy has always been a challenging complication of diabetes mellitus. Emerging theories suggest that early dysaesthesia associated with painful neuropathy may act as a marker for the development of the 'at risk' foot, allowing preventative clinical strategies to be undertaken. The mechanisms of neuropathic pain are complex. The authors' intentions are to help members of the diabetes care team better understand and appreciate the diverse symptoms reported by patients. The various treatments available for painful neuropathy are discussed in detail. Robust comparative studies on such treatments are, however, unavailable and the authors have designed a logical approach to management based on best current evidence and their own clinical experience.

American Academy of Neurology painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) guideline — recommendations summary: Clinicians should assess patients with diabetes for PDN (Level B) and those with PDN for concurrent mood and sleep disorders (Level B). In patients with PDN, clinicians should offer tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentinoids, or sodium channel blockers to reduce pain (Level B). Clinicians should offer patients a trial of medication from a different effective class when they do not achieve satisfactory improvement or experience significant adverse effects with the initial therapeutic class (Level B) and not use opioids for the treatment of PDN (Level B).

2.4 Data collection

Data were collected using a standardized electronic case report form and were transferred to a central database via a web‐based data capture system. Some data were extracted from existing electronic health records in Canada, Denmark, France, Norway and Sweden; in these countries, an abbreviated case report form was used. All data not automatically extracted from electronic medical records were manually transferred from existing medical records (electronic or otherwise) to the web‐based data capture system by the participating physicians. To ensure data quality, a risk‐based monitoring model was implemented. On‐site visits were organized at each data collection time point, and key variables entered into the web‐based data capture system were checked against the original medical records for a random sample of 10% of patients at each site. Variables collected at baseline included: physician and site characteristics; patient socioeconomic demographics; physiological variables [including body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure]; laboratory test results (including HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose and cholesterol levels); change in glucose‐lowering therapies and reason(s) for change; co‐morbidities including microvascular (nephropathy, retinopathy or neuropathy) and macrovascular (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or implantable cardioverter defibrillator use) diseases; and co‐medications. In line with the observational nature of the study, clinical variables, such as HbA 1c levels, were measured and recorded in accordance with routine clinical practice; data collection was not mandatory for any of the clinical variables. Similarly, the presence and severity of co‐morbidities such as microvascular and macrovascular complications were not adjudicated and relied on the judgement of the participating physicians. Reasons for changing first‐line therapy and reasons for choosing second‐line therapy were entered in the data capture system by the participating physicians, who selected one or several reasons from predefined lists.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

Adults aged 20–39 years or > 75 years with diabetes — statin initiation or continuation thresholds: Risk may reach intermediate-risk levels by 30–39 years of age, especially with longstanding type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes of ≥ 20 years duration, and for adults aged 20–39 years with long duration of diabetes, albuminuria, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m², retinopathy, neuropathy, or ankle brachial index < 0.9, it may be reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Among adults aged > 75 years with diabetes, a meta-analysis of JUPITER and HOPE-3 demonstrated similar benefits in ASCVD reduction among those aged ≥ 70 years vs < 70 years, with approximately 21% of included patients aged ≥ 75 years and having diabetes; the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline recommends that it is reasonable to continue moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after the age of 75 years if therapy is well-tolerated. The benefit of initiation of statin therapy in individuals aged > 75 years with recent or newly diagnosed diabetes is not well known, so it may be reasonable to have a clinician-patient discussion, and the decision to initiate nonstatin therapy in individuals aged > 75 years should be individualized based on factors such as expected longevity, frailty, polypharmacy, susceptibility to adverse effects of treatment, and goals of care.

Recommendations

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter using simple clinical tests. (B)
Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. (E)
Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient. (E)

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important for a number of reasons: 1) nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable; 2) a number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy; 3) up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, and patients are at risk of insensate injury to their feet; 4) autonomic neuropathy may involve every system in the body; and 5) cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is not currently available, other than improved glycemic control, which may slow progression but not reverse neuronal loss. Effective symptomatic treatments are available for some manifestations of DPN and autonomic neuropathy.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^116t5N1B]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Section 1. Pharmacotherapy

All patients with diabetes should be screened for PDN and, if present, should be appropriately treated. There are three classes of medications that are primarily used for the treatment of PDN. These classes include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentinoids, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The individual medications belonging to each of these classes are presented later in this section. Of all these oral agents, duloxetine, pregabalin, and tapentadol are approved by the FDA for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Drugs belonging to the TCA class are often used and effective for various neuropathic pain conditions; however, these agents have not been studied in randomized control trials specifically for the treatment of PDN.

Opioids, while effective in the short term, are discouraged for use in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. In a systematic review by the CDC, there was weak to nonexistent evidence for the long-term efficacy of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. Instead, long-term opioid use was found to be associated with adverse consequences including addiction and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Interestingly, tapentadol which exerts its effect by both opioids and SNRI-based mechanisms was found to be effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and has an FDA indication for this condition. However, due to the adverse consequences of long-term opioid use, this medication is discouraged by several societies.

At large, all the agents from the SNRI, gabapentinoids, and TCA classes have similar efficacy on neuropathic pain. However, there are agent-specific differences in side effects. Additionally, some of the agents have multiple indications, including depression and anxiety. Clinicians should be mindful of these differences in selecting appropriate medication. While many of these medications are effective for the treatment of PDN, complete elimination of pain is not realistic. Clinicians should have a discussion with patients in setting reasonable analgesic expectations. When initiating an agent, it is advisable to slowly titrate the agent to the effective dose to avoid intolerance and if therapeutic efficacy is not achieved after increasing the dose to the maximum allowable dose for the duration of 12 weeks, the medication can be considered inefficacious. Clinicians should not prematurely declare an agent ineffective when the dose has not been escalated to an appropriate level and the agent has not been tried for an appropriate duration.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: real-world comparison between topical treatment with lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster and oral treatments [^114FW4So]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic neuropathies are common chronic microvascular complications affecting the somatic and/or autonomic nervous system exclusively as a consequence of diabetes mellitus. The most common type is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy defined for clinical practice as 'the presence of symptoms and/or signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction in people with diabetes after the exclusion of other causes'. Many patients with diabetic neuropathy experience neuropathic symptoms such as burning, shooting, or lancinating pain (with or without numbness), tingling sensations, or stimulus-evoked pain (allodynia or hyperalgesia). In Europe, the prevalence of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) ranges from 6% to 34% of patients with diabetes.PDPN affects daily functioning and sleep, often results in anxiety and depression, and is associated with diminished quality of life; the impact on both the individual patient and society is significant.

Symptomatic treatment of neuropathic pain is challenging. Available pharmacological treatment options for painful diabetic neuropathy have been recently reviewed. Recent guidelines for PDPN treatment mainly recommend pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), the antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin, the selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) duloxetine and venlafaxine, and high concentration capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) patch. The lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster (LMP) has been recommended for general peripheral neuropathic pain treatment in recent guidelines. The use of oral medications is limited by a number of factors including systemic side effects, drug–drug interactions, a slow onset of action, the need for titration, and the need for multiple daily dosing, which can lead to suboptimal adherence to treatment. A US claims database analysis estimated that up to 50% of patients discontinued their initial PDPN treatment within 3 months of initiation. In contrast, topical treatments provide pain relief by directly targeting the site of the pain, and the low systemic exposure reduces the risk of systemic side effects. Thus, the benefit/risk ratio of topical treatments may be more favorable than that of oral medications, and they may offer a valuable analgesic treatment option, particularly considering that patients with PDPN are often multimorbid and polymedicated.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^111CpCd8]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a leading cause of pain and disability globally with a lack of consensus on the appropriate treatment of those suffering from this condition. Recent advancements in both pharmacotherapy and interventional approaches have broadened the treatment options for PDN. There exists a need for a comprehensive guideline for the safe and effective treatment of patients suffering from PDN.

Objective

The SWEET Guideline was developed to provide clinicians with the most comprehensive guideline for the safe and appropriate treatment of patients suffering from PDN.

Methods

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) identified an educational need for a comprehensive clinical guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations for PDN. A multidisciplinary group of international experts developed the SWEET guideline. The world literature in English was searched using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BioMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, Meeting Abstracts, and Scopus to identify and compile the evidence for diabetic neuropathy pain treatments (per section as listed in the manuscript) for the treatment of pain. Manuscripts from 2000-present were included in the search process.

Results

After a comprehensive review and analysis of the available evidence, the ASPN SWEET guideline was able to rate the literature and provide therapy grades for most available treatments for PDN utilizing the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Conclusion

The ASPN SWEET Guideline represents the most comprehensive review of the available treatments for PDN and their appropriate and safe utilization.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: consensus recommendations on diagnosis, assessment and management [^1118p4c7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is common, is associated with significant reduction in quality of life and poses major treatment challenges to the practising physician. Although poor glucose control and cardiovascular risk factors have been proven to contribute to the aetiology of DPN, risk factors specific for painful DPN remain unknown. A number of instruments have been tested to assess the character, intensity and impact of painful DPN on quality of life, activities of daily living and mood. Management of the patient with DPN must be tailored to individual requirements, taking into consideration the co-morbidities and other factors. Pharmacological agents with proven efficacy for painful DPN include tricyclic anti-depressants, the selective serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors, anti-convulsants, opiates, membrane stabilizers, the anti-oxidant alpha-lipoic acid and topical agents including capsaicin. Current first-line therapies for painful DPN include tricyclic anti-depressants, the serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor duloxetine and the anti-convulsants pregabalin and gabapentin. When prescribing any of these agents, other co-morbidities and costs must be taken into account. Second-line approaches include the use of opiates such as synthetic opioid tramadol, morphine and oxycodone-controlled release. There is a limited literature with regard to combination treatment. In extreme cases of painful DPN unresponsive to pharmacotherapy, occasional use of electrical spinal cord stimulation might be indicated. There are a number of unmet needs in the therapeutic management of painful DPN. These include the need for randomized controlled trials with active comparators and data on the long-term efficacy of agents used, as most trials have lasted for less than 6 months. Finally, there is a need for appropriately designed studies to investigate non-pharmacological approaches.

Patients diagnosed with renal disease, coronary heart disease and stroke were 4.20 (p < 0.0001) and 2.22 (p < 0.0001) times more likely to be prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors as first-line outpatient treatment for T2DM. Metformin was more likely to be initiated in patients with diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic nephropathy, the odds of which were 0.74 (p < 0.0001), 0.94 (p = 0.16) and 0.96 (p = 0.22), respectively. With every 1 year increase in age at the index date, the odds of being prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors was 1.06 times (p < 0.0001) more likely than metformin. With every 1 kg/m² increase in BMI and 1% increase in HbA1c level, metformin was more likely to be prescribed as the first-line AD therapy vs DPP-4 inhibitors, with odds of 0.90 (p < 0.0001) and 0.83 (p < 0.0001), respectively (Table 2).

Clinicians should assess patients with PDN for the presence of concurrent mood and sleep disorders and treat them as appropriate (Level B), noting that patients with diabetes are more likely to have mood and sleep disorders than the general population; mood and sleep can both influence pain perception, and treating concurrent mood and sleep disorders may help reduce pain and improve quality of life.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes: too little too late [^1137Ebuh]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes is poorly managed because of its insidious onset, delayed diagnosis and more complex aetiology resulting from the contribution of not only hyperglycaemia, but also ageing, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and obesity. Because there is no US Food and Drug Adminstration-approved disease-modifying therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the key to ameliorating it in type 2 diabetes has to be through earlier diagnosis and timely multi-factorial risk factor reduction. The management of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy also requires a detailed appraisal of the choice of therapy, taking into account efficacy, patient wishes, comorbidities, side effect profile and potential for abuse.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^114uYcCd]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

For clinical trials of putative new therapies for painful DPN, rigorous patient selection with the use of NP scales and outcome measures are indicated. Inclusion criteria for such trials would normally include NP associated with DPN for > 6 months duration, mean weekly pain score of between 4 and 10 on an 11-point numerical rating scale, exclusion of pain not associated with DPN, mononeuropathies or proximal neuropathies, non-neuropathic chronic pain, and central pain.

Pharmacological management of painful DPN almost exclusively consists of symptomatic therapies (those that improve symptoms of painful DPN without an effect on underlying causes or natural history). The antioxidant α-lipoic acid administered intravenously is the only pathogenetic treatment that has efficacy confirmed from several randomized controlled trials and confirmation in a meta-analysis (level A evidence). Although spinal cord stimulation might be useful in refractory painful DPN, insufficient evidence exists for any nonpharmacological therapies.

Level A evidence exists to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine (,–). There is also randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the use of opiates such as oxycodone and tramadol in painful DPN. There is no evidence available to support the use of the cannabinoids. Preliminary evidence shows promise for topical treatment using a 5% lignocaine plaster applied to the most painful area, although larger RCTs are required. First-line therapies for painful DPN are a tricyclic antidepressant, duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin, taking into account patient comorbidities and cost. Combinations of first-line therapies may be considered if there is pain, despite a change in first-line monotherapy. If pain is still inadequately controlled, opiods such as tramadol and oxycodone may be added in a combination treatment. A number of areas relating to painful DPN warrant further investigation including population-based prevalence and natural history studies, trials using active comparators rather than placebo, assessment of combination therapies in addition to placebo, and longer-term studies of the efficacy and durability of treatments of painful DPN.

Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: an update [^117UF9wz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in approximately 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus who are treated in the office setting and significantly affects quality of life. It typically causes burning pain, paresthesias, and numbness in a stocking-glove pattern that progresses proximally from the feet and hands. Clinicians should carefully consider the patient's goals and functional status and potential adverse effects of medication when choosing a treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Pregabalin and duloxetine are the only medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating this disorder. Based on current practice guidelines, these medications, with gabapentin and amitriptyline, should be considered for the initial treatment. Second-line therapy includes opioid-like medications (tramadol and tapentadol), venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and topical agents (lidocaine patches and capsaicin cream). Isosorbide dinitrate spray and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may provide relief in some patients and can be considered at any point during therapy. Opioids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are optional third-line medications. Acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, alpha lipoic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine, primrose oil, and electromagnetic field application lack high-quality evidence to support their use.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy – providing the best patient service [^112qJtMk]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is just one of a myriad of secondary conditions that may result from poor glycaemic control. Educating the patient to suspect diabetic complications, understanding why they may occur, what their progression is likely to be and what measures can be taken to avoid them can significantly improve outcomes. Education within the diabetes management framework needs to be consistent, prioritised, tailored to the needs of each patient and ongoing in order to be maximally effective, with tight glycaemic control playing the anchoring central role. The specialist diabetes nurse is in the ideal situation to coordinate this education and to ensure that the patient with diabetes receives the care and support needed to take dual responsibility for their condition.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^112Tq8rf]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite multiple FDA-approved, guideline-recommended, and other available options to treat painful DPN, many patients continue to experience uncontrolled pain. An individualized and comprehensive approach, considering pharmacological, neuromodulatory, and non-pharmacological therapies, is often necessary to improve pain outcomes. Since complete resolution of symptoms is not always achievable, patients, caregivers and healthcare providers should have realistic expectations regarding the efficacy of available treatment options, understand that pain reduction (not necessarily pain elimination) and improved HR-QoL are the goals of therapy and that it may be necessary to try a series of treatments in order to identify the most beneficial option.

Current US evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of painful DPN focus primarily on pharmacological treatments. Careful consideration is required when selecting pharmacological agents as affected patients are generally already receiving polypharmacy to treat diabetes and other health conditions, which increases the risk of DDIs and ADRs. Diabetic patients in the US take an average of 5.9 medications, with an even higher pill burden for those with painful DPN (83% take one or more pain medications solely to treat this condition). Treatment selection should consider the potential for systemic ADRs and DDIs, contraindications and precautions in special populations, the presence of comorbid mood and sleep disorders supporting the use of one option over another, costs, and individual patient preferences.

Of the oral drug classes regarded as first-line therapy in US guidelines and recommendations, TCAs (eg, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine), SNRIs (eg, duloxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine), gabapentinoids (eg, pregabalin, gabapentin), and sodium channel blockers (eg, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine) are considered to have comparable efficacy with limited data to support one therapeutic intervention over another. Use of oral opioids, including those with a dual MoA such as tapentadol ER, is not recommended. Among topical pharmacological options (which include lignocaine and glyceryl trinitrate), the capsaicin 8% topical system has the most robust evidence and is the only topical agent currently approved by the FDA to treat painful DPN. The capsaicin 8% topical system can be used in combination with oral pharmacotherapy and is not associated with any contraindications, DDIs, systemic ADRs, or need for dose titration/adjustment.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, under or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is not only key to implementing earlier interventions but also to ensure that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is critical as many potentially effective therapies may never progress to the clinic, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect, but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify benefit. Apart from improving glycaemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy, however, a number of pathogenetic pathways remain under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy is a cause of considerable morbidity and whilst many pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We address the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and also consider potential new pharmacological therapies as well as nonpharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Impact of glycemic control strategies on the progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation 2 diabetes (BARI 2D) cohort [^114Gw7hh]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathies (DPNs) are consequences of diabetes-induced large and small, myelinated and unmyelinated, nerve fiber injury and are among the most common and perplexing complications of diabetes. Although the clinical manifestations, pattern of neurological deficits, symptoms, and clinical course are quite heterogeneous, DPN ultimately affects > 50% of patients with diabetes. DPN is a major cause of disability and is associated with high mortality and poor quality of life. Patients with DPN have a 25% cumulative risk of a lower-extremity amputation. The 3-year survival rate in patients with DPN is 20% less than in age- and sex-matched diabetic patients without this complication.

Intensive glucose control has proven efficacy in delaying or preventing DPN in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) but with less evidence for benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In any case, most people with diabetes do not reach and maintain the glycemic levels needed to achieve these benefits. Despite promising preclinical data, large-scale pharmacologic interventions for established DPN have been disappointing. To date, no disease-modifying treatment other than glycemic control is available for DPN.

The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial enrolled 2,368 participants with both T2DM and angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD). Participants were randomly assigned in a factorial design to either prompt revascularization or initial intensive medical therapy for CAD and to either insulin-sensitizing (IS) or insulin-providing (IP) drugs for glycemic control. The primary outcomes of BARI 2D have been reported. BARI 2D offered a unique opportunity to compare the effects of IS versus IP strategies on DPN outcomes among participants with T2DM and stable CAD.

In a previous cross-sectional analysis of the baseline DPN evaluations, we found that ∼50% of BARI 2D participants had DPN at baseline. Multivariate analysis showed that insulin use was associated with a higher prevalence of DPN, whereas IS use was associated with a trend for lower prevalence of DPN. The aim of the present longitudinal analysis was to determine whether after a 4-year follow-up, an IP-based strategy differed from an IS-based strategy with regard to the incidence of DPN onset and remission in the BARI 2D participants according to the absence or presence of DPN at baseline, respectively.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy: the need for new approaches [^111oG7p4]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common vexing problem for people with diabetes and a costly problem for society. The pathophysiology is not well understood, and no safe and effective mechanistically-based treatment has been identified. Poor glycemic control is a risk factor for painful diabetic neuropathy. Excessive intraneuronal glucose in people with diabetes can be shunted away from physiological glycolysis into multiple pathological pathways associated with neuropathy and pain. The first three treatments that are traditionally offered consist of risk factor reduction, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological therapy, which includes only three drugs that are approved for this indication by the United States Food and Drug Administration. All of these traditional treatments are often inadequate for relieving neuropathic pain, and thus, new approaches are needed. Modern devices based on neuromodulation technology, which act directly on the nervous system, have been recently cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration for painful diabetic neuropathy and offer promise as next-in-line therapy when traditional therapies fail.

### Pramlintide acetate (Symlinpen) [^1127BAjN]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.1 Patient Selection

Proper patient selection is critical to the safe and effective use of SYMLIN. Before initiating SYMLIN, the patient's HbA1c, recent blood glucose monitoring data, history of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, current insulin regimen, and body weight should be reviewed. SYMLIN therapy should only be considered in patients with type 1 diabetes or patients with type 2 diabetes using mealtime insulin who fulfill the following criteria:

have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control despite individualized insulin management.
are receiving ongoing care under the guidance of a healthcare professional skilled in the use of insulin and supported by the services of diabetes educator(s).

Patients meeting any of the following criteria should NOT be considered for SYMLIN therapy:

poor compliance with current insulin regimen.
poor compliance with prescribed self blood glucose monitoring.
have a HbA1c > 9%.
recurrent severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance during the past 6 months.
presence of hypoglycemia unawareness.
confirmed diagnosis of gastroparesis.
require the use of drugs that stimulate gastrointestinal motility.
pediatric patients.

SYMLIN should be prescribed with caution to persons with visual or dexterity impairment.

5.2 Hypoglycemia

SYMLIN alone does not cause hypoglycemia. However, SYMLIN is indicated to be coadministered with mealtime insulin therapy, and in this setting there is an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes. If severe hypoglycemia associated with SYMLIN occurs, it is usually seen within the first 2 to 3 hours following a SYMLIN injection. If severe hypoglycemia occurs while operating a motor vehicle, heavy machinery, or while engaging in other high-risk activities, serious injuries or death may occur. Therefore, when introducing SYMLIN therapy, appropriate precautions need to be taken to avoid increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia. These precautions include frequent monitoring of pre- and post-meal glucose combined with an initial 50% reduction in doses of mealtime insulin [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes; diabetic neuropathy; use of medications such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, or reserpine; or intensified glycemic control.

The addition of any anti-diabetic medication, such as SYMLIN, to an existing regimen of one or more anti-diabetic medications (e.g., sulfonylurea), or other medications that can increase the risk of hypoglycemia may necessitate further insulin dose adjustments and particularly close monitoring of blood glucose.

### Clinical manifestations and current treatment options for diabetic neuropathies [^116jApUR]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical manifestations and current treatment options for diabetic neuropathies, one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We performed a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature using a combination of words (diabetic neuropathy, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, diagnosis and treatment) to identify original studies, consensus statements, and reviews on diabetic neuropathies published in the past 25 years. Emphasis was placed on clinical manifestations of distal polyneuropathy and its treatment, especially new therapies.

Results

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of diabetic neuropathy, usually involves small and large nerve fibers. Small-nerve fiber neuropathy often presents with pain and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers, but without objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage. This type of neuropathy is a component of impaired glucose tolerance and the metabolic syndrome. The greatest risk from small-fiber neuropathy is foot ulceration and subsequent gangrene and amputation. Large-nerve fiber neuropathy produces numbness, ataxia, and incoordination, thus impairing activities of daily living and causing falls and fractures. Successfully treating diabetic neuropathy requires addressing the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, treating symptoms to improve quality of life, and preventing progression and complications of diabetes mellitus. Two new drugs, duloxetine hydrochloride and pregabalin, have recently been approved for treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetes mellitus.

Conclusion

Symptomatic therapy has become available and newer and better treatment modalities, based on etiologic factors, are being explored with potential for clinically significant reduction of morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient and physician education still remain key factors in reducing complication rates and mortality.

### Impact of comorbidities on pharmacotherapy of painful diabetic neuropathy in clinical practice [^111RuD8o]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

We evaluated the impact of baseline comorbidities on the effectiveness of duloxetine and anticonvulsants (pregabalin/gabapentin) in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy in clinical care.

Methods

Outcomes from a 6-month, observational study with 2575 patients initiating/switching DPNP treatment were analyzed post-hoc. Propensity scoring was used to adjust for baseline factors influencing treatment choice in 1523 patients receiving duloxetine or anticonvulsants. Analysis of covariance models with fixed effects for baseline pain, treatment, propensity score, baseline characteristics or comorbidities, and their interaction with treatment were used to estimate LSmean effects on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain and interference scores.

Results

89.5% of patients reported comorbidities, including hypertension (70.5%), hyperlipidemia (39.2%), and depression (24.8%). Macrovascular complications (37.0%) and 'other chronic pain' (41.5%), particularly joint pain had an impact on both pain treatments, i.e. less improvement of average pain and interference of pain. Better treatment responses with duloxetine vs. anticonvulsants were observed in patients with depression, those with high baseline BPI total interference score, especially general activity, and in patients with joint pain.

Conclusions

Comorbidities such as macroangiopathy and depression as well as pain characteristics should be considered in the treatment of DPNP as they may predict the effectiveness of duloxetine and anticonvulsants.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^114DGjpY]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The ASPN SWEET Guideline provides the first comprehensive clinical tool encompassing both pharmacological, interventional, and alternative approaches to PDN. As PDN continues to be a difficult and under-treated condition, the SWEET Guideline is intended to improve appropriate and safe treatment of patients suffering from PDN. Many recent interventional and pharmacological agents have significantly improved the ability to improve pain and suffering in PDN. Further research continues to be developed, which should only help in further identifying the optimal treatment of patients with PDN. In addition to global open access to this guideline for all clinicians involved in the care of those suffering from PDN, ASPN aims to disseminate the awareness of these important guidelines via social media, webinars, annual conferences, and other media forms. The ASPN SWEET guideline is intended to be a living document and will be updated at appropriate intervals as the research and science around PDN continues to evolve. The ASPN guidelines will be shared on the society's website at aspnpain.com. The guidelines will be updated at a minimum of every 12 months and as impactful evidence is published relevant to the content of the SWEET guideline.

### Treatment of symptomatic diabetic neuropathy [^111NQYNf]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common and particularly unpleasant long-term complication of diabetes that affects a significant minority of patients with distal polyneuropathy. After exclusion of other causes of neuropathic pain, attention should be focused on achieving optimal and stable glycaemic control avoiding flux of blood glucose levels, which have been shown to aggravate pain. Most patients will require pain control therapy and whilst the tricyclic drugs remain a first-line approach, their use is often hampered by predictable but troublesome side effects. Gabapentin, the only agent specifically licensed for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the United Kingdom, is useful in diabetic neuropathy and is generally better tolerated than the tricyclics. Additionally, other pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management approaches may be useful. Patient education has a significant role to play in the avoidance of late neurological complications.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy [^114aetr1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic, and associated neuropathy is its most costly and disabling complication. Given the rising prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy, it is increasingly important that we understand the best ways to diagnose and treat this condition. Diagnostic tests in this field are evolving rapidly. These include the use of skin biopsies to measure small unmyelinated fibers, as well as even newer techniques that can measure both small unmyelinated fibers and large myelinated fibers in the same biopsy. The main treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy remain management of the underlying diabetes and drugs for the relief of pain. However, emerging evidence points to major differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including the ability of glycemic control to prevent neuropathy. Enhanced glucose control is much more effective at preventing neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 disease. This dichotomy emphasizes the need to study the pathophysiologic differences between the two types of diabetes, because different treatments may be needed for each condition. The impact of the metabolic syndrome on neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes may account for the difference between the two types of diabetes and requires further study. Finally, neuropathic pain is under-recognized and undertreated despite an ever evolving list of effective drugs. Evidence exists to support several drugs, but the optimal sequence and combination of these drugs are still to be determined.

### Clinical approach to the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy [^114vuxM6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Painful neuropathy is a common and often progressive complication of diabetes. Patients frequently report symptoms of tingling, burning, lancinating pain, hyperesthesia and allodynia. The natural history of the disease may vary from intermittent mild symptoms to severe chronic daily pain; the latter is often associated with diminished quality of life. There are a variety of pharmaceutical agents from different medicinal categories available for the symptomatic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, however selecting an agent is often challenging given the breadth of choices and lack of consistent guidelines. As a result, many patients remain untreated or undertreated. This article presents a practical clinical approach to the treatment of pain in diabetic neuropathy. Recommendations for first, second and third line medications are based on specific evidence for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy as well as safety, tolerability, drug interactions and cost. Additional topics of discussion include breakthrough pain, opioid use and topical therapies. This review does not comprehensively discuss all possible treatments for painful neuropathy, but provides a systematic approach designed to guide clinicians in tailoring therapies to the individual patient.

### What is new in neuropathic pain? [^113j5PUG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain occurs in 1% of the population and is difficult to manage. Responses to single drugs are limited in benefit. Thirty percent will fail to respond altogether. This is a review of newer drugs and treatment paradigms.

Methods

A literature review was performed pertinent to new drugs and treatment algorithms in the management of neuropathic pain.

Results

New information on opioids (tramadol and buprenorphine) suggests benefits in the management of neuropathic pain and has increased interest in their use earlier in the course of illness. Newer antidepressants, selective noradrenaline, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have evidence for benefit and reduced toxicity without an economic disadvantage compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment paradigms are shifting from sequential single drug trials to multiple drug therapies. Evidence is needed to justify this change in treatment approach.

Conclusion

Drug choices are now based not only on efficacy but also toxicity and drug interactions. For this reason, SNRIs and gabapentin/pregabalin have become popular though efficacy is not better than TCAs. Multiple drug therapies becoming an emergent treatment paradigm research in multiple drug therapy are needed.

Anand et al reported similar results in a randomized control trial with 50 participants in which patients were randomized to either 8% capsaicin patch along with standard of care (SOC) medication management or SOC alone. Patients in the capsaicin plus SOC group fared significantly better with a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in NRS pain scores at 3-month follow-up, as compared to SOC alone.

On the basis of this clinical evidence, 8% capsaicin patch is an FDA approved treatment for PDN and should be considered as a treatment option that can provide moderate relief, especially when initial oral agents are ineffective or provide only partial pain relief (see Table 6).

### Critical review of oral drug treatments for diabetic neuropathic pain-clinical outcomes based on efficacy and safety data from placebo-controlled and direct comparative studies [^117TGa6U]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

The present review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a selection of oral treatments for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy. A literature review was conducted retrieving placebo-controlled and direct comparative studies with a selection of oral treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy. All studies were analyzed with regard to efficacy and tolerability. Efficacy was evaluated as the percentage improvement in pain intensity between baseline and endpoint. Tolerability was evaluated by means of study discontinuations due to adverse events and by incidence of drug-related adverse events. The analyzed trials enrolled different patient populations with mostly small numbers of patients. The great variability in dosages and dose titration schemes, cross-over designs with variable wash-out periods, and other design schemes made comparison between the different studies difficult. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, tramadol, oxycodone, mexiletine, and acetyl-L-carnitine were the only treatments studied in large (at least 100 patients), placebo-controlled parallel group trials. It is concluded that standardization in design and reporting for comparison of treatments is needed. Validated questionnaires for evaluation of the efficacy and safety should be further developed. Based on the reviewed randomised controlled trials, gabapentin shows good efficacy, a favourable side-effect profile with lack of drug interactions and therefore it may be a first choice treatment in painful diabetic neuropathy, especially in the elderly. However, head to head trials of current treatments are lacking and therefore randomized controlled trials are required to address this issue.

A large, nationally representative health care claims study found that the most common prescriptions for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy were opioids, followed by gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine, despite an American Academy of Neurology (AAN) position statement and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline recommending caution with opioid use in people with chronic noncancer pain.

Diabetic retinopathy — treatment recommendations specify referral, laser, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), and adjunct options with explicit strength. Promptly refer individuals with any level of diabetic macular edema, moderate or worse nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (a precursor of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [PDR]), or any PDR to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management of diabetic retinopathy. Panretinal laser photocoagulation therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of vision loss in individuals with high-risk PDR and, in some cases, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF are a reasonable alternative to traditional panretinal laser photocoagulation for some individuals with PDR and also reduce the risk of vision loss in these individuals. Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF are indicated as first-line treatment for individuals with center-involved diabetic macular edema that involves the foveal center and impairs visual acuity. Macular focal/grid photocoagulation and intravitreal injections of corticosteroids are reasonable treatments in eyes with persistent diabetic macular edema despite previous anti-VEGF therapy or eyes that are not candidates for this first-line approach. The presence of retinopathy is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy for cardioprotection, as aspirin does not increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^116fQXXg]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Painful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDN) — Recommendation Statement 8a states clinicians should not use opioids for the treatment of PDN (Level B). Rationale includes that evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy for improving chronic pain and function and evidence supports a dose-dependent risk for serious harms. Although short-term pain reduction has been demonstrated in patients with PDN with opioids, no randomized trial of opioids over a long duration has demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement of pain and function, which would be needed to justify the severity of potential side effects. Additional concerns note that data from the CDC suggest that it is likely that dependence may set in within days to weeks of starting opioids, a 1-year trial in osteoarthritis reported opioids were nonsuperior to nonopioid medications, and long-term adverse consequences include nearly universal dependence, high rates of misuse, opioid use disorder, morbidity via overdose events, and excess mortality.

### Diabetic neuropathy: clinical manifestations and current treatments [^1111ugsB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent, disabling disorder. The most common manifestation is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP), but many patterns of nerve injury can occur. Currently, the only effective treatments are glucose control and pain management. While glucose control substantially decreases the development of neuropathy in those with type 1 diabetes, the effect is probably much smaller in those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence supports the use of specific anticonvulsants and antidepressants for pain management in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the lack of disease-modifying therapies for diabetic DSP makes the identification of new modifiable risk factors essential. Growing evidence supports an association between components of the metabolic syndrome, including prediabetes, and neuropathy. Studies are needed to further explore this association, which has implications for the development of new treatments for this common disorder.

The European Federation of Neurological Societies proposed that first-line treatments might comprise of TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentin, or pregabalin. The U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of neuropathic pain in nonspecialist settings proposed that duloxetine should be the first-line treatment with amitriptyline as an alternative, and pregabalin as a second-line treatment for painful DSPN. However, this recommendation of duloxetine as the first-line therapy was not based on efficacy but rather cost-effectiveness. More recently, the American Academy of Neurology recommended that pregabalin is "established as effective and should be offered for relief of [painful DSPN] (Level A evidence)", whereas venlafaxine, duloxetine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, valproate, opioids, and capsaicin were considered to be "probably effective and should be considered for treatment of painful DSPN (Level B evidence)". However, this recommendation was primarily based on achievement of greater than 80% completion rate of clinical trials, which in turn may be influenced by the length of the trials. Finally, the International Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy recommended TCAs, duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin as first-line agents having carefully reviewed all the available literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of painful DSPN, the final drug choice tailored to the particular patient based on demographic profile and comorbidities.

Tailoring treatment to individual requirements

The initial selection of a particular first-line treatment will be influenced by the assessment of contraindications, evaluation of comorbidities (including sleep disturbance, mood disorders, and other chronic medical/diabetes complications), and cost. For example, in diabetic patients with a history of heart disease, elderly patients on other concomitant medications such diuretics and antihypertensives, and patients with comorbid orthostatic hypotension TCAs have relative contraindications. In patients with liver disease, duloxetine should not be prescribed, and in those with peripheral edema, pregabalin or gabapentin should be avoided. Moreover, although pharmaceutical companies may recommend a particular starting dose for their drugs based on their clinical trials, one has to appreciate that the clinical practice scenario is different from clinical trial scenario because many elderly patients with multiple comorbidities would have been excluded from trials. Therefore, treatment has to be individualized to take patient comorbidities including occupation, renal impairment, etc. into account, and caution is advised to start at lower than recommended doses and titrate gradually.

### Suboptimal treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in the United States [^116cXa89]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Approximately one third of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) also experience neuropathic pain, resulting in a significant health care burden, and reduced quality of life. Pregabalin, duloxetine, and tapentadol extended-release are approved for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), but many other medications are commonly used "off-label" with various degrees of success. We examined US health insurance claims to determine the current DPNP treatment patterns.

Methods

This retrospective analysis used the MarketScan claims database to identify adults with continuous health plan enrollment for 12 months pre- and postindex who were initially diagnosed with DPN between 2006 and 2011 and were provided a prescription for a medication reported to be beneficial for treating DPNP (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, opioids, or topical agents). We evaluated the frequency and types of medication dispensed within 1 year after first diagnosis, treatment adherence, and patterns of treatment alteration.

Results

Overall, 12,074 patients met inclusion criteria, with 66.6% initiating an anticonvulsant (gabapentin 45.0%; pregabalin 21.6%), and 5.2% initiating duloxetine. Patients commonly received less than the recommended dose of prescribed medication, and adherence was suboptimal for all treatments. It is estimated that up to 50% of patients discontinued their initial treatment within 3 months of initiation.

Conclusions

Newly diagnosed patients with DPNP are most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants. Many patients receive lower than recommended dosages, potentially resulting in poor outcomes. Initial treatments are frequently discontinued, indicating low levels of satisfaction and/or poor tolerability. New therapies with improved efficacy and better tolerability are urgently needed for DPNP.

### Treating diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain [^113ht88P]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain affects the functionality, mood, and sleep patterns of approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients with diabetes mellitus. Treatment goals include restoring function and improving pain control. Patients can realistically expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction in discomfort with improved functionality. The main classes of agents used to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain include tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, opiates and opiate-like substances, and topical medications. Physicians should ask patients whether they have tried complementary and alternative medicine therapies for their pain. Only two medications are approved specifically for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: pregabalin and duloxetine. However, evidence supports the use of other therapies, and unless there are contraindications, tricyclic antidepressants are the first-line treatment. Because patients often have multiple comorbidities, physicians must consider potential adverse effects and possible drug interactions before prescribing a medication.

SYMPTOMATIC PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF PAINFUL NEUROPATHY

Diabetic painful neuropathy may constitute a considerable management problem. The efficacy of a single therapeutic agent is not the rule, and simple analgesics are usually inadequate to control the pain. Therefore, various therapeutic schemes have been previously proposed, but none have been validated. Nonetheless, there is agreement that patients should be offered the available therapies in a stepwise fashion. Effective pain treatment consists of a favorable balance between pain relief and adverse events without implying a maximum effect.

The various pharmacological treatment options are summarized in Table 1. The advantages and disadvantages of the various drugs and drug classes used for treatment of DPN under consideration of the various comorbidities and complications associated with diabetes are summarized in Table 2. Before any decision regarding the appropriate treatment, the diagnosis of the underlying neuropathic manifestation should be established. In contrast to the agents that have been derived from the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy, those used for symptomatic therapy were designed to modulate the pain, without favorably influencing the underlying neuropathy. A number of trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs, but only a few included large patient samples.

The relative benefit of active treatment over a control in clinical trials is usually expressed as the relative risk, the relative risk reduction, or the odds ratio. However, to estimate the extent of a therapeutic effect (i.e. pain relief) that can be translated into clinical practice, it is useful to apply a simple measure that helps the physician to select the appropriate treatment for the individual patient. Such a practical measure is the "number needed to treat" (NNT), i.e. the number of patients who need to be treated with a particular therapy to observe a clinically relevant effect or adverse event in one patient. The NNTs and numbers needed to harm for the individual agents used in the treatment of DPN are given in Table 1.

Guidelines for Managing Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)

The management of painful DPN involves controlling the underlying diabetic condition and symptomatically treating the associated pain, as recommended in multiple clinical practice guidelines and expert reviews. Given their influence and importance in determining recommendations in other relevant expert opinions and reviews, we have focused on evidence-based guidelines and recommended treatment algorithms from the following US organizations:
American Academy of Neurology (AAN): Published in December 2021, the Oral and Topical Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: Practice Guideline Update Summaryprovides updated recommendations on the treatment of painful DPN. Graded recommendations for the use of numerous drug classes and individual agents are based on a systematic and statistical analysis of the results of 133 relevant peer-reviewed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).
American Diabetes Association (ADA): Three publications guiding the treatment of painful DPN are available from the ADA. Diabetic Neuropathy: A Position Statementwas published in 2017 and provides graded recommendations on all aspects of DPN management — including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment — based on several technical reviews and associated supporting references. The clinical compendium on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathyand Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes‒2022, were published in 2022. The clinical compendium focuses on the screening, diagnosis and treatment of painful DPN in routine clinical practice, and summarizes the latest guidance on effective therapies, including pharmacological agents, nutraceutical products, and non-pharmacological therapies. Guidance on treating painful DPN is also provided in Chapter 12: Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Careof the updated Standard of Medical Care in Diabetes ‒2022.
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE). Published in 2022, the AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan‒2022 Updateprovides graded recommendations for the care of diabetic patients, including diagnosis and management of DPN, based on a comprehensive search and appraisal of the current literature.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^114p3xfQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Methodology

Development Process

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN), through its mission to increase evidence-based access to treatment, has commissioned a systematic guideline process to outline the current state of the art in treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) (SWEET guidelines). Members of the SWEET consensus group were selected from among the thought leaders across a broad spectrum of specialties interested in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy within both ASPN and other societies. A diverse authorship included experts from the specialties of Pain Medicine, Neurology, Podiatry, Primary Care, Neurosurgery, Physiatry, Psychology, and Anesthesiology. The current guideline will examine the evidence, education and current treatment options. The SWEET consensus work group was convened and at regular intervals, members have evaluated the level of current evidence in the peer-reviewed literature for topics that have been identified as critical for treatment.

Work groups were convened to conduct literature searches and examine the evidence for the topics developed by lead authors in outline form. After the literature search was completed, each author was asked to provide cited references, and evidence rank. The section leaders then formulated the recommendation grade, based on the evidence, which were reviewed by at least three different, nonconflicted SWEET working group members. If conflicts of interest were identified, recusal was required as outlined below. ASPN utilizes the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) format with slight modification for interventional pain treatment. This process has been established in previous ASPN publications. Once literature was reviewed, consensus statements were created and graded based upon the ASPN-USPSTF criteria listed in Table 1. The process by which section leaders then created consensus points included in-person meetings, teleconference, or other electronic or audio-video communications to define the consensus; agreement by at least 80% of the contributing authors was considered a quorum. Consensus strength was defined, as described in previous ASPN guidelines. If a recommendation was proposed with < 50% consensus, based on assigned evidence rank and recommendation grade, then no consensus was achieved.

This consensus guideline gives guidance to clinicians concerning painful PDN treatment and evidence-based practice and outcome optimization. However, these recommendations should not be construed as a standard of care, but instead represent best practices. This guidance is based on several factors and peer-reviewed evidence, and regardless of the strength of evidence, requires interpretation for clinical application.

Conclusion

A simple algorithm was suggested by the Toronto International Neuropathy Consensus meeting (Fig. 3) to help practitioners in the management of patients with painful DSPN. After exclusion of other causes and optimization of glycemic control, first-line therapies would include either an antidepressant (a tricyclic or duloxetine) or an anticonvulsant (gabapentin or pregabalin). These therapies all have level A evidence for efficacy and a clear pathway of progression if initial therapies fail is provided. Those patients with the severest neuropathic pain unresponsiveness to antidepressant or anticonvulsant therapy might require short-term treatment with opioid or opioid-like drugs such as tramadol or controlled release oxycodone. Finally, it must always be emphasized that all patients with any form of diabetic neuropathy are at increased risk of foot ulceration and require education in self foot care and, if possible, regular podiatry assessment and treatment.
