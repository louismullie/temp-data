## Question

For a patient with numbness/tingling and fatigue, what is the differential diagnosis and which tests should be ordered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a differential diagnosis and workup plan for patients presenting with numbness and tingling accompanied by fatigue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about temporal pattern, neuroanatomic distribution, fiber types involved, and whether autonomic features are present. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential with common and treatable causes first, followed by autoimmune, infectious, toxic, paraneoplastic, and hereditary conditions. Next, I will outline first-line labs, followed by conditional testing based on clues, and define indications for electrodiagnostic studies and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Finally, I should verify medication contributors, distinguish peripheral from central mimics, and close with initial management and monitoring considerations, ensuring each assertion maps back to evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical framing. Temporal pattern matters: acute to subacute evolution over days to weeks raises inflammatory, infectious, toxic, or vascular etiologies such as GBS, autoimmune nodopathies, or toxic neuropathies, whereas chronic progression over months to years suggests metabolic, hereditary, or degenerative causes; episodic symptoms could reflect intermittent compression or metabolic fluctuations, so I need to document onset-to-peak and variability carefully [^112SxJA8] [^112Y2F6Y]. Spatial distribution guides localization: a distal symmetric stocking–glove pattern is typical of distal symmetric polyneuropathy, multifocal or asymmetric patterns suggest mononeuritis multiplex, radiculopathy or plexopathy, and proximal weakness with sensory symptoms may signal polyradiculoneuropathy or a central process, so I should not jump to conclusions before aligning pattern with pathology [^112Y2F6Y] [^116Rofy5].

> I need to ensure fiber type involvement is parsed. Sensory-predominant complaints with burning, tingling, and allodynia point to small fiber involvement, loss of vibration or proprioception indicates large fiber pathology, motor weakness and gait changes raise demyelinating or mixed neuropathy, and orthostasis, sweating change, bowel or bladder symptoms indicate autonomic involvement and broaden the differential toward diabetes, amyloid, autoimmune and toxic causes; I should double-check for subtle autonomic signs at the bedside because they are often underreported and materially shift the workup [^114gySGq] [^112Y2F6Y].

> Hold on, let me verify where fatigue fits. It is tempting to treat fatigue as nonspecific, but emerging evidence indicates fatigue can be primary and even dominant in small fiber neuropathy phenotypes, and in some CIDP presentations fatigue may precede classic findings; I should explicitly ask about exertional intolerance, myalgias, and sleep disturbance and not dismiss fatigue when neuropathic features co-occur [^1168GusW] [^1124ubBQ]. But wait, what if this is post-infectious or post-COVID small fiber neuropathy? Small prospective series show a high proportion of long COVID patients with objective evidence of small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia, so I should document COVID timelines and dysautonomic symptoms to guide testing and therapy [^113rn4r4].

> Next, I will construct a hierarchy that prioritizes common and treatable etiologies. I should first screen for diabetes or prediabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, alcohol-related neuropathy, paraproteinemia, and inherited neuropathies that commonly manifest with distal symmetric polyneuropathy, because these account for a large share of cases and have actionable treatments or risk mitigation strategies [^112Y2F6Y]. I must also consider medication-induced neuropathy early: bortezomib and related proteasome inhibitors, brentuximab vedotin, thalidomide, and fluoroquinolones have well-described sensory-predominant axonal neuropathies with variable reversibility, so a meticulous drug history and temporal correlation are essential [^117UD1Sw] [^116wptZa] [^111iBEgT] [^116gA7SB].

> I should now review autoimmune and inflammatory causes that warrant targeted therapy. Sjögren disease, SLE, vasculitic neuropathies, CIDP and GBS-spectrum disorders can present with sensory and autonomic features or mixed sensorimotor findings, sometimes acutely; I need to check for sicca, rashes, arthralgias, weight loss, and constitutional symptoms that would steer me toward serologic and electrodiagnostic evaluation, and consider CSF analysis when polyradiculoneuropathy is suspected [^114gySGq] [^112SxJA8] [^11154cVk]. For infections, I should confirm HIV and Lyme risk, exposures, and timelines since both are well-recognized neuropathic etiologies with distinct management [^114gySGq].

> Let me consider paraneoplastic, infiltrative, and hereditary categories next. Amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can produce painful small fiber and autonomic neuropathies with multisystem involvement, and monoclonal gammopathy can underlie demyelinating or axonal phenotypes, so I should confirm SPEP with immunofixation and look for organ involvement and granulomatous disease clues when appropriate [^114gySGq] [^112Y2F6Y]. I need to remember Charcot–Marie–Tooth and other hereditary neuropathies when there is a long-standing course, pes cavus, hammertoes, or family history, while acknowledging that up to a quarter of distal symmetric polyneuropathy remains idiopathic even after structured evaluation, which should temper overtesting outside of clinical signals [^112Y2F6Y].

> Now, I will outline the first-line laboratory evaluation. I should obtain a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel to survey for systemic disease, fasting glucose or HbA1c for diabetes and prediabetes, serum vitamin B12 with reflex methylmalonic acid if borderline, thyroid-stimulating hormone, an inflammatory marker such as ESR, and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation to detect paraproteinemia; this set aligns with high-utility panels in distal symmetric polyneuropathy and focuses on treatable causes efficiently [^112Y2F6Y] [^116R4vmx] [^115cK6zj]. I need to double-check whether the clinical features are atypical, because if they are, this initial lab set may need immediate expansion rather than a staged approach [^112SxJA8].

> Conditional and second-line tests should be driven by clinical clues, and I should be explicit about when to pivot. If sicca, rash, neuropathic pain with autonomic signs, or multisystem features are present, I will add ANA, anti-SSA/SSB, RF and ANCA, and consider complement levels and cryoglobulins as context dictates; if infectious risks exist, I will order HIV antigen/antibody testing and Lyme serology with confirmatory algorithms as indicated; if the presentation is subacute with proximal weakness or areflexia, I will expedite EMG/NCS and consider CSF to evaluate for CIDP or GBS [^114gySGq] [^112SxJA8] [^11154cVk]. If fatigue is dominant with cramps, paresthesias, and suggestive historical flags for calcium–phosphate disorders, I should check calcium, phosphate, and PTH to avoid missing hypocalcemic etiologies, recognizing the evidence base is mainly case level and should be interpreted cautiously [^111Rs6jj].

> Before advanced testing, I should confirm bedside neuro findings and foot risk with guideline-concordant maneuvers. Wait, I need to ensure both small and large fiber modalities are assessed: temperature or pinprick for small fibers and 128-Hz tuning fork vibration for large fibers, along with annual 10-g monofilament testing in patients with diabetes to identify loss of protective sensation and amputation risk; this helps stage neuropathy and guides prevention even as the etiologic workup proceeds [^1123j3Qy] [^113YEPY1] [^115kj7Vh].

> I will now examine when to order electrodiagnostic testing, but hold on, I should verify that it is not reflexively ordered in all cases. My initial instinct was to get EMG/NCS broadly, yet guidelines recommend reserving electrodiagnostics for worrisome features such as acute onset, asymmetry, predominant motor or autonomic symptoms, or a rapidly progressive course, or when the initial workup is unrevealing and symptoms persist; when obtained, EMG/NCS differentiates demyelinating from axonal processes and can localize to root, plexus, or nerve, shaping diagnosis and treatment [^112SxJA8] [^113WN4yE]. In suspected GBS or mimics, early electrodiagnostics support diagnosis and help exclude alternatives, and I should not delay urgent management while waiting for late findings to evolve [^11154cVk].

> But wait, what if the symptoms reflect a central mimic rather than a peripheral neuropathy. I need to check for myelopathic signs, sensory level, sphincter involvement, and UMN features; if present, MRI of brain and spine and CSF analysis may be indicated to exclude inflammatory myelopathies, neurosarcoidosis, or structural lesions, correcting course away from a peripheral workup if central pathology is likely [^112SxJA8] [^112kqVAy]. For suspected CIDP or GBS-spectrum disorders, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation can support the diagnosis, but I should confirm that lumbar puncture adds value in the specific clinical context before proceeding [^116R4vmx] [^11154cVk].

> I should confirm medication and toxin contributors with precision, as dechallenge and dose modification can be decisive. Bortezomib causes predominantly sensory neuropathy with dose and route effects and may improve with dose reduction or schedule change; brentuximab vedotin produces cumulative peripheral neuropathy with partial or complete resolution in many patients after modification; thalidomide neuropathy can be severe and irreversible, mandating vigilant screening and discontinuation if symptoms emerge; fluoroquinolones can precipitate rapid-onset sensory or sensorimotor axonal neuropathy that may be irreversible, requiring prompt discontinuation and future avoidance; these time-linked exposures can spare patients unnecessary invasive testing if recognized early [^117UD1Sw] [^116wptZa] [^111iBEgT] [^116gA7SB].

> Management should address the underlying cause and provide symptom control while diagnostics proceed. I need to ensure glycemic control in diabetes, correct B12 deficiency when confirmed biochemically, treat autoimmune or infectious etiologies specifically, and implement foot care to prevent injury; for neuropathic pain, evidence-based options include tricyclics, SNRIs and gabapentinoids in general neuropathic pain, with duloxetine specifically recommended for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, whereas compounded topical baclofen–amitriptyline with or without ketamine lacks sufficient evidence outside trials, and in severe cases tramadol or opioids may be considered as rescue per oncology guidelines; therapy should be individualized, monitored for efficacy and adverse effects, and deprescribed if ineffective [^112Y2F6Y] [^113YDDz3] [^114Wrw3x] [^116dW5J9].

> Finally, I should confirm red flags and follow-up. Rapid progression, new objective weakness, prominent dysautonomia, or respiratory or bulbar involvement warrant urgent escalation and possible hospitalization; if the initial evaluation is unrevealing yet symptoms persist or evolve, I need to reconsider the differential, review exposures again, and proceed to electrodiagnostics or specialty referral to avoid missing treatable inflammatory neuropathies or central mimics [^112SxJA8] [^11154cVk]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also re-evaluate fatigue trajectory after addressing neuropathic contributors, because persistent disproportionate fatigue might imply coexisting sleep, endocrine, mood, or oncologic factors that merit parallel assessment rather than attributing everything to neuropathy alone [^111YgHJA].

Numbness or tingling with fatigue most often reflects **peripheral neuropathy** (diabetes, B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, CKD, alcohol, medications) [^112Y2F6Y] or **systemic disease** (autoimmune, infectious, metabolic, malignancy) [^114gySGq]. Start with a **focused history/exam**, then order **CBC**, **CMP**, fasting glucose and HbA1c, TSH, vitamin B12, and SPEP with immunofixation [^112SxJA8]. If systemic disease is suspected, add ESR/CRP, ANA, RF, ENA, ANCA, HIV, hepatitis B/C, and Lyme serology [^115CvkRF]. Use **EMG/NCS** for atypical, asymmetric, or progressive cases [^112SxJA8]; **MRI** for focal deficits or myelopathy [^112kqVAy]; and **CSF** for suspected inflammatory neuropathies [^11154cVk]. This **stepwise approach** efficiently identifies treatable causes and guides management [^116R4vmx].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for numbness, tingling, and fatigue is broad and includes:

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Commonly caused by diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease [^112Y2F6Y], alcohol use, and medications (e.g. chemotherapy, fluoroquinolones) [^114gySGq] [^116gA7SB].

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome [^114gySGq], rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis can cause peripheral neuropathy and fatigue [^115CvkRF].

- **Infectious diseases**: HIV, hepatitis B and C, Lyme disease [^114gySGq], and leprosy can present with neuropathy and fatigue [^112SxJA8].

- **Metabolic and endocrine disorders**: Diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism [^112Y2F6Y], hyperparathyroidism, and electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) [^114iNPh3].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12 [^112Y2F6Y], thiamine [^112i6Mi3], and folate deficiencies.

- **Medications and toxins**: Chemotherapy agents (e.g. vincristine, bortezomib) [^117UD1Sw], fluoroquinolones [^116gA7SB], alcohol, and heavy metals [^114gySGq].

- **Neurological disorders**: Multiple sclerosis [^112kqVAy], Guillain-Barré syndrome [^11154cVk], chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) [^112Y2F6Y], and small fiber neuropathy [^1168GusW].

- **Malignancy**: Paraneoplastic syndromes [^114gySGq] and direct nerve infiltration by tumors.

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to narrow the differential diagnosis. The **history** should address onset, duration, progression, and distribution of symptoms [^112SxJA8]; associated features (e.g. weakness, autonomic symptoms); medical history; medication and alcohol use; occupational exposures; and family history. The **physical examination** entails a comprehensive neurological assessment, including motor function, sensory modalities (light touch, pinprick, vibration), deep tendon reflexes, and autonomic function [^1123j3Qy].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To assess for anemia, infection, or hematologic disorders [^112SxJA8].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: To evaluate renal and hepatic function, electrolytes, and glucose levels [^115cK6zj].

- **Fasting glucose and HbA1c**: To screen for diabetes mellitus [^1123j3Qy].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: To assess thyroid function [^112SxJA8].

- **Vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid (MMA)**: To detect vitamin B12 deficiency [^112SgKD1].

- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)**: To screen for inflammation or autoimmune disease [^115CvkRF].

- **Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation**: To detect monoclonal gammopathies or paraproteinemias [^115cK6zj].

---

### Additional laboratory tests (if indicated)

Order additional tests based on clinical suspicion, including an **autoimmune panel** (ANA, RF, ENA, ANCA) and an **infectious panel** (HIV, hepatitis B and C, Lyme serology) [^112SxJA8]. Also consider **electrolytes** (calcium, magnesium, potassium) [^114iNPh3].

---

### Electrodiagnostic studies

Electrodiagnostic studies, including **nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG)**, help distinguish axonal from demyelinating neuropathies and identify focal or generalized neuropathies [^112GnKbf] [^112SxJA8].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain **MRI of the brain and spinal cord** if central nervous system involvement, myelopathy, or multiple sclerosis is suspected, and **MRI or CT of the spine** if radiculopathy or spinal cord compression is suspected [^112kqVAy].

---

### Specialized tests

Specialized tests include **lumbar puncture (CSF analysis)** when inflammatory neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or CIDP are suspected [^11154cVk] and **skin biopsy** to diagnose small fiber neuropathy [^113rn4r4]. Obtain **genetic testing** if hereditary neuropathy is suspected [^112nHukG].

---

## Stepwise diagnostic approach

- **1. **Initial evaluation: Comprehensive history, physical examination, and initial laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, glucose, HbA1c, TSH, vitamin B12, ESR, CRP, SPEP) [^112SxJA8].

- **2. **Electrodiagnostic studies: NCS and EMG if neuropathy is suspected or if initial tests are inconclusive [^112GnKbf].

- **3. **Imaging studies: MRI or CT if central nervous system involvement or structural lesions are suspected [^112kqVAy].

- **4. **Specialized tests: Lumbar puncture, skin biopsy, or genetic testing if indicated by clinical suspicion [^113UjYAf].

---

## Conclusion

Numbness, tingling, and fatigue are common and have a broad differential. A **systematic approach** — combining a thorough clinical evaluation with targeted diagnostic testing — is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management [^116Rofy5].

### Peripheral neuropathy: differential diagnosis and management [^116R4vmx]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy has a variety of systemic, metabolic, and toxic causes. The most common treatable causes include diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and nutritional deficiencies. The diagnosis requires careful clinical assessment, judicious laboratory testing, and electrodiagnostic studies or nerve biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear. A systematic approach begins with localization of the lesion to the peripheral nerves, identification of the underlying etiology, and exclusion of potentially treatable causes.

Initial blood tests should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, and measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Specialized tests should be ordered if clinically indicated. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be helpful in the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy.

Electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction studies and electromyography, can help in the differentiation of axonal versus demyelinating or mixed neuropathy. Treatment should address the underlying disease process, correct any nutritional deficiencies, and provide symptomatic treatment.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: A review [^112Y2F6Y]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal symmetric polyneuropathy:

- **Definition**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is a diffuse length-dependent peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, tingling, pain, and/or weakness. It typically starts in the toes and spreads proximally.

- **Pathophysiology**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is most commonly caused by diabetes (32–53%) and idiopathic reasons (24–27%). Other notable causes include alcohol consumption, vitamin B12 deficiency, chemotherapy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), paraproteinemia, and inherited conditions such as hammertoes, high arches, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Additional causes encompass pre-diabetes, infections, inflammation, toxins, autoimmunity, neoplasms, and paraneoplasms.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of distal symmetric polyneuropathy include numbness, tingling, and pain starting in the toes with proximal spread. Patients may experience decreased pinprick and vibration sensation in a stocking-glove distribution, decreased reflexes starting at the ankles, weakness of toe extension, and trouble walking on heels. Progression may lead to weakness, involvement of fingertips, and balance issues resulting in falls and fractures, alongside a risk of ulcerations and amputations.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Lower extremity amputations are associated with early postoperative mortality of up to 22%.

### Autonomic peripheral neuropathy [^114gySGq]. Continuum (2020). High credibility.

Peripheral autonomic neuropathy can have various causes, including:

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's disease, rheumatoid arthritis
- **Hereditary conditions**: Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1A, type 3, type 4; multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b
- **Metabolic and deficiency conditions**: Diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, vitamin B12 deficiency
- **Infectious diseases**: Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease
- **Neurological and demyelinating conditions**: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome
- **Toxic exposures**: Lead poisoning, arsenic poisoning
- **Other systemic diseases**: Tangier disease, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, polyarteritis nodosa, porphyria
- **Other causes**: Paraneoplastic syndrome, Fabry disease, amyloidosis, alcoholic neuropathy

Additionally, certain medications such as vincristine can also cause peripheral autonomic neuropathy.

### Peripheral neuropathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^112SxJA8]. American Family Physician (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for distal symmetric polyneuropathy, specifically concerning electrodiagnostic testing, the AAFP 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining electrodiagnostic studies in patients with peripheral neuropathy if symptoms are worrisome, such as acute onset, asymmetrical presentation, predominant motor or autonomic symptoms, or a rapidly progressive clinical course. Testing is also advised if the initial workup is normal and symptoms persist.

### Velcade [^117UD1Sw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Velcade treatment causes peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain, or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening neuropathy, including Grade 3 or higher, during treatment with Velcade. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain, or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing Velcade subcutaneous versus intravenous, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Starting Velcade subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or high risk of peripheral neuropathy.

- **Dose adjustment**: Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during Velcade therapy may require a decrease in the dose and/or a less dose-intense schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. In the Velcade vs dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48% of patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption. Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73% of…

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^114Wrw3x]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, specifically with respect to topical agents, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of a topical gel containing baclofen, amitriptyline hydrochloride, with or without ketamine, for the treatment of CIPN outside the context of a clinical trial.

### Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism presenting as fatigue [^111Rs6jj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Fatigue is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice, often posing a diagnostic challenge due to its myriad underlying causes. A comprehensive clinical history can serve as a valuable guide in such diagnostic dilemmas. A man in his 30s presented with a history of intermittent fatigue. The history of premature cataract surgery prompted an investigation for hypocalcaemia. Subsequent evaluation revealed hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low serum parathyroid hormone. Additionally, elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels were noted. Treatment with calcium and alfacalcidol yielded a favourable response. This case underscores the significance of revisiting clinical history and considering hypocalcaemia as a potential aetiology in cases of unexplained fatigue. It also emphasizes the potential for overlooking the diagnosis due to the inconspicuous nature of hypocalcaemic myopathy in idiopathic hypoparathyroidism.

### Gitelman syndrome with Graves' disease leading to rhabdomyolysis: A case report and literature review [^113SiAXX]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male patient presented with limb numbness, fatigue, and hypokalemia, initially leading to a diagnosis of Graves' disease (GD) with complicated thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). Despite treatment with antithyroid drugs, the patient developed severe hypokalemia and rhabdomyolysis (RM). Further laboratory evaluations revealed hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemia, and hyperaldosteronemia. Genetic testing identified compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC12A3 gene (c.506–1G > A and c.1456G > A), encoding the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter, confirming a diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome (GS).

Moreover, gene analysis showed his mother, who had subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, carried the c.506–1G > A heterozygous mutation. His father carried the c.1456G > A heterozygous mutation. His younger sister, suffering from hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, carried the same compound heterozygous mutations as the proband and was also diagnosed with GS, but with a milder clinical presentation and better treatment response.

This case highlights the potential relationship between GS and GD. Clinicians should enhance differential diagnosis protocols to prevent missed diagnoses.

### Acquired neuropathies [^111cs4Vv]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Acquired neuropathies represent most of the neuropathies encountered in clinical practice. Hundreds of causes have been identified even though up to 41% of patients are still classified as idiopathic. Routine evaluation relies on comprehensive medical history taking, clinical examination, nerve conduction studies, and laboratory tests. Other investigations, such as nerve biopsy or nerve or muscle imaging, are performed in specific settings. This review focuses on recent advances in acquired neuropathies.

### A young man with numbness in arms and legs: From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society case conference proceedings [^111iHanP]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

This patient's symptom onset and evolution were both subacute. The differential of a partial myelopathy includes structural (compressive), inflammatory, metabolic, toxic, infectious, paraneoplastic, vascular (especially spinal dural arteriovenous fistula), and malignant causes. Genetic/inherited causes usually present more insidiously. In acute cases of myelopathy, where inflammation of the spinal cord is demonstrated by imaging or in CSF, but no more specific etiology is found, the label idiopathic acute transverse myelitis may be applied, typically reaching nadir in 4–21 days. This case presented as a subacute partial myelitis.

A key clinical feature of this patient's presentation is the relative lack of early major clinical deficits despite such an extensive longitudinal spinal cord lesion, which favors neurosarcoidosis. This differs from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) pathophysiology, which typically causes extensive tissue destruction along the lesion, leading to profound early deficits. While LETM is exceptionally uncommon in MS, it is highly characteristic of NMOSD and can be associated with other inflammatory myelitides, particularly with neurosarcoidosis. Dorsal subpial post-gadolinium enhancement is characteristic of neurosarcoidosis myelitis when compared to NMOSD, whereas the ring configuration of enhancement is highly reminiscent of the inflammatory pattern most commonly affiliated with those diagnostic entities under the rubric of the NMOSD. The "trident sign" describes central canal enhancement with dorsal subpial enhancement.

### The role of spinal cord imaging in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^112kqVAy]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old male presented with fluctuating but progressive sensory disturbances, including tingling and dysesthesia in his right leg. MRI of the brain showed white matter lesions initially thought to be caused by multiple sclerosis.

- **Investigations**: Neurological examination, cerebrospinal fluid examination, laboratory blood testing, brain and spinal MRI scans.

- **Diagnosis**: Spinal cord schwannoma.

- **Management**: Surgical removal of the schwannoma. An algorithm is provided that clarifies the appropriate MRI work-up for cases where the clinical presentation is suggestive of multiple sclerosis.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A clinical review [^1159vog9]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ALS in patients with a typical disease presentation is relatively straightforward and is based on the recognition of signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration, in the presence of a progressively worsening spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions. However, in patients with very early disease presentations, slow disease progression, or central or peripheral nervous system disorders, the diagnosis can be challenging. The probability of misdiagnosis, the so‐called 'ALS mimicking syndromes', is about 7%–8% [67]. These mimicking syndromes should be ruled out as a delay in treatment may have an unfavorable effect on the outcome.

- **Patients with predominant UMN or LMN involvement**: In cases of predominant UMN involvement, clinicians should consider cervical radiculomyelopathy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, adrenomyeloneuropathy, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. For patients exhibiting pure LMN features, conditions such as plexopathy, peripheral neuropathy (e.g. multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, infectious neuropathy), or myopathies (e.g. inclusion body myositis) should be considered. Flail arm ALS needs to be differentiated from conditions like spinal muscular atrophy, Kennedy's disease, multifocal motor neuropathy, and monomelic amyotrophy. In cases of focal onset of neck extensor weakness, myasthenia gravis and focal myopathy should also be considered.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^114NCFFK]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter using simple clinical tests (B). Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical (E). Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes (E). Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient (E).

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important for a number of reasons:

1. Nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable.
2. A number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy.
3. Up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, and patients are at risk of insensate injury to their feet.
4. Autonomic neuropathy may involve every system in the body.
5. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality.

### Peripheral neuropathy evaluations of patients with prolonged long COVID [^113rn4r4]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection appears exponential, leaving a tail of patients reporting various long COVID symptoms, including unexplained fatigue/exertional intolerance and dysautonomic and sensory concerns. Indirect evidence links long COVID to incident polyneuropathy affecting the small-fiber (sensory/autonomic) axons.

- **Methods**: We analyzed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from patients with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined long COVID without prior neuropathy history or risks, who were referred for peripheral neuropathy evaluations. We captured standardized symptoms, examinations, objective neurodiagnostic test results, and outcomes, tracking participants for an average of 1.4 years.

- **Results**: Among 17 patients (mean age 43.3 years, 69% female, 94% Caucasian, and 19% Latino), 59% had at least one test interpretation confirming neuropathy. These included 63% (10/16) of skin biopsies, 17% (2/12) of electrodiagnostic tests, and 50% (4/8) of autonomic function tests. One patient was diagnosed with critical illness axonal neuropathy, and another with multifocal demyelinating neuropathy three weeks after mild COVID, and more than 10 received small-fiber neuropathy diagnoses. Longitudinal improvement averaged 52%, although none reported complete resolution. For treatment, 65% (11/17) received immunotherapies, such as corticosteroids and/or IV immunoglobulins.

- **Discussion**: Among evaluated patients with long COVID, prolonged, often disabling small-fiber neuropathy after mild SARS-CoV-2 was most common, beginning within 1 month.

The utility of rapid and reliable sensory tests appropriate for the diagnosis of neuropathy in the diabetes clinic, rather than as prognostic tools for the prediction of foot complications, has been unclear because of limitations inherent in previous studies. Although clinical practice guidelines recommend annual screening for neuropathy, they are unable to support specific recommendations for screening maneuvers due to a lack of evidence for the validity of screening tests in the medical literature. The objective of this study was to assess the operating characteristics of four simple sensory screening maneuvers as compared with standardized electrophysiological tests in the diagnosis of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.

- **Research design and methods**: We assessed four simple tests (the 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament examination [SWME], superficial pain sensation, vibration testing by the on-off method, and vibration testing by the timed method) in 478 subjects with independent blinded evaluations compared against the criterion standard of nerve conduction studies. We present receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and sensitivity and specificity values for each test.

- **Results**: The four simple screening maneuvers reveal similar operating characteristics. Cutoff points by ROC curve analyses reveal that a positive or abnormal test is represented by five incorrect responses of eight stimuli applied. A negative or normal test is represented by one or fewer incorrect responses of eight stimuli applied.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: A review [^115cK6zj]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a highly prevalent and morbid condition affecting 2% to 7% of the population. Patients frequently experience pain and are at risk of falls, ulcerations, and amputations. This review aimed to highlight recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances in distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common subtype of peripheral neuropathy.

- **Observations**: Evidence supports limited routine laboratory testing for patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Patients without a known cause should undergo a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 measurement, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, fasting glucose measurement, and glucose tolerance test. The presence of atypical features such as asymmetry, non-length dependence, motor predominance, acute or subacute onset, and prominent autonomic involvement should prompt a consultation with a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist. Although electrodiagnostic tests and magnetic resonance imaging of the neuroaxis contribute substantial costs, evidence supporting their use is lacking. Strong evidence supports the use of tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and voltage-gated calcium channel ligands for the treatment of neuropathic pain. More intensive glucose control substantially reduces the incidence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes but not in those with type 2 diabetes.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: There is potential to enhance guideline-concordant testing in patients.

### Diagnosis and management of sensory polyneuropathy [^116Rofy5]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Sensory polyneuropathies, which are caused by dysfunction of peripheral sensory nerve fibers, represent a heterogeneous group of disorders ranging from common diabetic neuropathy to rare sensory neuronopathies. The presenting symptoms, acuity, time course, severity, and subsequent morbidity vary and depend on the type of fiber affected and the underlying cause. Damage to small, thinly myelinated, and unmyelinated nerve fibers results in neuropathic pain, whereas damage to large myelinated sensory afferents results in proprioceptive deficits and ataxia. The causes of these disorders are diverse and include metabolic, toxic, infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and genetic conditions. Although idiopathic sensory polyneuropathies are common, they should be considered a diagnosis of exclusion.

The diagnostic evaluation involves electrophysiologic testing, including nerve conduction studies, histopathologic analysis of nerve tissue, serum studies, and sometimes autonomic testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include immunotherapy, mitigation of risk factors, symptomatic treatment, and gene therapy, such as recently developed RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotide therapies for transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Many of these disorders have no directed treatment, in which case management remains symptomatic and supportive. More research is needed into the underlying pathophysiology of nerve damage in these polyneuropathies to guide advances in treatment.

### Diagnosis of acute neuropathies [^113WN4yE]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute and subacute polyneuropathies present diagnostic challenges since many require prompt initiation of treatment to limit axonal degeneration. An exact and detailed diagnosis is essential for choosing the correct treatment. It is, for instance, of utmost importance to recognize whether the underlying pathological changes are due to demyelination or axonal degeneration. Electrodiagnostic tests can often significantly contribute to securing an exact diagnosis.

The specific and characteristic electrophysiological findings in the different types of acute and subacute neuropathies are discussed. The various electrophysiological pitfalls and technical problems encountered in these patients are also mentioned.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for diabetic neuropathy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a careful history. Assess either temperature or pinprick sensation (small-fiber function) and vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function) for the assessment of distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Obtain annual 10-g monofilament testing in all patients with diabetes to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation.

### Uncovering hidden profiles: From pain-centric to multi-symptom small fiber neuropathy [^112JWERR]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Symptom localization**: The localization data for burning pain, pins and needles, and numbness were available for the original cohort of 105 patients (Figure 3, Table S3). The three symptoms were not observed in the same location in individual patients, which was also reflected at the group level by different patterns of symptom distribution within clusters.

	- **Figure 3**: Localization of SFN symptoms of each cluster. Depicted is the percent of patients in the algesic (A), myalgic (B), and pauci-symptomatic (C) clusters who marked the location of burning pain (first column), pins and needles (second column), and numbness (third column) on a stick figure. Note the proximal involvement of symptoms in all clusters, the stocking-glove distribution of symptoms in the algesic cluster (A), and the relative proximal involvement of pins and needles and numbness in the pauci-symptomatic cluster (C).

Most patients in all clusters reported symptoms in their feet; however, the involvement of more proximal sites differed between clusters (Figure 3; Table S3). Patients in the algesic cluster experienced symptoms in a stocking-glove pattern with symptoms in feet reported by most patients, followed by symptoms in hands and then in more proximal sites (Figure 3A). Symptoms were more generalized in the other two clusters (Figure 3B, C). Although burning pain was most widely distributed in the algesic group, only feet and hands were significantly more frequently affected, indicating that burning pain affects more proximal areas in the myalgic and pauci-symptomatic clusters (Table S3).

Regarding medical management for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, especially concerning other systemic agents, EANO/EONS/ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend considering the following agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain:

- **Venlafaxine**: Effective in alleviating neuropathic pain symptoms.
- **Pregabalin**: Commonly used for managing pain associated with neuropathy.
- **Amitriptyline**: Offers relief for varying pain intensities.
- **Tramadol or strong opioids**: Recommended for severe pain management.

### Evaluation and management of the dysesthetic patient [^114caW1R]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a symptomatology that includes sensations such as pain, burning, crawling, biting, numbness, piercing, pulling, cold, shock-like feelings, wetness, and heat. These sensations can cause significant emotional distress and functional impairment in affected individuals. Although some cases of dysesthesia are secondary to organic etiologies, most exist without an identifiable infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, or neoplastic process. Ongoing vigilance is required for the consideration of evolving processes, including paraneoplastic presentations.

Elusive etiologies, unclear treatment regimens, and stigma present challenges for both patients and clinicians, leading to a difficult path often marked by "doctor shopping", lack of treatment, and significant psychosocial distress. This study addresses the symptomatology and the psychosocial burden that often accompanies it. Although notoriously labeled as "difficult to treat", dysesthesia patients can be effectively managed, providing life-changing relief possible for those affected.

### Uncovering hidden profiles: From pain-centric to multi-symptom small fiber neuropathy [^1168GusW]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN), resulting from dysfunction and loss of peripheral unmyelinated and thinly myelinated nerve fibers, is traditionally characterized by distal skin pain and sensory loss. Patients often report additional symptoms, including muscle cramps, myalgias, fatigue, subjective weakness, and neuropathic itch, but the prevalence and intensity of these symptoms remain poorly defined. Treatments — focused primarily on pain — are often ineffective, possibly due to substantial between-patient heterogeneity. This study aimed to characterize the symptomatic variability of SFN and determine whether patients can be stratified into clinically meaningful subgroups.

- **Methods**: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were analyzed from patients with skin biopsy-confirmed SFN (n = 203) and healthy controls (n = 30). SFN patients were clustered based on clinical features using unsupervised machine learning.

- **Results**: Fatigue — not neuropathic pain — was the most prevalent and intense symptom among patients with SFN. Muscle symptoms were as common and severe as neuropathic pain, while neuropathic itch was rare. Three distinct phenotypic clusters were identified: (1) an "algesic" group (~20%) with severe neuropathic pain and co-occurring intense symptoms; (2) a "myalgic" group (~60%) with prominent fatigue, myalgias, and subjective weakness but milder neuropathic pain; and (3) a "pauci-symptomatic" group with few, mild to moderate symptoms. Clusters differed by symptom profiles, disease duration, intraepidermal nerve fiber density, sex, and body mass.

### Adcetris [^116wptZa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Adcetris treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. Adcetris-induced peripheral neuropathy is cumulative.

In studies of Adcetris as monotherapy, 62% of patients experienced any grade of peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset was 3 months (range, 0–12). Of the patients who experienced neuropathy, 62% had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement, and 14% had no improvement at their last evaluation. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement was 5 months (range, 0–45). Of the patients with ongoing neuropathy (38%), 71% had Grade 1, 24% had Grade 2, and 4% had Grade 3.

In ECHELON-1 (Study 5), 67% of patients treated with Adcetris + AVD experienced any grade of peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of any grade was 2 months (range, 0–7), of Grade 2 was 3 months (range, 0–6), and of Grade 3 was 4 months (range, < 1–7). By the time of the primary analysis, 43% of affected patients had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement, and 33% had no improvement at their last evaluation. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 2 months (range, 0–32).

### Guillain-Barré syndrome: A comprehensive review [^111pFwoh]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Inflammatory neuropathy is likely if the onset and progression are acute or subacute (over days or weeks) and accompanied by elevated CSF protein and improvement of symptoms with immunosuppression or immunomodulation. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is most probable if the neuropathy is acute, inflammatory, and monophasic. Mimics include disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems, and in some instances, only time will confirm or refute a diagnosis of GBS. The differential diagnosis of GBS based on localization is summarized in Figure 4.

- **Peripheral nerve mimics of GBS**: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) may present acutely with sensory-motor disturbance, resembling acute CIDP (A-CIDP). Autoimmune nodopathies (AIN) can also be acute and monophasic, but often exhibit additional features. Notably, patients with NF186 or pan-neurofascin antibodies (against NF155, NF140, and NF186) typically experience a severe, GBS-like neuropathy with cranio-respiratory and autonomic involvement. A-CIDP or autoimmune nodopathy is more probable with three or more TRFs, progression or (re)deterioration over eight weeks from onset, or significant sensory disturbance, including sensory ataxia. Slow disease onset (more than two weeks from onset to nadir) or significant early reduction in motor CV may also indicate an alternative diagnosis. It is crucial to distinguish GBS.

### Peripheral neuropathies in rheumatic disease — a guide to diagnosis [^115CvkRF]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder that can be associated with a wide range of conditions, including rheumatic disease. Although the association of the two disorders can be coincidental, an underlying pathogenic link can occur in many instances, which can affect treatment options. The presentation of peripheral neuropathy can be multifaceted, which is important to consider when recognizing the condition and optimizing diagnosis. Furthermore, understanding the diagnostic strategy will help physicians treating patients with rheumatic disease who develop peripheral neuropathy.

Although available treatment options have greatly reduced the risk of patients with inflammatory disorders developing systemic complications, such as peripheral neuropathy, new therapeutic agents can trigger toxic or immune-mediated neuropathies. Treatment will need to be adjusted accordingly. In this review, we discuss the general approach for diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy and detail the presentation, pathophysiological features, and general rules of treatment for patients with peripheral neuropathy in the context of rheumatic disease.

### Peripheral neuropathy in glycogen storage disease type III: Fact or myth [^114ocHtc]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess whether peripheral neuropathy is a feature of glycogen storage disease type IIIa (GSD IIIa) in adult patients.

- **Methods**: Medical records of a cohort of adult GSD IIIa patients who underwent electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were reviewed, and the results were correlated with physical examination findings.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients underwent EMG and NCS; 4 complained of exercise intolerance, 1 of foot paresthesia, and 11 of muscle weakness (3 proximal, 8 distal). None of the patients had sensory deficits on clinical examination. All motor and sensory conduction velocities and sensory amplitudes were within reference ranges. EMG showed myopathic motor unit potentials in 15 of the 16 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Based on the clinical examination and the NCS and EMG results, we did not identify any peripheral nerve involvement in our adult patients diagnosed with GSD IIIa.

### Fatigue as the presenting symptom of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^1124ubBQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

Different clinical presentations of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) have been described. Fatigue is generally considered to be a secondary sign and is not mentioned as a warning sign for the diagnosis. We present a patient with CIDP in whom fatigue remained the only symptom, thereby stressing the importance of adding this disease to the differential diagnosis of fatigue. Immunomodulatory treatment did not change the clinical course of the patient, but electrodiagnostic features improved substantially.

### Neurocutaneous disease: Neurocutaneous dysesthesias [^114dTRJa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a generic term for a cutaneous symptom, such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain, without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location often caused by nerve trauma, impingement, or irritation. There are multiple types of dysesthesias depending on the body location and the nerves involved. While location, exact symptoms, and etiologies might vary, the underlying theme is that these conditions are of neurologic origin and have dermatologic consequences.

For many of these conditions, the symptoms are localized to the skin, and patients frequently present to the dermatologist. It is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about these symptoms and their underlying causes. In part II of this continuing medical education review, the primary diagnoses associated with underlying cutaneous dysesthesias will be explored, including scalp dysesthesia, trigeminal trophic syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. The typical demographics in terms of symptoms, location, and patient populations will be discussed, in addition to the specific etiologies, workups, and possible treatment options.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^115C5CGt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosing and assessing the severity of DSPN and painful DSPN

A broad spectrum of presentations may occur in patients with DSPN, ranging from very severe painful symptoms with few signs, to the presence of a foot ulcer without any painful symptoms. Patients might describe their feet as feeling "numb" or "dead". It is well recognized that the severity of symptoms may not correlate with the severity of the deficit on clinical examination.

- **Diagnosing and assessing severity of DSPN**:
	- The American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement recommends that the diagnosis of painful DSPN in clinical practice be based on the patient's description of pain and typical features of peripheral neuropathy, such as reduction of sensory modalities and absence or reduction of ankle/knee reflexes. DSPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, necessitating a thorough clinical history, and a peripheral neurological and vascular examination of the lower limbs to exclude other causes of neuropathic pain, such as peripheral vascular disease, arthritis, malignancy, alcohol abuse, and spinal canal stenosis. NC studies are rarely helpful in clinical practice but might assist in excluding other causes of pain, such as entrapment syndromes. Patients with asymmetrical symptoms and/or signs, rapid progression of symptoms, or a predominance of motor symptoms should be carefully assessed.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^112i6Mi3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Patients in high-risk groups, particularly those presenting with early symptoms of thiamine deficiency or long-term symptoms such as heart failure and numbness in the extremities, should undergo a targeted history and physical examination. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by a triad of symptoms: nystagmus, confusion, and ataxia. With a high index of suspicion, routine investigations such as electrolytes, urea and creatinine, blood alcohol content, B12, thiamine pyrophosphate levels, erythrocyte transketolase activity, or a computed tomography scan can be ordered to support diagnosis.

- **Management**: Management of thiamine deficiencies presenting neurological and cardiovascular manifestations should include thiamine supplementation of 200 mg intravenously (IV) or orally three times a day until symptoms resolve. A maintenance dose of 10 mg daily should continue after symptoms have resolved. In an acute crisis, 50 mg of thiamine should be administered intramuscularly (IM) for approximately 2 to 4 days, followed by an oral maintenance period.

### Acupuncture for the treatment of the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance-numbness/tingling symptom cluster in breast cancer survivors: A feasibility trial [^117F55i2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind to examine the feasibility of acupuncture in the management of a symptom cluster in people with cancer. Previous trials have largely focused on acupuncture for a single symptom. A small number of trials have examined multiple symptoms, but not a pre-defined symptom cluster, where symptoms were selected based on the characteristics of the patient group, a core symptom and its associated symptoms, or by the prevalence or severity of the symptoms. In this way, these trials examine the symptoms independent of each other, rather than as a pre-defined cluster of inter-related symptoms. Symptom cluster research using acupuncture is emerging, and the findings of a recently published research protocol focusing on a symptom cluster involving cognitive function will provide additional insights.

Our findings on TCM syndromes are consistent with previous studies which have associated breast cancer with qi and xie (blood) deficiency. Future studies may be guided by these findings in designing acupuncture treatment protocols for this cohort.

- **Limitations**: Our study has several limitations. First, the study was a single cohort in a single setting, without blinding of participants or practitioners, reducing external validity and increasing risk of bias. Secondly, the acupuncture intervention was completely individualized and determined according to the expertise and clinical reasoning of the acupuncturist on the day, which may not be based on the SOHQ-50 taken at baseline. While this pragmatic approach reflects the clinical…

### Peripheral neuropathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1168MNPu]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases.

Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation.

If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing is recommended.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: Symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^117MEr5m]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Adult and pediatric VIPN

In the pediatric cohort, VIPN typically presents as motor predominant. However, sensory neuropathy is difficult to evaluate in young children, as they may have difficulty communicating their experiences of sensory symptoms such as 'numbness and tingling'. On the other hand, motor neuropathy is easier to detect clinically, with patients often being visibly weaker and less active. Conversely, in adults, 'numbness and tingling' is a distinct abnormal sensation that patients can often easily recognize and report. In contrast, motor neuropathy symptoms, including weakness and cramping, are often difficult to attribute solely to treatment side effects as opposed to cancer or age-related deconditioning.

Electrophysiological examinations in pediatric VIPN have also demonstrated greater motor compared to sensory nerve involvement, suggesting the motor-predominant neuropathy may not be purely due to symptom communication difficulties or myopathy. While the specific reasons behind this difference remain unknown, the difference in phenotypes may be related to age-dependent molecular changes in axonal function which may affect repair or regeneration pathways. Experimental models of traumatic injury or inherited neuropathy have also demonstrated differences in phenotypic expression of symptoms based on age, highlighting that age-dependent changes in axonal function may influence VIPN presentation between adults and children. In the present adult study, there were reductions in both motor and sensory amplitudes by the end of treatment; however, patients reporting.

The authors prospectively studied 120 consecutive patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) to identify the clinical and laboratory features that most accurately distinguished symptomatic from classic TN. After a standardized evaluation, they identified 24 patients with symptomatic TN. Age, sensory examination, and affected division were not useful in the differential diagnosis. In contrast, electrophysiologic testing of trigeminal reflexes accurately distinguished symptomatic from classic TN (sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%).

### Clinical utility of electrodiagnostic consultation in suspected polyneuropathy [^112GnKbf]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Although paresthesias of the distal lower limbs are characteristic features of polyneuropathy, they may also herald the presence of a focal neuropathy, polyradiculopathy, or myelopathy. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) are widely used in the evaluation of such symptoms, but their utility has not been subjected to vigorous scrutiny. We investigated the clinical impact of the electrodiagnostic consultation in assessing suspected polyneuropathy. The result of the electrodiagnostic consultation was confirmatory in only 39% of all patients when compared with the clinical impression, and it changed the diagnosis or uncovered an additional diagnosis in 43% of cases. An alternative diagnosis was likely when either weakness was present (75%) or the Achilles stretch reflex was preserved (48%). These data support the use of EMG/NCS in the diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting with distal paresthesias, especially in those with preserved Achilles reflexes or motor deficits.

### Nerve biopsy: Current indications and decision tools [^113UjYAf]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

While the utility of nerve biopsy in the clinical setting has decreased over recent years, it continues to play a role in the diagnostic workup of highly selected patients. Although nerve biopsy does not significantly affect the diagnosis or management in a large proportion of patients, it is crucial to consider factors that might maximize the diagnostic yield should a nerve biopsy be performed. This includes the clinical features of the neuropathy, appropriate nerve selection, consideration of combination tissue biopsies, and the appropriate use of neuropathology techniques.

### The clinical spectrum of isolated peripheral motor dysfunction [^112dn5jm]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Isolated peripheral motor dysfunction due to lower motor neuron or peripheral nerve disorders presents an interesting challenge to clinicians because of the diverse differential diagnosis with a broad range of prognoses.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of adults who presented over 12 years with muscle weakness, atrophy, or fasciculations, but without hyperreflexia or sensory involvement.

- **Results**: In 119 patients, 52% had a motor neuron disease (MND), 13% had immune neuropathies, 11% had genetic neuronopathies, 10% had residual or post-polio syndrome, 5% had benign fasciculation, 1% had an infectious etiology, and 8% were not given a final diagnosis. Only MND patients had cognitive dysfunction or frontal release signs. Bulbar and respiratory symptoms virtually excluded consideration of immune neuropathy.

- **Conclusions**: Only half of the patients were diagnosed with MND. A significant minority have treatable conditions. Cognitive involvement, frontal release signs, and bulbar or respiratory symptoms are strongly suggestive of MND.

### Uncovering hidden profiles: From pain-centric to multi-symptom small fiber neuropathy [^113E72dB]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN), resulting from dysfunction and loss of peripheral unmyelinated and thinly myelinated nerve fibers, is traditionally characterized by distal skin pain and sensory loss. Patients often report additional symptoms, including muscle cramps, myalgias, fatigue, subjective weakness, and neuropathic itch, but the prevalence and intensity of these symptoms remain poorly defined. Treatments — focused primarily on pain — are often ineffective, possibly due to substantial between-patient heterogeneity. This study aimed to characterize the symptomatic variability of SFN and determine whether patients can be stratified into clinically meaningful subgroups.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were analyzed from patients with skin biopsy-confirmed SFN (n = 203) and healthy controls (n = 30). SFN patients were clustered based on clinical features using unsupervised machine learning.

Fatigue — not neuropathic pain — was the most prevalent and intense symptom among patients with SFN. Muscle symptoms were as common and severe as neuropathic pain, while neuropathic itch was rare. Three distinct phenotypic clusters were identified:

- **Algesic group (~20%)**: This group experienced severe neuropathic pain and co-occurring intense symptoms.
- **Myalgic group (~60%)**: Characterized by prominent fatigue, myalgias, and subjective weakness but milder neuropathic pain.
- **Pauci-symptomatic group**: Featuring few, mild to moderate symptoms.

Clusters differed by symptom profiles, disease duration, intraepidermal nerve fiber density, and sex.

### Acupuncture for the treatment of the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance-numbness/tingling symptom cluster in breast cancer survivors: A feasibility trial [^113WqeBW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Acupuncture, using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome diagnosis, may provide an option for symptom cluster management. Using a TCM approach, a patient's signs and symptoms are considered together as a "TCM syndrome", a concept similar to a clinical phenotype, which refers to a particular pattern of multiple-concomitant symptoms rather than single-independent symptoms. In traditional clinical practice, the TCM syndrome diagnosis guides the treatment prescription, with acupuncture points, needle stimulation, depth, and retention selected to best treat that syndrome. The symptom cluster management approach and TCM approach to patient care are similar, both considering the relationship between a group of inter-related symptoms.

Acupuncture has demonstrated benefits in a range of single symptoms in women with breast cancer. It is recommended for general cancer-related pain and aromatase-inhibitor-related arthralgia in ASCO-SIO guidelines. Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture may also lead to reductions in chemotherapy-related peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) presented as "numbness and tingling", cancer-related fatigue (CRF), and sleep disturbance. To our knowledge, there have been no clinical trials investigating acupuncture for symptom clusters using a TCM approach at the time of writing.

The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of acupuncture for the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance-numbness/tingling symptom cluster in women with breast cancer who have completed treatment. The secondary aim was to investigate the correlation between TCM syndromes and this symptom cluster.

### Peripheral neuropathy in complex inherited diseases: an approach to diagnosis [^112nHukG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common finding in patients with complex inherited neurological diseases and may be subclinical or a major component of the phenotype. This review aims to provide a clinical approach to the diagnosis of this complex group of patients by addressing key questions, including the predominant neurological syndrome associated with the neuropathy, for example, spasticity, the type of neuropathy, and the other neurological and non-neurological features of the syndrome. Priority is given to the diagnosis of treatable conditions. Using this approach, we associated neuropathy with one of three major syndromic categories:

- **Ataxia**
- **Spasticity**
- **Global neurodevelopmental impairment**:

Syndromes that do not fall easily into one of these three categories can be grouped according to the predominant system involved in addition to the neuropathy, for example, cardiomyopathy and neuropathy. We also include a separate category of complex inherited relapsing neuropathy syndromes, some of which may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome, as many will have a metabolic aetiology and be potentially treatable.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: A critical analysis [^112uf43Q]. CA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, more specifically with respect to the initial assessment, ACS 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining a standardized assessment of CIPN, including baseline assessment and risk profile. Long-term follow-up should be conducted at more than 2–3 months after treatment. Calculating the Total Neuropathy Score or its clinical version is essential, along with obtaining objective evidence of neurological deficits.

Patient-reported outcomes, including FACT/GOG-Ntx, EORTC QLQ-CIPN20, PNQ, and CIPN-R-ODS, are crucial. Additionally, nerve conduction studies are recommended in the clinical trials setting.

### Clinical reasoning: A 60-year-old man with asymmetric weakness and persistent fever [^111M6iZj]. Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies, especially those with atypical features, remain a diagnostic challenge. In this case, a 60-year-old patient presented with acute-onset weakness starting in the right hand, then sequentially involving the left leg, left hand, and right leg over 5 days. The asymmetric weakness was accompanied by persistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers. Subsequent development of rashes, combined with a careful review of the history, led us to the final diagnosis and targeted treatment.

This case highlights clinical pattern recognition with the help of electrophysiologic studies in peripheral neuropathies, which provide shortcuts to narrow the differential diagnosis. We also illustrate the important pitfalls from history taking to ancillary testing in diagnosing the rare but treatable cause of peripheral neuropathy.

### Acupuncture for the treatment of the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance-numbness/tingling symptom cluster in breast cancer survivors: a feasibility trial [^117G9jp4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Breast cancer survivors following disease-modifying treatment frequently experience multiple concurrent symptoms, which negatively impact their quality of life and increase the risk of polypharmacy. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of acupuncture for managing the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance-numbness/tingling symptom cluster in breast cancer survivors and investigates relationships between the symptom cluster and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome diagnosis.

This was a single-arm, pre-test/post-test feasibility trial conducted at Chris O'Brien Lifehouse Hospital, Australia. Breast cancer survivors who had completed treatment and experienced clinically significant levels of two or more symptoms — pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, numbness/tingling — were eligible to participate in the individualized, pragmatic 6-week acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was feasibility and acceptability, while effectiveness was explored using a symptom cluster mean score.

Twenty women enrolled in the study over an 11-week period, with 90% completing the study. Most participants agreed or completely agreed that acupuncture was feasible (85%), acceptable (90%), and appropriate (90%). Both mean and composite symptom cluster scores were significantly reduced (p < 0.001), as were individual symptom scores in fatigue (p < 0.001), sleep disturbance (p = 0.04), and numbness/tingling (p = 0.01).

### Uncovering hidden profiles: From pain-centric to multi-symptom small fiber neuropathy [^111ns2mi]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Interestingly, BMI and fatigue did not correlate in the myalgic cluster. The pathophysiology of fatigue, instead, has been hypothesized to be secondary to an overactive or dysregulated immune response resulting in both higher and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Given the more generalized localization of symptoms and the well-described association of fatigue and post-infectious SFN, we suggest that a low-grade immune dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of that cluster.

The pauci-symptomatic cluster was characterized by patients who experienced only a few symptoms, which were generally of low to moderate intensities. While the other two clusters are female predominant, this one involves a significantly higher proportion of males. Human DRGs from patients suffering from pain revealed major sex differences in the gene expression pattern between males and females. Accordingly, sex-specific differences in DRG gene expression patterns may contribute to the less severe phenotype that characterizes this cluster.

### Factors associated with levels of pain intensity in patients with intermittent paresthesia [^116CpCsK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Distorted thinking, such as worst-case thoughts and fear of painful movement, and feelings of distress, like worry and despair, are important and modifiable aspects of human illness. It is possible that a more intense experience of intermittent paresthesia of the fingers, interpreted as "pain", might be associated with higher levels of misinterpretation and distress regarding sensations. In patients seeking specialist care for intermittent paresthesia of the fingers, we asked what factors are associated with general and nighttime "pain" intensity, as well as levels of incapability.

In a cross-sectional study, 142 adult patients with symptoms of intermittent paresthesia of the fingers completed a survey. This included measures of unhelpful thoughts and feelings of distress regarding symptoms, symptoms of depression, an 11-point ordinal rating of pain intensity, and a measure of upper extremity-specific capability. Bivariate, linear regression, and cluster analyses sought factors associated with greater pain intensity and level of incapability.

Greater general and night pain intensity and greater levels of incapability were all associated with higher levels of distress regarding symptoms.

Among patients with intermittent paresthesia of the fingers, relatively notable levels of pain intensity and incapability are associated with modifiable mindset factors.

When clinicians notice a patient experiencing or describing paresthesia as pain, it can signal them to guide patients to a healthy understanding of compressive neuropathy.

Recommendations

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, using simple clinical tests. Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. Screening for signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient.

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important for several reasons:

1. Nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable.
2. A number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy.
3. Up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic and patients are at risk of insensate injury to their feet.
4. Autonomic neuropathy, and particularly cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, is associated with substantial morbidity and even mortality.

Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is crucial.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Peripheral nerve biopsy [^112FFBg9]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common disorder with many possible etiologies, including metabolic diseases, inflammatory conditions, infections, malignancy, inherited diseases, drugs, and toxins. In most instances, diagnosis and treatment plans can be established based on clinical presentation, family history, laboratory results, genetic testing, and electrophysiological studies. However, in some situations, a peripheral nerve biopsy remains a valuable tool, especially for patients with rapidly progressive disease, atypical presentations, or where other approaches fail to yield a definitive diagnosis.

The pathologic examination starts with basic decisions about specimen triage. A few basic questions help to provide an initial framework for the assessment of a nerve biopsy: is the specimen adequate; are there inflammatory changes; are there vascular changes; is there amyloid; are there changes to axonal density and the Schwann cell-myelin-axon unit. In the appropriate context and with such an approach, peripheral nerve biopsies can still represent a clinically helpful test.

### Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy [^116qFQZM]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuropathies are a group of clinical disorders that involve injury to primary first-order neurons within the trigeminal nerve. This review examines the spectrum of etiologies underlying both painful and non-painful trigeminal neuropathies, with particular attention to especially dangerous processes that may elude the clinician without meticulous evaluation. Complications and management issues specific to patients with trigeminal neuropathy are also discussed.

- **Methods**: The study used a retrospective literature review.
- **Results**: Facial or intraoral numbness, the hallmark of trigeminal neuropathy, may indicate the earliest symptomology of malignancy or autoimmune connective tissue disease as sensory neurons are destroyed. Such numbness, especially when progressive, necessitates periodic evaluation and vigilance, even years after presentation, if no diagnosis can be made.
- **Conclusions**: In the routine evaluation of patients with facial pain, clinicians will inevitably encounter secondary pathology of the trigeminal nerves and nuclei. The appearance of numbness, even when pain remains the most pressing complaint, necessitates clinical assessment of the integrity of all aspects of the trigeminal pathways. This may also include neurophysiologic, radiographic, and laboratory evaluations.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Clinical and radiological manifestations, pathophysiology, and outstanding questions [^116wEimm]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of PRES in patients presenting with specific neurological symptoms and risk factors. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating PRES from other neurological conditions with similar presentations.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least one acute neurological symptom, at least one risk factor, specific findings on brain imaging, and the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Acute neurological symptoms may include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headache, or visual disturbances. Risk factors encompass severe hypertension or blood pressure fluctuations, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder. The brain imaging should either be normal or show bilateral vasogenic edema or cytotoxic edema with a pattern indicative of PRES.

The diagnostic criteria for PRES are met if all four components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for PRES are not met, suggesting the need for further investigation into alternative diagnoses. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of PRES, facilitating early recognition and appropriate management of this condition.

### Pitfalls in the diagnostic evaluation of subacute combined degeneration [^112SgKD1]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 43-year-old man presenting with a 2-week history of painless ascending sensory disturbances, suspected to be suffering from acute inflammatory polyneuropathy. On clinical examination, deep tendon reflexes were preserved and muscle strength was 5/5 everywhere. Gait was ataxic with a positive Romberg test. Lumbar puncture was normal, and electroneurography demonstrated demyelination. With spinal cord involvement centered on the posterior tracts on MRI, the differential diagnosis focused on cobalamin deficiency.

Initial laboratory workup showed nearly normal holotranscobalamin (43 pmol/L, normal > 50), suggesting no vitamin B12 deficiency. Surprisingly, further testing, including methylmalonic acid (3732 nmol/L, normal < 271) and homocysteine (48.5 µmol/L, normal < 10), showed an impairment of vitamin B12-dependent metabolism, leading to the diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration. Only after repeated history-taking did the patient remember having taken tablets containing cobalamin for 3 days before hospitalization. In cases of B12 deficiency, holotranscobalamin can rapidly normalize during supplementation, whereas methylmalonic acid and homocysteine might help detect B12 deficiency in patients who recently started supplementation.

### Thalomid [^111iBEgT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Thalomid is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral neuropathy is a common (≥ 10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with Thalomid that may be irreversible. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported. The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear. Symptoms may occur some time after Thalomid treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.

Few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long-term Thalomid treatment. However, the inability clinically to differentiate Thalomid neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in ENL makes it difficult to determine accurately the incidence of Thalomid-related neuropathy in patients with ENL treated with Thalomid.

Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of Thalomid therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy, which include numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet. Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment. Patients should be regularly counseled, questioned, and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy develop, Thalomid should be discontinued.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^112KfWHD]. Brain Pathology (2024). Low credibility.

Over time, axon loss becomes more severe, making demyelinating lesions difficult to identify, either electrophysiologically or pathologically. Consequently, such patients are sometimes wrongly considered to have an axonal polyneuropathy and are not treated correctly. For these reasons, it might be more appropriate to reuse the original term "CIP" rather than "CIDP".

### Muscle weakness in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114rs1Wt]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Although the prevalence of muscle weakness in the general population is uncertain, it occurs in about 5% of U.S. adults 60 years and older. Determining the cause of muscle weakness can be challenging. True muscle weakness must first be differentiated from subjective fatigue or pain-related motor impairment with normal motor strength. Muscle weakness should then be graded objectively using a formal tool such as the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale.

The differential diagnosis of true muscle weakness is extensive, including neurologic, rheumatologic, endocrine, genetic, medication- or toxin-related, and infectious etiologies. A stepwise approach to narrowing this differential diagnosis relies on the history and physical examination combined with knowledge of the potential etiologies. Frailty and sarcopenia are clinical syndromes occurring in older people that can present with generalized weakness. Asymmetric weakness is more common in neurologic conditions, whereas pain is more common in neuropathies or radiculopathies.

Identifying abnormal findings, such as Chvostek sign, Babinski reflex, hoarse voice, and muscle atrophy, will narrow the possible diagnoses. Laboratory testing, including electrolyte, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and creatine kinase measurements, may also be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated if there is concern for acute neurologic conditions, such as stroke or cauda equina syndrome, and may also guide muscle biopsy. Electromyography is indicated when certain diagnoses are being considered, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^114X1p9K]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

No single sign or physical finding is diagnostic of neuropathic pain. Nearly 50% of patients with musculoskeletal pain use words commonly associated with neuropathic pain, such as "shooting" and "tingling", to describe their pain; as much as 30% of patients with non-neuropathic pain will describe "burning" sensations, making it difficult to rely solely on patient history and descriptions. Consequently, a thorough examination is crucial to determining the actual presence of neuropathic pain over more ambiguous symptoms or conditions.

The physical examination for neuropathic pain is straightforward and should include evaluation of tone, strength, reflexes, sensation, and vasomotor/sudomotor activity. The examination requires specific tools and procedures:

- **Pinprick sensation**: Tested with a paperclip or pin.
- **Light touch**: Assessed using a cotton ball or fingers.
- **Cold response**: Evaluated with a reflex hammer cooled with tap water.
- **Vibration sensation**: Checked using a tuning fork at 128 Hz.
- **Vasomotor responses**: Assessed with a thermometer.

Classically, a patient's abnormal sensation in the area of maximal pain intensity is indicative of neuropathic pain. Sensory changes should be rated as "increased", "decreased", or "normal"; a patient with neuropathic pain will commonly demonstrate decreased sensation to some sensory modalities while reporting pain in response to others. The overall purpose of the examination should be to either confirm or rule out the involvement of relevant neural pathways based on the patient's history.

If a neural lesion is suspected, electroneuromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) can be performed to better define the condition.

### Gitelman syndrome with Graves' disease leading to rhabdomyolysis: A case report and literature review [^114iNPh3]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male patient who suffered from limb numbness, fatigue, and hypokalemia was initially considered to have Graves' disease (GD) complicated by thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). Despite treatment with antithyroid drugs, he developed severe hypokalemia and rhabdomyolysis (RM). Further laboratory tests revealed hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemia, and hyperaldosteronism. Genetic testing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC12A3 gene (c.506–1G > A, c.1456G > A) encoding the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter, indicating a definitive diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome (GS).

Gene analysis revealed that his mother, diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, carried the c.506–1G > A heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene, and his father carried the c.1456G > A heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene. His younger sister, who had hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, carried the same compound heterozygous mutations as the proband and was also diagnosed with GS, but with a milder clinical presentation and better treatment outcome.

This case suggests a potential relationship between GS and GD, emphasizing that clinicians should strengthen the differential diagnosis process to avoid missed diagnoses.

### Cipro [^116gA7SB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Fluoroquinolones, including Cipro, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including Cipro. Symptoms may occur soon after the initiation of Cipro and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue Cipro immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations, including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength, in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including Cipro, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].
