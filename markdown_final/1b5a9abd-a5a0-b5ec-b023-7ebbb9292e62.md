## Question

Which of the following relies on internal resources to cope with a problem?

Answer Choices:
A. Problem-focused coping
B. Emotion-focused coping
C. Cognitive dissonance
D. Semantic differential

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option relies on internal resources to cope with a problem. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions of problem-focused versus emotion-focused coping. Then, I should verify whether emotion-focused coping is indeed internally oriented. Next, I will examine cognitive dissonance and semantic differential to ensure they are not coping strategies. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the coping framework. Problem-focused coping targets the external stressor directly, such as changing the situation or removing the source of stress, whereas emotion-focused coping targets the internal emotional response to the stressor, such as reappraisal, acceptance, or emotional regulation, which are inherently internal processes.

> Wait, let me verify the internal versus external distinction. Emotion-focused coping relies on internal resources like cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, or acceptance to manage distress, whereas problem-focused coping relies on external action to alter the stressor itself; this internal orientation is precisely why emotion-focused strategies are emphasized in contexts where the stressor cannot be changed, such as advanced illness or existential threats.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the distractors. Cognitive dissonance is a theoretical construct describing discomfort from conflicting cognitions, not a coping strategy, so it does not fit the question of coping with a problem. Similarly, semantic differential is a psychometric scaling method used to measure connotative meaning, not a way of coping with stressors.

> I should double-check the options against the evidence. The provided sources consistently categorize coping into problem-focused versus emotion-focused, with emotion-focused strategies explicitly described as internal approaches to managing emotional responses, which aligns with the question's request for internal-resource reliance.

> Putting this together, the correct answer is B. Emotion-focused coping, because it relies on internal resources to regulate emotions and appraisals rather than changing the external problem itself.

---

The correct answer is **B. Emotion-focused coping**. Emotion-focused coping relies on internal resources such as reappraisal, acceptance, and emotional regulation to manage stress, whereas problem-focused coping uses external actions to change the stressor. Cognitive dissonance is a mental conflict, not a coping strategy, and semantic differential is a measurement tool, not a coping approach.

## Definitions and explanations

### Problem-focused coping

Problem-focused coping involves **external actions** to directly address or remove the stressor, such as problem-solving, time management, or seeking information. It is best suited when the stressor is controllable or changeable [^08525dab].

---

### Emotion-focused coping

Emotion-focused coping involves **internal strategies** to manage emotional responses to stressors, such as reappraisal, acceptance, mindfulness, or seeking emotional support. It is especially useful when the stressor is uncontrollable or when the emotional impact needs mitigation [^08525dab] [^51a66a8e].

---

### Cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon characterized by **mental discomfort** from holding conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. It is not a coping strategy but rather a state that may prompt coping responses [^notfound].

---

### Semantic differential

Semantic differential is a **psychological scaling technique** used to measure the connotative meaning of concepts, objects, or events. It is a research tool, not a coping strategy [^fbe7645e].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Description** | **Internal vs. external resources** | **Coping strategy?** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A. Problem-focused coping | External actions to change the stressor | External | Yes |
| B. Emotion-focused coping | Internal strategies to manage emotional responses | Internal | Yes |
| C. Cognitive dissonance | Mental discomfort from conflicting cognitions | Internal | No |
| D. Semantic differential | Psychological scaling technique | External (tool) | No |

---

## Conclusion

Emotion-focused coping (**B**) is the strategy that relies on internal resources to cope with problems, using internal strategies such as reappraisal, acceptance, and emotional regulation [^08525dab] [^51a66a8e].

### Validation of the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis stigma scale: performance of likert and semantic differential scale versions [^fbe7645e]. AIDS and Behavior (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of previously published work identified no difference between performance of Semantic Differential and Likert scales, yet some studies found Semantic labeling increased performance There are several possible reasons that the Likert scale in our study items outperformed the Semantic Differential scale. First, it was difficult to translate more complex logic of Likert items into the simplified Semantic Differential format we were using. Second, we selected a transformation of items from Likert to Semantic that required greater changes to item wording than some prior studies. These prior studies used nearly identical wording for both scales, changing only the response format. We opted for a more condensed Semantic scale, using a single stem for all items (People taking PrEP are…). Higher completion rates for Likert items relative to Semantic Differential items may indicate that such items are more acceptable or interpretable, which conforms to previous findings that participants prefer Likert scale formats. Last, it is possible that the performance across different response formats depends on the specific domains of assessment. Regardless of the reason for the difference, the substantial performance difference identified in this study argues for more use of head-to-head comparisons of scale response formatting.

### Clinical diagnostics in human genetics with semantic similarity searches in ontologies [^6bd5039e]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

The differential diagnostic process attempts to identify candidate diseases that best explain a set of clinical features. This process can be complicated by the fact that the features can have varying degrees of specificity, as well as by the presence of features unrelated to the disease itself. Depending on the experience of the physician and the availability of laboratory tests, clinical abnormalities may be described in greater or lesser detail. We have adapted semantic similarity metrics to measure phenotypic similarity between queries and hereditary diseases annotated with the use of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and have developed a statistical model to assign p values to the resulting similarity scores, which can be used to rank the candidate diseases. We show that our approach outperforms simpler term-matching approaches that do not take the semantic interrelationships between terms into account. The advantage of our approach was greater for queries containing phenotypic noise or imprecise clinical descriptions. The semantic network defined by the HPO can be used to refine the differential diagnosis by suggesting clinical features that, if present, best differentiate among the candidate diagnoses. Thus, semantic similarity searches in ontologies represent a useful way of harnessing the semantic structure of human phenotypic abnormalities to help with the differential diagnosis. We have implemented our methods in a freely available web application for the field of human Mendelian disorders.

### Individual coping strategies. stacks… [^a8e4cac0]. stacks.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Individual coping strategies. Public Domain 1985/03/01 File Language: Details Personal Author: Description: Individually oriented strategies for coping with occupational stress and reducing its health consequences are reviewed. Two sets of research studies are examined: those attempting to identify coping behaviors and determine the degree to which the use of those behaviors reduces the effects of work stressors on health, and those evaluating prescriptive strategies for helping workers manage or control responses to stress. It is pointed out that socially censored coping behaviors such as physical violence and industrial sabotage, and maladaptive behaviors such as increased alcohol use, have not been examined in the literature. Problem focused coping behaviors appear to be valued more highly by researchers than emotion focused behaviors, although the latter appear to be used more frequently in everyday life situations.

In general, the available literature associates stress management strategies with health promotion and disease prevention orientation, an emphasis which may widen the gap between sources of occupational stress and stress management methods. It is noted that the lack of worker controls over organizational attributes and the way work is designed may explain the ineffectiveness of individual coping strategies in handling such stress. Studies do show that when workers learn skills aimed at managing distress via stress management techniques, reductions in anxiety, depression, muscle tension, and perhaps blood pressure result, although these benefits deteriorate over time. A literature review suggests that stress management techniques do not produce impressive changes in productivity or absenteeism. In addition, individual change has minimal effects on social structures.

The author concludes that studies of stress management techniques in organizational settings should acknowledge that these programs do not take place in a social/political vacuum nor against a backdrop of stable work and life stress, and these factors must be taken into account in any stress management study.

### Informatics in radiology: radiology gamuts ontology: differential diagnosis for the semantic web [^e34ca30e]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

The Semantic Web is an effort to add semantics, or "meaning", to empower automated searching and processing of Web-based information. The overarching goal of the Semantic Web is to enable users to more easily find, share, and combine information. Critical to this vision are knowledge models called ontologies, which define a set of concepts and formalize the relations between them. Ontologies have been developed to manage and exploit the large and rapidly growing volume of information in biomedical domains. In diagnostic radiology, lists of differential diagnoses of imaging observations, called gamuts, provide an important source of knowledge. The Radiology Gamuts Ontology (RGO) is a formal knowledge model of differential diagnoses in radiology that includes 1674 differential diagnoses, 19,017 terms, and 52,976 links between terms. Its knowledge is used to provide an interactive, freely available online reference of radiology gamuts (www.gamuts.net). A Web service allows its content to be discovered and consumed by other information systems. The RGO integrates radiologic knowledge with other biomedical ontologies as part of the Semantic Web.

### Distinct behavioural profiles in frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia [^03c9f6f4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To test predictions that frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia give rise to distinct patterns of behavioural change.

Methods

An informant based semistructured behavioural interview, covering the domains of basic and social emotions, social and personal behaviour, sensory behaviour, eating and oral behaviour, repetitive behaviours, rituals, and compulsions, was administered to carers of 41 patients with semantic dementia and with apathetic (FTD-A) and disinhibited (FTD-D) forms of frontotemporal dementia.

Results

Consistent with prediction, emotional changes differentiated FTD from semantic dementia. Whereas lack of emotional response was pervasive in FTD, it was more selective in semantic dementia, affecting particularly the capacity to show fear. Social avoidance occurred more often in FTD and social seeking in semantic dementia. Patients with FTD showed reduced response to pain, whereas patients with semantic dementia more often showed exaggerated reactions to sensory stimuli. Gluttony and indiscriminate eating were characteristic of FTD, whereas patients with semantic dementia were more likely to exhibit food fads. Hyperorality, involving inedible objects, was unrelated to gluttony, indicating different underlying mechanisms. Repetitive behaviours were common in both FTD and semantic dementia, but had a more compulsive quality in semantic dementia. Behavioural differences were greater between semantic dementia and FTD-A than FTD-D. A logistic regression analysis indicated that emotional and repetitive, compulsive behaviours discriminated FTD from semantic dementia with 97% accuracy.

Conclusion

The findings confirm predictions regarding behavioural differences in frontotemporal and semantic dementia and point to differential roles of the frontal and temporal lobes in affect, social functioning, eating, and compulsive behaviour.

### Cognitive and behavioral profiles of left and right semantic dementia: differential diagnosis with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease [^d53341f2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Semantic dementia (SD) is a subtype of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) characterized by semantic memory loss and preserved abilities of other cognitive functions. The clinical manifestations of SD require a differential diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially those with early onset, and behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD).

Objective

The present study aimed to compare cognitive performances and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a population of AD, bvFTD, and left and right SD defined with the support of molecular imaging (amyloid and 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography) and assessed the accuracy of different neuropsychological markers in distinguishing these neurodegenerative diseases.

Methods

Eighty-seven participants (32 AD, 20 bvFTD, and 35 SD (17 Left-SD and 18 Right-SD) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included memory, language, attention and executive functions, visuospatial function, visuoconstructional skills, and tasks designed specifically to evaluate prosopagnosia and facial emotions recognition. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was administered to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Results

An episodic memory test that included semantic cues, a visuospatial test (both impaired in AD), a naming test and a prosopagnosia task (both impaired in SD) were the four most valuable cognitive metrics for the differential diagnosis between groups. Several behavioral abnormalities were differentially present, of which aggression, self-care (both more frequent in bvFTD), and eating habits, specifically overeating and altered dietary preference (more frequent in SD), were the most valuable in group discrimination.

Conclusion

Our study highlights the value of a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric evaluation for the differential diagnosis between FTD syndromes and AD.

### A unified neurocognitive model of semantics language social behaviour and face recognition in semantic dementia [^f20f2cc8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent years have shown a considerable increase of interest in the cognitive and behavioural functions of the anterior temporal lobes (ATL). This heightened attention on the ATL is founded upon detailed neuropsychological investigations of semantic dementia (SD) –. These have, in turn, inspired explorations of the ATL contribution to semantic representation in healthy participants –, comparative studies across different patient groups with impaired semantic performance – and formal neuroanatomically constrained computational models of semantic cognition –. Accordingly, this study had integrated cognitive and clinical aims, not only to understand how semantic and other cognitive functions are distributed across the bilateral ATL and their sub-regions, but also how to conceive of the graded phenotype variations across SD. These dual aims can only be met by moving beyond investigating single cognitive activities in specific sub-groups of SD patients towards multi-task data collected in cohorts of SD patients. Such data allow us to elucidate the associations of different cognitive computations to one or more ATL sub-regions and also to derive a complete diagnostic cognitive-behavioural template such that all 'sub-types' of SD can be accurately diagnosed. Without a picture of the entire disease, it is possible to miss patients or falsely sub-group patients. Indeed, there is a danger that graded variations in the same single disease entity are treated as multiple separate disease groups (e.g. the right temporal-variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the semantic-variant of FTD, left temporal SD, etc). This investigation went beyond these descriptions to generate a unified neurocognitive model of ATL functions and SD characteristics, which captures the known cognitive-behavioural variations across SD, maps these to the underlying patterns of atrophy, and integrates the considerable database on the graded bilateral ATL contributions to healthy semantic functionand semantic impairment in other patient groups. The approach accommodates the facts that (i) there are not mutually exclusive sub-types of SD but rather gradely varying patterns of cognitive-behavioural presentation; (ii) SD is a part of the FTD spectrum; (iii) the cognitive-behavioural deficits reflect not only the balance of left vs. right ATL atrophy but also the total temporal lobe atrophy and its extension to insular and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); and (iv) semantic representation in healthy participants appears to be supported by ATL regions, bilaterally, with graded variations in function reflecting differential patterns of connectivity.

### Differential reorganization of episodic and semantic memory systems in epilepsy-related mesiotemporal pathology [^2de2f0e1]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common pharmaco-resistant epilepsy in adults and can serve as a human disease model to probe declarative memory system reorganization in young and middle-aged adults. Patients typically present with pathology of structures in the MTL, notably the hippocampus, and prior research has demonstrated marked impairments in episodic memory in some patients even at a young age. Episodic memory impairment has been related directly to degrees of hippocampal structural alterations, together with widespread structural and functional imbalances in both temporal and extratemporal neocortical networks. In contrast to the relatively consistent finding of episodic memory impairment in TLE, semantic memory has been studied less frequently, and reports remain mixed. Semantic memory function appears to be rather mildly affected, even in TLE patients with pronounced MTL hypometabolism. Moreover, and in contrast to the frequent finding of episodic memory disruptions in patients undergoing selective MTL resection, there are less marked semantic memory impairments seen postsurgically. Such resilience suggests a more distributed cortical control network substrate for semantic memory involving both hemispheres, in contrast to MTL representations of episodic memory. Individuals with TLE may, therefore, have difficulty recalling specific events or episodes from their past while retaining their general knowledge of the world. However, other studies have found significant semantic memory deficits in patients with TLE, which have been associated with MTLand ATL lesions. Additionally, poor performance on semantic memory tasks has been demonstrated in TLE patients after unilateral ATL resection. Nevertheless, given that impairments in declarative memory challenge the day-to-day patient functioning and wellbeing, it is crucial to derive more mechanistic insights into these memory types and their differential vulnerabilities in TLE.

### Differential reorganization of episodic and semantic memory systems in epilepsy-related mesiotemporal pathology [^d03ecc23]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Declarative memory is commonly divided into episodic and semantic memory components. Episodic memories are unique events with specific spatiotemporal associations, whereas semantic memory refers to context-invariant knowledge and facts about the world. The relationship between both forms of memory is complex, with behavioural and neuroimaging studies suggesting shared and distinct substrates. Behavioural studies have shown a synergistic interplay between both memory types, whereby episodic memory for events and words processed with semantic categorization exceeds that from non-semantic tasks. Functional and structural neuroimaging evidence in healthy populations supports this finding, suggesting shared neural substrates across both memory types. Shared key networks are situated in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, alongside posterior parietal regions. More broadly, networks involved in both memory types have been shown to engage similar intrinsic functional systems, notably the frontoparietal networkand the default mode network. As such, behavioural and neural evidence collectively implicates shared processes in both forms of declarative memory. Nonetheless, findings also point to divergences. Generally, episodic processes appear to rely more on medial temporal lobe (MTL) systems, whereas anterior temporal lobe (ATL) regions are more heavily implicated in semantic processing. Likewise, prior work has suggested differential activations in middle frontal versus inferior temporal regions in episodic in comparison to semantic retrieval. A neural divergence between both memory systems is supported by (i) the controlled semantic cognition framework, which stipulates that semantic representations within the ATL 'hub' and modality-specific 'spokes' interact with a 'semantic' control' system that dynamically supervises and adjusts semantic retrieval bilaterally; and (ii) hippocampal–neocortical connectivity, such that the hippocampus interacts closely with other regions through process-specific alliances to support episodic memory. A systematic investigation of neocortical and MTL networks will help us to understand substrates contributing to declarative memory function in the human brain.

### Disproportionate impairment in semantic verbal fluency in schizophrenia: differential deficit in clustering [^2285df20]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia present disproportionate impairment in semantic, relative to phonemic, fluency. Specifically, we explored whether this impairment could be explained by differential deficits in clustering or switching strategies. The Greek Verbal Fluency Test was administered to 119 patients with schizophrenia and 150 age-, education-, and gender-matched healthy controls. We calculated the total number of words generated, the number of cluster related words, and the number of switches on the semantic and phonological fluency tasks separately. Patients with schizophrenia generated fewer total words, cluster related words and switches than healthy controls on both fluency tasks. When controlling for the total number of words produced, however, the differences between the two groups in the number of cluster related words and switches disappeared. We found a disproportionate impairment in semantic, compared with phonemic, fluency in schizophrenia for total word production and the number of cluster related words, but not for the number of switches. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia used the same strategies as healthy controls to perform on a word fluency test, but they used them less effectively. Disproportionate impairment in semantic fluency in schizophrenia resulted from a differential deficit only in clustering. Therefore, disproportionately impaired category fluency in schizophrenia may be primarily due to disorganization and not to inefficient access to and retrieval from semantic store.

### Demographic effects on longitudinal semantic processing, working memory, and cognitive speed [^9d46994d]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

The different cognitive requirements for semantic control versus semantic memory efficiency are also reflected in the correlations among the latent factors identified in this study: semantic control correlated with working memory, as both rely on controlled processing and manipulation of information, whereas semantic memory efficiency correlated with cognitive speed, as both contribute to efficiency of processing. This differential correlation could also explain the previously found effects of executive function on semantic memory functioning (e.g.;) as being particularly driven by the semantic control component of semantic memory. Importantly, in the cross-sectional analyses, age was not related to semantic memory efficiency, but it was related to semantic control and the two cognitive domains of working memory and cognitive speed. This differential association of age with semantic control but not semantic memory efficiency replicates the findings by, including his finding that an analysis of response times on two semantic memory tests — much like the inclusion of response times in our latent factor of semantic memory efficiency — showed no differences between age groups. The absence of a relation between semantic memory efficiency and age also fits within the fluid/crystalized intelligence model, in which semantic memory efficiency would be considered crystalized intelligence (closely linked to vocabulary), while semantic control, working memory, and cognitive speed would be considered fluid intelligence. The results are also in line with the Transmission Deficit Hypothesis, in which processes involved in connecting semantic memory to the lexical and phonological levels of word retrieval (which could be considered semantic control) are affected by aging.

### The public stigma of mental illness means a difference between you and me [^69cbc365]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Social desirability can influence reports of stigma change in that subscribing to stigmatizing attitudes might pose a threat to personal beliefs of open-mindedness, while endorsing difference might not be as troubling. A measure is needed that assesses stigma change but is less susceptible to desirability effects. This study examined the psychometrics of various assessments of perceived difference from a person with mental illness. A total of 460 participants were recruited online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Four measures of difference, the Likert Scale of Difference, Semantic Differential: Similar-Different Scale, Semantic Differential: Mental Illness versus Other Illness scale, and Cause of Perceived Difference Scale were compared to measures of stereotypes, affirming attitudes, and care seeking. A vignette describing a person with mental illness anchored the Difference Scale and a measure of stereotype. Results showed that measures of difference yielded significantly higher endorsements than measures of stereotypes; the Semantic Differential Scale: Similar-Different was endorsed at a higher rate than other difference scales. Difference scores were positively related to stereotypes and inversely related to affirming attitudes. Difference was also found to influence empowerment separate from, and in addition to stereotype. These results suggest a new domain as an efficient and sensitive measure of stigma change.

### Similarities and differences in the neural representations of abstract concepts across english and mandarin [^5061b135]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Factor analyses revealed a set of common neurosemantic dimensions that constitute the basis for the representation of abstract concepts across languages: verbal representation, internality–externality, social content, and rule‐based content. The subsequent predictive modeling based on behavioral ratings of the concepts provides convergent validity for the factor interpretations. The successful cross‐language classification suggests that the underlying semantic dimensions provide a sufficient basis for decoding abstract word concepts across languages. Although the neural dimensions used for representing abstract concepts are common across languages, differences in the meaning of some individual concepts can be accommodated in terms of differential salience of particular dimensions. These semantic dimensions constitute a set of neurocognitive resources for abstract concept representation within a larger set of regions responsible for general semantic processing.

### A brief drawing task for the differential diagnosis of semantic dementia [^5a85de55]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Semantic dementia (SD) is a subtype of frontotemporal lobe degeneration characterized by semantic loss, with other cognitive functions initially preserved. SD requires differential diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Semantic knowledge can be evaluated through different tests; however, most of them depend on language.

Objective

We describe the development of a brief drawing task that may be helpful for the differential diagnosis of SD.

Methods

Seventy-two patients, including 32 AD, 19 bvFTD, and 21 SD were asked to draw 12 items with different age of acquisition and familiarity, belonging to four different semantic categories. We employed the drawings of healthy volunteers to build a scoring scheme.

Results

Turtle, strawberry, train, and envelope were the items of each category that best discriminated between groups and were selected for the Brief drawing task. The discriminatory power of the Brief drawing task between SD versus AD and bvFTD patients, estimated through the area under the curve was 0.84 (95% CI = 0.72–0.96, p = 0.000007). In a logistic model, the Brief drawing task (p = 0.003) and VOSP "number location" subtest (p = 0.016) were significant predictors of the diagnosis of SD versus AD and bvFTD after adjustment by the main covariates. The Brief drawing task provided clinically useful qualitative information. SD drawings were characterized by loss of the distinctive features, intrusions, tendency to prototype, and answers like "I don't know what this is".

Conclusion

The Brief drawing task appears to reveal deficits in semantic knowledge among patients with SD that may assist in the differential diagnosis with other neurodegenerative diseases.

### A unified neurocognitive model of semantics language social behaviour and face recognition in semantic dementia [^30c85f2b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The face-recognition-right ATL dimension may reflect a complementary effect of differential connectivity, this time with respect to input to the bilateral ATL. Semantic knowledge about people aligned with general semantic knowledge, and was associated with the degree of bilateral ATL damage. In contrast, the degree of right ATL atrophy was linked with visual face recognition per se (cf. the classical definition of visual prosopagnosia). This finding is consistent with patients with unilateral right ATL resection who show greater deficits of visual recognition of familiar people. Furthermore, the progression of rare, early right ATL SD patients (Table 3) fits with this result; in the very earliest stage (which is long before most right > left SD patients present to clinic), right-only SD patients are reported to have visual prosopagnosia (i.e. poor recognition from faces with good semantic knowledge of the same people when probed from another input modality) which later develops into a generalised semantic impairment and anomia, presumably when bilateral ATL pathology has begun to evolve. The differential right > left ATL involvement in face recognition may again reflect differential connectivity. It is well established that there is a strong asymmetry in ventral occipital-temporal regions for different visual objects, with face processing exhibiting a rightward biasand the opposite for word recognition. Extending the logic and computational demonstrations for the effect of differential connectivity on function, atrophy of right ATL regions might impact much earlier than left ATL atrophy on face recognition because there is stronger visual face input to this part of the bilaterally distributed semantic system. Atrophy might also extend posteriorly into the FFA and other parts of the right-lateralised extended face processing network –. In our further analysis, the face deficits of SD were found to be correlated with the level of atrophy in all of the nodes in this network.

### Cortical organization of environmental sounds by attribute [^4e2d6a20]. Human Brain Mapping (2011). Low credibility.

Semantic knowledge is supported by a widely distributed neuronal network, with differential patterns of activation depending upon experimental stimulus or task demands. Despite a wide body of knowledge on semantic object processing from the visual modality, the response of this semantic network to environmental sounds remains relatively unknown. Here, we used fMRI to investigate how access to different conceptual attributes from environmental sound input modulates this semantic network. Using a range of living and manmade sounds, we scanned participants whilst they carried out an object attribute verification task. Specifically, we tested visual perceptual, encyclopedic, and categorical attributes about living and manmade objects relative to a high-level auditory perceptual baseline to investigate the differential patterns of response to these contrasting types of object-related attributes, whilst keeping stimulus input constant across conditions. Within the bilateral distributed network engaged for processing environmental sounds across all conditions, we report here a highly significant dissociation within the left hemisphere between the processing of visual perceptual and encyclopedic attributes of objects.

### Semantic-specific and domain-general mechanisms for integration and update of contextual information [^62f0aa98]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

The anterior salience network showed an opposite pattern of results to the semantic/language network. Neural responses were positive in the non‐semantic task, but negative in the semantic task. In the semantic task, NC conditions differed from HC conditions (p = .013). There were no significant differences between LC and HC conditions (p = .436), nor between LC and NC conditions (p = .124). In the non‐semantic task, NC and LC conditions showed more positive responses as compared to HC conditions (p = .030 and p < .001), whilst the LC and NC conditions did not differ (p = .757).

The left executive control network was similarly engaged in the two tasks. In the semantic task, it showed increased positive responses when the semantic context was available for integration (LC > NC and HC > NC, both ps < .001), but no difference between LC and HC was observed (p = .471). Also in the non‐semantic task, increased positive responses were observed when context integration was possible (LC > NC and HC > NC, both ps < .001). As above, no difference between LC and HC was observed (p = .515). This domain‐general pattern of responses for context integration is in line with the conjunction analysis results. In fact, the left executive control network spatially overlaps with the brain regions that were similarly activated in semantic and non‐semantic tasks during context integration.

The right executive control network showed a similar context integration effect as for the left executive control network, but only in the non‐semantic task (HC > NC and LC > NC, both ps < .001; HC vs. LC, p > .999).

Finally, unlike the other components, the default mode network was deactivated with respect to the rest baseline. Conditions differed only in the non‐semantic task and reflected differential de‐activations (non‐semantic task: NC vs. LC, p = .054; NC vs. HC, p = .318; HC > LC, p < .001).

### Differential reorganization of episodic and semantic memory systems in epilepsy-related mesiotemporal pathology [^c43d4f71]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Declarative memory encompasses episodic and semantic divisions. Episodic memory captures singular events with specific spatiotemporal relationships, whereas semantic memory houses context-independent knowledge. Behavioural and functional neuroimaging studies have revealed common and distinct neural substrates of both memory systems, implicating mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) regions such as the hippocampus and distributed neocortices. Here, we explored declarative memory system reorganization in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as a human disease model to test the impact of variable degrees of MTL pathology on memory function.

Our cohort included 31 patients with TLE and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and all participants underwent episodic and semantic retrieval tasks during a multimodal MRI session. The functional MRI tasks were closely matched in terms of stimuli and trial design. Capitalizing on non-linear connectome gradient-mapping techniques, we derived task-based functional topographies during episodic and semantic memory states, in both the MTL and neocortical networks.

Comparing neocortical and hippocampal functional gradients between TLE patients and healthy controls, we observed a marked topographic reorganization of both neocortical and MTL systems during episodic memory states. Neocortical alterations were characterized by reduced functional differentiation in TLE across lateral temporal and midline parietal cortices in both hemispheres. In the MTL, in contrast, patients presented with a more marked functional differentiation of posterior and anterior hippocampal segments ipsilateral to the seizure focus and pathological core, indicating perturbed intrahippocampal connectivity. Semantic memory reorganization was also found in bilateral lateral temporal and ipsilateral angular regions, whereas hippocampal functional topographies were unaffected. Furthermore, leveraging MRI proxies of MTL pathology, we observed alterations in hippocampal microstructure and morphology that were associated with TLE-related functional reorganization during episodic memory. Moreover, correlation analysis and statistical mediation models revealed that these functional alterations contributed to behavioural deficits in episodic memory, but again not in semantic memory in patients.

Altogether, our findings suggest that semantic processes rely on distributed neocortical networks, whereas episodic processes are supported by a network involving both the hippocampus and the neocortex. Alterations of such networks can provide a compact signature of state-dependent reorganization in conditions associated with MTL damage, such as TLE.

Clinical Effectiveness of the Representative Subset

To verify the clinical effectiveness of the 19 representative robust RFs, their correlations with pathological diagnosis and 8 CT semantic features were analyzed (Fig. 7). For the pathological diagnosis, 16 of 19 RFs showed statistically significant differences when differentiating invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) from adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) (FDR < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; see Table S6, Supplemental Digital Content, which demonstrates the results of differential analysis), with the highest AUC reaching 0.722 (95% CI, 0.664–0.780; see Table S7, Supplemental Digital Content, which demonstrates the AUC values of 19 representative RFs in pathological diagnosis and semantic features). For each of the 8 CT semantic features, at least 3 RFs of the subset showed statistically significant differences between the groups. When the mean value was used to distinguish the type of nodule, we obtained the highest AUC (AUC, 0.845; 95% CI, 0.801–0.889; see Table S7, Supplemental Digital Content, which demonstrates the AUC values of 19 representative RFs in pathological diagnosis and semantic features). Among the 8 semantic features, the RFs showed better performance in distinguishing the type of nodule, spiculation, lobulation, bubblelike appearance, pulmonary vascular change, and pleural indentation (columns with more asterisks in Fig. 7) than the tumor-lung interface and air bronchogram (columns with fewer asterisks in Fig. 7).

### Hemispheric dissociation in access to the human semantic system [^751fc1e2]. Neuron (2003). Low credibility.

Patient studies suggest that speech and environmental sounds are differentially processed by the left and right hemispheres. Here, using functional imaging in normal subjects, we compared semantic processing of spoken words to equivalent processing of environmental sounds, after controlling for low-level perceptual differences. Words enhanced activation in left anterior and posterior superior temporal regions, while environmental sounds enhanced activation in a right posterior superior temporal region. This left/right dissociation was unchanged by different attentional/working memory contexts, but it was specific to tasks requiring semantic analysis. While semantic processing involves widely distributed networks in both hemispheres, our results support the hypothesis of a dual access route specific for verbal and nonverbal material, respectively.

### Mapping contributions of the anterior temporal semantic hub to the processing of abstract and concrete verbs [^ffc8649c]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Discussion

The potential of the hub‐and‐spoke hypothesis to account for verb processing, and particularly abstract verb processing, has not previously been investigated with fMRI. This was the aim of the present study. The key findings were as follows.
The vATL was engaged in semantic processing of all verb types (although to a lesser extent for mental state verbs), confirming its central role in the representation of concepts of all types. This is the first demonstration using distortion‐corrected fMRI of vATL involvement in verb processing.
Outside of the ATL, we observed robust activity within other parts of the core semantic cognition network, including the left IFG and the posterior MTG, for all verb types.
We found that ATL subregions other than the vATL were differentially associated with processing the three types of abstract verbs.
We observed only modest differences between verb types in cortical activity outside of the core semantic network. Contrary to the hypotheses, nonembodied abstract verbs (e.g. reduce) were associated with activity in the motor and somatosensory cortices. Embodied verbs (e.g. straddle) were associated with activity in the MTG that extended more posteriorly than other verb types, and with the posterior STG, at least to a greater extent than nonembodied verbs (though these differences did not reach p < 0.05).

These findings support the proposal that the vATL is a supramodal hub for semantic representations and provide new insight into the role of the wider ATL region in abstract verb processing. We found limited evidence for differential activity associated with different verb types across distributed "spoke" regions and some observed differences were contradictory to the hypotheses (which we consider in greater detail below). However, differential activity observed within the ATL suggests that the kinds of information converging within the ATL are dependent on verb type, and this manifests in graded patterns that are consistent with the graded hub hypothesis.

### Cross-platform transcriptional profiling identifies common and distinct molecular pathologies in lewy body diseases [^c45cd6ca]. Acta Neuropathologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Visualisation of GO term overlaps between analyses

Overlapping GO-derived pathway enrichments from each of the three analyses (i.e. single-nucleus differential expression, bulk-tissue differential splicing, and gene expression contributions to bulk-tissue PC1) were visualised using the ComplexHeatmap R package (v 2.7.7). Pathways from all three analyses were filtered to include only those that were shared across more than one type of analysis. Pathways were encoded by a binary 1 and 0 for present and absent, respectively, permitting clustering of gene sets by Pearson correlation. Gene sets derived from differential splicing were collapsed across our own dataset and the replication dataset, resulting in one gene set per pairwise comparison. Likewise, gene sets derived from up- and down-regulated single-nucleus DE gene sets were collapsed across cell types, resulting in 7 gene sets per pairwise comparison.

Reduction of GO terms using semantic similarity

To reduce redundancy across GO-derived pathway enrichment analyses derived from various analyses (i.e. single-nucleus differential expression, bulk-tissue differential splicing, genes contributing to bulk-tissue PC1), two steps were taken. First, GO terms were filtered to exclude terms with ≥ 20 genes or ≤ 2000 genes. Second, semantic similarity of all enriched GO terms was calculated using mgoSim from the GOSemSim R package (v 2.17.1) and a graph-based measure of semantic similarity (measure = "Wang"). Thereafter, reduceSimMatrix from the rrvgo R package (v 1.1.4) was used to reduce terms. This function reduces terms by generating a distance matrix from the semantic similarity scores, which is hierarchically clustered using complete linkage (a "bottom-up" clustering approach). Both steps were combined into the function go_reduce, available at: The hierarchical tree was then cut at a threshold of 0.9 (leading to fewer groups), and the term with the highest semantic similarity score was used to represent each group of terms. This reduction was performed separately for each of the three analyses.

### Mapping contributions of the anterior temporal semantic hub to the processing of abstract and concrete verbs [^b2258407]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Multiple representation theories of semantic processing propose that word meaning is supported by simulated sensorimotor experience in modality‐specific neural regions, as well as in cognitive systems that involve processing of linguistic, emotional, and introspective information. According to the hub‐and‐spoke model of semantic memory, activity from these distributed cortical areas feeds into a primary semantic hub located in the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). In the present pre‐registered study, we examined whether different types of abstract verbs (mental, emotional and nonembodied) and concrete (embodied) verbs all engage the vATL, and also whether they differentially recruit a broader set of distributed neurocognitive systems (consistent with multiple representation theories). Finally, we investigated whether there is information about different verb types distributed across the broader ATL region, consistent with a Graded Semantic Hub Hypothesis. We collected data from 30 participants who completed a syntactic classification task (is it a verb? Yes or no) and a numerical judgment task which served as an active but less semantic baseline task. Whole brain univariate analyses revealed consistent BOLD signal throughout the canonical semantic network, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and the vATL. All types of abstract verbs engaged the vATL except for mental state verbs. Finally, a multivariate pattern analysis revealed clusters within the ATL that were differentially engaged when processing each type of abstract verb. Our findings extend previous research and suggest that the hub‐and‐spoke hypothesis and the graded semantic hub hypothesis provide a neurobiologically constrained model of semantics that can account for abstract verb representation and processing.

### Semantic encoding during language comprehension at single-cell resolution [^d708257b]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Confirming the quality and separability of the semantic domains

Purity measures and d ′ analysis were used to confirm the quality and separability of the semantic domains. To this end, we randomly sampled from 60% of the sentences across 100 iterations. We then grouped all words from these subsampled sentences into clusters using the same spherical clustering procedure described above. The new clusters were then matched to the original clusters by considering all possible matching arrangements and choosing the arrangement with greatest word overlap. Finally, the clustering quality was evaluated for 'purity', which is the percentage of the total number of words that were classified correctly. This procedure is therefore a simple and transparent measure that varies between 0 (bad clustering) to 1 (perfect clustering; Fig. 1d, bottom). The accuracy of this assignment is determined by counting the total number of correctly assigned words and dividing by the total number of words in the new clusters:in which n is the total number of words in the new clusters, k is the number of clusters (that is, 9), is a cluster from the set of new clusters, andis the original cluster (from the set of original clusters) that has the maximum count for cluster. Finally, to confirm the separability of the clusters, we used a standard d ′ analysis. The d ′ metric estimates the difference between vectoral cosine distances for all words assigned to a particular cluster compared to those assigned to all other clusters (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

The resulting clusters were labelled here on the basis of the preponderance of words near the centroid of each cluster. Therefore, although not all words may seem to intuitively fit within each domain, the resulting semantic domains reflected the optimal vectoral clustering of words based on their semantic relatedness. To further allow for comparison, we also introduced refined semantic domains (Extended Data Table 2) in which the words provided within each cluster were additionally manually reassigned or removed by two independent study members on the basis of their subjective semantic relatedness. Thus, for example, under the semantic domain labelled 'animals', any word that did not refer to an animal was removed.

### The effect of word imagery on priming effect under a preconscious condition: an fMRI study [^af1e202d]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

Our results showing that highly related prime‐target word pairs displayed a shorter latency and higher correct response than nonrelated prime‐target word pairs or NW pairs support the semantic priming effect. This was further supported by the findings of differential brain activities between prime‐target word pairs (HA, LA, and NA) and prime‐target NW pairs. According to spreading‐activation theories [Collins and Loftus, 1975; Neely, 1976], the activation of the prime spreads automatically into the semantically related nodes, and thereby a semantically related target can be processed more rapidly than an unrelated target. There is evidence that associative priming effects using a lexical decision task occur even at a very short SOA, suggesting an automatic priming effect [Dietrich and Thieos, 1992; Perea and Gotor, 1997; Sereno, 1991]. In this sense, these findings reflect automatic, implicit access to semantic priming. However, we failed to show brain activity dependent on the degree of the relatedness of prime‐target word associations (e.g. HA vs. LA or LA vs. NA). A previous study conducted by Wible et al. [2006], however, found differential brain activity depending on the degree of the relatedness of prime‐target word pairs, but under a long prime‐target SOA condition (750 ms). These results suggest that the semantic priming effect based on the degree of the relatedness of prime‐target words might not be generated under preconscious conditions (short prime‐target SOA; 30 ms). We speculate that the lack of a differential effect of the degree of the relatedness of word associations might be attributable to passive and shallow spread of activation into the semantically related nodes during the very short prime‐target SOA condition (30 ms), which also hinders brain activity from differentiating related and unrelated word pairs. As such, a semantic priming effect of the degree of the relatedness of word associations appears to occur at SOA conditions of more than 30 ms.

### Phonological and semantic fluency in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^21d834f5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

SF and PF performance depends on partially different cognitive-linguistic systems, and the deterioration of these systems is different as AD progresses. PF requires a greater demand of frontal lobe mediated cognitive processes, imposes fast mental processing, information evocation, and search, and requires decoding as well as encoding, specifically linked to the initial letter. On the other hand, SF requires retrieval strategies that use the meaning of words within a semantic category and generate consecutive responses that are semantically similar. This occurs partly because of automatic associative retrieval processes drawing inferences about the relatedness of concepts encoded in semantic memory. Several studies argue that as language is semantically represented and organized, retrieving words from a semantic category would be consistent with how language is stored in the mind. In contrast, word representations are not alphabetically organized, meaning that PF requires engaging additional cognitive strategies. Letter retrieval involves exploring more subsets of categories than retrieving names from a specific semantic category, which could be related to the worse performance in PF found in our findings, given possible higher task demands in PF compared to SF. A previous meta-analysis investigated healthy volunteers' brain activation during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Evidence arose for spatially different activation in BA 44, but not in other regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus (BA 9, 45, 47) during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency processing. Schmidt and colleagues also identified circumscribed parts of the left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior and middle temporal gyrus that are significantly double dissociated concerning their differential contribution to PF and SF, respectively. Meinzer et al. reported differential brain activity patterns of older and younger adults performing SF and PF tasks. Young adults recruited different subparts of the left inferior frontal gyrus for SF and PF, but older adults did not show this distinction. The PF task was comparable for both age groups and was reflected in strongly left-lateralized (frontal) activity patterns. In older adults, poor PF performance was accompanied by additional right frontal activity, while SF is more related to the temporal cortex function. Merging behavioral data with task-driven neuroimaging data might shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying these tasks in healthy and pathological aging. Behind this differential performance in SF and PF, a neural network might start failing, and it might deteriorate faster in the presence of dementia. Based on SF and PF, early detection of deterioration and cognitive stimulation promotion during the early stages of aging could be done.

### Differential contributions of inferior frontal gyrus subregions to sentence processing guided by intonation [^f47009c8]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Auditory sentence comprehension involves processing content (semantics), grammar (syntax), and intonation (prosody). The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved in sentence comprehension guided by these different cues, with neuroimaging studies preferentially locating syntactic and semantic processing in separate IFG subregions. However, this regional specialisation has not been confirmed with a neurostimulation method. Consequently, the causal role of such a specialisation remains unclear. This study probed the role of the posterior IFG (pIFG) for syntactic processing and the anterior IFG (aIFG) for semantic processing with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in a task that required the interpretation of the sentence's prosodic realisation. Healthy participants performed a sentence completion task with syntactic and semantic decisions, while receiving 10 Hz rTMS over either left aIFG, pIFG, or vertex (control). Initial behavioural analyses showed an inhibitory effect on accuracy without task‐specificity. However, electric field simulations revealed differential effects for both subregions. In the aIFG, stronger stimulation led to slower semantic processing, with no effect of pIFG stimulation. In contrast, we found a facilitatory effect on syntactic processing in both aIFG and pIFG, where higher stimulation strength was related to faster responses. Our results provide first evidence for the functional relevance of left aIFG in semantic processing guided by intonation. The stimulation effect on syntactic responses emphasises the importance of the IFG for syntax processing, without supporting the hypothesis of a pIFG‐specific involvement. Together, the results support the notion of functionally specialised IFG subregions for diverse but fundamental cues for language processing.

### Semantic dementia: a unique clinicopathological syndrome [^8de35979]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Semantic dementia (SD), one of the main clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia, presents a unique combination of clinical and imaging abnormalities. We describe the epidemiological, cognitive, and radiological features of SD. The distinctive and consistent neuropsychological deficits in this disorder have had a major effect on current conceptions of the organisation of semantic memory and its links to episodic memory, language, and perceptual processes. Structural (MRI) and functional (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) studies in SD emphasise the role of the temporopolar and perirhinal cortices. Unlike other frontotemporal dementia syndromes, the neuropathological findings in SD are fairly predictable: most patients have ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative neuronal inclusions.

### Guidelines for the audiologic management of adult hearing impairment [^1d6c26ac]. AAA (2006). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for addressing non-auditory issues in adult hearing aid management — There is no strong evidence to suggest that any one or a combination of these nonauditory issues can be used to reliably predict success or failure with hearing aids, and one study found that factors such as personality and intelligence did not predict performance with hearing aids but did predict reported self-perceived disability; nevertheless, identifying these factors should be addressed in counseling and in establishing realistic expectations with the patient. Recommended actions are that audiologists should be aware of the non-auditory factors that may impact successful prognosis; at a minimum, all patients should be queried or screened for issues related to general health, manual dexterity (finger sensitivity), near vision, support systems, motivation, and prior experience with amplification; self-assessment scales, visual analog scales, or semantic differential scales can be used to assess hearing aid readiness; cognitive abilities or personality assessments should be assessed by a professional specially trained in these areas; training is available for audiologists who wish to perform relatively simple screening measures (for example, the Beck Depression Screening Inventory, Snellen charts for near field visual acuity, or simple tests of manual dexterity); and audiologists should have a list of professionals trained to deal with the above-mentioned issues to whom patients might be referred.

### Disorganised schizotypy is selectively associated with poorer semantic processing in non-clinical individuals [^4ae1cdc7]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

The nature and severity of semantic memory (SM) impairments in schizophrenia has been related to symptoms, mainly formal thought disorder (FTD), and other clinical factors like length of illness. Symptom-related studies in schizophrenia are often confounded by clinical factors, for example medication and hospitalisations. We completed a schizotypy analogue study to examine the relationship between SM processing and FTD using an analogue schizotypy score referred to as cognitive disorganisation. Sixty individuals without a history of mental illness (M = 22.92, SD = 2.70) completed a schizotypy questionnaire and three semantic tasks - naming pictures, category fluency and semantic priming. Only decreasing fluency was associated with increasing cognitive disorganisation scores (p = 0.029). In line with the prevailing dyssemantic theories, the results highlight that cognitive disorganisation is associated with some difficulties in SM processes, though not all. The observed differential relationships of SM processes to disorganised schizotypy are discussed in relation to previous work, and in terms of potential developmental trajectories for SM impairment in schizophrenia.

### Development of category-based induction and semantic knowledge [^4eac3790]. Child Development (2014). Low credibility.

Category-based induction is a hallmark of mature cognition; however, little is known about its origins. This study evaluated the hypothesis that category-based induction is related to semantic development. Computational studies suggest that early on there is little differentiation among concepts, but learning and development lead to increased differentiation based on taxonomic relatedness. This study reports findings from a new task aimed to (a) examine this putative increase in semantic differentiation and (b) test whether individual differences in semantic differentiation are related to category-based induction in 4- to 7-year-old children (N = 85). The results provide the first empirical evidence of an age-related increase in differentiation of representations of animal concepts and suggest that category-based induction is related to increased semantic differentiation.

### Integration of PET / CT radiomics and semantic features for differentiation between active pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer [^f59d5647]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aim to accurately differentiate between active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer (LC) based on radiomics and semantic features as extracted from pre-treatment positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) images.

Procedures

A total of 174 patients (77/97 pulmonary TB/LC as confirmed by pathology) were retrospectively selected, with 122 in the training cohort and 52 in the validation cohort. Four hundred eighty-seven radiomics features were initially extracted to quantify phenotypic characteristics of the lesion region in both PET and CT images. Eleven semantic features were additionally defined by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Feature selection was performed in 5 steps to enable derivation of robust and effective signatures. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was subsequently used to develop a radiomics nomogram. The calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were evaluated in both the training and independent validation cohorts.

Results

The individualized radiomics nomogram, which combined PET/CT radiomics signature with semantic features, demonstrated good calibration and significantly improved the diagnostic performance with respect to the semantic model alone or PET/CT signature alone in training cohort (AUC 0.97 vs. 0.94 or 0.91, p = 0.0392 or 0.0056), whereas did not significantly improve the performance in validation cohort (AUC 0.93 vs. 0.89 or 0.91, p = 0.3098 or 0.3323).

Conclusion

The radiomics nomogram showed potential for individualized differential diagnosis between solid active pulmonary TB and solid LC, although the improvement of performance was not significant relative to semantic model.

### Automated speech analysis to differentiate frontal and right anterior temporal lobe atrophy in frontotemporal dementia [^ab36eb48]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorders encompass various neurodegenerative clinical syndromes, each associated with varying probabilities of a spectrum of pathologic changes called frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD) is the most prevalent FTD syndrome, clinically characterized by behavioral and personality changes and neuroanatomically by predominant atrophy in the frontal lobes, generally right more than left lateralized. Within bvFTD, anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy is variable and, if present, is typically linked to Pick pathology when in conjunction with frontal atrophy, or TDP-43 proteinopathy type C (TDP-C) pathology when atrophy is isolated to the right ATL (rATL). Because isolated rATL atrophy is highly predictive of TDP-C pathology, recent studies have highlighted the importance of characterizing and isolating this syndrome from other FTD syndromes. To this end, new criteria have been proposed for a syndrome named semantic behavioral-variant FTD (sbvFTD), characterized by rATL atrophy and nonverbal semantic loss related to socioemotional concepts. Differential diagnosis of sbvFTD remains challenging because of the clinical overlap in socioemotional functioning with bvFTD and lexical semantic deficits with the left-lateralized semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Although distinguishing rATL and svPPA-related left ATL (lATL) atrophy is theoretically interesting, it is less clinically crucial because both syndromes (together classified as semantic dementia) share common pathology. However, accurately differentiating bvFTD and sbvFTD is clinically relevant for selecting participants for trials targeting TDP-43 proteinopathies because predominantly rATL atrophy is specifically linked to TDP-C, while bvFTD-associated frontal atrophy varies in neuropathology.

### Experience-driven semantic differentiation: effects of a naturalistic experience on within-and across-domain differentiation in children [^88e5c405]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Organized semantic networks reflecting distinctions within and across domains of knowledge are critical for higher-level cognition. Thus, understanding how semantic structure changes with experience is a fundamental question in developmental science. This study probed changes in semantic structure in 4–6 year-old children (N = 29) as a result of participating in an enrichment program at a local botanical garden. This study presents the first direct evidence that (a) the accumulation of experience with items in a domain promoted increases in both within- and across-domain semantic differentiation, and that (b) this experience-driven semantic differentiation generalized to nonexperienced items. These findings have implications for understanding the role of experience in building semantic networks, and for conceptualizing the contribution of enrichment experiences to academic success.

### A unified neurocognitive model of semantics language social behaviour and face recognition in semantic dementia [^420685d7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Simple comparison of left and right SD patients is complicated by the fact that other potentially important differences occur across the groups. In keeping with previous reports, the ROI analysis confirmed: (i) atrophy for both left and right SD patient groups was found in bilateral ATL and OFC relative to controls (p -values < 0.00008; Table 1); and (ii) comparison between left and right SD revealed that the right SD patients had more atrophy to both ATL (mean difference = 151 mm 3, 95% CI = 37–264 mm 3, t (45) = 2.67, p = 0.01) and OFC (mean difference = 105 mm 3, 95% CI = 23–186 mm 3, t (45) = 2.59; p = 0.01; Table 1). This is important for interpretation of any cognitive or behavioural differences between left and right SD patients for two reasons: (i) the right SD patients were neuroanatomically more severe and (ii) their atrophy encroached into potentially important regions such as the left ATL and OFC. These relationships can be clearly observed in the scatterplots (Fig. 1e): (i) there is no boundary between left and right SD cases; (ii) most patients have a degree of bilateral ATL and OFC damage, with the exception of some very mild left SD cases (indeed, OFC damage is correlated with total temporal damage (r (45) = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43–0.78, p = 0.000001; Fig. 1e, right panel; though, as expected for an SD sample, there is always greater temporal than OFC atrophy; replicating the results from Seeley et al.); (iii) the right SD cases have greater bilateral ATL (Fig. 1e, left panel) and OFC (Fig. 1e, middle panel) damage; and (iv) very mild right ATL-only cases are extremely rare (indeed, like many SD group studies, no such cases were found in our clinical sample; thus there are no cases in the upper right-hand region of the left scatterplot in Fig. 1e). Accordingly, rather than using a simple left-right binary division of SD cases, we adopted statistical approaches which take into account not only the laterality but also total temporal and OFC atrophy. We first used simultaneous regression (to map these anatomical measures to the cognitive and behavioural results) and then we utilised PCA to establish the underlying dimensions of cognitive-behavioural variation in the SD sample and explored their relationship to the atrophy distribution.

### Similarities and differences in the neural representations of abstract concepts across english and mandarin [^9adce628]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recent research suggests there is a neural organization for representing abstract concepts that is common across English speakers. To investigate the possible role of language on the representation of abstract concepts, multivariate pattern analytic (MVPA) techniques were applied to fMRI data to compare the neural representations of 28 individual abstract concepts between native English and Mandarin speakers. Factor analyses of the activation patterns of the 28 abstract concepts from both languages characterized this commonality in terms of a set of four underlying neurosemantic dimensions, indicating the degree to which a concept is verbally represented, internal to the person, contains social content, and is rule‐based. These common semantic dimensions (factors) underlying the 28 concepts provided a sufficient basis for reliably identifying the individual abstract concepts from their neural signature in the other language with a mean rank accuracy of 0.65 (p < .001). Although the neural dimensions used for representing abstract concepts are common across languages, differences in the meaning of some individual concepts can be accommodated in terms of differential salience of particular dimensions. These semantic dimensions constitute a set of neurocognitive resources for abstract concept representations within a larger set of regions responsible for general semantic processing.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

NIA-AA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia — diagnosis can be made when the patient "Meets criteria for dementia syndrome" and has "An insidious onset: symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days", with "Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition", and initial prominent deficits in an amnestic presentation or specified non-amnestic presentations. The amnestic presentation "is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia" with "impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information" plus another domain deficit, while non-amnestic variants include "Language presentation", "Visuospatial presentation", and "Executive dysfunction", each with additional domain deficits. The diagnosis "should not be applied" when there is evidence of substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, prominent behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, prominent semantic variant or non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or another concurrent active disease/comorbidity/medication affecting cognition. "Biomarker evidence increases the certainty" that AD pathophysiology underlies the syndrome; if both amyloid-beta and neuronal injury biomarkers are present the "likelihood is high that dementia is due to AD", if either are absent it is "highly likely not due to AD", and if conflicting, likelihood is "intermediate".

### A comparison of verbal fluency tasks in schizophrenic patients and normal controls [^1393691a]. Schizophrenia Research (2001). Low credibility.

Previous studies have reported significant impairment on verbal fluency tasks (semantic and letter) among schizophrenic subjects. However, the possibility of specific categorical deficits has not been adequately investigated. Nor have the effects of task duration, the stability between testing sessions, and the relationship between intelligence and performance on fluency been thoroughly studied. We performed a series of 3 min fluency tasks (semantic/syntactic and letter) to determine whether duration specific or category-specific differences exist between schizophrenic subjects and normal controls. Each subject was tested at three different times as a means of estimating word pool and assessing the stability of fluency output. Subjects were asked to generate exemplars from each of four semantic/syntactic categories (animals, tools, common nouns and verbs) and three letters (G, E and T). Data from 13 schizophrenic subjects and 15 sex-, age- and pre-morbid-IQ-matched control subjects revealed that patients' overall performance on both the semantic and letter fluency tasks was impaired. While differential impairment on specific semantic categories was noted between groups, no differential effects relating to task duration or testing session were present. Further, by comparing the number of novel words produced in the three testing sessions, we found the groups to be equivalent, a finding we take to suggest that schizophrenic patients' lexicon is intact. Covarying current IQ eliminated the group difference robustly for letter fluency, while only marginally for semantic fluency. Our data revealed the presence of impairment in semantic and letter fluency tasks in schizophrenic patients consistent with previous reports, and also that patients were differentially impaired on semantic categories.

### Inferring depression and its semantic underpinnings from simple lexical choices [^25c06720]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

Spatial demonstratives are highly frequent linguistic universals, with at least two contrastive expressions (proximal ("this") vs. distal ("that")) indicating physical, social, or functional proximity of the speaker to the referent object. Recent evidence based on the Demonstrative Choice Task (DCT), in which participants couple words with a spatial demonstrative with no context provided, suggests that demonstrative use is also indicative of experienced or emotional proximity to the self in an imagined mental space. As depression is characterized by increased and maladaptive focus on the self, the DCT may be a simple and reliable way to elicit behaviors that enable inference on the presence of severe depressive states and allow descriptions of the semantic characteristics of individual differences in such states. In two independent cross-sectional studies, including 775 and 879 participants, respectively, we showed that DCT-based classification models reliably capture semantic characteristics of experiential states that are predictive of self-reported depression symptom severity, as measured by PHQ-9. In both samples, DCT classifiers outperformed baseline models and replicated semantic patterns of negative affect previously observed to be associated with depression. This indicates that the paradigm captures semantic characteristics of the experiential states underlying depression symptoms and may be used to map individuals along a broad semantic space, potentially providing novel insights into individual differences in depressive states.

Additional syndromic categories include "Progressive aphasic syndrome (e.g. PPA or progressive aphasic multi-domain syndrome)", "Progressive visuospatial dysfunction (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy syndrome)", "Progressive dysexecutive and/or behavioral syndrome (e.g., bvFTD)", "Progressive cortical cognitive-somatosensorimotor syndrome (e.g., corticobasal syndrome)", and "Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (e.g. PSP Richardson's syndrome)". The note emphasizes that "There is a probabilistic — not deterministic — relationship between syndromic diagnosis and etiologic diagnosis", that "AD neuropathologic changes can be associated with many clinical syndromes", and that "multiple etiologies are likely in individuals older than 85 years".

Results

The neuropsychological profiles of SD patients

Table 1 summarises the SD patients' demographic, neuropsychological and behavioural information. Patients were matched to the healthy controls in terms of age, sex and education years (p -values > 0.07). Both left and right SD patients presented with impairments of object and face semantics, visual perception and general cognitive ability (p -values < 0.01). In addition, some behavioural problems were reported. The most six frequent symptoms included apathy (70%), irritability (59%), agitation (56%), anxiety (56%), depression (52%), and disinhibition (44%). With regard to cognitive and behavioural differences between left and right SD patients, left SD patients performed better on word-picture verification of faces (mean difference = 15% confidence interval (CI) = 2–29%, t (44) = 2.32, p = 0.03), while right SD patients had better performance on visual object perception (mean difference = −15%, 95% CI = −25 to −5%, t (42) = −3.00, p = 0.005) and picture naming of objects (mean difference = 16%, 95% CI = −28 to −5%, t (45) = −2.82, p = 0.007).

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^03880ae9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC COVID-19 data standards — terminology development and consensus process aggregated existing information relevant to the care of patients with CVD from external sources, including society guidelines and existing COVID-19 data elements from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) and AHA COVID-19 Registry, and primary sources such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines, NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, CDC data definitions, and previous Task Force publications to develop a controlled, semantically interoperable, machine computable terminology set, with differentiation between research/regulatory and clinical care contexts. Work was conducted via a series of virtual meetings and extensive email, with review distributed among subgroups, and was assembled into the vocabulary and descriptive text in Appendixes 3 to 10. The appendixes list each data element followed by the clinical definition and the allowed responses ("permissible values"), and for data elements with multiple permissible values provide a bulleted list and rows for each permissible value with corresponding definitions. Relative to published data standards, the committee anticipates this terminology will facilitate uniform adoption by clinical, clinical and translational research, regulatory, quality and outcomes, and EHR communities.

### Similarities and differences in the neural representations of abstract concepts across english and mandarin [^ad71284f]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent research suggests there is a neural organization for representing abstract concepts that is common across English speakers. To investigate the possible role of language on the representation of abstract concepts, multivariate pattern analytic (MVPA) techniques were applied to fMRI data to compare the neural representations of 28 individual abstract concepts between native English and Mandarin speakers. Factor analyses of the activation patterns of the 28 abstract concepts from both languages characterized this commonality in terms of a set of four underlying neurosemantic dimensions, indicating the degree to which a concept is verbally represented, internal to the person, contains social content, and is rule-based. These common semantic dimensions (factors) underlying the 28 concepts provided a sufficient basis for reliably identifying the individual abstract concepts from their neural signature in the other language with a mean rank accuracy of 0.65 (p < .001). Although the neural dimensions used for representing abstract concepts are common across languages, differences in the meaning of some individual concepts can be accommodated in terms of differential salience of particular dimensions. These semantic dimensions constitute a set of neurocognitive resources for abstract concept representations within a larger set of regions responsible for general semantic processing.

### Inferring depression and its semantic underpinnings from simple lexical choices [^47f63c83]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

Spatial demonstratives are highly frequent linguistic universals, with at least two contrastive expressions (proximal ("this") vs. distal ("that")) indicating physical, social, or functional proximity of the speaker to the referent object. Recent evidence based on the Demonstrative Choice Task (DCT), in which participants couple words with a spatial demonstrative with no context provided, suggests that demonstrative use is also indicative of experienced or emotional proximity to the self in an imagined mental space. As depression is characterized by increased and maladaptive focus on the self, the DCT may be a simple and reliable way to elicit behaviors that enable inference on the presence of severe depressive states and allow descriptions of the semantic characteristics of individual differences in such states. In two independent cross-sectional studies, including 775 and 879 participants, respectively, we showed that DCT-based classification models reliably capture semantic characteristics of experiential states that are predictive of self-reported depression symptom severity, as measured by PHQ-9. In both samples, DCT classifiers outperformed baseline models and replicated semantic patterns of negative affect previously observed to be associated with depression. This indicates that the paradigm captures semantic characteristics of the experiential states underlying depression symptoms and may be used to map individuals along a broad semantic space, potentially providing novel insights into individual differences in depressive states.

### A unified neurocognitive model of semantics language social behaviour and face recognition in semantic dementia [^62bc785f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The anterior temporal lobes (ATL) have become a key brain region of interest in cognitive neuroscience founded upon neuropsychological investigations of semantic dementia (SD). The purposes of this investigation are to generate a single unified model that captures the known cognitive-behavioural variations in SD and map these to the patients' distribution of frontotemporal atrophy. Here we show that the degree of generalised semantic impairment is related to the patients' total, bilateral ATL atrophy. Verbal production ability is related to total ATL atrophy as well as to the balance of left > right ATL atrophy. Apathy is found to relate positively to the degree of orbitofrontal atrophy. Disinhibition is related to right ATL and orbitofrontal atrophy, and face recognition to right ATL volumes. Rather than positing mutually-exclusive sub-categories, the data-driven model repositions semantics, language, social behaviour and face recognition into a continuous frontotemporal neurocognitive space.

### Semantic-specific and domain-general mechanisms for integration and update of contextual information [^babfdb51]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Non‐semantic task

There were 40 items per condition presented with the same procedure as in the semantic task (see above and Figure 1b). Thus, participants were asked to read silently both contexts and targets (displayed on the screen for 9 and 6 s, respectively), process them as a unique numerical sequence, and press a button when reaching the end of each paragraph (for both contexts and targets). However, to ensure that our volunteers were engaged in similar processing as in the semantic task (i.e. the same item‐by‐item and sentence‐by‐sentence integration processes), we also instructed participants to detect the combinatorial rule linking the first three numbers in the first row (e.g. incremental addition, see Figure 1a) with the content of the other remaining rows.

Furthermore, we informed participants that sometimes the combinatorial rule would change, but that their task would nevertheless be the same, that is, read the numbers presented in the context and target paragraphs silently, and detect the new combinatorial rule. The instruction emphasised speed, but also the need to process the information included in contexts and targets since at the end of some trials participants would be asked questions on the content of the stimuli. As per the semantic task, following 13% of the trials, a comprehension task was presented to ensure that participants were engaged in the task (see Figure 1b). When this happened, the target item was followed by a question displayed on the screen for 6 s, and participants were asked to provide a response (true/false) via button press. The questions pertained to the combinatorial rule(s) linking the number sequences, as well as the specific numbers presented in the context and target paragraphs (see Table S4). A fixation cross between the target and the question was presented for a variable duration between 0 and 6 s (average = 3.5, SD = 2.2). Before starting the experimental study, all participants signed an informed consent and were given written instructions. Then, they completed a practice session to familiarise themselves with the task. The stimuli used in the practice session were different from those used in the experimental study.

### Neural patterns differentiate traumatic from sad autobiographical memories in PTSD [^3083e8c1]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

For people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), recall of traumatic memories often displays as intrusions that differ profoundly from processing of 'regular' negative memories. These mnemonic features fueled theories speculating a unique cognitive state linked with traumatic memories. Yet, to date, little empirical evidence supports this view. Here we examined neural activity of patients with PTSD who were listening to narratives depicting their own memories. An intersubject representational similarity analysis of cross-subject semantic content and neural patterns revealed a differentiation in hippocampal representation by narrative type: semantically similar, sad autobiographical memories elicited similar neural representations across participants. By contrast, within the same individuals, semantically similar trauma memories were not represented similarly. Furthermore, we were able to decode memory type from hippocampal multivoxel patterns. Finally, individual symptom severity modulated semantic representation of the traumatic narratives in the posterior cingulate cortex. Taken together, these findings suggest that traumatic memories are an alternative cognitive entity that deviates from memory per se.

### Developing a valid evaluation for interpersonal and communication skills [^aba431a7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires that residency programs evaluate the acquisition of six general competencies, including Interpersonal and Communication Skills (ICS). To develop a 360-degree method for accomplishing this, a semantic-differentiation matrix for various communication traits for nurses to evaluate physician ICS was developed. The authors sought to determine whether this evaluation method could discriminate between more experienced medical communicators (faculty) and less experienced medical communicators (residents).

Methods

A 98-item questionnaire measured several communication dimensions by using an eight-element semantic-differentiation scale. In addition, global assessment ratings assessed nursing perceptions of physician ICS skills. This process was repeated for various clinical scenarios.

Results

There were 26 nurse evaluators, 19 emergency medicine (EM) residents (EM2 and EM3), and 30 EM faculty. Each physician received five independent evaluations (total, 245 evaluations). All EM residents (EM2 and EM3) were compared with the EM faculty. All eight items on the semantic-differentiation scale were compared. Likewise, the global assessment scores were compared. In every category, the faculty scored higher (Mann-Whitney U: p < 0.001).

Conclusions

An evaluation process integrating a semantic-differentiation matrix was applied to various clinical scenarios (as well as global assessment items) and demonstrated discriminatory results. Faculty physicians scored significantly higher than resident physicians. The ability to provide discriminatory results is a requisite in the development of a valid evaluation process. The described semantic-differentiation matrix and global assessment questions may be valid measurements of ICS.

### Automated text-level semantic markers of Alzheimer's disease [^1721520e]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Automated speech analysis has emerged as a scalable, cost-effective tool to identify persons with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Yet, most research is undermined by low interpretability and specificity.

Methods

Combining statistical and machine learning analyses of natural speech data, we aimed to discriminate ADD patients from healthy controls (HCs) based on automated measures of domains typically affected in ADD: semantic granularity (coarseness of concepts) and ongoing semantic variability (conceptual closeness of successive words). To test for specificity, we replicated the analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

Results

Relative to controls, ADD (but not PD) patients exhibited significant differences in both measures. Also, these features robustly discriminated between ADD patients and HC, while yielding near-chance classification between PD patients and HCs.

Discussion

Automated discourse-level semantic analyses can reveal objective, interpretable, and specific markers of ADD, bridging well-established neuropsychological targets with digital assessment tools.

### End-to-end automatic differentiation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from viral pneumonia based on chest CT [^95919811]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The results from this study indicated that the difference in CT characteristics between patients testing COVID-19 positive and other viral pneumonia patients could be decoded by a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technique. Although the CT findings of other viral pneumonia infections were similar to those of COVID-19 pneumonia, the self-supervised learning method of BigBiGAN distinguishes the two groups of patients based on the level of image semantic knowledge. Existing evidence shows that the CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia are bilateral involvement, peripheral distribution, mixed ground-glass opacity and consolidation, and vascular thickening. Thus, traditional methods may not be suitable for this issue because of the following reasons. First, if large bilateral involvement of the lungs occurs, it is difficult to accurately outline the area of interest on CT image. Second, there are some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who have no obvious abnormal CT signs. The end-to-end artificial intelligence analysis technology can help avoid the shortcomings of traditional analytic methods for this issue. Specifically, the BigBiGAN design does not concern itself with the image details but extracts the abstract frame elements that make up these details; that is, the semantic knowledge of the content expressed by the image was decoded and quantified. The entire CT image was used as the input, and the semantic features of bilateral involvement, peripheral distribution, ground-glass opacity and vascular thickening in COVID-19 pneumonia were identified by BigBiGAN. Meanwhile, with the semantic features extracted from the other viral pneumonia CT images, the difference between the CT finding of COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral-infected pneumonias can be quantified and evaluated. By using the external validation dataset to reduce bias, the results of our study indicated that based on the encoding of the semantic features, a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75% were achieved on the external validation dataset for COVID-19 pneumonia differentiation. Compared with the values of average sensitivity and specificity values of 80% and 83%, respectively, reported for the differentiation of COVID-19 from viral pneumonia using chest CT scans, our external validation results and the clinical application experiment indicated that the proposed approach could be used as a reliable clinical assistance for COVID-19 pneumonia differentiation.

### Toward a universal decoder of linguistic meaning from brain activation [^645e8877]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the decoder by training it and testing it using different subsets of the 180 concepts in a cross-validated manner. For each participant, we iteratively partitioned data into 170 concepts for training a decoder, and 10 left-out concepts for testing it. In each such partition, we selected 5000 voxels (~10% of the total) by the degree to which they could predict semantic vectors for the 170 training concepts; we then trained the decoder using those voxels (see "Decoding methodology" in Methods). For each left-out concept, a semantic vector was decoded from the corresponding activation pattern, resulting in 180 decoded vectors, after all iterations had taken place. We carried out this procedure using the data from each paradigm separately or the average of the three paradigms.

Decoding performance was evaluated in two ways. The first was a pairwise classification task where, for each possible pair of words, we computed the similarity between the decoded vectors and the "true" (text-derived) semantic vectors (Fig. 2b, right). If the decoded vectors were more similar to their respective text-derived semantic vectors than to the alternative, we deemed the classification correct. The final accuracy value for each participant is the fraction of correct pairs. The second was a rank accuracy classification task where we compared each decoded vector to all 180 text-derived semantic vectors, and ranked them by their similarity (Fig. 2c, right). The classification performance reflects the rank of the text-derived vector for the correct word: 1 if it is at the top of the rank, 0 if it is at the bottom, and in-between otherwise. The final accuracy value for each participant is the average rank accuracy across the 180 concepts. The null hypothesis value (chance performance) is 0.5 for both measures, but the statistical tests are different (see subsection "Statistical testing of results" in Methods).

### A novel method of evaluating semantic intrusion errors to distinguish between amyloid positive and negative groups on the Alzheimer's disease continuum [^3e54898b]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The development and validation of clinical outcome measures to detect early cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers is imperative. Semantic intrusions on the Loewenstein Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) has outperformed widely used cognitive measures as an early correlate of elevated brain amyloid in prodromal AD and has distinguished those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and high amyloid load from aMCI attributable to other non-AD conditions.

Methods

Since intrusion errors on memory tasks vary widely, we employed a novel method that accounts for the percentage of intrusion errors (PIE) in relation to total responses. Individuals with either high or low amyloid load across the spectrum of aMCI and dementia and amyloid negative cognitively normal older adults (CN) were studied.

Results

Mean PIE on indices sensitive to proactive semantic interference (PSI) and failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) could distinguish amyloid positive from amyloid negative aMCI and dementia groups. Number of correct responses alone, while able to differentiate the different diagnostic groups, did not differentiate amyloid positive aMCI from their counterparts without amyloid pathology.

Conclusions

PIE, a novel and sensitive index of early memory dysfunction, demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity in differentiating CN from amyloid positive persons with preclinical AD. Mean levels of PIE are higher for amyloid positive aMCI and dementia participants relative to their amyloid negative counterparts.

Donanemab appropriate use — clinical phenotype selection prioritizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) as primary etiology and permits certain non-amnestic AD phenotypes while excluding non-AD causes. To be considered as candidates for treatment, AD should be suspected as the primary etiology of cognitive impairment; the AUR allow inclusion of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and dysexecutive AD, whereas cognitive-behavioral syndromes suggestive of non-AD etiologies would rarely be candidates and patients with alternative medical, psychiatric or neurological etiologies should also be excluded from treatment.

TABLE 4
Voxel‐wise analysis significant results within the whole‐brain mask

FIGURE 1
Voxel‐wise significant activation, within the whole‐brain mask for the contrast of: (a) Related (Onset + Rhyme) > Perceptual in the Sound Judgment Task, (b) Related (Low + High) > Perceptual in the Meaning Judgment Task, (c) Sound Judgment Task (Related > Perceptual) > Meaning Judgment Task (Related > Perceptual), (d) Meaning Judgment Task (Related > Perceptual) > Sound Judgment Task (Related > Perceptual). All clusters greater than 77 voxels are shown, thresholded at a voxel‐wise p < .001 uncorrected and cluster‐wise p < .05 corrected

The univariate voxel‐wise results within the combined functional and literature‐based anatomical mask are shown in Table 5 and Figure 2. The direct comparisons between the sound and meaning judgment tasks (see Figure 2a) revealed significantly greater activation for the sound judgment task in the left triangular part of the IFG and significantly greater activation for the meaning judgment task in the left orbitalis part of the IFG and the left MTG. For the sound judgment task, the comparison between onset and rhyme conditions showed significant clusters in the left STG/MTG and the left opercular and triangular parts of IFG (see Figure 2b). These regions did not overlap with the phonologically specialized clusters found in the direct task comparison (Sound > Meaning). Similarly, for the meaning judgment task, the comparison between the low and high association conditions showed significant clusters in the left triangular and opercular part of the IFG (see Figure 2b). These regions also did not overlap with the semantically specialized clusters found in the direct task comparison (Meaning > Sound). The comparison of parametric modulations across tasks ([Onset > Rhyme] > [Low > High] and [Low > High] > [Onset > Rhyme]) revealed no significant clusters. Finally, the regression analyses did not reveal any significant clusters between specialization‐related brain activation and phonological awareness or semantic association skill as measured by the standardized tests. The same pattern of results for the direct and parametric modulation comparisons were found using a more lenient threshold of a voxel‐wise p < .005 uncorrected and cluster‐wise p < .05 corrected level (see Table S1 and Figure S1) with the only exception being that at the more linient threshold the left STG also showed greater activation for the sound judgment task as compared to the meaning judgment task.

### Imaging studies of semantic memory [^7642f858]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The neural basis of semantic memory has not only theoretical interest, but also implications for several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and semantic dementia.

Recent Findings

The main focus of functional imaging studies is to disentangle the contribution of several interacting factors to the landscape of cerebral activation observed in normal individuals performing tasks requiring access to semantic knowledge (e.g. picture naming, word comprehension sentence verification). The main factors found to play a role are the modality of stimulus presentation (e.g. visual, verbal); the domain to which the stimuli belong (e.g. concrete or abstract entities; natural kinds or artifacts); and the type of knowledge accessed (e.g. visual properties vs. action properties). Another area of investigation is the neural correlates of semantic processes, such as selection among alternatives or information retrieval.

Summary

The results of imaging studies confirm the neuropsychological concept that semantic knowledge and its usage depend upon a widely distributed network of brain areas. Specificity within this extended network, which includes a number of areas involved in perceptual and action processing, as well as the language areas, is related both to the type of knowledge and to different conceptual domains. The heterogeneous pattern of semantic memory dysfunction in neurological disorder may be a consequence of this complex neural organization.

Social pragmatic communication disorder (SPCD) — a DSM-5 diagnosis — is described as affecting individuals with functionally impairing social language use without habitual or repetitive behaviors. Affected individuals must have "deficits in using language for social purposes", difficulty matching communication to context, following conversational rules, and interpreting idioms and unstated meanings. The text adds that the symptoms "cannot be better explained by another DSM-5 diagnosis", that evaluation by "a speech-language pathologist provides additional information to consider this diagnosis", and that these characteristics and management "require additional study", while noting that ongoing experience will clarify similarities and differences with ASD in etiology, prognosis, and treatment.

### Title: "Labels matter: is it stress or is it trauma? " [^e91874f1]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The discussion of the results

Even before changing anything in the experimental protocols, we believe that the proposed definitions of Stress and Trauma are important for a more productive discussion over existing findings. The confusion arising from the use of the term stress for describing a wide range of different experiences and the responses to them has introduced great difficulties in comparing the findings, discussing them and drawing conclusions from them in a comprehensive way.

Adopting the proposed terminology and aiming to plan and conduct experiments along the line of those definitions will enhance discussion and promote reaching more well-based conclusions in the future.

Vulnerability and resilience versus pathology and no pathology

The proposed conceptual definitions of stress and trauma are based on the eventual outcome of the exposure, namely, whether the individual could maintain its functional capacity or failed to keep effective coping when facing future life events. This terminology is effective when examining the outcome of an exposure. Yet, difficulty arises when attempting to associate them with questions regarding vulnerability versus resilience (and we are back to the importance of semantic definitions). Often, the terms vulnerability and resilience are used in a predictive manner, to describe qualities that would only be manifested if and when individuals will encounter a challenging experience. The assumption behind the use of these terms is that vulnerable or resilient individuals are already different prior to the potential encounter, in a way that would enable the resilient, but not the vulnerable individual, to cope with the challenge if and when it arises.

It is important to note that even when referring to vulnerability and resilience as qualities to be measured prior to or without exposure to any challenge, the concept is a predictive concept, referring to currently present mechanisms that would come to action, or fail to come to action in the face of future exposure. In fact, vulnerability and resilience require identifying biomarkers that can predict the coping abilities of the individual. In that sense, the conceptual definitions proposed here for the dissociation between stress and trauma still hold, and they help to identify the need for predictive biomarkers.

As of now, there are no actual biomarkers that could predict vulnerability or resilience in an effective way. However, employing the Behavioral Profiling analysis approach, which enables to differentiate between exposed–affected and exposed–nonaffected individuals, it is possible to design studies that would collect samples prior to the exposure and analyze them in light of the eventual outcome, thus associating them to vulnerability or resilience. In any case, planning such experiments requires dissociating between stressful or traumatic outcome, if to reflect any functional significance to identified biomarkers.

### Semantic intrusion error ratio distinguishes between cognitively impaired and cognitively intact African American older adults [^e2665f01]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Semantic intrusion errors on memory tests may represent very early cognitive changes associated with elevated Alzheimer's disease pathology within the brain, including amyloid-β (Aβ). Subscales that measure proactive semantic interference (PSI) and intrusions related to PSI on the Loewenstein Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) have been associated with high levels of brain amyloid load, structural changes on brain MRI in Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. It is presently unknown whether intrusion errors or other measures of the LASSI-L can differentiate between African-American (AA) older adults diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or classified as cognitively normal (CN).

Objective

This study examined the extent to which a high percentage of semantic intrusion errors on LASSI-L subscales susceptible to PSI and other LASSI-L measures could differentiate between AA aMCI and CN groups.

Methods

Forty-eight AA older adults were recruited (27 CN and 21 aMCI) and received a through clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. The LASSI-L was administered independent of diagnostic classification.

Results

With and without statistical adjustment for literacy, AA aMCI participants scored lower on all LASSI-L measures. ROC analyses revealed an area under the curve exceeding 90% and correctly classified 86% of AA aMCI with 82% specificity for AA CN participants.

Conclusions

Percentage of intrusion errors on the LASSI-L subscales susceptible to PSI differentiated AA aMCI from AA CN. This adds to emerging evidence indicating that the LASSI-L may be culturally appropriate and can differentiate between aMCI and CN in diverse ethnic/cultural groups.

### Convergence of distinct functional networks supporting naming and semantic recognition in the left inferior frontal gyrus [^525592fb]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Naming individual objects is a composite cognitive process and contains three stages after perception: (a) the semantic stage, where the item is recognized, and the semantic information is retrieved; (b) the lexical retrieval stage where the item's specific name is recalled; (c) the phonological retrieval stage where the phonemes of the retrieved name is recalled (Dell, 1986; Dell & O'Seaghdha, 1992; Dell, Schwartz, Martin, Saffran, & Gagnon, 1997; Foygel & Dell, 2000; Schwartz, Dell, Martin, Gahl, & Sobel, 2006). Substantial evidence from neuropsychological studies suggests that the semantic recognition should be distinguishable from the following lexical and phonological retrieval at the cognitive and neural level (Bi et al. 2011; Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio, 1996; Damasio, Tranel, Grabowski, Adolphs, & Damasio, 2004; Drane et al. 2013). Specifically, several studies on patients with lesions in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) revealed that patients showed intact object recognition, yet had name retrieval deficits (Bi et al. 2011; Damasio et al. 1996). Furthermore, another study revealed that right temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients exhibited deficits in face recognition of famous persons without any problems in naming (Drane et al. 2013). Yet despite the suggested dissociation of the responsible brain regions for the sub‐functions, functional neuroimaging studies using cognitively normal participants have shown a large overlap between the brain regions related to semantic processing and those to lexical access including both lexical and phonological retrievals. For instance, some neuroimaging studies reported that the left ATL is involved in naming unique entities such as famous persons (Abel et al. 2015; Damasio et al. 1996), while other neuroimaging studies suggested its involvement in identification of famous persons or buildings (Gorno‐Tempini & Price, 2001; Olson, McCoy, Klobusicky, & Ross, 2013). In addition to the left ATL, the left pars triangularis of inferior temporal gyrus (IFGtri) was reportedly involved in both lexical retrieval task that required participants to retrieve names of animals, tools, and persons (Grabowski, Damasio, & Damasio, 1998) and postretrieval selection of semantic memory (Badre, Poldrack, Paré‐Blagoev, Insler, & Wagner, 2005; Badre & Wagner, 2007; Thompson‐Schill, D'Esposito, Aguirre, & Farah, 1997). Considering the inconsistent findings in the ATL between the neuropsychological studies and the neuroimaging studies, it remains unclear whether the overlapped brain regions such as the left IFGtri contribute to only one stage of the cognitive functions or all the stages during naming objects.

### Instant diagnosis of gastroscopic biopsy via deep-learned single-shot femtosecond stimulated raman histology [^b8f03fbc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Semantic segmentation of intratumoral heterogeneity

The highly heterogeneous development of tumor results in the uneven intratumoral histoarchitectures, which offers critical information of tumor malignancy. To further visualize the heterogeneous distribution of tumor subtypes and levels of differentiation, we developed a semantic segmentation algorithm based on the above CNNs, with the operations of flip-expansion, shifting FOVs and scoring (see Methods and Fig. S7). High-resolution predictions were made to generate the diagnostic probability maps of non-cancer, non-diagnostic, differentiated and undifferentiated cancers (Fig. 6a). The prediction probabilities were colored and superimposed onto the SRH images, showing the spatial characteristics of the diagnostic histological heterogeneity within a gastroscopic biopsy (Fig. 6b).

Scale bars: 100 µm. Source data are provided in the Source data file.

To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, we demonstrated the results of a typical tumorous tissue imaged with femto-SRH (Fig. 6b). The red color represents the high probability regions of predicted undifferentiated cancer, with low differentiation, poor maturity and high malignancy. The blue color represents the differentiated tissue regions with well or moderately differentiated carcinoma, and lower degree of malignancy. The green regions are predicted non-cancer, with gastritis symptoms and regularly patterned histology. And the gray areas do not provide useful diagnostic information, mainly consisting of the empty regions. From the segmentation results, we could clearly see that this particular tissue was mainly composed of poorly differentiated tumors with very few sites that remained moderate differentiation, which agreed with the pathological result of the patient. Moreover, representative FOVs of these subtyped areas are magnified (Fig. 6c) and verified by pathologists, confirming the accuracy of the semantic segmentation algorithm in generating diagnoses with high spatial resolution. Pixel-level prediction accuracy is difficult to achieve at current stage, since corresponding SRH and H&E results could not be generated on fresh tissues.

### Meaning for reading: the neurocognitive basis of semantic reading impairment after stroke [^7e36fa70]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of alexia has historically focused on syndromes such as surface alexia, which capture discrete patterns of reading deficits observed in some patients but do not describe the breadth of reading deficits observed in practice. Aphasia research has recently shifted focus to language process impairments rather than syndromic classifications. A similar shift in focus to reading process impairments might improve our diagnostic approach to alexia. Behavioural evidence suggests that semantic processing influences reading aloud and that semantic deficits in the context of semantic dementia underlie surface alexia. Because stroke rarely causes loss of semantic knowledge and surface alexia as a syndromic diagnosis is unusual after stroke, semantic reading deficits in stroke alexia have not previously been examined systematically. Semantic reading deficits in stroke may not relate to semantic deficits per se, but rather an inability to use semantics to support reading. Imageability, the degree to which a word brings to mind an image, is one index of semantic influences on reading. High-imageability words are read more quickly by healthy persons and more accurately following brain damage. Here, we test whether deficits of semantic reading after stroke, as indexed by reduced imageability effects, result from semantic or post-semantic processes. Examining non-verbal semantic processing, semantics-phonology mapping and semantic control in 56 left-hemisphere stroke survivors, only better semantics-phonology mapping ability predicted better accuracy on high-imageability words. Neither semantic nor post-semantic scores related to low-imageability word accuracy. Support vector regression voxel-based lesion symptom mapping revealed that damage along the superior temporal sulcus and underlying white matter, extending into the middle and superior temporal gyri, reduced the advantage of high-imageability over low-imageability words during reading, reflecting an inability to use semantics to support reading. A similar cluster related to impairments in semantics-phonology mapping. The imageability and semantics-phonology mapping results overlapped in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. Support vector regression connectome lesion symptom mapping revealed that white matter disconnections within a broad temporoparietal network important for phonological and semantic processing were associated with a reduction of the imageability advantage during reading. These results demonstrate that, irrespective of syndromic classification, semantic reading deficits occur in left-hemisphere stroke survivors owing to impaired integration of semantic and phonological representations and that the left posterior superior temporal sulcus underlies this process. Our results clarify the neurobiology of reading aloud and support the existence of a post-semantic impairment of semantic reading in left-hemisphere stroke survivors.

### Seeing different objects in different ways: measuring ventral visual tuning to sensory and semantic features with dynamically adaptive imaging [^4a9d199d]. Human Brain Mapping (2012). Low credibility.

A key challenge of object recognition is achieving a balance between selectivity for relevant features and invariance to irrelevant ones. Computational and cognitive models predict that optimal selectivity for features will differ by object, and here we investigate whether this is reflected in visual representations in the human ventral stream. We describe a new real-time neuroimaging method, dynamically adaptive imaging (DAI), that enabled measurement of neural selectivity along multiple feature dimensions in the neighborhood of single referent objects. The neural response evoked by a referent was compared to that evoked by 91 naturalistic objects using multi-voxel pattern analysis. Iteratively, the objects evoking the most similar responses were selected and presented again, to converge upon a subset that characterizes the referent's "neural neighborhood". This was used to derive the feature selectivity of the response. For three different referents, we found strikingly different selectivity, both in individual features and in the balance of tuning to sensory versus semantic features. Additional analyses placed a lower bound on the number of distinct activation patterns present. The results suggest that either the degree of specificity available for object representation in the ventral stream varies by class, or that different objects evoke different processing strategies.

### The neural response to changing semantic and perceptual complexity during language processing [^f0bb6bf1]. Human Brain Mapping (2010). Low credibility.

Speech comprehension involves processing at different levels of analysis, such as acoustic, phonetic, and lexical. We investigated neural responses to manipulating the difficulty of processing at two of these levels. Twelve subjects underwent positron emission tomographic scanning while making decisions based upon the semantic relatedness between heard nouns. We manipulated perceptual difficulty by presenting either clear or acoustically degraded speech, and semantic difficulty by varying the degree of semantic relatedness between words. Increasing perceptual difficulty was associated with greater activation of the left superior temporal gyrus, an auditory-perceptual region involved in speech processing. Increasing semantic difficulty was associated with reduced activity in both superior temporal gyri and increased activity within the left angular gyrus, a heteromodal region involved in accessing word meaning. Comparing across all the conditions, we also observed increased activation within the left inferior prefrontal cortex as the complexity of language processing increased. These results demonstrate a flexible system for language processing, where activity within distinct parts of the network is modulated as processing demands change.

### Both frontal and temporal cortex exhibit phonological and semantic specialization during spoken language processing in 7-to 8-year-old children [^72623b11]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

An alternative hypothesis for the lack of a linear brain‐behavior relation in our study is that brain specialization and skill could have a nonlinear relationship such that only children with high skills would show specialization. To examine this hypothesis, we partitioned our total sample into three groups consisting of 30 participants with the highest semantic association skills, 30 with the lowest semantic association skills, and 30 with skills in the middle. Then we examined the semantic specialization effect within each group, respectively, to see if specialization differs across groups. We found that only children with high skill showed significant semantic specialization in both the frontal and temporal lobes whereas children with low and middle‐skill did not show semantic specialization (see Table S2 and Figure S2 a). Similarly, we formed three groups of children with high, low, and middle phonological awareness skills and examined the phonological specialization effect within each group, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that children with both high and low skill showed phonological specialization in the frontal lobe whereas children with middle‐skill did not show evidence for phonological specialization (see Table S2 and Figure S2 b). This U‐shape brain‐behavior correlation in the frontal lobe in developing children was also found by a previous study (Booth et al. 2000) during sentence comprehension. The authors suggested that their participants who performed poorly were trying extremely hard to answer the questions correctly. Thus, we also speculate that the greater engagement of the left dIFG for the sound judgment task than the meaning judgment task could be due to greater cognitive control needed for the sound than the meaning judgment task in the low‐skill children. In fact, we found that low skill children struggled more with phonological than semantic processing (scaled score of phoneme isolation: 7.6; scaled score of word classes: 10.9; discrepancy: −2.3), whereas high skill children did not (scaled score of phoneme isolation: 13.5; raw score of word classes: 14.1; discrepancy: −0.8). Independent sample t test showed that the between task discrepancy score in low skill children were significantly lower than that in high skill children (t [58] = −2.869, p = .006). Therefore, while we interpret the greater engagement of the left dIFG in high skill children as reflecting phonological specialization, in low skill children, greater activation in the left dIFG for the sound than the meaning judgment tasks was likely due to greater cognitive demand rather than greater phonological specialization.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^27b38a52]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline 9 — psychologists strive to be familiar with current knowledge about normal and disease-mediated cognitive changes in older adults — emphasizes that one of the greatest challenges is knowing how to attribute subtle observed cognitive changes to normal developmental shifts versus an underlying neurodegenerative condition, that several moderating and mediating factors contribute to and confound age-associated changes within and across individuals, and that psychologists' knowledge about cognitive changes in older adulthood is critical to their ability to provide services. Application indicates that most cognitive changes older adults experience as part of normal aging are mild and do not significantly interfere with daily functioning, that for most older adults some abilities remain relatively stable into late life while others change beginning decades earlier, that the vast majority continue to engage in longstanding pursuits, interact intellectually, solve real-life problems, and achieve new learning, and that functions better preserved with age include aspects of language such as vocabulary and general semantic knowledge and other skills relying primarily on stored information, while psychologists aim to inform themselves about this process.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^b417de8b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease staging — principles, phenotypes, and Stage 2 context emphasize that cognitive decline in stages 3 through 6 may involve any cognitive domain(s), not only memory, and clinical staging is based on severity of cognitive/functional impairment rather than phenotype, with five characteristic AD phenotypes recognized: amnestic or "typical", language variant, visuospatial variant, behavioral variant, and dysexecutive variant; although stages are described, cognitive performance and cognitive decline are continuous processes and staging represents a categorical construct superimposed on a continuous process; the severity of clinical impairment is the product of all neuropathological insults and symptoms in individuals with abnormal AD biomarkers often cannot be ascribed solely to AD with confidence, particularly in older persons; Stage 2 is called out as a distinct transitional stage between asymptomatic (stage 1) and mildly impaired (stage 3), and individuals may be assigned to stage 2 based on neurobehavioral symptoms alone, whereas individuals must have cognitive impairment to be placed into stage 3.

### Neural correlates of semantic and morphological processing of hebrew nouns and verbs [^4d77d783]. Human Brain Mapping (2007). Low credibility.

Neuropsychological evidence regarding grammatical category suggests that deficits affecting verbs tend to localize differently from those affecting nouns, but previous functional imaging studies on healthy subjects fail to show consistent results that correspond to the clinical dissociation. In the current imaging study, we addressed this issue by manipulating not only the grammatical category but also the processing mode, using auditory presentation of Hebrew words. Subjects were presented with verbs and nouns and were instructed to make either a semantic decision ("Does the word belong to a given semantic category?") or a morphological decision ("Is the word inflected in plural?"). The results showed different patterns of activation across distinct regions of interest. With respect to grammatical category effects, we found increased activation for verbs in the posterior portion of the left superior temporal sulcus, left dorsal premotor area, and posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In each of these regions, the effect was sensitive to task. None of the ROIs showed noun advantage. With respect to task effects, we found a semantic advantage in left anterior inferior frontal gyrus, as well as in left posterior middle temporal gyrus. The results suggest that cerebral verb-noun dissociation is a result of localized and subtle processes that take place in a set of left frontal and temporal regions, and that the cognitive and neural processes involved in analyzing grammatical category depend on the lexical characteristics of the stimuli, as well as on task requirements. The discrepancy between functional imaging and patient data is also discussed.

### In search of convergent regional brain abnormality in cognitive emotion regulation: a transdiagnostic neuroimaging meta-analysis [^8d727aca]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Throughout our daily lives, we are constantly exposed to a wide range of emotionally arousing situations. Lacking the capacity to effectively use emotion regulation strategies to modify the occurrence, intensity, and duration of an emotional experience is referred to as emotion dysregulation, which can negatively affect our personal and social functioning and may cause serious mental health issues (Beauchaine & Cicchetti). Regulatory strategies are putatively considered "adaptive" or "maladaptive" based on their positive or negative associations with psychopathological symptoms (Aldao, Nolen‐Hoeksema, & Schweizer). Accordingly, healthy emotion regulation involves a balanced interplay between the use of adaptive and maladaptive strategies to reach a desired emotional state, whereas emotion dysregulation reflects unsuccessful handling of emotions caused by over‐reliance on maladaptive and/or failure in recruiting adaptive strategies (Aldao et al.). It is estimated that emotion dysregulation occurs in about 40–70% of individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders (Jazaieri, Urry, & Gross,), suggesting a transdiagnostic phenomenon (Aldao; Fernandez, Jazaieri, & Gross).

Emotion dysregulation has been extensively studied in the context of cognitive emotion regulation with a particular focus on reappraisal, an antecedent strategy that incorporates cognitive processes to alter the meaning or relevance of stimuli in order to change their emotional impact. (Aldao et al; Cludius, Mennin, & Ehring; D'Agostino, Covanti, Monti, & Starcevic; Werner & Gross). Reappraisal is a universal ability that can be used to maintain, decrease or increase negative and positive emotions (Nezlek & Kuppens). But, it is mainly required for reframing an emotionally aversive situation by creating a neutral or a more pleasant interpretation (Gross). Reappraisal has attracted attention as one of the most effective and adaptive strategies due to its immediate positive effects on emotional experience, as well as its long‐term beneficial outcomes for mental health (Hu et al; Webb, Miles, & Sheeran). Despite the health‐protective benefits of reappraisal, patients with mental illnesses generally report infrequent deployment of this regulation strategy, particularly in distressing or unpleasant situations (Aldao et al; Cludius et al; D'Agostino et al.).

### Title: "Labels matter: is it stress or is it trauma? " [^68306017]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The need for a stronger conceptual differentiation between Stress and Trauma

Our claim is that the use of the term Stress in a nondistinctive way to describe emotional experiences anywhere on the range from mild to severe, contributes to the difficulty in addressing the subjective nature of the response to emotional, stressful, or traumatic experiences.

Not every challenge should come under the umbrella of the term Stress. We propose to refer to three distinct conceptual levels of emotional experiences, which will be distinguished from one another according to three parameters: the level of emotional reaction associated with the experience, the scale of induced plasticity from the experience, and, most importantly, the experience's impact on the ability or inability of the individual experiencing it to cope later on with daily challenges.

The following are the three distinct conceptual levels we propose:

Arousing experience

An experience that activates a detectable emotional reaction and may affect the immediate choice of behavioral response, but does not lead to substantial long-term consequences in physiological systems, i.e. it does not lead to physiological plasticity. Following an arousing emotional experience, physiological systems generally return to their former baseline.

Stressful experience

An emotionally significant experience that activates a substantial emotional response — a response that not only acutely changes the choice of an immediate behavioral response, but also induces lasting alterations that have the potential of changing the response of the individual to a variety of future experiences (metaplasticity — plasticity of plasticity). Those alterations are not pathological, however, as they remain within the coping abilities of the individual. As a result, their functional capacity, understood as the degree to which the individuals can adapt with normative responses to future challenges, is not affected.

### Toward a universal decoder of linguistic meaning from brain activation [^8efca4a9]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Prior work decoding linguistic meaning from imaging data has been largely limited to concrete nouns, using similar stimuli for training and testing, from a relatively small number of semantic categories. Here we present a new approach for building a brain decoding system in which words and sentences are represented as vectors in a semantic space constructed from massive text corpora. By efficiently sampling this space to select training stimuli shown to subjects, we maximize the ability to generalize to new meanings from limited imaging data. To validate this approach, we train the system on imaging data of individual concepts, and show it can decode semantic vector representations from imaging data of sentences about a wide variety of both concrete and abstract topics from two separate datasets. These decoded representations are sufficiently detailed to distinguish even semantically similar sentences, and to capture the similarity structure of meaning relationships between sentences.

4.2 Experimental task design issues

The absence of convergent regional abnormality due to the reappraisal impairment can be further explained by the taxonomy of experimental designs in neuroimaging studies of reappraisal. Although we only included studies that used the prototypical reappraisal paradigm, some experimental factors and underlying cognitive functions could well affect the neural basis of cognitive reappraisal. Attentional engagement is a relevant example that can be modulated with interrelated exogenous factors such as arousal and valence (Sussman, Heller, Miller, & Mohanty,) and endogenous factors like needs, goals, and motivations (Ochsner & Gross). Remarkably, reappraising high arousal stimuli involves greater cognitive demands (Ortner, Ste Marie, & Corno,), as appeared in differential prefrontal recruitment (Silvers, Weber, Wager, & Ochsner). Relatedly, various negative stimuli (e.g. sad, disgusting, and fearful) are reported to reflect similar arousals, but involve different emotion processing networks (Fusar‐Poli et al; Vytal & Hamann,), suggesting their potentially distinct regulatory circuitries. In particular, disorder‐relevant stimuli are expected to be more salient than irrelevant ones (Hagemann, Straube, & Schulz). Thus, at least a part of nonreplicable results may stem from uncontrolled moderating factors related to external heterogeneous stimuli and/or internal diverse representations.

Another important factor that may not be well indexed by prototypical reappraisal tasks is the temporal dynamics of reappraisal, which is thought to engage different neural substrates for implementing and maintaining new appraisals (Kalisch). In a standard reappraisal task, individuals are given instructions on how and when to regulate their emotions. This paradigm usually measures the capability of individuals to implement reappraisal‐related cognitive processes to regulate their emotions (Silvers & Moreira). However, their tendency to engage regulatory mechanisms without being instructed (Doré, Weber, & Ochsner,) or their ability to keep and monitor reappraised images or thoughts (Kalisch,) are not generally evaluated by these experiments. Therefore, by using a standard reappraisal paradigm, it is not possible to capture the difficulties psychiatric patients may encounter while self‐initiating the regulation process or maintaining the reframed emotional states after applying the reappraisal successfully.

### Similarities and differences in the neural representations of abstract concepts across english and mandarin [^1737ff49]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

3.2 Common representation supported by cross‐language classification

To assess the similarity of individual concept representations across languages based on the underlying factors, a classifier was trained on one language to predict individual concepts in the other language. Cross‐language classification of individual concepts resulted in a mean rank accuracy (averaged over concepts, direction of decoding, and participants) of 0.65, p < .001. (The right‐most column in Table 2 shows the accuracies for individual concepts.) When individual concepts were averaged within categories, the categories with the highest accuracies were mathematics (0.67), scientific (0.78), emotion (0.70), and social (0.70). When the features for the between participant cross‐language classification were defined independently of the factors, using the union of 120 stable voxels from each language regardless of their association with any of the factors, the mean accuracy was 0.69, p < .01. The classification accuracy was only slightly lower (0.65 vs. 0.69) when computed using only stable voxels associated with factors, indicating how well a factor‐based account of the data accounts for the similarity between languages in their neural representations of abstract concepts.

3.1.2 Commonality of the concept representations across speakers of the same language

A between‐participant, within‐language classification was performed to determine whether these abstract concept representations were similar across speakers within a language group. For English speakers, when the classifier was trained on the data of all but one participant, the mean rank accuracy of the concept identification in the data from the left‐out participant was 0.74, p < .01, indicating that the neural signatures had a substantial amount of commonality across participants (Table 2). All 28 individual concepts were reliably classifiable between English‐speaking participants, with a range of 0.58–0.94 (p < .01 = 0.55).

TABLE 2
Commonality of concepts within and across languages as measured using concept‐level decoding rank accuracy. Dashed lines separate concept categories.

For Mandarin speakers, when the classifier was trained on the data of all but one participant, the mean rank accuracy of the concept classification in the test data from the left‐out participant was 0.73, p < .01 (Table 2). All 28 individual concepts were reliably classifiable between Mandarin‐speaking participants, with a range of accuracies from 0.57 to 0.92 (p < .01 = 0.54) except for contract which was classifiable only at p < .05.

Thus, there is a comparable degree of commonality across participants within each language group in their neural representation of the abstract concepts. Below, the underlying dimensions of the concept representations across languages are described, followed by an assessment of the commonality of the neural representations of individual concepts across languages, taking the underlying dimensions into account.

In the few cases where between‐participant decoding was more accurate than within‐participant decoding within a language, the difference might be attributable to the different way the stable voxels were selected in the two cases. The consensually chosen stable voxels in the between‐participant analysis could have reduced idiosyncratic properties in the concept representations.

Language status and proficiency — assessment considerations for (C)APD: It is important to consider the language background and level of language function of the individual referred for evaluation, and behavioral and some electrophysiologic measures require the ability to understand the test instructions; it is therefore important to ensure that the individual has adequate receptive and expressive language skills to complete the tasks within the test battery. Non‑native English speakers or those with limited proficiency may require a modification of the test battery, which may include a combination of electrophysiologic measures alongside behavioral tasks using simple verbal stimuli and nonverbal stimuli; when translated tests with adequate sensitivity and specificity are available and the clinician can instruct and interpret responses, use of these alternative, language‑specific tests may be appropriate, but significant language delay, disorder or difference can preclude reliable administration or severely limit procedures, making accurate diagnosis of (C)APD difficult or impossible. To reduce linguistic confounds, one approach is to present stimuli in an undistorted or non‑competing condition as well as in the specific test condition; if a deficit exists under the acoustically manipulated condition but not in the un‑manipulated condition, the deficit is most likely due to the acoustic manipulation rather than generalized language impairment or other listener‑related variables. Ear or hemisphere effects, especially in light of symmetrical hearing sensitivity and speech recognition scores, are more likely to reflect processing deficits rather than generalized global test confounds or comorbid conditions expected to affect performance for both ears.

DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) — criteria C–H — state that persistent avoidance must begin after the traumatic event(s) and be "as evidenced by one or both of the following", including "Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s)" or "Avoidance or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s)". Negative alterations in cognitions and mood must begin or worsen after the event(s) "as evidenced by two (or more) of the following", with examples such as "Inability to recall an important aspect of the traumatic event(s)" or "Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world". Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity must begin or worsen after the event(s) "as evidenced by two (or more) of the following", including "Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects" or "Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep)". The "Duration of the disturbance (Criteria B, C, D, and E) is more than 1 month", the disturbance "causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning", and "is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., medication, alcohol) or another medical condition".

### Defining key concepts for mental state attribution [^eb38cb39]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Choosing and discarding terms

Following the process outlined above and in more detail in the Supplementary Methods, we agreed on a set of most important terms. In Box 1, we outline the recommendation for whether the term should further be used and provide our consensually generated definition and percentage of agreement. The remaining terms referred to definitions that were already covered by more suitable alternatives. For example, the definitions obtained for 'cognitive empathy' largely overlap with the present definition of mentalizing. While introducing the concept might have had a clear justification two decades ago (i.e. "the cognitive component of empathy"), it now seems redundant and conceptually problematic. Accordingly, a significant proportion of our panel were concerned about its intrinsic ambiguity and support this term to be discontinued (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Proportion of our panel of researchers who agree for each term to be discontinued.

Terms are ordered from the most to the least frequently encountered (Proportion of our panel of researchers who stated having already encountered each term is available in more detail as Supplementary Fig. 1). Proportions are based on all responses available for each question.

Table 1 summarizes our recommendations for each of the discarded terms. It might appear surprising that for some terms (e.g. "empathic perspective-taking") we recommend favoring alternatives which, at first sight, might seem less lexically related (e.g. "mentalizing about affective states") than others (e.g. "empathy" or "perspective-taking"). The reason driving these decisions is that we focused on the conceptual idea underlying the panel's definitions of these terms, rather than on lexical proximity or alternative definitions. In this case, as "empathic perspective-taking" was defined as 'imagining how a target person feels', it appeared to be conceptually closer to our proposed definition of mentalizing than to those obtained for empathy (as its definition does not imply experiencing the emotional state of the targeted person) or perspective-taking (as its definition does not imply the adoption of the other perspective).

Summary of our recommendations for the alternatives to each of the discarded terms

These recommendations are based on the consensual definitions obtained.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^bbba6e61]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines executive summary — applications to practice states that culture provides the context for understanding personality and mental disorders and "defines adaptation and maladaptation, resilience, vulnerability, and coping"; it adds that "The scoring and interpretation of assessments aims to reflect variables that are culturally important for the identification of problems in living", and notes that "it is important for psychologists to seek to understand that individualism, self-reliance, self-efficacy, self-actualization, and self-care do not connote the only model", because "In many cultures, self-psychology and group and interpersonal processes are interpreted differently".

### Definitional issues in emotion regulation research [^e9f09507]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

Operational definitions of emotion regulation are frequently unclear, as are links between emotion regulation measures and underlying theoretical constructs. This is of concern because measurement decisions can have both intentional and unintentional implications for underlying conceptualizations of emotion regulation. This report examines the implications of some such decisions, including (a) focusing on types versus total amount of emotion regulation, (b) determining distinctiveness of measures of emotion versus emotion regulation strategies, (c) deciding whether and how to examine temporal sequencing of strategy use and emotion, d) using discrete versus global emotion measures, and (e) determining when emotion is being regulated. Finally, the need for better conceptualizations and empirical assessments of adaptive (vs. maladaptive) emotion regulation is discussed.

### Understanding and addressing the role of coping in palliative care for patients with advanced cancer… [^08525dab]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract Advanced cancer, with its considerable physical symptoms and psychosocial burdens, represents an existential threat and major stressor to patients and their caregivers. In response to such stress, patients and their caregivers use a variety of strategies to manage the disease and related symptoms, such as problem-focused, emotion-focused, meaning-focused, and spiritual/religious coping. Researchers have conceptualized coping strategies in multiple domains, such as: problem-focused, emotion-focused, and meaning-focused coping, among others.

1-3Another common distinction in the literature pertains to whether coping methods reflect engagement, consisting of active or approach-oriented strategies to manage the stressor directly, or disengagement, in which individuals seek to avoid or withdraw from dealing with the stressor. 42However, the researchers also found interaction effects between patient prognostic awareness and certain coping strategies. Specifically, greater use of positive reframing and active coping was associated with better QOL and fewer depression symptoms among those who accurately reported that their health status was terminal or identified their oncologist's treatment goal as not to cure their cancer, respectively. 42The associations between these coping strategies and QOL and depression symptoms were not as strong or significant in patients with inaccurate understanding of their health status or goal of treatment.

Thus, the use of particular coping strategies may buffer the relationships between prognostic awareness and worse QOL and mood outcomes. The dyadic relationship may play an important role in how patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers cope. For example, patient use of acceptance coping is associated with lower caregiver depression symptoms, whereas patient coping through seeking emotional support is related to higher caregiver depression symptoms. 80Moreover, caregiver use of avoidance, emotion-focused, and problem-focused coping strategies significantly correlate with patient outcomes of physical function and symptoms. 81These findings underscore the potential value of targeting dyadic adjustment to enhance coping and well-being when managing the stress of advanced cancer.

88Despite the abundance of studies on coping in response to major life stressors, including cancer, no specific strategies consistently predict better outcomes across patients or situations, questioning the utility of established coping assessments. For example, an emotion-focused coping strategy like self-distraction may be a helpful approach for managing stress in one circumstance, while reflecting maladaptive avoidance in another.

### Problems of reliability and validity with similarity derived from category fluency [^c22ce030]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

This study aims to assess the reliability and the validity of exemplar similarity derived from category fluency tasks. A homogeneous sample of 21 healthy participants completed a category fluency task twice with an interval of one week. They also rated pairs comprised of the most frequently generated exemplars in terms of similarity. Similarities were derived from the fluency data by determining the average distance between generated exemplars and correcting it for repetitions and response sequence length. We calculated the correlation between the similarities derived from the two sessions of the fluency task and between the derived similarities and the directly rated similarities. Spatial representations of the similarities were constructed using multidimensional scaling to visualize the differences between both sessions of the fluency task and the pairwise rating task. We find that the derived similarities are not stable in time and show little correspondence with directly rated similarities. The differences between similarities derived from category fluency tasks in healthy participants, indicate that similar differences between healthy controls and patients with mental disorders, do not necessarily point to a semantic impairment of the latter, but rather reflect the unreliability of the data.

### Title: "Labels matter: is it stress or is it trauma? " [^01248935]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic experience

An experience that activates a robust emotional response, which not only acutely changes the choice of a behavioral response, but also induces lasting alterations that would change the response of the individual to a variety of future experiences. Critically, those alterations are pathological, compromising functional capacity, i.e. the ability of the individual to cope later on with daily challenges. In other words, it can be said that the experience induces pathological metaplasticity.

It should be emphasized that we propose these definitions as conceptual distinctions. They obviously leave much to be more precisely defined: what should be considered as a 'significant' or a 'robust' emotional response? What should be considered as a 'substantial level of plasticity'? How do we define healthy functional capacity? What should be considered a pathological outcome? When does an experience transform from 'stressful' to 'traumatic'? etc. For both humans and animals, these are all challenging concepts to define. We will propose how to start translating these concepts into practice below, but regardless of whether and how precisely we can draw the dividing lines, it is critical to conceptually distinguish between these notions (Fig. 1). Particularly, it is important to distinguish between stressful and traumatic experiences. As mentioned above, our choice of terminology shapes our way of thinking about scientific challenges, and the way we address them. The questions indicated above, such as how to define a 'substantial level of plasticity' or 'healthy functional capacity', would not have been considered if not for such conceptual distinction.

Fig. 1
Schematic illustration addressing the need for a conceptual terminology to allow the distinction between Stress and Trauma.

As of now, there are no ideal ways for effectively addressing the subjective nature of the response to stress, the murkiness of the border between stressful and traumatic experiences, and the complexity of individual variability. Nevertheless, we propose to conceptually associate the term 'stress'/'stressful experience' with 'stress resilience' (the ability to be exposed to a stressful experience and cope with it), while restricting the use of the term 'trauma' only in reference to exposures that lead to pathology. In accordance with that, additional tools and approaches should be developed, making it more practical to establish the distinction between Stress and Trauma. These would enable to more effectively dissociate neural mechanisms underlying coping with stress from those mechanisms underlying failure to cope, which lead to the development of trauma-related psychopathologies.

### Title: "Labels matter: is it stress or is it trauma? " [^11fb2acf]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

In our view, the use of the term Stress for both stressful and traumatic experiences has hampered the field's ability to dissociate between two distinctive mechanisms. People who have undergone a severe experience, may change their behavior in significant ways and, if examined, will exhibit neuronal alterations at different levels of analysis. Yet many of them will continue with what is considered regular daily life and a satisfactory level of day-to-day functional capacity. What this means is that these people do not suffer from a pathology. Somehow, they have managed to cope with the experience. It is, therefore, important to clearly distinguish these individuals' experience from that of others, who, as a result of being exposed to a similar experience, have lost a significant part of their previous neurobehavioral functional capacities. Accordingly, the same experience affects neural mechanisms differently and induces a different level of plasticity in the two cases. Similarly, in animal studies, we should be able to distinguish between alterations in behavior and physiology that lead to a significant compromise of the animal's functional capacity and those alterations that do not. Lumping together the results from both affected and coping individuals and averaging them out would mask any possibility to identify the mechanisms of stress vulnerability, pathology or stress resilience.

The proposed conceptual definitions emphasize the consequences of exposure to an experience. This raises a problem when referring to resilience or vulnerability to traumatic experiences, because resilience and vulnerability refer to characteristics that are assumed to be present prior to the exposure and influence the exposure outcome. Below, we suggest a way to use the concepts of resilience and vulnerability in the context of the above-proposed dissociation between stress and trauma.
