## Question

Acute limb ischemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute limb ischemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining acute limb ischemia and its urgency. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and the Rutherford classification. Next, I will review immediate bedside assessment and when imaging is warranted. After that, I need to check the initial medical management, especially anticoagulation and analgesia. Then, I will examine revascularization strategies by severity, including thrombolysis, surgery, and mechanical thrombectomy. I should also consider special scenarios like popliteal aneurysm thrombosis, upper extremity ischemia, and pediatrics. Finally, I will address post-reperfusion care, prognosis, and quality metrics, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why this is an emergency. Acute limb ischemia is a sudden decrease in limb perfusion causing new or worsening symptoms and threatening viability, typically within 14 days of onset, with skeletal muscle tolerating ischemia for roughly 4–6 hours before irreversible injury, which explains the time-critical nature of management [^f09a28f6] [^ce6beb9b] [^4ed7aa11].

> I need to check the clinical presentation and classification next. Patients often report severe pain with sensory changes early, progressing to weakness, sensory loss, and color change as ischemia advances; the Rutherford classification remains the standard to stratify severity and guide urgency, with Category I viable, Category IIa marginally threatened, Category IIb immediately threatened, and Category III irreversibly damaged, which correlates with salvageability and timing of intervention [^f09a28f6] [^7c53f705] [^a209bddd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm that the initial evaluation is clinical and can proceed without noninvasive imaging in most cases. Experienced clinicians should assess motor and sensory function and use handheld Doppler for arterial and venous signals to determine limb threat and salvageability; imaging is reserved for ambiguous cases, complex reconstructions, or when it will change management, and if local expertise is unavailable, transfer to a vascular center is indicated [^4ed7aa11] [^071340a1] [^81b4fec2].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate medical management. Systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin should be started as soon as ALI is suspected unless contraindicated, because it prevents thrombus propagation and buys time for definitive therapy; adequate analgesia and IV hydration are also recommended while awaiting revascularization, and I should remember to stop heparin if catheter-directed thrombolysis is planned to mitigate bleeding risk [^1f98ee4a] [^5b0e8430] [^24e0908c] [^493148b2] [^c00c5dca].

> Next, I should review revascularization strategy by severity. For Category III irreversible ischemia, primary amputation is recommended as the index procedure because revascularization risks reperfusion injury and systemic collapse; for Category IIb immediately threatened limbs, emergent revascularization within about 6 hours is critical; for Category IIa marginally threatened limbs, urgent revascularization within 6–24 hours is appropriate; for Category I viable limbs, revascularization is still indicated but may be scheduled within 24 hours depending on etiology and patient factors [^8009e81c] [^e82d9909] [^d8b54773] [^52ce127c].

> I will now examine endovascular options, especially catheter-directed thrombolysis. CDT is reasonable in selected patients with salvageable limbs, particularly when symptoms are less than 14 days and there is no contraindication to thrombolysis; however, I should double-check the bleeding risk, as thrombolysis increases major hemorrhage and distal embolization compared with surgery, and guidelines advise against CDT for non–limb-threatening claudication and recommend combining with mechanical thrombectomy when feasible in Rutherford IIb cases [^32fcaa28] [^a8732543] [^b94f9a31] [^00f760b2].

> Let me consider surgical options and when they are preferred. Surgical thromboembolectomy remains a key strategy, especially for embolic disease, failed bypass grafts, or when rapid restoration of flow is needed; contemporary series show comparable limb salvage between endovascular and surgical approaches in class II ischemia, though technical success may vary by etiology and anatomy, reinforcing the need to tailor the approach to patient and lesion factors [^a44b597b] [^104f9129].

> But wait, what if we can combine strategies or use mechanical thrombectomy alone. Mechanical thrombectomy and pharmacomechanical approaches can achieve rapid reperfusion and reduce ICU stays; emerging data suggest lower 30-day mortality with endovascular-first strategies, though reintervention rates may be higher, and adjunctive angioplasty or stenting of underlying lesions is often required to secure durable patency and prevent recurrence [^51b0596b] [^4e2392b5].

> I should confirm special scenarios that change management. In popliteal artery aneurysm thrombosis, thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical therapy to improve runoff is recommended for mild-to-moderate ischemia, followed promptly by definitive aneurysm repair; for acute upper extremity ischemia, conservative anticoagulation alone is not advised if the limb is threatened or function is important; in pediatrics, therapeutic-dose IV heparin is first-line, with UFH preferred over LMWH in neonates and infants under 2 years [^416317a5] [^28e363f2] [^80eca9dc] [^0b77a06b].

> Hold on, I should verify post-reperfusion complications and surveillance. Compartment syndrome is a major risk after revascularization and mandates vigilant monitoring with a low threshold for four-compartment fasciotomy; reperfusion injury with myoglobinuria and metabolic derangements should be anticipated and managed proactively, including urine alkalinization and renal protection when indicated [^c2c2520b] [^a7237cb2].

> Next, I should review prognosis and quality metrics to frame expectations. Despite advances, ALI carries high morbidity and mortality, with 30-day mortality around 6–9%, in-hospital amputation near 6%, and 1-year mortality up to 41%; delays to anticoagulation and revascularization worsen outcomes, and female sex may portend higher mortality and amputation risk after endovascular therapy, underscoring the need for timely, guideline-concordant care and equitable access to vascular centers [^2f37fd99] [^2557a574] [^abae5461].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic workup for the embolic source so I don't miss it. After stabilization, patients without known PAD should undergo evaluation for cardioembolic sources, including ECG or rhythm monitoring for atrial fibrillation, echocardiography for valvular disease or thrombus, and consideration of hypercoagulable testing when results will change management; this should not delay revascularization when the limb is threatened [^2557a574] [^8041fc28].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and ensure it aligns with guidelines. Suspect ALI, start heparin, assess Rutherford category at the bedside with Doppler, provide analgesia and fluids, and escalate to emergent revascularization for IIb, urgent revascularization for IIa, and primary amputation for III; choose CDT, surgery, or mechanical thrombectomy based on etiology, duration, anatomy, and local expertise, and transfer promptly if the center lacks hybrid capabilities or vascular specialists; monitor closely for compartment syndrome and reperfusion injury after any successful revascularization [^4ed7aa11] [^81b4fec2] [^d8b54773] [^c2c2520b].

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a **sudden reduction in limb perfusion** [^a209bddd] that threatens viability, typically within 14 days [^f09a28f6] of symptom onset. It is a **vascular emergency** [^344717cf] with high morbidity and mortality [^2f37fd99]; rapid diagnosis and revascularization are critical to limb salvage [^d8b54773]. The most common causes are embolic occlusion (often from atrial fibrillation) [^48935a31] and in situ thrombosis from underlying atherosclerosis [^3bb51311]. Immediate management includes **systemic heparinization** [^1f98ee4a] and urgent vascular consultation [^a209bddd]; revascularization strategy depends on severity, etiology, and patient factors, with endovascular thrombolysis or thrombectomy for salvageable limbs [^a44b597b] and primary amputation for irreversible ischemia [^8009e81c]. Delays increase amputation and mortality [^2557a574], so time-to-reperfusion is the key driver of outcomes [^2557a574].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

ALI has two main etiologies: **embolic occlusion** — most often from atrial fibrillation or mural thrombus [^48935a31] — and **thrombotic occlusion** — typically from in situ thrombosis in atherosclerotic vessels or bypass grafts [^3bb51311]. Less common causes include trauma, dissection, and popliteal aneurysm thrombosis [^344717cf] [^416317a5].

Risk factors include **atrial fibrillation**, recent myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypercoagulable states, and prior vascular interventions [^2557a574] [^aad98ebd].

---

## Clinical presentation

ALI presents with the **six Ps**: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia (coldness) [^notfound]. Severity is classified by Rutherford categories:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Clinical findings** |
|-|-|-|
| I | Viable | No sensory loss, normal motor function, audible arterial Doppler |
| IIa | Marginally threatened | Minimal sensory loss, no motor deficit, inaudible arterial Doppler |
| IIb | Immediately threatened | Marked sensory loss, mild motor deficit, inaudible arterial Doppler |
| III | Irreversible | Profound sensory loss, severe motor deficit, inaudible arterial and venous Doppler |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** [^4ed7aa11], with bedside Doppler assessment of arterial and venous signals [^4ed7aa11]. Imaging is reserved for ambiguous cases or pre-intervention planning: duplex ultrasound, CTA, or MRA can define occlusion level and extent [^a0b01b44] [^c5f7cea8]. Routine labs include CBC, renal function, electrolytes, and coagulation profile [^48935a31].

---

## Initial management

Immediate steps include:

- **Systemic anticoagulation**: unfractionated heparin unless contraindicated [^1f98ee4a] [^5b0e8430].
- **Analgesia**: prompt pain control [^160ac7a1] [^24e0908c].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: IV hydration as needed [^493148b2].
- **Urgent vascular consultation**: for revascularization planning [^a209bddd] [^76c32339].

---

## Revascularization strategies

Choice of revascularization depends on severity, etiology, and patient factors:

- **Endovascular therapy**: catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) [^a44b597b], mechanical thrombectomy, or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis for salvageable limbs (Rutherford I–IIb) [^00f760b2].
- **Surgical revascularization**: embolectomy, bypass, or thrombectomy for severe ischemia, failed endovascular therapy, or embolic etiology [^a44b597b].
- **Primary amputation**: for irreversible ischemia (Rutherford III) to avoid reperfusion injury [^8009e81c] [^011d4788].

---

## Complications

ALI carries **high complication rates**:

- **Compartment syndrome**: common after reperfusion; monitor and decompress promptly [^c2c2520b].
- **Reperfusion injury**: metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria, and renal failure [^a7237cb2].
- **Bleeding**: especially with thrombolysis [^a8732543].
- **Infection**: including wound infections and sepsis [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Outcomes depend on severity and time to reperfusion. Mortality is 10–20% at 30 days and 20–40% at 1 year [^notfound]; amputation rates are 10–20% at 30 days and 20–30% at 1 year [^notfound]. Delays beyond 6 hours increase amputation and mortality [^notfound].

---

## Prevention and follow-up

Prevention focuses on **risk-factor modification** (anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, antiplatelet therapy, statins, smoking cessation, and diabetes control) [^b545a155] and surveillance for recurrent ischemia or complications [^notfound].

---

Acute limb ischemia is a **time-critical emergency** [^344717cf] requiring rapid recognition, anticoagulation, and revascularization to prevent limb loss and death. Early, guideline-directed care and multidisciplinary coordination are essential to optimize outcomes [^d7ece909].

Acute limb ischemia is a medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. Rapid diagnosis is required because it is a time-sensitive condition. Timely treatment is necessary to restore blood flow to the extremity and prevent complications. The differential diagnosis of acute limb ischemia is broad. Classification of severity of acute limb ischemia is based on clinical variables. A suspicion of acute ischemia based on history and physical examination warrants heparin administration and vascular surgery consultation. The decision for endovascular thrombolysis or standard surgery depends on etiology, duration, and location of vascular occlusion. This review evaluates the diagnostic approach and management for acute limb ischemia.

Acute limb ischemia is one of the most potentially devastating but treatable diseases faced by the vascular surgeon. It is crucial to identify the ischemic process early, as the outcomes of early intervention can lead to limb salvage, whereas late recognition places the patient at risk for limb loss and potential mortality. This article emphasizes the importance of properly evaluating the acutely ischemic extremity to ascertain whether the etiology is embolic or thrombotic. Appropriate treatment and management of the limb are determined by the underlying cause of the ischemia. The authors will review the clinical features, angiographic findings, and strategies for management for these similar but distinct etiologies: acute embolic versus thrombotic limb ischemia.

Background

Both peripheral arterial thrombolysis and surgery can be used in the management of peripheral arterial ischaemia. Much is known about the indications, risks, and benefits of thrombolysis. However, whether thrombolysis works better than surgery for initial management of acute limb ischaemia remains unknown. This is the second update of the review first published in 2002.

Objectives

To determine whether thrombolysis or surgery is the more effective technique in the initial management of acute limb ischaemia due to thromboembolism.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL, AMED, and clinical trials registries up to 7 May 2018.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled studies comparing thrombolysis and surgery for initial treatment of acute limb ischaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Agreement was reached by consensus. We performed analyses using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We identified no new studies for this update. We included five trials with a total of 1292 participants; agents used for thrombolysis were recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Trials were generally of moderate methodological quality. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was generally low owing to risk of bias (lack of blinding), imprecision in estimates, and heterogeneity. Trial results showed no clear differences in limb salvage, amputation, or death at 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 2.55, 4 studies, 636 participants; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.85, 3 studies, 616 participants; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.14, 4 studies, 636 participants, respectively), and we rated the evidence as low, low, and moderate quality, respectively. Trial results show no clear differences for any of the three outcomes at six months or one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. A single study evaluated vessel patency, so no overall association could be determined (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76, 20 participants; very low-quality evidence). Evidence of increased risk of major haemorrhage (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.79 to 5.78, 4 studies, 1070 participants; low-quality evidence) and distal embolisation (OR 31.68, 95% CI 6.23 to 161.07, 3 studies, 678 participants; very low-quality evidence) was associated with thrombolysis treatment at 30 days, and there was no clear difference in stroke (OR 5.33, 95% CI 0.95 to 30.11, 5 studies, 1180 participants; low-quality evidence). Participants treated by initial thrombolysis had a greater reduction in the level of intervention required, compared with a pre-intervention prediction, at 30 days (OR 9.06, 95% CI 4.95 to 16.56, 2 studies, 502 participants). None of the included studies evaluated time to thrombolysis as an outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence in favour of either initial thrombolysis or initial surgery as the preferred option in terms of limb salvage, amputation, or death at 30 days, six months, or one year. Low-quality evidence suggests that thrombolysis may be associated with higher risk of haemorrhagic complications and ongoing limb ischaemia (distal embolisation). The higher risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in each individual case. Trial results show no statistical difference in stroke, but the confidence interval is very wide, making it difficult to interpret whether this finding is clinically important. We used GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence as generally low. We downgraded quality owing to risk of bias, imprecision, and heterogeneity between included studies.

### Contemporary management of acute limb ischemia: factors associated with amputation and in-hospital mortality [^d7ece909]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Contemporary treatment of patients with acute limb ischemia includes both open and endovascular techniques, and advances in technology continue to make interventions easier and safer. However, the greatest gains in improving outcomes in these patients will come from more consistent and prompt recognition of the disease followed by rapid, standardized therapy to minimize the risk of limb loss and subsequent reperfusion-related injury. This article uses case reports to highlight critical issues that may arise during the course of diagnosis and treatment and describes clinical factors associated with morbidity and mortality in these patients.

Introduction

Acute limb ischemia is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of acute limb ischemia, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Acute limb ischemia is defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion resulting in cessation of blood flow and nutrient and oxygen delivery to the tissues. This leads to cellular injury and necrosis, ultimately resulting in limb loss and potentially systemic symptoms with significant morbidity and mortality. There are several etiologies including native arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis after an intervention, arterial embolus, and arterial injury. Patients with acute limb ischemia most commonly present with severe pain and sensory changes in the initial stages, with prolonged ischemia resulting in weakness, sensory loss, and color changes to the affected limb. The emergency clinician should consult the vascular specialist as soon as ischemia is suspected, as the diagnosis should be based on the history and examination. Computed tomography angiography is the first line imaging modality, as it provides valuable information concerning the vasculature and surrounding tissues. Doppler ultrasound of the distal pulses may also be obtained to evaluate for arterial and venous flow. Once identified, management includes intravenous unfractionated heparin and vascular specialist consultation for revascularization.

Conclusions

An understanding of acute limb ischemia can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Demography and etiology of acute leg ischemia [^838497e0]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Acute leg ischemia arguably is the most challenging condition that a vascular surgeon has to manage. Patients have widely different presentations, there are several available treatment options, and, yet, despite best efforts, the outcome remains poor. An understanding of the changes in population demographics in affluent western societies, set in an historical context, enables choices about therapy. A vascular unit serving a community including half a million people can expect to treat approximately 75 patients with acute leg ischemia per year. It is vital that a team approach is used to decide management because endovascular treatment with peripheral thrombolysis is increasingly important. The distinction between etiology of thrombosis or embolism remains important, although the diagnosis can never be conclusive. The severity of arterial ischemia is a more important determinant of outcome; optimal management, therefore, begins with stratification according to the severity of ischemia on admission to the hospital. Subsequent care lends itself to organization by care-pathway or guidelines that take into account the available local facilities.

### Hypercoagulable syndromes: evaluation and management strategies for acute limb ischemia [^aad98ebd]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Acute limb ischemia secondary to peripheral arterial thrombosis is a relatively uncommon but ominous form of vascular accident. Select inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states appear to contribute to an initial arterial thrombosis and, more importantly, recurrent thrombotic events. Mounting interest in hypercoagulability, the increased availability of hypercoagulable state "profiles", and enhanced ability to identify an abnormality in tested patients have promoted widespread testing. Unfortunately, widespread testing has had a limited beneficial impact on the management of acute limb ischemia. Ideally, costly and specialized testing should be limited to situations in which the results will have a tangible impact on patient care. Clear goals of testing should be determined before testing is performed. This article addresses a practical approach to hypercoagulable state testing in patients with acute limb ischemia with a focus on abnormalities that impact patient management.

### Quality improvement guidelines for percutaneous management of acute lower-extremity ischemia [^259c6459]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute limb ischemia — pre-thrombolysis management emphasizes rapid anticoagulation and evaluation, and limb outcomes worsen with delayed thrombolysis; intravenous heparin at full anticoagulation doses should be initiated as soon as possible and continued until thrombolysis is started, and Doppler imaging examination of the limb should be performed when possible. In one study, amputation rates were 6% if thrombolytic therapy was initiated within 12 hours of development of acute symptoms of ischemia, 12% if initiated within 13–24 hours, and 20% if initiated after 24 hours.

### Acute limb ischemia following aortic reconstruction… [^445dc035]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Acute limb ischemia following aortic reconstruction is primarily related to intraoperative technical errors and is associated with significantly increased mortality. Elective aortic reconstruction was performed on 262 patients between 1975 and 1981. Surgical indications were aneurysm in 84 patients, occlusive disease in 125, and both of these in
53. Acute limb ischemia developed postoperatively in 27 patients; it was noted at the conclusion of the operation in five of them and within the first 48 hours in 22. The mortality was greater in the combined aneurysm and occlusive disease group than in the aneurysmonly and occlusive disease — only groups, primarily because of an increased incidence of myocardial disease in the combined group. Postoperative limb ischemia was mainly a result of technical error and resulted in increased mortality in all groups. Strom JA, Bernhard VM, Towne JB.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® sudden onset of cold, painful leg: 2023 update [^b6cf0e40]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute onset of a cold, painful leg, also known as acute limb ischemia, describes the sudden loss of perfusion to the lower extremity and carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Acute limb ischemia requires rapid identification and the management of suspected vascular compromise and is inherently driven by clinical considerations. The objectives of initial imaging include confirmation of diagnosis, identifying the location and extent of vascular occlusion, and preprocedural/presurgical planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Quality improvement guidelines for percutaneous management of acute lower-extremity ischemia [^48935a31]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Indications/patient selection — initial evaluation for acute lower-extremity ischemia centers on history, examination, and targeted testing, with emphasis on defining embolic versus thrombotic etiology. Patient selection "is determined by a number of clinical findings of the limb in question", and "an appropriate history and physical examination and an evaluation of the patient for absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy should be performed". The history and exam "should focus on" pain, sensory and motor changes, pallor, and temperature, while laboratory tests "should be obtained to assess for renal function, baseline hematocrit and coagulation profile, and evidence of hyperkalemia and acidosis". An "electrocardiogram may be obtained to ascertain if any cardiac arrhythmias are present and to assess for a recent myocardial infarction". Etiologic assessment informs management; in embolic events, "the heart is the source in 80%–90% of cases", and "arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can have a 3%–6% annual risk of thromboembolic complications if they are not treated with anticoagulation".

### European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2020 clinical practice guidelines on the management of acute limb ischaemia; a word of caution! [^2f37fd99]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is relatively uncommon but serious condition. The estimated incidence is 23.3/100.000 person years (Baril et al.) (Korabathina et al.). Regardless of any intervention, ALI is linked with significant morbidity and mortality rates. The hospital mortality ranges from 6.3–9% with hospital amputation rate of 6%, and one-year amputation rate 11%, while the one-year mortality could reach up to 41%.

ESVS has published guidelines regarding the management of this critical condition (Björck M et al.). The guidelines have adopted the grading system of recommendation strength proposed by the European Society of Cardiology. In essence, the evidence behind each recommendation is given A-C level, where A represents data derived from multiple randomised clinical trials or meta-analyses, B data derived from a single randomised clinical trial or large nonrandomised studies and C consensus of opinion of the experts and/or small studies, retrospective studies and registries. The strength of each recommendation is given I to III class level where class I represents evidence and/or general agreement that a given treatment or procedure is beneficial, useful, and effective, Class II conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy of the given treatment or procedure, and Class III evidence or general agreement that the given treatment or procedure is not useful/effective, and in some cases may be harmful.

### Clinical staging of acute limb ischemia as the basis for choice of revascularization method: when and how to intervene [^1cc56b24]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

In acute lower limb ischemia, there are basically three management options: (1) clot removal by catheter-directed thrombolysis with or without percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, (2) surgical thromboembolectomy followed by correction of underlying arterial lesions, and (3) anticoagulation with continued observation. Arterial embolic occlusion presents more abruptly and with more severe ischemia than arterial thrombosis, which occurs in narrowed arterial segments that have generally developed some degree of collateral circulation. The appropriate choice of treatment for acute limb ischemia depends to a great extent on the severity of the ischemia. Level of ischemia is readily determined by examining for sensory loss or motor deficit and interrogating the distal arteries and veins for audible flow signals with a handheld Doppler velocity detector. After clot removal, appropriate management of the responsible underlying lesion depends on its characteristics, best determined by vascular imaging. Staging the severity of ischemia according to clinical classification levels in the current reporting standards for lower extremity ischemia continues to serve as the basis for logical management decisions. This approach is outlined in algorithmic form and alternative pathways are discussed in this article.

### Acute ischemia of the upper and lower limbs: tailoring the treatment to the underlying etiology [^79f77d3a]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) can be a devastating clinical emergency with potentially limb- or life-threatening consequences. It is defined as a quickly developing or sudden decrease in limb perfusion producing new or worsening symptoms and signs, often threatening limb viability. ALI is commonly related to an acute arterial occlusion. Rarely, extensive venous occlusion can lead to upper and lower extremities ischemia (ie, phlegmasia). The incidence of acute peripheral arterial occlusion causing ALI is approximately 1.5 cases per 10,000 people per year. The clinical presentation depends on the etiology and whether the patient has underlying peripheral artery disease. Except for traumas, the most common etiologies are embolic or thrombotic events. Peripheral embolism, likely related to embolic heart disease, is the most common cause of acute upper extremity ischemia. However, an acute thrombotic event may occur in native arteries, at the site of a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque, or as a failure of previous vascular interventions. The presence of an aneurysm may predispose to ALI for both embolic and thrombotic mechanisms. Immediate diagnosis, accurate assessment of limb viability, and prompt intervention, when needed, play important roles in salvaging the affected limb and preventing major amputation. Severity of symptoms is usually dependent on the amount of surrounding arterial collateralization, which may often reflect a pre-existing chronic vascular disease. For this reason, early recognition of the underlying etiology is crucial for choice of best management and definitely for treatment success. Any error in the initial evaluation may negatively affect the functional prognosis of the limb and endanger the patient's life. The aim of this article was to discuss diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of patients with acute ischemia of the upper and lower limbs.

### Quality improvement guidelines for percutaneous management of acute lower-extremity ischemia [^80047357]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute limb ischemia — comparative evidence for thrombolysis versus surgery supports thrombolysis in selected patients and offers specific outcome data; published studies indicate that patients with acute leg ischemia of less than 14 days duration benefit most from thrombolysis, and subanalysis showed that lower amputation and mortality rates occurred when patients were randomized to undergo thrombolysis versus surgery when symptoms were less than 14 days in duration. In a randomized study, after 12 months, 84% of the patients randomized to receive thrombolytic therapy were alive, whereas only 58% of those randomized to surgery were still alive (P = 0.01). Further analysis of the STILE trial indicated that 1-year amputation-free survival rate was significantly higher in patients with ALI randomized to receive thrombolytic therapy compared with surgery (20% vs 48% [P = 0.026]; failure of catheter placement occurred in 28% of patients). Based on the results of the TOPAS and STILE trials, a working group proposed that thrombolytic therapy should be considered appropriate initial management in patients with acute occlusion of the leg arteries or bypass grafts, noting that these recommendations are not absolute. Further subgroup analysis suggests that thrombolysis appears to be more effective for graft occlusions than for native artery occlusions, and some studies have indicated that the likelihood of limb salvage after thrombolytic therapy is greater when a greater number of patent vessels are present.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) — defined as any sudden decrease in, or worsening of, limb perfusion causing a threat to extremity mobility and viability that has been present for less than 14 days — is one sequela of peripheral arterial disease, and it is one of the most common vascular emergencies interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons are asked to evaluate and treat. Treatment options include medical management, surgical management, and image-guided minimally invasive management; specifically, medical management entails anticoagulation with continued observation, surgical management entails embolectomy, and image-guided minimally invasive therapy entails percutaneous endovascular removal of the clot. Often, more than one is needed to achieve optimum results, and regardless of the method chosen to remove the clot, the underlying causative abnormality must be addressed. There are diverse etiologies for ALI, with the two most common etiologies being embolus and thrombosis in situ secondary to underlying disease such as atherosclerosis.

### Acute limb ischemia [^854be73e]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute limb ischemia is technically defined as ischemia of the lower extremities lasting 14 days or less. The condition affects between 15 and 26 persons per 100,000 each year in the United States. The associated morbidity and mortality is extremely high, with 1-year mortality rates reported at over 40%. Acute limb ischemia is 20 times more common in the lower extremities than the upper extremities. Both interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons bring unique skills to the table in caring for these patients, and therefore should approach the care of these patients in a multidisciplinary manner to ensure the best outcomes for each patient. Patients should be classified according to the Rutherford classification scale for acute limb ischemia. Catheter-directed thrombolysis can be a viable treatment alternative for these patients, offering a minimally invasive option to patients with outcomes similar to surgery. It is important to know the presentation, physical examination, risks and benefits, as well as the techniques and equipment required to treat patients with acute lower limb ischemia.

### Navigating between the science and art of acute limb ischemia treatment [^b6c9b511]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of acute limb ischemia (ALI) has long been a fierce adversary that has evolved over the last several decades with scientific advancements in endovascular therapy. History and physical examination remain the mainstay of diagnosis enhanced by detailed imaging to guide therapy. Many endovascular tools are available for prompt restoration of flow that compliment traditional surgical options. These devices incorporate the mechanical removal of thrombus and the chemical dissolution of thrombus. Medical decision-making for ALI patients must take into account the patient characteristics, anatomic variables, mechanism of ischemia, degree of ischemia, and operator skill to employ the right strategy for the right patient. This moving target challenges scientific study, making the therapeutic bedside decision making an artform. We present an overview of the field, supportive data, and a treatment algorithm that hopefully captures this delicate balance.

### Acute limb ischemia [^8d27dd46]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute limb ischemia occurs when there is an abrupt interruption of blood flow to an extremity usually because of either embolic or thrombotic vascular occlusion. When profound ischemia ensues, this represents an emergency in which restoration of perfusion through early intervention can lead to limb salvage, whereas delay may result in significant morbidity, including limb loss and, potentially, death. Patients in whom urgent or semi-urgent surgical or endovascular revascularization is indicated may undergo catheter angiography unless there is a contraindication, such as profound critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, or contrast allergy. Alternative imaging modalities include ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography. The clinical degree of the ischemic insult will determine the most appropriate course of management, as severely ischemic limbs may require immediate surgical revascularization, while endovascular interventions, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, may be appropriate in patients with moderate ischemia. Additionally, many percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices are being used or undergoing clinical evaluation, either alone or in combination with pharmacologic thrombolysis, for the treatment of acute limb-threatening ischemia. In this article, we present our approach to an acutely ischemic limb, with a focus on the pertinent aspects of endovascular intervention.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of endovascular and surgical revascularization techniques in acute limb ischemia [^f68e669a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The initial treatment of patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI) remains undefined. The aim of this article was to compare the safety and effectiveness of catheter-driven thrombolysis (CDT) with surgical revascularization and evaluate the various fibrinolytic agents, endovascular, and pharmacochemical approaches that aim for thrombectomy.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies on the management of ALI by means of surgical or endovascular recanalization, returning 520 studies. All randomized, controlled trials, nonrandomized prospective, and retrospective studies were included comparing treatment of ALI.

Results

Twenty-five studies, investigating a total of 4689 patients, were included for meta-analysis spread across nine different comparisons. No differences were found in limb salvage between thrombectomy and thrombolysis. More major vascular events were seen in the thrombolysis group (6.5% compared with 4.4% in the surgically treated group; odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13–0.87; P = 0.02; I² = 20%). Comparable limb salvage was found for high- and low-dose recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA). No significant differences were found in major vascular event between low r-tPA (14%) and high r-tPA (10.5%; P = 0.13). The 30-day limb salvage rate was 79.7% for r-tPA treatment and 60.4% for streptokinase (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.26–7.85; P = 0.01; I² = 0%). AngioJet showed more limb salvage at 6 months compared with r-tPa (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.17–4.18; P = 0.01; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Both CDT and surgery have comparable limb salvage rates in patients with ALI; however, CDT is associated with a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the risk of hemorrhagic complications regarding thrombolytic therapy by means of r-tPA, streptokinase, or urokinase. Insufficient data are available to conclude the preference of using a hybrid approach, ultrasound-accelerated CDT, heated r-tPA. or novel endovascular (rheolytical) thrombectomy systems. Future trials regarding ALI need to be constructed carefully, ensuring comparable study groups, and should follow standardized practices of outcome reporting.

Ischemia- and infection-dominant conditions in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) emphasize that ischemia management is central, infection can drive amputation, and the wound triad requires systematic assessment and documentation. The management and monitoring of ischemia play a central role in healing as well as in recurrence and involve regular vascular assessment and monitoring for potential intervention, and infection is often the primary factor leading to amputation, accentuated by tissue loss and ischemia. Each member of the wound care team must categorize, stage, and grade the severity of each component of the "wound triad" initially and at all follow-up encounters, with appropriate and regular documentation including diagrams and photographs. During follow-up, recurrence may be related to tissue loss such as deformity, inappropriate shoes, or change in activity, and nonhealing may be due to ongoing or recurrent ischemia; intervening when infection develops may require additional surgical or medical intervention.

### Comparative effectiveness of endovascular versus surgical revascularization for acute lower extremity ischemia [^104f9129]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Thrombolysis and open surgical revascularization are current options for the treatment of acute limb ischemia (ALI). Despite the several randomized controlled trials comparing the two options, no single treatment can yet be recommended as a universal initial management of ALI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate contemporary endovascular and surgical revascularization for ALI.

Methods

Consecutive patients with ALI treated with endovascular revascularization (ER) or open revascularization (OR) between 2005 and 2011 were identified and reviewed. Procedural success and outcomes were compared between the two groups. Limb salvage and survival were assessed by time-to-event methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and competing-risks regression models.

Results

A total of 154 limbs were treated in 147 patients in the ER group, compared with 326 limbs in 296 patients in the OR group. The mean follow-up was 14 ± 18.5 months. The majority of patients presented with Rutherford II ischemia (83% for OR, 90% for ER). In Rutherford II patients, technical success was achieved in 90.7% of the OR group vs 79.9% of the ER group (P = 0.002), with amputation rates of 10.0% vs 7.2% (P = 0.35) at 30 days and 16.3% vs 13.0% (P = 0.37) at 1 year, respectively. In Rutherford II patients with failed bypass graft, technical success rate was 95.0% (OR) vs 75.0% (ER) (P = 0.001), whereas the amputation rate was 6.3% vs 15.38% (P = 0.13) at 30 days and 24.1% vs 23.1% (P = 0.90) at 1 year, respectively. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 13.2% (OR) and 5.4% (ER) (P = 0.012). Overall amputation rates were 13.5% (OR) vs 6.5% (ER) at 30 days (P = 0.023) and 19.6% (OR) vs 13.0% (ER) at 1 year (P = 0.074). The primary patency rate was 57% (OR) and 51% (ER) at 1 year (P = 0.74). Predictors of limb loss by life-table analysis included coronary artery disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; P = 0.007) and Rutherford category III (HR, 19.0; P < .001). Predictors of death by life-table analysis included age (HR, 1.03; P < .001), end-stage renal disease (HR, 7.28; P < .001), cancer (HR, 1.65; P = 0.005), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.61; P = 0.005).

Conclusions

In patients presenting with class II ALI, ER or surgical OR resulted in comparable limb salvage rates. Although technical success is higher with OR for patients presenting with failed bypass grafts, the amputation rates are comparable. Overall mortality rates are significantly higher at 30 days and 1 year in the OR group.

### Acute limb ischemia: a case report and literature review [^432ad0b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute limb ischemia (ALI), although uncommon, can present with profound symptoms, including disabling pain in the setting of acute vascular and neurologic deficits. The most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategy has evolved with emerging technologies inclusive of less-invasive endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic options.

Objective

We present a case of ALI to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches with a summary of the most common literature.

Discussion

Utilizing the clinical findings applied to the Rutherford classification, the emergency physician, in consultation with a vascular surgeon and interventional radiologist, can strategize a methodical approach for better clinical outcomes, often with less-invasive endovascular interventions, ideally within 6 h of symptom onset.

Conclusions

We present a case of ALI to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic approach with a summary of the most current literature. Emergency physicians should be aware of optimized clinical outcomes with the use of time-sensitive enhanced endovascular therapies as a recommended option for the best outcomes for the treatment of ALI.

### Validating GLASS score in predicting acute limb events in CLTI… [^32fd67ee]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Validating GLASS Score in Predicting Acute Limb Events in CLTI Patients ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Ischemia is a severe medical condition that occurs when the blood and oxygen supply to a specific part of the body is significantly reduced or completely absent, it can affect any body part, often the legs. It is typically caused by the narrowing or blockage of an artery and can result in severe pain, tissue gangrene, and the potential loss of a limb. This condition requires medical intervention and will not improve on its own. To diagnose leg ischemia, the doctor will conduct a thorough vascular clinical examination. Depending on the findings, further imaging tests such as duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance arteriography, or computed tomography may be conducted. In some cases, an arteriogram may be necessary which is an x-ray of the arteries while the dye is injected into the blood vessels.

The primary aim of the PROMOTE GLASS study is to investigate if the Global Anatomical Staging System score, which is a summation of points given according to the disease pattern as seen on assessment images can accurately tell if the treatment using catheters and stents inside blood vessels will work well for people with ischemia in their legs. The researchers also want to see if the GLASS score can predict how well patients with ischemia will heal and if they will need further treatments in the long term after having treatment with catheters and stents inside their blood vessels. A prospective, observational study will be delivered by Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. The vascular team will prospectively collect data over a 12-month period. This will be in patients undergoing elective and/or emergency primary EVT procedure, with follow-up 4–6 weeks after the procedure and at 12 months.

Exclusion Criteria:

- Patient with traumatic or iatrogenic lesions leading to CLTI.
- Acute Limb Ischemia
- Patients who have undergone open/endovascular revascularization of the same limb within the last 12 months

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) urgency and initial management emphasizes that ALI is a vascular emergency that requires rapid diagnosis and management, including timely revascularization to re-perfuse the ischemic limb, and that determination of the potential underlying cause is crucial but such an evaluation should not delay revascularization and other potentially limb-saving therapies; causes include acute thrombosis of native vessel or bypass grafts in the setting of known diagnosis of peripheral artery disease (PAD), arterial embolism, dissection, and trauma, with potential underlying causes listed in Table 20.

### Female patients at increased risk for adverse outcomes after acute limb ischemia [^abae5461]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The underrepresentation of female patients in key trials results in a lack of sex-based guidelines regarding appropriate evaluation, diagnosis and management of the female vascular patient. As a result, recent literature has found a difference in the amputation and mortality rates in female patients following treatment for acute limb ischemia. However, the reasons for outcome variability are unknown. The objectives of this study were to identify sex specific predictors of major amputation and mortality following intervention for acute limb ischemia and sex specific differences in presentation, management and outcome of patients who undergo revascularization for acute limb ischemia.

Methods

We included all adults who underwent revascularization for ALI at a multihospital healthcare system (2016–2023), excluding those who presented secondary to trauma, dissection, iatrogenic injury, popliteal aneurysms or COVID. The terms "male" and "female" were used to delineate patient's sex assignment at birth, were obtained from electronic health records and were assumed to be congruent with gender references. Survival and amputation were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression with a priori and empirically selected covariates. Comprehensive subgroup analyses were conducted to assess risk of mortality and amputation.

Results

548 patients were identified, of which 252 (46%) were female. Male patients were younger (64.4 ± 11.5 vs. 67.0 ± 15.3; p = 0.023), more likely to have CAD (p = 0.014), smoking history (p < 0.001), and prior revascularization (p < 0.001). Female patients were more likely to be hypercoagulable (p = 0.001) and less likely to present with acute on chronic disease (p < 0.001). Female patients were less frequently on a preoperative statin (p < 0.001) or antiplatelet agent (p = 0.004). While there was no sex-based difference in Rutherford ALI classification upon presentation, female patients were more likely to go to the OR within 24 hours (p = 0.024). There were no differences in the initial surgical approach (endovascular vs. open). Female patients had an increased rate of death on univariable (p = .009) and multivariable (aHR = 1.6; 95% CI [1.07–2.33]) analysis. On subgroup analyses, female patients who were medically optimized on presentation achieved mortality rates similar to male patients. Although there was no difference in overall amputation rates, female patients who underwent an endovascular first approach were twice as likely to undergo amputation in comparison to males (OR 2.6, p interaction = 0.01).

Conclusions

Female patients who presented with ALI had higher mortality following revascularization, except for those medically optimized. They also had notably higher amputation rates following endovascular intervention. Further exploration of these disparities may allow for tailored intervention strategies by sex.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) — initial clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach emphasizes emergency assessment and rapid determination of limb viability: Patients with ALI should be evaluated on an emergency basis by a clinician with sufficient experience to assess limb viability and implement appropriate therapy, and in suspected ALI the initial clinical evaluation should rapidly assess limb viability and potential for salvage and can be achieved without noninvasive imaging (ie, duplex ultrasound, CTA, or MRA). In patients with ALI who have a complicated history of revascularization procedures, it may be reasonable to obtain noninvasive imaging (ie, duplex ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) before deciding to proceed with revascularization. ALI is a vascular emergency that requires rapid recognition and timely implementation of therapy, and if local expertise is unavailable for rapid assessment and potential revascularization, patient transfer to a facility with such resources should be considered. Initial evaluation includes targeted history and physical examination, including use of a continuous wave Doppler device at the bedside to assess arterial and venous signals in the limb, and in most cases treatment for ALI is implemented without the need for additional noninvasive imaging studies (ie, duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA). The time constraint is attributable to the period that skeletal muscle will tolerate ischemia — about 4 to 6 hours.

### Perioperative outcomes are adversely affected by poor pretransfer adherence to acute limb ischemia practice guidelines [^d44bd162]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The accepted treatment for acute limb ischemia (ALI) is immediate systemic anticoagulation and timely reperfusion to restore blood flow. In this study, we describe the retrospective assessment of pretransfer management decisions by referring hospitals to an academic tertiary care facility and its impact on perioperative adverse events.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of ALI patients transferred to us via our Level I Vascular Emergency Program from 2010 to 2013 was performed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, Rutherford ischemia classification, time to anticoagulation, and time to reperfusion were tabulated and analyzed for correlation to incidence of major adverse limb events (MALEs), mortality, and bypass patency in the perioperative period (30-day postoperative). All intervals were calculated from the onset of symptoms and categorized into 3 subcohorts (< 6 hr, 6–48 hr, and > 48 hr).

Results

Eighty-seven patients with an average age of 64.0 (± 16.2) years presented to outlying hospitals and were transferred to us with lower extremity ALI. The mean delay from symptom onset to initial referring physician evaluation was 18.3 hr. At that time of evaluation, 53.8% had Rutherford class IIA ischemia and 36.3% had class IIB ischemia. Seventy-six patients (87.4%) were started on heparin previous to transfer. However, only 44 patients (57.9%) reached therapeutic levels as measured by activated partial thromboplastin time before definitive revascularization. A delay of anticoagulation initiation > 48 hr from symptom onset was associated with increased 30-day reintervention rates compared with the < 6 hr group (66.7% vs. 23.5%; P < 0.05). However, time to reperfusion had no statistically significant impact on MALE, 30-day mortality, or 30-day interventional patency in our small cohorts. Additionally, patients with a previous revascularization had a higher 30-day reintervention rate (46.5%; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The practice of timely therapeutic anticoagulation of patients referred for ALI from community facilities occurs less frequently than expected and is associated with an increased perioperative reintervention rate.

### Controlled reperfusion after acute and persistent limb ischemia [^e61cadef]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality after revascularization of acute ischemic limbs remain high, despite many surgical improvements during the last decades. To a large extent, this is related to reperfusion itself after complete, acute, prolonged ischemia that results in postreperfusion syndrome. This report addresses the deleterious consequences of postreperfusion syndrome, which occurs after normal blood reperfusion, and describes the pathophysiologic basis for this complication. A unique opportunity arises from these data. Control of the initial reperfusion by modifying the conditions of reperfusion and the composition of the reperfusate will open the door to a new approach to salvage limbs and lives from this disastrous complication. The same approach that is used successfully in other organs and tissues (eg, heart, kidney, brain, whole body) will put the vascular surgeon in the position to intraoperatively counteract the consequences of revascularization after prolonged acute limb ischemia.

### Quality improvement guidelines for percutaneous management of acute lower-extremity ischemia [^4e2392b5]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) adjunctive techniques — when flow in the vessel has been restored, repeat angiography should be performed to define the vascular anatomy and areas of disease that may require additional treatment, and in most cases a causative lesion will be identified and this should be managed with the appropriate endovascular technique or conventional surgical procedure, because failure to detect and rectify an underlying lesion is associated with poor long-term patency. Patients who required thrombolytic therapy only had much higher primary patency rates (95.2% at 1 mo, 88.4% at 6 mo and 1 y) and limb salvage rates (100% at 1 mo, 6 mo, and 1 y) than those needing adjunctive procedures. These techniques will help achieve two clinically important endpoints: they may be used in conjunction with thrombolysis to remove insoluble material, or debulk the thrombus to accelerate the restoration of flow; and they may be used to correct underlying lesions at the time of thrombolysis or in the periprocedural period.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- The ABI, or toe-brachial index when the ABI demonstrates noncompressible arteries, should be used for the diagnosis of PAD in patients with findings suggestive of or at high risk for PAD.
- Structured exercised therapy is recommended at least three times per week for 12 weeks in patients with chronic symptomatic PAD and improves walking distance, functional status, and quality of life.
- Single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is recommended for symptomatic PAD; low-dose rivaroxaban combined with low-dose aspirin benefits select patients at high risk.
- Cilostazol reduces claudication symptoms and may reduce restenosis after endovascular therapy. From the AFP Editors Peripheral artery disease is a common cardiovascular disease that impacts walking, overall function, and quality of life. It also increases the risk of amputation, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have released guidelines for the management of PAD. CLINICAL SUBSETS ACC/AHA defines four PAD subsets: asymptomatic, chronic symptomatic, chronic limb-threatening ischemia, and acute limb ischemia.

### Basic control of reperfusion effectively protects against reperfusion injury in a realistic rodent model of acute limb ischemia [^233b5c7a]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Reperfusion injury is insufficiently addressed in current clinical management of acute limb ischemia. Controlled reperfusion carries an enormous clinical potential and was tested in a new reality-driven rodent model.

Methods and Results

Acute hind-limb ischemia was induced in Wistar rats and maintained for 4 hours. Unlike previous tourniquets models, femoral vessels were surgically prepared to facilitate controlled reperfusion and to prevent venous stasis. Rats were randomized into an experimental group (n = 7), in which limbs were selectively perfused with a cooled isotone heparin solution at a limited flow rate before blood flow was restored, and a conventional group (n = 7; uncontrolled blood reperfusion). Rats were killed 4 hours after blood reperfusion. Nonischemic limbs served as controls. Ischemia/reperfusion injury was significant in both groups; total wet-to-dry ratio was 159 ± 44% of normal (P = 0.016), whereas muscle viability and contraction force were reduced to 65 ± 13% (P = 0.016) and 45 ± 34% (P = 0.045), respectively. Controlled reperfusion, however, attenuated reperfusion injury significantly. Tissue edema was less pronounced (132 ± 16% versus 185 ± 42%; P = 0.011) and muscle viability (74 ± 11% versus 57 ± 9%; P = 0.004) and contraction force (68 ± 40% versus 26 ± 7%; P = 0.045) were better preserved than after uncontrolled reperfusion. Moreover, subsequent blood circulation as assessed by laser Doppler recovered completely after controlled reperfusion but stayed durably impaired after uncontrolled reperfusion (P = 0.027).

Conclusions

Reperfusion injury was significantly alleviated by basic modifications of the initial reperfusion period in a new in vivo model of acute limb ischemia. With this model, systematic optimizations of according protocols may eventually translate into improved clinical management of acute limb ischemia.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) revascularization — In patients with ALI, the revascularization strategy "should be determined by local resources and patient factors (e.g., etiology and degree of ischemia)" (COR I, LOE C-LD). "Catheter-based thrombolysis is effective for patients with ALI and a salvageable limb" (I, A). "Amputation should be performed as the first procedure in patients with a nonsalvageable limb" and "Patients with ALI should be monitored and treated (e.g., fasciotomy) for compartment syndrome after revascularization" (both I, C-LD). For salvageable limbs, "percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy can be useful as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis" (IIa, B-NR), and "surgical thromboembolectomy can be effective" when ALI is due to embolism (IIa, C-LD), whereas "The usefulness of ultrasound-accelerated catheter-based thrombolysis for patients with ALI with a salvageable limb is unknown" (IIb, C-LD). Prolonged ischemia limits salvageability; patients who are insensate and immobile "in the setting of prolonged ischemia (≈6 to 8 hours) are unlikely to have potential for limb salvage with revascularization".

### Open or endovascular revascularization in the treatment of acute lower limb ischaemia [^4ce2018f]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment for acute lower limb ischaemia (ALI) represents a major challenge for vascular specialists, largely because of high amputation and death rates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The 1‐year amputation‐free survival rate is approximately 50–70 per cent 6, 7. The optimal choice of treatment remains undefined despite considerable research effort 8. Previous reports 9, 10, 11, 12 highlighted that differences in outcome are dependent on the aetiology of the occlusion: either arterial thrombosis, embolus or aneurysm. These aetiologies may represent different diseases, with mutual symptoms, but requiring different treatment for optimal outcome 4.

Open surgery was previously the exclusive treatment option. After the advent of catheter‐directed thrombolytic therapy, its use was compared with open surgery in several RCTs in the mid‐1990s 8. There was no overall difference in limb salvage or death at 1 year between initial surgery or thrombolysis 8. During the past two decades, the treatment of ALI has developed appreciably with the introduction of new advanced and, more frequently, endovascular techniques 6. There are no contemporary large‐scale comparisons between open and endovascular interventions for ALI. The lack of consensus on the treatment of ALI has led to wide variation in practice. Half of patients in the USA are treated with open surgery 6; in contrast, in Scandinavia patients are more often treated with thrombolysis. The European Society of Vascular Surgery has initiated a process of developing clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of ALI, to be published in late 2019.

This nationwide cohort study aimed to compare short‐ and long‐term results after open or endovascular intervention for ALI, with amputation‐free survival as the primary endpoint.

### Prospective single-arm trial of endovascular mechanical debulking as initial therapy in patients with acute and subacute lower limb ischemia: one-year outcomes [^7c165ca0]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is a critical vascular emergency that both endangers the affected extremity and puts the patient's life at risk. Duration of symptoms is 14 days or less. Similarly, subacute lower limb ischemia (SLI) can also threaten limb viability, but ischemic symptoms worsen gradually over a period of up to 3 months. Historically, open surgery and/or catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) have been front-line interventions in both ALI and SLI, – but each therapy is associated with a significant incidence of complications.

Mechanical debulking offers advantages over CDT and surgery, with low invasiveness, prompt reperfusion, and the opportunity to immediately treat the underlying cause and concomitant lesions, with a low rate of bleeding complications and no need for an intensive care unit stay. However, mechanical removal (atherectomy, thromboembolectomy) of arterial occlusive material has not replaced the traditional treatments so far. Adoption of mechanical thrombectomy has been slow due to limited experience with the technique and the low standalone efficacy of some devices, necessitating concomitant use of thrombolysis.

Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is a well-accepted treatment modality for acute arterial and graft occlusion, but intraoperative use of plasminogen activators as an adjunct to operative thrombectomy or thromboembolectomy is frequently overlooked by vascular surgeons. Evidence exists that intraoperative intraarterial infusion of lytic agents is safe and is accompanied by breakdown of distal thrombus. This article describes the rationale for intraoperative thrombolysis, reviews the evidence supporting its use, and suggests several technical approaches to incorporating lytic therapy intraoperatively.

### Study protocol of a prospective multicenter observational study evaluating acute lower limb ischemia [^8317a1b3]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is a limb- and potentially life-threatening condition which requires urgent evaluation and treatment. Contemporary data on optimal therapy and prognosis of ALI are lacking, while surgical, hybrid, and foremost endovascular techniques have rapidly evolved over the past decades. Available clinical guidelines are not based on high-level evidence and do not fully reflect day-do-day practice. Contemporary data on etiology, procedural strategies as well as patient outcomes in ALI are urgently needed to improve care and prevent limb loss. The current study was initiated by the European Vascular Research Collaborative (EVRC), established by young European vascular specialists, and aims to provide insight into contemporary treatment strategies in ALI and its clinical results within Europe. In this manuscript we report the rationale and a detailed study protocol.

Material and Methods

The proposed study is a prospective, international, multicenter, observational study on ALI (PROMOTE-ALI) (ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05138679). Patients with ALI (Rutherford classification grade I -III) of one or both lower extremities will be included in the study. The primary endpoint of the study is amputation-free survival (AFS) at 30 d. Secondary endpoints are freedom from target limb reintervention, freedom from complications, clinical outcome of the index leg, and limb salvage and survival at 30 and 90 d after diagnosis of ALI.

Conclusions

ALI remains a challenging condition and due to the heterogeneous etiology, clinical presentation and treatment strategies, a large multicenter study on this topic is needed to gain contemporary data on clinical outcomes and prognosis, especially for modern endovascular techniques. PROMOTE-ALI is expected to provide these data and set a benchmark for future randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Discussion

Acute limb ischemia remains a potentially debilitating disease with increased mortality and major amputations rates. Despite the technical advancements in this field, there is still a relevant lack of data on contemporary devices, medications, and techniques. Most reports in the last years evaluated either a small cohort, a single treatment option without control group, or reported only on the peri-interventional outcomes. The current analysis, which assessed all currently available treatment options, showed a significantly lower mortality and morbidity rates at 30 days following endovascular therapy, although the early amputation rates did not differ significantly between the 3 groups. Moreover, ET was associated with improved AFS and mortality during follow-up, although the reintervention and major amputation rates were comparable with hybrid and surgical therapy.

Endovascular therapy is the first-line treatment option for most patients with chronic ischemia of the lower extremities. The minimally invasive nature of percutaneous procedures offers a benefit compared with open repair especially in patients with increased comorbidity. Despite the promising results of the initial randomized trials, the increased risk for bleeding, the need for ICU stay and the delayed reperfusion of the affected limb did not allow a similar adoption of an endovascular first approach for most patients with ALI. However, the development of endovascular thrombectomy techniques enabled the rapid clot removal and reperfusion of the lower extremities, while reducing the need for CDT and accordingly of ICU stay. In this cohort, more than 50% of patients treated by endovascular thrombectomy devices did not require a CDT. Similarly, in the prospective PEARL registry (PEripheral Use of Angiojet Rheolytic Thrombectomy), the use of PMT reduced the need for CDT in half of the procedures. This might be crucial in patients with increased risk for bleeding complications as well as in cases of severe ischemia of the limb. Of note, although current recommendations suggest a rapid restoration of the blood flow with thrombus extraction and thrombo-aspiration, especially in patients with neurologic deficit, recent studies showed that the primary mode of endovascular therapy remains CDT. The updated European guidelines for the treatment of ALI among patients with COVID-19 infection also highlighted the importance of endovascular thrombectomy, given the limited resources in ICU and high dependency units during the pandemic.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) — compartment syndrome risk, diagnosis, and urgency: patients presenting with ALI experience elevated rates of morbidity, mortality, and limb loss, and adjuncts to limb revascularization, including fasciotomy for compartment syndrome and amputation, may be necessary to minimize tissue loss and preserve maximal limb function; elevated compartment pressures are generally not present at initial presentation but can occur after partial or complete revascularization due to reperfusion injury, with the lower leg as the most common site, and a high clinical suspicion is necessary so that timely decompression with surgical fasciotomy can interrupt progression of ischemia to tissue necrosis.

4.2. Vascular Medicine

Arterial, venous, and lymphatic disorders are common and induce substantial morbidity and mortality. The comprehensive management of all vascular disorders is the goal of Level III training in vascular medicine. All trainees should be able to manage acute and chronic vascular disorders in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, including initial evaluation and ongoing care. Core areas of knowledge include the anatomy, vascular biology, clinical pharmacology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of diverse vascular diseases. In addition, vascular medicine trainees should understand the principles of vascular duplex and physiology testing and be familiar with the role of advanced imaging, angiography, and revascularization procedures.

4.2.1. Peripheral Artery Disease

Given the growth of the aging population in the United States along with the known morbidity and mortality of PAD, it is crucial that vascular medicine trainees understand the pathophysiology, causes, epidemiology, risk factors, and symptoms of the disease such as claudication. In particular, trainees must be able to recognize the manifestations of the most severe forms of disease, acute and chronic critical limb ischemia, including pain in the limbs at rest, loss of lower extremity pulses, a nonhealing wound, or gangrene. PAD is diagnosed with the ankle-brachial index and toe brachial index. Trainees are expected to know the indications for different tests, how to perform them, and how to interpret them. Training requirements also include knowing the indications and limitations for the imaging modalities to diagnose these disorders (ie, duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, MR angiography, and catheter-based angiography). A trainee who has achieved competence in the vascular management of PAD should be knowledgeable about the current ACC/AHA recommendations for medical, endovascular, surgical, and exercise therapies and their application for the treatment of patients with PAD.

Introduction

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the final stages of peripheral artery disease, reflecting impairment in tissue perfusion that leads to a threatened limb. The clinical manifestations of this condition may be broad, ranging from rest pain to severe ischemic ulceration or tissue gangrene of the extremities. Unfortunately, this condition is relatively common, with an annual incidence of 3.5 patients per 1000 and a documented age‐adjusted prevalence of 1.3% in the United States. 1 More concerning, the incidence of this condition will likely grow because up to 10% of patients with peripheral artery disease are expected to develop CLI over a 5‐year period. 2 The primary therapeutic intervention for this condition focuses on urgent revascularization to facilitate tissue salvage, through percutaneous or surgical approaches. The immediate limb salvage rates with revascularization are encouraging, although subsequent morbidity and mortality remain high, with more than one third of these patients experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event within 3 years of their initial presentation. 3 The need for urgent revascularization during the index presentation and the subsequent risk of adverse events make the treatment of CLI incredibly costly to patients and the healthcare system as a whole. 4, 5
