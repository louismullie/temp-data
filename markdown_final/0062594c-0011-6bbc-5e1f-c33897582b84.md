## Question

How to investigate stand-alone thrombocytopenia without any other lab abnormalities

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to investigate stand-alone thrombocytopenia without any other lab abnormalities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true thrombocytopenia and excluding pseudothrombocytopenia. Then, I should verify the severity and immediate bleeding risk to decide on urgency. Next, I will consider age-specific differentials and the core initial laboratory evaluation. After that, I need to check for secondary causes and decide when to pursue bone marrow examination. Finally, I will outline management thresholds, follow-up cadence, and when to escalate to hematology or genetic testing, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality is real and not artifactual, because pseudothrombocytopenia from platelet clumping in EDTA is common and can mislead management. I should double-check the platelet count with a peripheral smear and consider citrate-anticoagulated samples or manual counts if clumping is suspected, since pseudothrombocytopenia accounts for a meaningful fraction of isolated thrombocytopenia referrals and can delay critical care decisions if unrecognized [^6bb0d57a] [^90c7cfb2].

> Next, I should review severity and bleeding risk to triage urgency. Mild thrombocytopenia is 100–149 × 10⁹/L, moderate 50–99 × 10⁹/L, and severe less than 50 × 10⁹/L. Spontaneous bleeding risk rises as counts fall below 50 × 10⁹/L and is high below 10 × 10⁹/L, so I need to ensure I act promptly if there is major bleeding, neurologic or renal dysfunction, or a platelet count under 10 × 10⁹/L, which warrant hospitalization and immediate evaluation [^90c7cfb2] [^57a90f23].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I anchor the likely causes by age. In children, immune thrombocytopenia is the most common cause and often self-limited, whereas in adults, primary ITP remains common but drug-induced, viral, and myelodysplastic etiologies become more prevalent, and in older adults the risk of hematologic malignancy rises substantially, so I should tailor the workup accordingly [^2ba610f1] [^5958fcb1] [^bae851ba].

> I will now examine the core initial laboratory evaluation that I should obtain in essentially all patients with isolated thrombocytopenia. A repeat CBC with platelet count, a careful peripheral smear to assess morphology and exclude clumping, and HIV and hepatitis C serologies are foundational. I should also consider hepatitis B testing when risk factors exist, and in women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test is appropriate because gestational thrombocytopenia and pregnancy-related etiologies are common and change management [^4df5863d] [^165bcefb] [^1ac85f0c].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antinuclear antibody testing. Routine ANA is not recommended in children with suspected ITP, but in adults with suggestive features or suspected secondary ITP, targeted autoimmune testing can be reasonable. I should avoid broad, low-yield panels and instead align testing with the clinical picture to prevent unnecessary costs and false positives [^e64c8540] [^4df5863d].

> Next, I should review the peripheral smear carefully for red flags that would pivot me away from a simple ITP diagnosis. Dysplasia, blasts, macrocytosis, schistocytes, or abnormal platelet morphology should prompt consideration of myelodysplastic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, or inherited platelet disorders, respectively. If the smear is normal aside from thrombocytopenia, that supports ITP, but I need to ensure I do not miss subtle clues that would change management [^90c7cfb2] [^c3866631].

> I need to check for secondary causes systematically. I should confirm medication exposures, especially heparin, quinine, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and remember that drug-induced thrombocytopenia often resolves within 7–10 days after withdrawal. I should also consider alcohol use, liver disease, and infections such as HIV, hepatitis C, and CMV, and in the right context, H. pylori, because identifying and treating these can normalize platelets and alter ITP management [^57a90f23] [^aa52a5c6].

> But wait, what if the patient is on heparin or has recent heparin exposure. I should calculate a 4Ts score and, if moderate or high, discontinue heparin immediately and start a non-heparin anticoagulant while sending HIT immunoassays and, if positive, a functional assay, because HIT carries high thrombotic risk even when thrombosis is not yet clinically apparent [^5f06efb5] [^3dd1b16d].

> Let me consider when to pursue bone marrow examination, since this is often contentious in isolated thrombocytopenia. I should confirm that marrow is indicated when there are atypical features, such as age over 60, persistent unexplained thrombocytopenia, abnormal counts other than platelets, dysplasia on smear, or failure to respond to appropriate therapy. In adults over 60, isolated thrombocytopenia is associated with a markedly increased risk of hematologic malignancy, supporting a lower threshold for marrow evaluation in that group [^1508c449] [^bae851ba].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances. In children, routine bone marrow is not indicated for typical ITP, but I should consider inherited thrombocytopenia if there is a family history, persistent macrothrombocytopenia, or failure of first-line ITP therapy. Genetic testing may be appropriate in those scenarios, and I should remember that very low platelet counts, especially ≤ 12 × 10⁹/L, strongly favor ITP over other etiologies in pediatric cohorts [^b50cb89e] [^77393667].

> Next, I should review management thresholds and follow-up cadence. In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelets ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have only minor mucocutaneous bleeding, observation without steroids is recommended, whereas for counts < 30 × 10⁹/L, corticosteroids are suggested. For counts < 20 × 10⁹/L, hospitalization should be considered, and all patients should have hematology follow-up within 24–72 hours. In children, outpatient management is appropriate for counts ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L with mild bleeding, with close follow-up and caregiver education [^782995a3] [^b513dfa5] [^48d396a1].

> I should double-check the follow-up intervals for mild versus moderate thrombocytopenia. For mild isolated thrombocytopenia, repeating the platelet count in 4–6 weeks is reasonable, whereas for moderate thrombocytopenia, earlier rechecking in 1–2 weeks is prudent to detect evolution. Persistent or worsening thrombocytopenia should trigger hematology referral and reconsideration of the differential, including marrow evaluation if not already done [^57a90f23].

> Let me reconsider the role of platelet autoantibody testing. Although I initially thought it might help confirm ITP, I should confirm that current evidence shows low sensitivity and limited clinical utility, so routine autoantibody testing is not recommended. Diagnosis remains clinical and supported by exclusion of other causes rather than a positive antibody test [^6341a9bd] [^4df5863d].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have a plan for refractory or atypical cases. If there is no response to appropriate first-line therapy or if the phenotype is atypical, I should re-evaluate the diagnosis, repeat the smear, and pursue bone marrow with cytogenetics and flow cytometry, and consider genetic testing for inherited thrombocytopenia or secondary causes. This stepwise approach minimizes missed diagnoses and avoids prolonged exposure to ineffective or harmful treatments [^be114ce1] [^1a1b083a].

Stand-alone thrombocytopenia with otherwise normal labs is most often due to **immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)** [^2ba610f1], **drug-induced thrombocytopenia** [^90c7cfb2], or **pseudothrombocytopenia** [^6bb0d57a]. Confirm true thrombocytopenia with a **manual smear** [^90c7cfb2] and repeat CBC in citrate to exclude platelet clumping [^6bb0d57a]. If confirmed, obtain **HIV and hepatitis C serologies** [^4df5863d], review medications for agents like heparin [^5f06efb5] or quinine [^57a90f23], and check for **heparin exposure** with a 4Ts score if applicable [^5f06efb5]. Bone marrow biopsy is not routine unless age > 60 [^bae851ba], atypical features, or treatment failure [^1508c449]. Manage based on severity: observe if ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L [^782995a3]; treat if < 30 × 10⁹/L or with bleeding [^bf3c6ca3]; and refer to hematology if persistent, severe, or refractory [^notfound].

---

## Step 1: confirm true thrombocytopenia

- **Repeat CBC**: Verify persistent thrombocytopenia and exclude lab error [^90c7cfb2].
- **Peripheral smear**: Identify platelet clumping (pseudothrombocytopenia) [^6bb0d57a] and assess morphology [^087f0019].
- **Alternative anticoagulant**: If pseudothrombocytopenia is suspected, repeat CBC in citrate or heparinized tubes [^notfound].

---

## Step 2: initial clinical assessment

Obtain a **focused history** covering bleeding symptoms, recent infections, medication use (especially heparin, quinine, antibiotics), alcohol intake, and family history of bleeding or thrombocytopenia [^90c7cfb2]. Perform a **physical examination** for petechiae, bruising, mucosal bleeding, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and signs of liver disease [^90c7cfb2].

---

## Step 3: essential laboratory evaluation

- **HIV and hepatitis C serologies**: Test all adults with isolated thrombocytopenia [^4df5863d].
- **Hepatitis B serology**: If risk factors or abnormal LFTs are present [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune screening**: ANA, anti-dsDNA, and antiphospholipid antibodies if clinical suspicion of SLE or APS [^86a6cbc0].
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Apply 4Ts score [^5f06efb5]; if intermediate/high, stop heparin and send anti-PF4/heparin antibodies [^5f06efb5].

---

## Step 4: additional tests based on clinical suspicion

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Drug-induced thrombocytopenia | - Discontinue suspected drug <br/> - Monitor recovery [^57a90f23] |
| Inherited thrombocytopenia | - Family history <br/> - Genetic testing (e.g. MYH9, WAS, RUNX1) [^1a1b083a] [^c93877e6] |
| Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) | - Bone marrow biopsy if age > 60, atypical features, or treatment failure [^1508c449] [^bae851ba] |
| Thrombotic microangiopathy | - LDH <br/> - Haptoglobin <br/> - Direct antiglobulin test <br/> - ADAMTS13 activity [^c3866631] |

---

## Step 5: management based on severity and etiology

- **Platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L, asymptomatic**: Observation and regular monitoring [^782995a3].
- **Platelet count < 30 × 10⁹/L or symptomatic**: Initiate corticosteroids or IVIG [^bf3c6ca3]; consider TPO receptor agonists if refractory [^be114ce1].
- **HIT**: Stop heparin, start a non-heparin anticoagulant (e.g. argatroban, fondaparinux) [^5f06efb5].
- **Drug-induced thrombocytopenia**: Stop the offending drug and monitor recovery [^57a90f23].

---

## Step 6: follow-up and referral

Arrange **hematology follow-up** within 24–72 hours for newly diagnosed ITP or persistent thrombocytopenia [^c6226f45]. Continue to **monitor platelets** regularly until stable, then at intervals based on severity and etiology [^57a90f23]. Escalate care with **hematology referral** for severe, chronic, or refractory cases, or when malignancy is suspected [^90c7cfb2].

---

Stand-alone thrombocytopenia with otherwise normal labs is most often due to **ITP**, **drug-induced thrombocytopenia**, or **pseudothrombocytopenia**. Confirm with a smear and repeat testing, then pursue targeted labs and management based on severity and etiology, reserving marrow evaluation for atypical or refractory cases [^90c7cfb2].

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

Objectives

Incidental isolated mild to moderate thrombocytopenia is a frequent laboratory finding prompting a referral to pediatric hematology-oncology. We tested the hypothesis that patients with isolated asymptomatic mild thrombocytopenia would not progress to require an intervention from a pediatric hematologist-oncologist.

Methods

This is a 5-year retrospective review of 113 patients referred to pediatric hematology-oncology for isolated thrombocytopenia. Initial, lowest, and current platelet counts along with clinical course and need for interventions were recorded. Thrombocytopenia was categorized as mild (platelet count: 101–140 × 10³/μL), moderate (platelet count: 51–100 × 10³/μL), severe (platelet count: 21–50 × 10³/μL), and very severe (platelet count: ≤ 20 × 10³/μL).

Results

Eight of 48 patients (17%) referred for initial mild isolated thrombocytopenia progressed to moderate thrombocytopenia at 1 visit. At present, 2 of these patients have moderate thrombocytopenia, 17 remain with mild thrombocytopenia, and 29 patients have resolved thrombocytopenia. Nine of 65 patients (14%) referred for moderate thrombocytopenia progressed to severe or very severe thrombocytopenia on 1 occasion. At present, no patients have severe thrombocytopenia, 18 remain with moderate thrombocytopenia, 14 improved to mild thrombocytopenia, and 33 have resolved thrombocytopenia. Only 3 patients required interventions from a hematologist, whereas 10 patients required therapy from other subspecialties.

Conclusions

We only identified 3 patients (3%) with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia who required an intervention from a hematologist to improve platelet counts. Patients with isolated mild thrombocytopenia with a normal bleeding history and physical examination findings frequently have normalized their platelet counts within 1 month.

### Thrombocytopenia [^90c7cfb2]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 × 10³ per µL. It is often discovered incidentally when obtaining a complete blood count during an office visit. The etiology usually is not obvious, and additional investigation is required. Patients with platelet counts greater than 50 × 10³ per µL rarely have symptoms. A platelet count from 30 to 50 × 10³ per µL rarely manifests as purpura. A count from 10 to 30 × 10³ per µL may cause bleeding with minimal trauma. A platelet count less than 5 × 10³ per µL may cause spontaneous bleeding and constitutes a hematologic emergency. Patients who present with thrombocytopenia as part of a multisystem disorder usually are ill and require urgent evaluation and treatment. These patients most likely have an acute infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a hematologic disorder. During pregnancy, preeclampsia and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome are associated with thrombocytopenia. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia commonly have drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudothrombocytopenia, or if pregnant, gestational thrombocytopenia. A history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can differentiate patients who require immediate intervention from those who can be treated in the outpatient setting. Treatment is based on the etiology and, in some cases, treating the secondary cause results in normalization of platelet counts. Consultation with a hematologist should be considered if patients require hospitalization, if there is evidence of systemic disease, or if thrombocytopenia worsens despite initial treatment.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^1a1b083a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

Immune thrombocytopenia in adults with platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L — Recommendation 1b states that in adults with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the panel recommends against corticosteroids and in favor of management with observation (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and it remarks that for patients at the lower end of this threshold, those with additional comorbidities, anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or upcoming procedures, and for elderly patients (> 60 years old), treatment with corticosteroids may be appropriate.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia — screening for asymptomatic thrombosis in isolated HIT: The panel suggests bilateral lower-extremity compression ultrasonography to screen for asymptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in acute isolated HIT; in patients with acute isolated HIT and an upper-extremity central venous catheter (CVC), the panel suggests upper-extremity ultrasonography in the limb with the catheter to screen for asymptomatic DVT and suggests against upper-extremity ultrasonography in limbs without CVCs to screen for asymptomatic DVT; these recommendations do not apply to patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of DVT for whom diagnostic imaging would be indicated.

### Platelet disorders in children: a diagnostic approach [^b23044fa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The investigation of children with suspected inherited platelet disorders is challenging. The causes of mucocutaneous bleeding are many, and specialized testing for platelet disorders can be difficult to access or interpret. An algorithm developed for the investigation of suspected platelet disorders provides a sequential approach to evaluating both platelet function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. Investigation begins with a clinical evaluation and laboratory testing that is generally available, including platelet counting, peripheral blood cell morphology, and aggregometry. Based on results of initial investigations, the algorithm recommends specialized testing for specific diagnoses, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and mutational analysis.

ASH 2019 ITP — Recommendation 1a on initial management: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the panel "suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯)". The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^18dcfa77]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### Increased risk of haematological malignancy in adults over age 60 with thrombocytopenia compared with matched controls: time for an upfront bone marrow evaluation? [^bae851ba]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

International societies have conflicting recommendations on whether bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMB) is needed during workup for isolated thrombocytopenia. Our objective was to determine if thrombocytopenia in patients aged ≥ 60years is associated with an increased incidence of haematological malignancy. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study in patients aged ≥ 60years between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. Exposed patients had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia, with platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L, but normal haemoglobin and white blood cell count. Unexposed patients were those who never had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia and whose platelets were ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of haematological malignancy using a competing risk of death model. During 4.0years (IQR 2.2–6.7) of follow-up, 378/4930 exposed (19.1/1000PY, 95% CI 17.1–21.0), and 204/17556 unexposed patients (2.5/1000PY, 95% CI 2.2–2.8) were diagnosed with haematological malignancy (HR 15.5 (95% CI 11.3–21.4, p < 0.0001) in year 1, and 5.3 (95% CI 4.4–6.6, p < 0.0001) in years 2+). This finding persisted in analyses stratified by sex, age, severity, or duration of thrombocytopenia, and treatment with corticosteroids within 2weeks of consultation. This study found a strong association between isolated thrombocytopenia and haematological malignancy in patients ≥ 60years, supporting consideration of diagnostic testing including BMB during outpatient specialist consultation.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^67364c4d]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Isolated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — treatment duration during platelet count recovery is framed by the panel's view that there is evidence of high thrombotic risk during this period; although some clinicians provide treatment of 4 to 6 weeks, the panel could not agree on a specific duration and therefore provided a minimum (until platelet count recovery) and maximum (< 3 months) duration of treatment, noting that benefits of a longer course are trivial and harms are small.

### Service evaluation of R90 bleeding and platelet disorders gene panel in thrombocytopenia cases [^77393667]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thrombocytopenia is found in a heterogeneous group of bleeding disorders with varying clinical implications. In the paediatric population, a large proportion of patients presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia will be diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is an autoimmune disorder of peripheral platelet destruction. It is classically described as a diagnosis of exclusion; however, genetic testing is not routinely done at presentation. The role of genetic variants in inherited forms of thrombocytopenia has been established in recent years. These genetic aberrations disrupt various pathways involved in platelet production, regulation and function. Consequently, it is crucial to consider genetic testing in the context of isolated thrombocytopenia in the paediatric population to establish an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategies.

The R90 bleeding and platelet disorders gene panel is a resource available to the NHS in England that allows for the assessment of potential genetic aberrations involved in non‐ITP. The panel also includes genes associated with platelet function and factor disorders. Specifically, the R90.1 panel consists of coagulation and platelet disorders WES or medium panel and the R90.2 consists of F5; F11; MYH9; ENG; ACVRL1; F7; F8; F9; F10; VWF, MLPA or equivalent. The current testing criteria include individuals with a bleeding or platelet disorder of likely monogenic aetiology where there are multiple possible causative genes. In our local practice, we suspect inherited thrombocytopenia disorders when patients exhibit persistent thrombocytopenia from early life, have a positive family history, show distinct characteristics typical of inherited conditions and/or fail to respond to first‐line treatments. It was also considered when a patient was not presenting with the typical history, examination and laboratory findings associated with ITP. Investigations that triggered consideration of a potential inherited platelet disorder were mean platelet volume (MPV) or diameter (MPD) when available or when a peripheral film identified an excessive abundance of large platelets. If there was no improvement in platelet counts, or if the response to initial treatments was suboptimal after 3–6 months, we reevaluated the likelihood of an inherited platelet disorder.

### Evaluation of bleeding disorders in the newborn [^1945bbca]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal bleeding disorders may present a diagnostic challenge to the pediatric clinician. Isolated thrombocytopenia rarely presents as a hemorrhagic emergency. Appropriate laboratory testing with incorporation of time of presentation and disease state is crucial to formatting an appropriate differential diagnosis. Deficiencies of certain coagulation proteins coupled with multiple acquired risk factors and/or thrombocytopenia can result in a hemorrhagic emergency in the neonatal period.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia platelet monitoring — key model assumptions (Table 5) specify that platelet count monitoring is intended to identify patients with isolated HIT excluding those initially presenting with HIT-related thrombosis; patients with a moderate or high 4Ts score will have heparin discontinued, an ELISA ordered, and argatroban started, while those with a low 4Ts score will continue heparin; patients with a positive ELISA will have an SRA for confirmation; patients with a positive SRA will continue argatroban and those with a negative SRA will resume heparin prophylaxis assuming 100% sensitivity and specificity of the SRA for HIT; and HIT assay results are available within 24 h of ordering.

### Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in childhood: controversies and solutions [^f76ba39f]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder in patients who are otherwise healthy and present with thrombocytopenia with normal red cells and leukocytes. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion and is in origin heterogeneous. The unknown etiology and the lack of clinical data from controlled prospective studies are reasons for controversies in diagnosis and management. Study endpoints traditionally include the velocity of platelet increase after drug intervention or observation, although a rapid elevation of the platelet count is of questionable clinical value. Evaluation of other endpoints is needed.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — outpatient management threshold at platelet count ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L: In adults with a platelet count of ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests outpatient management rather than hospital admission (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). Remarks add that patients with social concerns, uncertainty about the diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, and more significant mucosal bleeding may benefit from admission to the hospital; patients not admitted to the hospital should receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist, and the need for admission is also highly variable across the range of platelet counts represented (20 × 10⁹/L to 150 × 10⁹/L).

### Impact of baseline thrombocytopenia on early outcomes in patients with acute venous thromboembolism [^d8e13d62]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

A comprehensive evaluation of 90 418 patients with VTE, recruited in RIETE from March 2003 through November 2022, was conducted. Acute PE, with or without accompanying DVT, was the initial presentation in 52 703 patients (58%), while 37 715 subjects (42%) presented with isolated lower‐limb DVT.

3.1 Thrombocytopenia and Patients' Characteristics

Baseline thrombocytopenia was identified in 2.4% of the whole cohort, including 303 patients (0.3%) with severe thrombocytopenia (61 of them had a platelet count < 25 000/μL) and 1882 patients (2.1%) with moderate thrombocytopenia. Patients with severe thrombocytopenia were less likely to present with PE (51% vs. 58%) and more often had active cancer, particularly hematologic malignancies, recent major bleeding, anemia, or a history receiving corticosteroids (Table 1). Moderate thrombocytopenia was more common in men, with higher presence of cancer, chronic thrombocytopenia, anemia, and corticosteroid use compared to those with normal platelet counts.

TABLE 1
Clinical characteristics of the patients, according to platelet count at baseline.

3.2 Therapeutic Interventions

Treatment approaches varied, reflecting the complexity of this clinical scenario (Table S1). Low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) was used as initial therapy in a majority of patients, but those with thrombocytopenia more often received unfractionated heparin (UFH) than patients with normal platelet counts. Among patients treated with LMWH, the use of reduced doses was more frequent in those with thrombocytopenia, reaching 45% of subjects with severe thrombocytopenia who presented as isolated DVT.

Of note, one in every 10 patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and one in every five with platelet counts below 25 000/μL, did not receive initial anticoagulant therapy. Among those patients with severe thrombocytopenia who were not treated, 35% had platelet counts under 25 000/μL. Instead, they more likely underwent nonpharmacological thrombolysis/thrombectomy or underwent a vena cava filter placement, particularly if presenting as PE.

Maternal thrombocytopenia — initial workup is outlined as follows: The differential diagnosis in pregnancy includes gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, pseudothrombocytopenia, viral infection, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and congenital thrombocytopenias. These disorders usually can be determined with a detailed medical and family history and a physical examination, with attention to current medication use, blood pressure, splenomegaly, viral serology, and adjunctive laboratory studies as appropriate, and a complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear generally are indicated in the evaluation of maternal thrombocytopenia; a CBC helps to exclude pancytopenia, evaluation of the peripheral smear serves to rule out platelet clumping that may be a cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy to distinguish between inadequate platelet production and increased destruction generally is not indicated.

### Bleeding severity as an important outcome in childhood immune thrombocytopenia [^5efd2286]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Over the years pediatric hematologists have continued to debate whether pharmacotherapy or clinical observation should be employed as initial management in childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Delineating the fundamental elements of heterogeneity in bleeding manifestations in childhood ITP has proven to be a complicated task. Efforts to classify the impact of hemorrhage in ITP based on platelet count have been problematic. Factors beyond relying on a laboratory measurement as a surrogate marker of disease severity need to be considered. What is needed to better guide therapeutic decision-making is a clinically relevant and evidence-based measure of bleeding severity. In this special supplement, the history of therapeutic management in ITP and prior attempts to grade or quantify hemorrhage will be reviewed.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^8fdb5d81]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The importance of the more primitive hemostatic mechanism stands out in the natural experiments represented by those clinical disorders in which thrombocytopenia is a sufficient cause of bleeding, despite an intact coagulation system. Quite surprisingly, contrary to what is expected, there are clinical situations accompanied by a reduced number of platelets in which thrombosis is also a major factor of morbidity or mortality, posing dramatic management dilemmas (see, for example, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia). Conversely, thrombocytosis may be accompanied by a hemorrhagic tendency as in essential thrombocythemia, whose first denomination was 'hemorrhagic thrombocythemia'. Finally, as detailed in Balduini's review, in a significant proportion of cases with inherited thrombocytopenias an associated impaired platelet function may further aggravate the bleeding tendency. Even worse, in rarer cases, the genetic lesions have impacts beyond thrombopoiesis and thrombocytopenia is just one component of more complex syndromic forms or may herald the future development of hematologic malignancies or bone marrow aplasia or fibrosis, raising ethical dilemmas on how to best inform patients on their condition.

Figure 1 depicts the many inherited and acquired causes that can lead to thrombocytopenia and the main pathogenic mechanisms involved. It is quite evident that a precise diagnosis is essential not only for directing prognosis and treatment, but also for excluding any underlying or associated disorder requiring prompt identification. As Balduini mentions in his review, the prevalence of inherited thrombocytopenias is reported to be as high as more than two cases per 100.000 persons, an order of magnitude similar to that of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Nevertheless, only a very tiny proportion of patients is diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenias at major hematology centers, thus highlighting the under-diagnosis of this pathology. No prevalence data are available for drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, but its diagnosis is very difficult without a high index of suspicion and underdiagnosis is anticipated also for this condition. Indeed, even in expert centers, several cases of isolated thrombocytopenia are initially misdiagnosed as ITP with potentially dangerous consequences.

Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome that presents with isolated thrombocytopenia within the first year of life. Classic diagnostic bone marrow findings reveal absent or significantly decreased megakaryocytes with otherwise normal marrow cellularity. We present a newborn with thrombocytopenia whose initial bone marrow aspirate showed an appropriate number of megakaryocytes. CAMT was subsequently diagnosed after molecular testing demonstrated a mutation in the thrombopoietin receptor. The presence of a normal number of megakaryocytes on an initial bone marrow aspirate should not exclude CAMT from the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia within the first year of life.

Diagnosis rests on careful clinical assessment plus HIT laboratory tests, and for patients with sufficient suspicion it is important to initiate anticoagulation for HIT while awaiting diagnostic laboratory testing results.

### Preliminary laboratory based diagnostic criteria for immune thrombocytopenic purpura: evaluation by multi-center prospective study [^1ecddfb8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We proposed diagnostic criteria for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) by modifying the existing guidelines for diagnosis of ITP and by incorporating laboratory tests found useful for predicting its diagnosis, for example erythrocyte count, leukocyte count, anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, platelet-associated anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, percentage of reticulated platelets, and plasma thrombopoietin.

Objective and Methods

To validate our criteria, we conducted a multi-center prospective study involving 112 patients with thrombocytopenia and a morphologically normal peripheral blood film at the first visit. Each patient underwent a physical examination, routine laboratory tests, and specialized tests for the anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody response and platelet turnover.

Results

Ninety-one patients (81%) satisfied the proposed criteria at first visit. Clinical diagnosis was made by skilled hematologists > 6 months after the first visit; ITP was diagnosed in 88 patients and non-ITP disorders in 24. The proposed criteria had 98% sensitivity, 79% specificity, a 95% positive predictive value, and a 90% negative predictive value. A relatively low specificity appears to be attributed to a few patients who had both ITP and aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

Conclusions

Our preliminary diagnostic criteria based on ITP-associated laboratory findings were useful for the differential diagnosis of ITP, but additional evaluations and modifications will be necessary to develop criteria that can be used routinely.

### How I diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia in geriatric patients [^de4f8842]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia in older individuals is a common but diagnostically challenging condition that has variable clinical impact to those who are affected. Diagnostic approach requires evaluation of the preexisting clinical conditions, detailed review of medications, and assessment for disorders that warrant urgent treatment. In this article, we describe a systematic approach to diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and present a schematic review for management strategies. Three clinical scenarios are presented that are relevant for their prevalence and management challenges in an older adult population. The first scenario addresses primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and reviews different treatment options. The second one addresses complications of thrombocytopenia in management of the myelodysplastic syndrome. The last one reviews diagnostic challenges of drug-induced ITP.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^b43f6486]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Evaluating the child with purpura [^e0ca6aa5]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Purpura is the result of hemorrhage into the skin or mucosal membrane. It may represent a relatively benign condition or herald the presence of a serious underlying disorder. Purpura may be secondary to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, coagulation factor deficiency or vascular defect. Investigation to confirm a diagnosis or to seek reassurance is important. Frequently, the diagnosis can be established on the basis of a careful history and physical examination, and a few key laboratory tests. Indicated tests include a complete blood cell count with platelet count, a peripheral blood smear, and prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times.

4 Discussion

Our comprehensive analysis of VTE outcomes in patients with thrombocytopenia provides significant insights that challenge and expand upon the existing paradigms of VTE management. The heightened risk of early fatal PE, major bleeding, and recurrent VTE in patients with baseline thrombocytopenia, especially in those presenting with acute PE, emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach to their care. Current guidelines generally suggest conservative management strategies, particularly in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, focused on reducing bleeding risks. However, our data suggest that such strategies might need to be carefully balanced with the risk of thrombotic events. In our study, PE patients had significantly worse outcomes in the presence of thrombocytopenia than those presenting with isolated DVT. This was particularly notable in the marked differences in fatality and major bleeding rates, suggesting that the physiological burden of PE exacerbates the risks imposed by thrombocytopenia. On the other hand, the higher risk of bleeding could also be related with a more intense anticoagulant therapy compared to patients with isolated DVT. For patients presenting with PE, there might be a need to prioritize interventions that allow a rapid stabilization and thorough monitoring. In contrast, the impact of thrombocytopenia was less pronounced in DVT patients, justifying a distinct management strategy for PE versus isolated DVT. DVT patients might benefit from a more conservative approach, focusing on preventing progression and recurrence of thrombosis while minimizing bleeding risks.

Our findings not only reveal the influence of initial VTE presentation on outcomes but also show an unexpected similarity in the risk profiles between severe and moderate thrombocytopenia. Traditionally, severe thrombocytopenia has been associated with a higher risk of bleeding and adverse outcomes. However, our study shows that moderate thrombocytopenia poses similar risks of fatal PE, major bleeding, and recurrent VTE. This finding challenges existing perceptions and suggests that the threshold for high‐risk thrombocytopenia may need reevaluation. In patients with chemotherapy‐induced thrombocytopenia, the platelet count may further decrease in the following days. Consequently, moderate thrombocytopenia might signal impending lower counts. On the other hand, despite adjustments, thrombocytopenia at any level may simply indicate overall patient severity. Nevertheless, our results indicate that even moderate reductions in platelet count can be clinically significant and warrant active management similar to those with severe thrombocytopenia.

### Clinical management, ethics and informed consent related to multi-gene panel-based high throughput sequencing testing for platelet disorders: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^c93877e6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

An HTS gene panel test designed using the ISTH‐curated genes 1 contains more than 35 genes known to cause thrombocytopenia. Genetic variants in these genes have also been identified in patients with low platelet counts that were initially treated for immune thrombocytopenia. 12 Therefore, if thrombocytopenia is detected in a patient with a positive family history, a gene panel test may be useful to provide a correct diagnosis and prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments such as a splenectomy. Some thrombocytopenia genes are also known risk factors for leukemia. 15, 16 Germline genetic defects in RUNX1, ETV6, and ANKRD26 can predispose to hematologic malignancies with an estimated lifetime risk of about 45%, 30%, and 4.9%, respectively. 17 WAS variants are associated with increased risk of lymphoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplasia, and myeloproliferative disorders with a prevalence of approximately 13%. 18 An accurate molecular diagnosis of patients with these genetic defects can improve our understanding of these diseases and may improve cancer risk predictions, which will ultimately benefit patients and their families in future generations. Today, the knowledge of these genetic predispositions to malignancy informs clinicians of the need to perform regular hematological evaluations and to provide family counseling. If allogenic bone marrow transplantation is required in a leukemic patient who has a germline risk variant, a genetic test in any potential donor family members is highly recommended because some affected individuals may be asymptomatic with borderline normal platelet counts. Moreover, if genetic studies for these genes have never been undertaken, there is a risk that a leukemic patient will receive stem cells from an affected family donor with a variant in such gene. A molecular diagnosis in some other thrombocytopenia genes can also provide prognostic information for the development of specific symptoms with age. For patients with macrothrombocytopenia, a pathogenic variant in MYH9 or DIAPH1 can result in hearing loss and, for MYH9, also in kidney failure. 19, 20 For MYH9, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications can reduce the risk of progression to renal failure. Some initial genotype‐phenotype relations are known for MYH9 and it is accepted that some MYH9 variants do result in more severe phenotypes than others. 19 For specific inherited thrombocytopenias with defects in MYH9, WAS, ANKRD26, DIAPH1, and monoallelic GP1BA/GP1BB, a patient's platelet count can be raised by supplying THPO‐receptor agonists, such as eltrombopag and romiplostim. 21, 22, 23 Variants in FERMT3, WAS, MECOM, and MPL can result in severe immune disease, pancytopenia, or bone marrow failure that often requires bone marrow transplantation. 24, 25, 26 Early initiation of donor search and stem cell transplantation can prevent immunization by repeated transfusions because of progressive bone marrow failure. In contrast, thrombocytopenia with bone marrow failure from biallelic THPO variants does not respond to bone marrow transplantation and is treatable with romiplostim. 27 Finally, KDSR ‐related thrombocytopenia appears to improve with age. 28 An HTS test can provide similar important prognostic information for patients with Hermansky Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Ten different genes cause HPS that include a variable degree of bleeding, delta storage pool disease, and oculocutaneous albinism, but only HPS1, HPS4, and AP3B1 defects can cause pulmonary fibrosis, 29, 30 HPS1 and HPS4 defect can also cause kidney disease and colitis 31 and only pathogenic variants in AP3B1 and AP3D1 are associated with immune disease. 30, 32

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^aa52a5c6]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the immune thrombocytopenia is secondary to a subclinical viral infection?

Multiple viruses have been associated with ITP. In children, ITP is often thought to be a post-infectious sequela. There may also be an underlying viral disease which is asymptomatic and thus eludes detection. It remains unclear whether all patients with ITP should be screened for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus; with the coronavirus pandemic, it might be appropriate to screen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Treatment of these three viral infections would alter ITP management. The primary treatment for both hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus would likely increase the platelet count. However, if hepatitis C has progressed to cirrhosis, the platelet effects of antiviral treatment may be limited. Another viral infection that could be subclinical is cytomegalovirus which might be revealed only by atypical lymphocytes and/or mildly elevated liver tests. Cytomegalovirus can worsen ITP in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments because these agents will activate the cytomegalovirus and thus worsen the ITP making it more resistant to treatment. Helicobacter pylori may "cause" ITP, but only in certain places, e.g. Japan and Italy, is searching for it at diagnosis of ITP routine and is its eradication a uniformly effective approach to ITP.

A good practice statement specifies that the treating physician should ensure that the patient is adequately monitored for potential corticosteroid side effects and should conduct an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (depression, fatigue, mental status, etc) while patients are receiving corticosteroids.

### Immune or inherited thrombocytopenia? A population-based cohort study on children and adolescents presenting with a low platelet count [^b50cb89e]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding in children and adolescents. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common cause of this finding, but the differential diagnosis includes a growing list of genetic disorders. We aimed to report differences in phenotypes of patients with ITP, inherited platelet disorder (IPD)/primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID), and other causes, with a focus on differentiating ITP from inherited thrombocytopenia.

Procedure

This retrospective, population-based observational cohort from 2006 to 2020 involved 506 Finnish children under 16 years of age presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia.

Results

Of the 506 participants, 79.7% had ITP, 6.7% had IPD/PID, and 13.6% had other causes of thrombocytopenia. A platelet count of ≤ 12 × 10⁹/L best distinguished between ITP and other reasons with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 80%. Among patients with the lowest platelet count of less than 10 × 10⁹/L, 95.9% had ITP, 3.3% had IPD/PID, and 0.8% had other causes. Severe bleeding events were reported in 20 patients (4.0%), but there were no cases of intracranial or fatal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Up to 50% of patients with a high suspicion of inherited thrombocytopenia remained without a specific diagnosis despite genetic testing.

Conclusions

ITP remains the most common cause of thrombocytopenia. A platelet count of ≤ 12 × 10⁹/L often leads to an ITP diagnosis. Genetic disorders are rare but should be suspected in patients with persisting thrombocytopenia, especially with platelet counts constantly above 12 × 10⁹/L, a positive family history, or atypical clinical features.

Data Extraction and Data Synthesis

Based on the literature review, an algorithm for platelet testing was developed.

Conclusions

A history of mucocutaneous bleeding often indicates abnormal platelet function that can be associated with a normal, increased, or decreased platelet count. Multiple laboratory procedures can now be used to determine the underlying pathologic condition of platelet dysfunction when other deficiencies or defects of the coagulation cascade or fibrinolysis are ruled out. Simple procedures, such as platelet count, peripheral blood smear, and a platelet function screening test, will often lead the investigator to more specific analyses. Although platelet function testing is often limited to larger medical centers with highly trained technologists, newer technologies are being developed to simplify current procedures and make platelet function testing more accessible. This review provides an algorithm for platelet testing that may be of benefit to pathologists and physicians who deal with hemostatic disorders.

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018? [^6341a9bd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed, (2) current test methods need to be improved, or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

### A benchmark for platelet count monitoring with low-molecular-weight heparin: expanding implementation of national patient safety goals [^3f9f3f79]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Practitioners in US hospitals are implementing anticoagulation dosing and monitoring protocols to improve the safety of anticoagulation, consistent with National Patient Safety Goal 03.05.01. An audit of the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database of patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at the University Medical Center Utrecht revealed low compliance with platelet count monitoring as well as initial management of suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Limitations to this work included the inability to exclude other drug-induced causes of thrombocytopenia and their definition of the frequency of platelet count monitoring for compliance in patients given venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Despite these limitations, the authors' work represents the first published report on extending the quality of heparin anticoagulation management to platelet count monitoring and evaluation for HIT in a large patient population. Clinicians should include evaluations of compliance with platelet count monitoring with unfractionated heparin and LMWH, as well as appropriateness of the initial management strategies for HIT, and direct thrombin inhibitor protocols in their patient safety practice assessments.

### An unusual cause of mismanagement in an acute myocardial infarction case: pseudothrombocytopenia [^6bb0d57a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia determined by an automated counter may represent a benign, incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient or a potentially life-threatening disorder. Even if the low platelet count actually is a benign condition itself, in some conditions, any delay resulting from this condition consequently may be seriously hazardous. Low platelet count may alter the decision of heparin administration, which is an essential part of management during acute coronary syndromes. EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia (PTCP) is reported to have a prevalence of 0.1% in a general hospital; however, it is also reported that around 15% of the patients referred for a specialized center for isolated thrombocytopenia are actually cases of PTCP. In this report, we describe a patient with PTCP who could not receive reperfusion therapy during acute myocardial infarction because of the low platelet counts reported by an automated counter.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^b928553b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common hematologic disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP presents as a primary or a secondary form. ITP may affect individuals of all ages, with peaks during childhood and in the elderly, in whom the age-specific incidence of ITP is greatest. Bleeding is the most common clinical manifestation of ITP. The pathogenesis of ITP is complex, involving alterations in humoral and cellular immunity. Corticosteroids remain the most common first line therapy for ITP. This article summarizes the classification and diagnosis of primary and secondary ITP, as well as the pathogenesis and options for treatment.

### Perioperative thrombocytopenia: evidence, evaluation, and emerging therapies [^c1cc8799]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

### Initial laboratory findings useful for predicting the diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [^c872ece3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify initial laboratory findings useful for the later diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adult patients with thrombocytopenia.

Subjects and Methods

We studied 62 consecutive adult patients who had thrombocytopenia and whose peripheral blood film was normal except for thrombocytopenia at presentation. Each patient underwent physical examination and routine laboratory tests and was prospectively followed for 22.5 ± 9.8 months (range, 8 to 41 months). The frequency of antiglycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, the presence of platelet-associated and plasma anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, the percentage of reticulated platelets, and the plasma thrombopoietin level were examined at the first visit. The final diagnosis was based on the clinical history, physical examination, complete blood test, bone marrow findings, and the clinical course at last observation.

Results

Forty-six patients were diagnosed as having ITP and 16 as having another disorder, including myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and reduced platelet production, with or without other cytopenias, and without dysplasia or evidence for destruction. Six initial laboratory findings discriminated ITP from other diagnoses: the absence of anemia, absence of leukocytopenia, increased frequency of anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, increased platelet-associated anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, elevated percentage of reticulated platelets, and a normal or slightly increased plasma thrombopoietin level. Three or more of these ITP-associated findings were found at presentation in 44 patients (96%) with thrombocytopenia later diagnosed as ITP, compared with only 1 patient (6%) whose disorder was non-ITP.

Conclusion

Initial laboratory findings can well predict future diagnosis of ITP. Further studies prospectively evaluating these same diagnostic criteria on another, independent set of patients are necessary.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### Traditional and new approaches to the management of immune thrombocytopenia: issues of when and who to treat [^180caf14]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and management of chronic ITP requires experience and the appropriate use of the laboratory despite the absence of a diagnostic test for ITP. Consideration of secondary ITP is important because identification of immunodeficiency infections or of lymphoproliferative disorders would change the management approach to a given patient. The development of newer therapies such as rituximab and the thrombopoietic agents has had a major impact on the management of ITP. In the future, combinations of agents may be a critical approach although the schedule and dosing remains difficult to establish. Finally, current studies to augment therapy in newly diagnosed ITP patients to prevent chronic disease may lessen the number of patients in chronic disease category.

Post-travel evaluation — further laboratory testing — diagnostic testing in returning travelers should be based on the differential diagnosis, and travelers with undifferentiated fever after visiting a malaria-endemic country within the prior year should have malaria testing results available urgently, ideally within a few hours. Conventional testing for malaria should be repeated 2 or 3 times over the first 24–48 hours; nucleic acid amplification tests are more sensitive and do not need to be repeated but are not commonly available in the United States. Blood cultures should be taken, enteric fever is almost always diagnosed by appropriate blood culture, and isolation of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi is essential due to increasingly common antimicrobial resistance. Arbovirus infections are best diagnosed by RT-PCR in the acute febrile phase (a dengue rapid antigen test is also reliable); rickettsioses and leptospirosis are typically diagnosed by serology, but acute serology is not highly sensitive or specific; HIV testing should be offered to all febrile patients. When routine testing fails to yield a diagnosis, storing extra tubes of serum or whole blood for paired antibody detection or nucleic acid testing is often helpful, and respiratory specimens for a multiplex PCR respiratory virus panel should be considered in all patients with fever, coryza, and myalgia. A complete blood count with differential can detect anemia, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia is often present in dengue, malaria, and acute HIV and the total white cell count is often low or normal in malaria, dengue, and enteric fever. A complete metabolic profile, including creatinine, urea, liver enzymes, blood glucose, and coagulation screen, is frequently useful, and the risk to laboratory workers is very low, so delaying these tests is rarely indicated.

Definition of terms in 2019 ASH guideline on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — standardized thresholds for responses, disease phases, and bleeding severity are specified. Corticosteroid-dependent is defined as ongoing need for continuous prednisone > 6 mg/d (or corticosteroid equivalent) or frequent corticosteroid courses to maintain a platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and/or to avoid bleeding. Response categories include durable response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling of the baseline count at 6 mo), early response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 wk), and initial response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 mo). Disease duration terms are newly diagnosed ITP (ITP duration of < 3 mo), persistent ITP (ITP duration of 3–12 mo), and chronic ITP (ITP duration of ≥ 12 mo), and remission is platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L at 12 mo. Bleeding severity includes major bleeding defined as (1) WHO grade 3 or 4 bleeding, (2) Buchanan severe grade, (3) Bolton-Maggs and Moon "major bleeding", (4) IBLS grade 2 or higher, or (5) life-threatening or intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding, whereas minor bleeding is any bleeding not meeting the criteria for "major bleeding".

### Thrombocytopenia and fever: not just another infection… [^8b6e3fdb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a high-grade, aggressive disease that typically presents with widespread lymphadenopathy and active 'B' symptoms, making it easy to recognise and manage. However, a small proportion of patients can present with no evidence of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, with the disease confined to the bone marrow; this presentation is also known as 'Primary Bone Marrow DLBCL'. Subsequently, diagnosis can be a challenge, resulting in delayed treatment and an overall poorer prognosis. Given the rarity of this disease, we wished to describe a patient who presented initially with fevers associated with isolated thrombocytopenia and was later diagnosed with this condition. Unfortunately, due to the aggressive nature of this disease, subsequent treatment was unsuccessful. Overall, we felt that in future cases of fevers with thrombocytopenia, clinicians should include this rare lymphoma subtype as part of the differential diagnosis, as early identification and treatment can be associated with a favourable outcome.

Grading of recommendations — interpretation of strong versus conditional: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has defined interpretations. For patients, strong means most individuals would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas conditional means the majority would want the suggested course of action but many would not and decision aids may be useful. For clinicians, strong means most individuals should follow the recommended course of action, while conditional indicates different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^5958fcb1]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

An important cause of thrombocytopenia in elderly patients is myelodysplastic syndrome. A bone marrow examination is necessary to diagnose this condition. Typically, marrow will be hyperplastic, but marrow cells will be undergoing apoptosis and not producing mature blood cells and reveal dyspoiesis. Diagnostics have improved remarkably as has clinical discrimination of different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome. Nonetheless. cases of myelodysplastic syndrome early in their evolution may be difficult to distinguish from "difficult" ITP.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a possibility since older patients may be taking more medications. Limited laboratory testing is available to demonstrate that thrombocytopenia is drug-induced. Diagnosis generally relies on recognizing medications likely to cause thrombocytopenia; one approach is to change medications if any are newly initiated. Viral infections could also occur in this population e.g. hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus.

Patients over the age of 60 are thought to have a higher likelihood of fatal and non-fatal serious bleeding compared to younger patients ;77–79 recent studies of intracranial hemorrhage have supported earlier findings demonstrating a higher risk in those above 60 years of age. Thus, it may be appropriate to pursue an aggressive approach in this patient, such as the addition of IVIG to steroids.

Which second-line treatment is optimal for a 63-year-old male?

Rituximab in an older male

In this case of ITP, the older man has a reasonable likelihood of a response but, even if he responds well, his response will very likely last only 6–12 months. The chance of a long-term (> 1 year) response is low. Furthermore, as discussed previously, after rituximab it would not be possible to vaccinate the patient against SARS-CoV-2, which is important since this 63-year-old is in a high-risk group and would benefit from boosters. As indicated, there is a 10–20% possibility of developing significant hypogammaglobulinemia when the combination of dexamethasone with rituximab is used. A good initial response followed by the expected relapse would allow rituximab to be reused, but it remains unlikely to lead to a cureand the probability of hypogammaglobulinemia occurring is thought to increase with repeated use.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^7ef399cc]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

On the other hand, in patients with very low platelet counts or modestly low platelet counts along with bleeding, glucocorticoid is the first-line therapy. Arnal et al studied 59 patients with SLE with thrombocytopenia, who were treated at five French centres. Of these 59 patients, 57 received oral glucocorticoid as first and sole therapy; and of these, 50 were evaluated long term (the remaining 9 received some other therapy in addition to glucocorticoid and were excluded from the evaluation). Of these 50, 40 had an acute response to glucocorticoid therapy that resulted in a rise in the platelet count. However, only 11 had a sustained response in mean follow-up of 78 months. Also, 8 of these 11 patients had normal platelet counts and were free from therapy after an average of 13 months of glucocorticoid therapy. Thus, the sustained remission rate was low (22%), and ultimately, 78% of the patients were classified as long-term failures. In this same study, 10 patients were treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone with an initial response rate of 60%; however, no patient had a sustained response, although one patient with a sustained response has been reported. Thus, oral or high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids produce a response in the majority of patients initially, but sustained response to this therapy is unlikely. Nonetheless, this therapy may be extremely useful in the patient with severe thrombocytopenia.

### Platelet count monitoring and laboratory testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^ef41a9e3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated adverse drug reaction that paradoxically is associated with a brief but dramatically increased risk for thrombosis (transient acquired thrombophilia). The objective of this article is to provide practical recommendations for platelet count monitoring in patients receiving heparin, as well as for selection of laboratory assays to detect pathogenic HIT antibodies.

Study Selection

Relevant literature that focused on frequency and timing of HIT in various clinical settings and that dealt with laboratory testing for HIT antibodies was critically appraised.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The author prepared a preliminary manuscript including recommendations that was presented to participants at the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia (November 10, 2001). Support of at least 70% of conference participants was required for recommendations to be adopted.

Conclusions

The risk of immune HIT varies depending on the type of heparin (unfractionated heparin greater than low-molecular-weight heparin) and patient population (surgical greater than medical). Thus, the intensity of platelet count monitoring should be stratified depending on the clinical situation. Platelet count monitoring should focus on the period of highest risk (usually days 5 to 10 after starting heparin) and should use an appropriate platelet count baseline (generally, the highest platelet count beginning 4 days after start of heparin). However, earlier platelet count monitoring is appropriate if the patient received heparin within the past 100 days, as already circulating HIT antibodies can cause rapid-onset HIT with heparin reexposure. Although both antigen and (washed platelet) activation assays are very sensitive for detecting clinically significant HIT antibodies, activation assays have greater diagnostic specificity for clinical HIT.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management… [^57a90f23]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Inpatient Evaluation The urgency for evaluating thrombocytopenia is dependent on severity and associated symptoms. Thrombocytopenia requires hospitalization and immediate evaluation if any of the following red flag findings are present: major bleeding, platelet count less than 10 × 10³ per μL, evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear, new neurologic or renal dysfunction, recent exposure to heparin products, associated coagulation abnormalities, or vascular findings. Patients with concomitant life-threatening hemorrhage, anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, or other associated severe illnesses also warrant urgent hospitalization. FOLLOW-UP LABORATORY TESTING Individuals with newly diagnosed mild or moderate thrombocytopenia without red flag findings should have their platelet counts repeated at intervals.

Testing should occur in one to two weeks for patients with moderate thrombocytopenia and in four to six weeks for those with mild thrombocytopenia. Patients with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology or decreasing platelet counts should be referred to hematology. Patients with stable chronic thrombocytopenia associated with specific medical conditions do not require increased platelet surveillance or immediate hematology consultation without other complications. 13–17 A comprehensive list of all case reports of DIT is available at https: //ouhsc. edu/platelets/ditp. html, 20andcommonlyencounteredmedicationsarelistedinTable2.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^be114ce1]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if none of the obvious options (thrombopoietin agents, rituximab, splenectomy) helps and no single treatment, including fostamatinib and mycophenolate mofetil is effective?

It is difficult to predict what approach will be effective in these "refractory" patients. If a patient has been on too low a dose or for too short a period, it may not be clear that a given medication will not be helpful.

The approach to difficult-to-treat patients, such as these examples, is discussed at great length in our review of refractory ITP and in another recent review. The major principles are: (i) spend time reconfirming the diagnosis; reconsider all options if response to treatments of ITP is absent or very limited: (ii) do a complete bone marrow examination, unless one was performed recently, with aspirate, biopsy, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics; (iii) if a treatment is ineffective, continue the treatment and add another treatment initiating combination therapy. In our opinion, this is preferable to discontinuing the ineffective treatment and starting another one; (iv) if indeed the case is refractory ITP, combination approaches are often better than single treatments. Including treatments with different mechanisms of effect is useful; however, there are situations in which two agents targeting the same mechanism are effective such as combining IVIG and IV anti-D; and (v) when using combination treatments, it would be ideal to not give maximum doses and to select agents with differing toxicities. If an adverse event requiring a change in treatment occurs, it is then easier to choose the agent to stop and/or replace. In our review of published reports, a TPO agent was often a crucial component of combination treatments.

In difficult patients, the inability to define the pathogenesis in most cases makes the treatment selection blind. Fortunately, multiply refractory patients for whom no treatment seems to bring their platelet count up at all are very rare. More commonly at least one treatment will transiently increase the platelet count. This minimizes the chance of serious bleeding and creates an approach for ongoing management, although continued steroid overuse must be avoided.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^298294c4]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Type 2 von Willebrand disease (VWD) — platelet-dependent VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio cutoff: The panel suggests against a platelet-dependent VWF activity/VWF:Ag ratio cutoff of < 0.5 and supports use of a higher cutoff of < 0.7 for patients with an abnormal initial VWD screen (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence from diagnostic accuracy studies). The pooled sensitivity for the higher cutoff of < 0.7 was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94) compared with 0.58 to 0.79 for < 0.5, and specificity was assumed to be 100% for < 0.5. The false-negative rate was much higher for the < 0.5 cutoff than the < 0.7 cutoff, and some patients with type 2 VWD have normal VWF:Ag and platelet-dependent VWF activity but a low ratio of platelet-dependent VWF activity/VWF:Ag.

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^19181883]. Blood (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for immune thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to patients with HCV-associated ITP, ASH 2011 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antiviral therapy in patients with secondary ITP due to hepatitis C. Closely monitor the platelet in patients treated with interferon, owing to a risk of worsening thrombocytopenia.

Adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L — evidence summary reports that there were no studies directly comparing corticosteroids with observation in this population; evidence came from 2 RCTs and 1 prospective study for corticosteroids and 2 retrospective studies for observation, there were no data on response at 7 days for the observation arm, remission was 71.7% with observation versus 29.3% with corticosteroids but was not considered in benefits because the mean platelet count in the observation studies was over 80 × 10⁹/L, major bleeding was low with no difference (0.9% for corticosteroids and 0% for observation), there were no data on HRQoL, overall the panel judged the potential benefits to be unknown, and undesirable effects of corticosteroids were considered moderate based on indirect evidence.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^6e6291e1]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) corticosteroid duration — adults: The guideline panel recommends against a prolonged course (> 6 weeks including treatment and taper) of prednisone and in favor of a short course (≤ 6 weeks) as initial treatment, issuing a strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence. Evidence review found no usable comparative ITP data because no studies had data on short courses of prednisone. Based on clinical experience, the panel agreed there was likely trivial benefit in continuing corticosteroids beyond 6 weeks; for the majority of patients, a visit 6 weeks after starting corticosteroids should determine remission versus need for additional therapy, and for patients who require additional therapy, consideration of alternative therapy is preferred over ongoing exposure to corticosteroids. The panel also agreed the risk of harm was large with courses > 6 weeks and acknowledged that 6 weeks is not evidence based but represents a reasonable duration to permit a standard maximum 21 days of treatment plus taper.
