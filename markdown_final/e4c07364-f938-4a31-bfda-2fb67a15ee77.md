## Question

Alternative antibiotics to peniccilin allegies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting alternative antibiotics in patients labeled as penicillin-allergic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how often the penicillin allergy label is accurate and what features lower that likelihood. Then, I should verify how to risk stratify the reported reaction using validated tools. Next, I will examine delabeling strategies tailored to risk, followed by choosing safe β-lactam alternatives based on side-chain structures and cross-reactivity. After that, I need to confirm the exceptions where all β-lactams should be avoided, outline non–β-lactam options when truly necessary, integrate antibiotic stewardship outcomes, and finally consider special populations like pregnancy, surgical prophylaxis, and pediatrics before summarizing a pragmatic decision algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the baseline premise: most penicillin allergy labels are inaccurate, and many patients can safely receive penicillins after proper evaluation. Wait, I should verify the magnitude of mislabeling and the role of time since reaction; contemporary data show that only a small fraction of labeled patients react on direct provocation and that IgE sensitization wanes with time, supporting delabeling efforts and explaining why remote childhood reactions often no longer persist, with large cohorts showing very low serious reaction rates on challenge and evidence of loss of specific IgE over several years [^1151izqc] [^112CRMFf] [^113crxza].

> Next, I should risk stratify the clinical history, and I need to ensure I use a validated, practical tool. The PEN-FAST decision rule reliably identifies low-risk patients in whom formal skin testing is not required prior to an oral challenge; scores 0–2 indicate less than 5% risk of true allergy, while 4–5 suggests high risk, guiding whether to proceed directly to challenge or to perform skin testing and supervised provocation later; importantly, histories inconsistent with allergy such as isolated headache, diarrhea, or family history should not trigger testing or avoidance in the first place, which I should double-check each time I review an allergy list [^115gvBEc] [^117RcH4t].

> For low-risk patients, I should confirm that a direct oral amoxicillin challenge is the preferred and safe delabeling strategy. Hold on, let me verify the safety signal and guideline alignment; AAAAI supports direct amoxicillin challenge in adults with distant, benign cutaneous reactions, and large prospective cohorts show that direct drug provocation testing without prior skin tests in carefully selected low-risk adults is extremely safe, with negligible rates of serious reactions and a tiny proportion of likely IgE-mediated events, enabling rapid delabeling in the ED, clinic, or pharmacy-led settings [^115HSywW] [^1151izqc] [^1155cqDA].

> For higher-risk histories, I should confirm when to pursue penicillin skin testing and supervised challenge and when to refer. I will now examine the parameter updates: patients with a history of anaphylaxis or recent likely IgE-mediated reactions should undergo penicillin skin testing followed by challenge if negative, whereas I initially thought cephalosporins should be avoided after penicillin anaphylaxis — wait, that is outdated; AAAAI now allows administering a cephalosporin with a structurally dissimilar R1 side chain even in penicillin anaphylaxis without additional precautions, and aztreonam and carbapenems can also be considered without prior testing in many scenarios, though allergist involvement is prudent if history suggests severe reactions [^1135ZxjZ] [^116QU3xv] [^116jHpS8] [^114cHE93] [^113xhrcn].

> Now, if a true penicillin allergy is confirmed and a β-lactam is still preferred, I need to ensure I choose agents with minimal cross-reactivity driven by dissimilar R1 side chains rather than the β-lactam ring. Let me verify exemplars: cefazolin has unique side chains and has near-zero clinically meaningful cross-reactivity with penicillins, with meta-analytic data showing extremely low dual allergy rates, and ceftriaxone and cefuroxime similarly do not share aminopenicillin side chains, supporting their safe use in most penicillin-allergic patients, particularly when the history is non-severe or unverified, consistent with AAAAI guidance on side-chain–dissimilar cephalosporins and direct challenges when appropriate [^114s5deF] [^116QU3xv] [^117U3K23] [^116jHpS8].

> I should also confirm non-penicillin β-lactams beyond cephalosporins. Aztreonam is structurally distinct and generally safe to administer in penicillin-allergic patients without prior testing, and carbapenems have very low rates of cross-reactivity; a systematic review estimates around 2.4% for possible IgE-mediated reactions, and contemporary practice parameters endorse routine administration without additional precautions in most penicillin-allergic patients, though I need to remain vigilant for any history suggesting severe delayed hypersensitivity [^114cHE93] [^113RYC9R] [^113xhrcn].

> But wait, I must not overlook the exceptions where avoiding all β-lactams is advised. Severe T cell–mediated delayed reactions such as SJS/TEN, DRESS, serum sickness–like reactions, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis, and hemolytic anemia warrant broad β-lactam avoidance, including cephalosporins, carbapenems, and aztreonam, because cross-reactivity patterns are unpredictable and potentially life-threatening; this is a critical safety checkpoint that I should double-check in every history [^116QU3xv] [^115jhoxq] [^114FqJSb].

> If I must select non–β-lactam alternatives, I need to ensure I choose the narrowest effective option and acknowledge trade-offs. Clindamycin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and aminoglycosides should be reserved for indications where they are truly necessary because their use, often driven by spurious penicillin allergy labels, is associated with higher risks of C. difficile, MRSA, VRE, and inferior outcomes compared with β-lactams; careful selection and stewardship can mitigate these harms, but the better solution is delabeling when safe [^117LycsR] [^113DLCHE] [^116nTYfo].

> Next, I should review stewardship strategies and expected impacts to confirm system-level benefits of penicillin allergy evaluation. Implementation of risk-stratified protocols, EMR decision support, and pharmacist- or clinician-led test-dose pathways consistently increases first-line penicillin and cephalosporin use without safety signals while reducing vancomycin, carbapenems, and aztreonam utilization and cutting costs, which I should consider when advocating institutional policies and order sets [^1155cqDA] [^114KWFz9] [^1159BhYZ].

> Special populations now demand attention; let me consider pregnancy. For GBS prophylaxis and peripartum infections, β-lactams remain preferred, and cefazolin is first-line in most penicillin-allergic patients without severe delayed reactions, whereas penicillin testing is both feasible and underutilized in pregnancy, enabling more targeted prophylaxis and improving neonatal processes of care; I should confirm risk stratification and consider referral for testing during pregnancy when feasible [^113RxJV8] [^114mFugh] [^112bGYXM].

> For surgical prophylaxis, I should double-check that cefazolin remains the drug of choice even in many labeled patients. Multiple stewardship interventions demonstrate large, safe increases in cefazolin use among penicillin-labeled patients with concomitant reductions in clindamycin and gentamicin and no increase in severe allergic events; meta-analytic data indicate the frequency of true dual allergy to natural penicillins and cefazolin is extremely low, so avoiding cefazolin purely due to a penicillin label is usually not justified unless there is a severe delayed reaction history [^1159BhYZ] [^114KWFz9] [^114s5deF].

> In pediatrics, let me verify whether the approach mirrors adults. The same principles apply: most children with reported penicillin allergy are not truly allergic, and risk-based direct oral challenges safely delabel the majority, reducing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing and preserving first-line amoxicillin for common infections, which I should reinforce in pediatric ED and outpatient protocols [^115XQx9g] [^115A4rda].

> Summarizing a decision pathway, I should confirm each step: clarify whether the reported event is compatible with allergy and remove labels when histories are inconsistent; use PEN-FAST to stratify risk; perform direct oral amoxicillin challenges for low-risk cases to delabel efficiently; perform penicillin skin testing followed by supervised challenge for higher-risk histories; if true IgE-mediated allergy is confirmed, preferentially choose β-lactams with dissimilar side chains such as cefazolin or ceftriaxone, or consider aztreonam or carbapenems when indicated; avoid all β-lactams in severe delayed reactions; and reserve non–β-lactam agents for scenarios where they are truly necessary, documenting the rationale and updating the allergy record meticulously at every step [^115gvBEc] [^115HSywW] [^116QU3xv].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure we remember that the optimal "alternative" for most patients with a penicillin allergy label is to remove the label through risk-stratified evaluation and direct challenge when appropriate; when true allergy exists, cefazolin and ceftriaxone are the preferred β-lactam alternatives for most indications due to their unique side chains and near-zero cross-reactivity, which improves outcomes and stewardship metrics without compromising safety [^1155cqDA] [^114s5deF].

For patients with penicillin allergy, **cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains** (e.g. cefazolin, ceftriaxone) [^114s5deF] are safe for most patients, including those with prior anaphylaxis [^116QU3xv], except in severe delayed reactions [^114FqJSb]. Carbapenems and aztreonam can be used **without prior testing** [^113xhrcn] [^114cHE93]. Select non–beta-lactam options — macrolides, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides — based on infection and susceptibility. Avoid cephalosporins with similar side chains in severe delayed reactions; use clindamycin and fluoroquinolones cautiously due to C. difficile and resistance risks [^117LycsR] [^113DLCHE]. Risk stratification and allergy testing enable **safe beta-lactam use** and reduce adverse outcomes [^1155cqDA] [^113iEb6p].

---

## Beta-lactam alternatives

### Cephalosporins

- **Cross-reactivity**: Low (≤ 2%) with penicillins; higher with similar side chains [^116QU3xv].
- **Safe options**: Cefazolin and ceftriaxone (dissimilar side chains) [^116QU3xv] are safe even after penicillin anaphylaxis, except in severe delayed reactions [^114FqJSb].
- **Avoid**: Cephalosporins with similar side chains in severe delayed reactions (e.g. SJS, TEN, DRESS).

---

### Carbapenems

Carbapenems have **very low cross-reactivity** (< 1%) [^113RYC9R] with penicillins, and agents such as meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, and doripenem can be given without prior testing [^113xhrcn].

---

### Monobactams

Aztreonam has **no cross-reactivity** with penicillins — except with ceftazidime (shared side chain) [^116QU3xv] — and is safe without prior testing [^114cHE93].

---

## Non-beta-lactam alternatives

### Macrolides

Agents include **azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin**; **uses** include respiratory and skin/soft-tissue infections and coverage of atypical pathogens.

---

### Clindamycin

Uses include **skin/soft-tissue infections, anaerobic infections, and surgical prophylaxis**; **caution** is warranted due to a higher C. difficile risk [^117LycsR] [^113DLCHE].

---

### Fluoroquinolones

- **Agents**: Levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin.
- **Use**: Respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal infections.
- **Caution**: Increased C. difficile and resistance risk [^117LycsR] [^113DLCHE].

---

### Tetracyclines

Agents include **doxycycline and minocycline**; **uses** include respiratory, skin, and tick-borne infections.

---

### Sulfonamides

The **agent** is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; **uses** include urinary, respiratory, and skin infections.

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Risk stratification**: Use PEN-FAST [^115gvBEc] to guide testing and rechallenge [^115HSywW].
- **Testing**: Skin testing and drug provocation [^1151izqc] enable safe beta-lactam use [^1155cqDA].
- **Monitoring**: Observe for allergic reactions, especially with new antibiotics [^1114uRYM].
- **Stewardship**: Prefer narrow-spectrum agents to limit resistance and adverse events [^116nTYfo].

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: Population based matched cohort study [^113DLCHE]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, patients with documented penicillin allergy had an increased incidence of broad spectrum antibiotic use, including the extended Gram positive spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and linezolid, which should be reserved for patients with suspected or known MRSA (or vancomycin resistant enterococci for linezolid). Use of the most narrow spectrum antibiotic that is effective for a given infection is a cornerstone of evidence-based treatment for infection and is responsible antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship committees enforce this aim in the hospital setting, with evaluations for penicillin allergy occasionally included in stewardship efforts. This analysis emphasizes the importance of performing outpatient antibiotic stewardship and the role that penicillin allergy evaluations might play.

Although diagnostic testing for penicillin allergy was developed in the 1960s, and has recently garnered the support of a variety of professional organizations, less than 0.1% of patients with a penicillin allergy label undergo confirmatory testing. Evaluation of penicillin allergy often involves a skin test, and if the result of skin testing is negative, a challenge dose of penicillin or amoxicillin is administered under medical observation. With these evaluation tools, evaluation of penicillin allergy has a more than 99% negative predictive value, takes less than three hours to perform, and costs about $220 (£165; €188; 2016 currency conversion). Previous observational cohorts have shown that more than 90% of patients with listed penicillin allergies can be safely treated with penicillin or amoxicillin.

### Inpatient β-lactam test-dose protocol and antimicrobial stewardship in patients with a history of penicillin allergy [^1155cqDA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in hospitalized patients, leading to increased use of second-line antibiotics, nosocomial infections, and greater health care utilization. Considering that most patients are not truly allergic, a safe strategy that empowers the admitting physician is essential.

- **Objective**: To assess the effect on antibiotic prescribing practices for hospitalized patients with penicillin allergy using a validated intervention.

- **Methods**: An intervention was implemented to educate health care professionals on the management of patients with penicillin allergy. This involved using a validated risk stratification algorithm to guide testing and antibiotic use. Thirty days of control data using standard care were compared with 60 days of post-intervention data, measuring the documentation of penicillin allergy history and antibiotic selection.

- **Results**: The relative use of cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics increased by 121.2% (P = .03) and 256% (P = .04), respectively, without an increase in adverse drug reactions. There was a decrease in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin, 67.2% (P = .04); quinolones, 33.3% (P = .31); carbapenems, 81.9% (P = .08); and aztreonam, 73.8% (P = .18).

- **Conclusion**: The antibiotic choice in patients admitted to the hospital with a reported penicillin allergy can be improved by a better evaluation of the allergy history and the use of a risk stratification guideline.

### Cefazolin as the mainstay for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy in obstetrics and gynecology [^114FqJSb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common antibiotic used for prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology. Among those with a penicillin allergy, alternative antibiotics are often chosen for prophylaxis, given fears of cross-reactivity between penicillin and cefazolin. Alternative antibiotics in this setting are associated with adverse sequelae, including surgical site infection, induction of bacterial resistance, higher costs to the healthcare system, and possible Clostridium difficile infection. Given the difference in R1 side chains between penicillin and cefazolin, cefazolin use is safe and should be recommended for patients with a penicillin allergy, including those who experience Immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis.

Cefazolin should only be avoided in those who experience a history of a severe, life-threatening delayed hypersensitivity reaction manifested as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Steven-Johnson Syndrome), hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, and hemolytic anemia in response to penicillin administration. In addition, more than 90% of those with a documented penicillin allergy do not have true allergies on skin testing. Increased referral for penicillin allergy testing should be incorporated into routine obstetric care and preoperative assessment to reduce suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis use. More education is needed among providers surrounding penicillin allergy assessment and cross-reactivity among penicillins and cephalosporins to optimize antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^113ydjgQ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Potential confounders, such as the indication for antibiotic use, illness severity at presentation, and patient demographics, present substantial challenges for retrospective studies in this field; researchers often struggle to access these variables. However, advances in causal inference theory have substantially improved our ability to discern causal effects from observational data. In particular, the use of instrumental variables (IVs) can provide reliable estimates of causal effects when the appropriate methodology and falsification tests are applied, emulating natural-experiment-like conditions.

Here, we propose to employ the reported allergy to penicillin as such an IV. Reported penicillin allergy satisfies the essential conditions needed for a valid IV analysis. First, it causally influences prescription practices, leading physicians to opt for non-penicillin antibiotics upon presentation of penicillin allergy. Second, reported penicillin allergy also inherently does not directly affect the AMR of bacterial populations.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^114t3m1G]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing with penicillins. If the skin test is negative, challenge testing should be conducted to exclude a penicillin allergy, especially if penicillin is required in a patient with a clinical history of cephalosporin allergy.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^111ZfDBJ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

The BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend conducting skin testing using a cephalosporin with a different side chain for diagnosing drug allergies, specifically penicillin allergy. If the skin test is negative, challenge testing should be performed to exclude allergy to the specific cephalosporin. This is essential for patients with a clinical history of penicillin allergy and positive skin tests who require a cephalosporin.

### Documented penicillin allergies on antibiotic selection at pediatric emergency department visits [^115XQx9g]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Penicillin or amoxicillin are the recommended treatments for the most common pediatric bacterial illnesses. Allergies to penicillin are commonly reported among children but are rarely true. We evaluated the impact of reported penicillin allergies on broad-spectrum antibiotic use overall and for the treatment of common respiratory infections among treat-and-release pediatric emergency department (ED) visits.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients receiving antibiotics during a treat-and-release visit at a large pediatric ED in the northeast from 2014 to 2016. Study exposure was a reported allergy to penicillin in the electronic medical record. Study outcomes were the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics and alternative (second-line) antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) and group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. We used unadjusted and adjusted generalized estimating equation models to analyze the impact of reported penicillin allergies on the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to determine the probability of children with a documented penicillin allergy receiving alternative antibiotic treatments for AOM and GAS.

- **Results**: Among 12,987 pediatric patients, 810 (6.2%) had a documented penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergies increased the odds of children receiving a broad spectrum versus narrow spectrum antibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.34–16.18). In our adjusted logistic regression model, the probability of child…

### Enhancing antibiotic stewardship by tackling "spurious" penicillin allergy [^116ZpxGL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 90–99% of patients with a label of penicillin allergy (PenA) are not allergic when comprehensively investigated. An inaccurate label of PenA has major public health implications, including longer hospital stays, more frequent hospital admissions, and greater use of fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, cephalosporins, and other expensive antibiotics. This results in significantly higher costs to the health service and predisposes patients to Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

We describe lessons learned from recent studies regarding possible reasons contributing to an inaccurate label of PenA. Additionally, we propose a concerted multidisciplinary approach to address this important public health problem. Given the unmet need for allergy services in the UK and several other countries, along with knowledge gaps regarding PenA among healthcare professionals, we describe the potential role of a computerized clinical decision support system. This system could enable non-specialists to rapidly identify and de-label "low-risk" hospitalized patients with a label of PenA, thereby obviating the need for allergy tests.

This approach, however, needs rigorous evaluation for feasibility, safety, patient and physician acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and its compatibility with information technology systems currently employed in the health service.

### Cost and risk analysis of lifelong penicillin allergy [^11751DVj]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Patients labeled as being penicillin-allergic require the use of alternative antibiotics. The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime antibiotic costs of patients labeled as being penicillin allergic prior to age 10 compared with those who were not penicillin allergic, and to compare antibiotic utilization between these two groups regarding the risks of adverse effects. Using the low end of the antibiotic cost range, penicillin-allergic patients had a mean lifetime antibiotic cost of $8,171 per patient, compared with $6,278 for non-penicillin-allergic patients, resulting in a difference of $1,893. Penicillin-allergic patients utilized more moderate-spectrum antibiotics, more fluoroquinolones, and had a higher estimated Clostridium difficile risk.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure.

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Delabeling, safety, and impact of β-lactam allergy testing: A systematic review [^113iEb6p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2023). High credibility.

β-Lactam allergy testing is a field with an incomplete evidence base; however, there is scope for improvement to ensure that we are providing patients with clear and reasonable testing and management.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin shows that it has two side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin, which suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having a penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of nonconfirmed penicillin allergy also had the label.

### Evaluation of the PEN-FAST clinical decision rule in non-beta-lactam antibiotic allergy assessment [^112Gz48M]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

False antibiotic allergy labels lead to the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum agents, contributing to antimicrobial resistance and poorer clinical outcomes. Penicillin allergy delabeling initiatives have been supported by validated clinical decision rules such as PEN-FAST. However, there are currently no available standardized approaches for non-beta-lactam allergies, for which standardized and validated skin tests are also lacking.

- **Objective**: We first aimed to validate the safety and negative predictive value (NPV) of PEN-FAST for penicillin allergies. Next, we evaluated whether the performance of PEN-FAST could be replicated for non-beta-lactam antibiotic allergy labels.

- **Methods**: This retrospective single-center comparative cohort study analyzed adult patients with penicillin or non-beta-lactam allergy labels referred to our allergy division at the Department of Dermatology, Heidelberg, Germany. Allergy assessment included skin tests and subsequent drug challenge. The performance of the previously published PEN-FAST criteria was evaluated for both cohorts.

- **Results**: A total of 102 penicillin allergy and 191 non-beta-lactam labels were analyzed. Confirmed allergies were more prevalent among non-beta-lactams (50.3% vs. 37.3%). PEN-FAST demonstrated high sensitivity for both penicillin (97.4%) and non-beta-lactams (94.8%), with an NPV of 95.8% and 82.8%, respectively. Misclassifications were limited to mild cutaneous reactions. Excluding clindamycin labels increased the NPV for non-beta-lactams to 95%.

- **Conclusion**: Despite lower NPV for non-beta-lactam labels and varying degrees of reliability, PEN-FAST remains a useful tool for clinical decision-making in the evaluation of antibiotic allergies.

### Impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions on peripartum antibiotic prescribing in patients with penicillin allergy [^113RxJV8]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). High credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems) are preferred for group B streptococcus prophylaxis, intra-amniotic infection, and cesarean surgical site infection prophylaxis. Non-beta-lactam alternatives are associated with inferior efficacy and contribute to higher rates of surgical site infection and longer lengths of stay. Most patients who report a penicillin allergy can tolerate penicillins without any adverse reaction. There are low rates of cross-reactivity between penicillins and other beta-lactams, including cephalosporins and carbapenems. Efforts to evaluate penicillin allergy and promote the use of beta-lactams are needed.

The study aimed to evaluate whether an antimicrobial stewardship intervention improved the use of first-line antibiotics for peripartum indications in patients with a reported penicillin allergy, following updates to institutional guidelines.

This was a retrospective study of adult patients presenting for vaginal or cesarean delivery at two hospitals within a healthcare system. Patients received at least one dose of antibiotics for a peripartum indication between May 1, 2018, and October 31, 2018 (preintervention group) and May 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020 (postintervention group). The stewardship intervention bundle, which was implemented between March 2019 and April 2020, included updates to institutional antibiotic guidelines, reclassification of severe penicillin allergy, development of obstetrical prophylaxis and treatment order sets, and promotion of allergy referral services.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: A retrospective study of a health system intervention [^113o9UXs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Reported penicillin allergies affect 10% to 15% of patients and pose a threat to the appropriate administration of first-line surgical-site infection (SSI) antimicrobial prophylaxis. The scope of this impact is enormous: SSIs are the most common and costly health care–associated infections, affecting 2% to 5% of surgeries in the United States. The aims of administering first-line surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are to prevent SSI, lower the risk of multi–drug-resistant organisms, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Cefazolin is the medication of choice for most procedures due to its desirable spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile, and low cost. The presence of a penicillin allergy label alone is associated with a 50% increased risk of SSI, likely mediated by reduced use of first-line antibiotics (most often cefazolin). When alternative antibiotics are used for surgical prophylaxis, there are higher rates of SSIs, prosthetic joint infections, surgical revisions, and multi–drug-resistant infections across a broad range of surgical specialties and procedures.

Although reported penicillin allergies commonly affect prescribing decisions, evidence shows that most are inaccurate: more than 95% of these patients can tolerate penicillin safely, and even more can tolerate cephalosporins. Patients are often inaccurately labeled either because they were mislabeled at the time of the inciting event or because, in cases of true allergy, most instances will be outgrown within 10 years.

### Antibiotic choice for group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis. Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines.

There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS positive mothers. Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. In August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact to neonates.

### The evolution of our understanding of penicillin allergy: 1942–2022 [^113crxza]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

This article reviews our evolving understanding of penicillin hypersensitivity on the 80th anniversary of penicillin's clinical introduction. Penicillin breakdown products covalently bond to serum proteins, leading to classic drug hypersensitivity. Penicillin remains the most frequently reported drug "allergy". Adverse reactions were presumed, in retrospect incorrectly, to pose a risk for anaphylaxis, and therefore skin testing for IgE became the focus. Skin test positivity may wane over time. This insight has led to the radical conclusion that penicillin hypersensitivity may not be "forever". Atopic background, other drug allergies, family history, gender, and race are apparently not risk factors for penicillin hypersensitivity.

Confirmed penicillin hypersensitivity has declined since the 1960s, potentially due to "cleaner" penicillin products and lower dose oral, instead of parenteral, use. Avoiding penicillins, without evaluation, caused unanticipated problems that have only recently been appreciated, including longer hospital stays, increased cost of care, suboptimal outcomes from serious infections, and greater toxicities and costs with alternative antibiotics. There are personal and public health advantages with broadly implemented penicillin allergy delabeling based on a reaction history-based risk assessment. Limited skin testing followed by an oral challenge, if negative, for higher-risk histories, and direct oral challenges in lower-risk individuals are currently the reference standard tests to confirm tolerance.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: Implications for clinical practice [^113vz5NC]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

In patients with a beta-lactam antibiotic (BA) allergy label, avoidance of the whole group of BAs leads to the displacement of first-line therapies, potentially influencing patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Studies previously published on BA cross-reactivity use different sets of BA and seem to contain conflicting recommendations on safe BA alternatives in cases of (suspected) BA allergy.

- **Methods**: The objectives were (i) to identify discrepancies between studies regarding cross-allergy in BA and (ii) to identify research gaps. The tables and errata from four studies (Romano et al, Trubiano et al, Zagursky et al, swab-guideline by Wijnakker et al.) were evaluated and compared head-to-head.

- **Results**: A total of 51 antibiotics were covered by the four authors, theoretically leading to 2550 potential recommendations regarding alternatives in case of specific allergies. Internal discrepancies existed in two tables. Since none of the tables included all 51 BAs, data were lacking in 356 situations regarding specific alternatives. In 1104 situations, only one author gave advice about a specific alternative. Harmony and disharmony between authors could be evaluated in 1090 cases. The advice regarding alternative BAs was in harmony 696 times (482 safe, 214 unsafe), while discrepancies were found in 394 cases. This led to different advice (safe vs. unsafe) in 272 cases or 69%.

- **Conclusion**: Disharmony between authors was identified in 36% of the cases. In 69%, this led to clinically relevant, different advice. This indicates the need for synchronization of cross-reactivity recommendations among different authors and studies.

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: population based matched cohort study [^116Kst3x]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

One third of patients report a drug allergy (i.e. adverse or allergic reaction), with the most commonly implicated drug being penicillin, which is documented in 5–16% of patients. Being labeled with a penicillin allergy affects future prescribing for infections in both outpatients and inpatients, with prescribed antibiotics often being more broad-spectrum and toxic. Unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and healthcare-associated infections such as Clostridium difficile-related colitis.

Most patients with a documented penicillin allergy are not truly allergic — that is, they have no immediate hypersensitivity. After evaluation by an allergist, about 95% of patients with reported penicillin allergies were found to be penicillin-tolerant. The discrepancy between labeled and confirmed penicillin allergies stems from misdiagnosis (e.g. a viral exanthem is misinterpreted as an allergy), misassumptions (e.g. an intolerance, such as a headache, is listed as an allergy), and remote timing of the allergy evaluation since 80% of patients with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin are no longer allergic after 10 years. Most patients with a penicillin allergy label, therefore, unnecessarily avoid penicillins and often other related β-lactam antibiotics, such as cephalosporins.

To evaluate the public health consequences of having a penicillin allergy label, we conducted a population-based matched cohort study and examined the relation between a newly recorded penicillin allergy and its implications.

### The economic burden of antibiotic treatment of penicillin-allergic patients in internal medicine wards of a general tertiary care hospital [^117BkDXV]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy poses a major problem in the management of infectious diseases.

- **Objective**: We estimated the costs and usage of antibiotic treatment of 'penicillin-allergic' patients in comparison to non-allergic patients in a tertiary care hospital.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was based on the records of 118 randomly chosen in-hospital patients labeled as being 'allergic to penicillin' and who were treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic selection and cost of the patients with alleged penicillin allergy were compared to 118 matched patients without an antibiotic allergy (controls).

- **Results**: During in-hospital treatment, the mean antibiotic cost for penicillin-allergic patients was 63% higher than the cost for the controls. In addition, there was a 38% higher cost of the recommended antimicrobial treatment regimen to be followed upon discharge by the former compared to the latter.

- **Conclusions**: Penicillin-allergic patients were more likely to receive broader spectrum antibiotics compared to non-allergic ones. Since many of the patients who are labeled as being 'allergic to penicillin' are, in fact, not allergic to it, inaccurate reporting of penicillin allergies may have costly economic and epidemiologic repercussions in addition to more toxic effects which can occur when choosing alternative drugs in case of penicillin allergy.

### Is a reported penicillin allergy sufficient grounds to forgo the multidimensional antimicrobial benefits of β-lactam antibiotics [^116nTYfo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

The majority of patients with a reported penicillin allergy are not actually allergic when tested or challenged. Penicillin allergy testing has been shown to significantly reduce annual healthcare expenditures. Data have emerged showing that β-lactams have multidimensional antibacterial effects in vivo, far beyond what is appreciated in standard bacteriological susceptibility testing media. These effects include enhancing bacterial killing by the innate immune system. Recent clinical and pharmacoeconomic analyses support the clinical relevance of these secondary, underappreciated effects; they show worse outcomes in patients with reported penicillin allergies who receive non-β-lactam antibiotics compared to their non-penicillin-allergic counterparts. This is particularly relevant in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This article reviews the tremendous advantages offered by β-lactam therapy and makes a strong case that debunking false penicillin allergies through a detailed allergy history and penicillin allergy testing should be a vital component of antimicrobial stewardship practices.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^115HSywW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, more specifically in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering a direct amoxicillin challenge in adult patients with a history of distant (more than 5 years ago) and benign cutaneous reactions, such as morbilliform drug eruption and urticaria.

### Safety of direct drug provocation for the evaluation of penicillin allergy in low-risk adults [^1151izqc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

About 10% of patients have a penicillin allergy label, but less than 5% of them are actually allergic. Unnecessary penicillin avoidance is associated with serious medical consequences. Given the growing number of these labels, it is imperative that our diagnostic strategy for penicillin allergy be as efficient as possible. The validity of traditionally used skin tests (STs) has been questioned, whereas drug provocation testing (DPT), the criterion standard, without previous ST, appears very safe in most cases.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety of direct DPT without consideration for ST results and the validity of ST in the diagnosis of penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: In this prospective cohort study without a control group, we recruited patients consulting an allergist for penicillin allergy. Patients underwent ST followed by DPT regardless of ST results. Patients with anaphylaxis to penicillin within the past 5 years or a severe delayed reaction were excluded, as were those with significant cardiorespiratory comorbidity.

- **Results**: None of the 1002 recruited patients had a serious reaction to DPT. Ten (1.0%) had a mild immediate reaction, of whom only 1 (0.1%) was considered likely IgE-mediated. The positive and negative predictive values of ST for an immediate reaction were 3.6% and 99.1%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: In a low-risk adult population reporting penicillin allergy, ST has a very poor positive predictive value. Direct DPT without ST is safe and appears to be an ideal diagnostic strategy to remove penicillin allergy labels.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^117RcH4t]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in evaluating penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend not obtaining any testing in patients with a history inconsistent with penicillin allergy, such as headache, family history of penicillin allergy, or diarrhea. Consider obtaining a one-step amoxicillin challenge in patients who are anxious or request additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy label.

### Management of children with reported penicillin allergies [^116xienQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported medication allergy. Reported allergy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Risk categorization tools can help determine the optimal testing strategies to delabel patients with reported allergy. Approaches to allergy removal include oral challenges in low-risk patients and skin testing in high-risk patients. Many different locations may be used to test for allergy, including ambulatory care clinics, inpatient units, and emergency departments. Interventions, such as the use of the electronic medical record, are needed to ensure that once the allergy is removed, this information is effectively transmitted to the patient and appropriate providers.

### Delabeling, safety, and impact of β-lactam allergy testing: A systematic review [^117PPQmg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

Follow-up after penicillin testing

A total of 10,537 participants (in 39 studies) underwent repeat provocation testing with the delabeled antibiotic after testing. Of these patients, 442 (4.2%) developed a reaction; however, the types of reactions were not reported. Only six studies followed up with participants (n = 660) but did not necessarily challenge them to assess participants' perceptions of their allergy status 2 to 10 years after delabeling. Of these 660 patients, 243 received a therapeutic course of penicillins during the interim period, with 10 of them (4.1%) reacting to penicillin. In all, 136 of the followed participants (20.6%) were still actively avoiding β-lactams despite successful delabeling due to either their own concern that they would react or their prescribing doctor's concern that they would react.

Meta-analysis

A total of 211 studies (74.3%) reported complete data regarding direct provocation test results. Attempts at meta-analysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity between studies with regard to direct provocation testing in those who had and had not undergone preceding skin tests (I² for all prospective studies = 93.9%; I² for prospective studies in the past 20 years = 83.6%), meaning that it was inappropriate to derive an estimate of overall effect from these studies. With regard to anaphylaxis in those who had and had not undergone skin tests, 113 studies reported complete data (39.8%). Again, significant heterogeneity in these studies was seen (I² = 72.6%). This heterogeneity was also seen when considering the 15 studies considered to be of high quality.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^112CRMFf]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Penicillins are the most common cause of drug-induced allergic reactions. Penicillin allergy can manifest as a variety of symptoms, ranging from reactions non-compatible with allergy and mild allergic symptoms (widespread erythema, urticaria, or periorbital edema) to severe anaphylaxis (circulatory failure, cardiac and/or respiratory arrest, and death).

The approach to diagnosing reactions to penicillins is complex. As proposed by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the first step includes a detailed clinical history. However, the information provided by patients is often inaccurate, especially when patients are referred following a long delay and the information about the nature of the symptoms and the suspected antibiotic is incomplete. Therefore, in vitro and skin tests (STs) are usually required, and if negative, a drug provocation test (DPT) should be considered.

Importantly, many patients with a history compatible with penicillin allergy yield negative STs and even tolerate the suspected antibiotic in DPT. Evidence suggests a loss of specific IgE (sIgE) to penicillins after avoiding exposure to the drug that induced the allergic reaction, leading to ST-negative results. sIgE to penicillin and/or to amoxicillin (AX) in serum was not detected in 50% of patients 3 years after the reactions, and in no patient after 4 years. Concerning the basophil activation test, in 60% of patients, negativization occurred after 18 months. Regarding STs, it has been reported that up to 30% of patients with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity become ST-negative.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet, for those who truly have allergies or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternative drugs is a must. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### A systematic review: can one prescribe carbapenems to patients with IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins [^113RYC9R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Cross-reactivity between penicillins or cephalosporins and carbapenems is anticipated as all have a beta-lactam ring. However, the true incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated cross-reactivity is not known.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted to collect and combine all published data on children and adults reported to have a clinical history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a penicillin and/or cephalosporin who were subsequently given a carbapenem. Reactions were classified as proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated.

- **Results**: Ten studies and 12 case reports describing 854 participants fit the study criteria. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin reactions (N = 838), the incidence of any type of suspected hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 36/838 (4.3%; 95% confidence interval, 3.1%-5.9%) and the incidence of proven (1/838), suspected (0/838), or possible (19/838) IgE-mediated reactions was 20/838 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.7%). Of the subset of patients with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295), only 1 had a hypersensitivity reaction (0.3%; 95% CI, .06%-1.9%), and this was a possible IgE-mediated reaction. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated cephalosporin reactions (N = 12), the incidence of any type of hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 3/12 (25%); this included 2 non-IgE-mediated reactions and 1 possible IgE-mediated reaction.

Conclusions

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems for IgE-mediated reactions…

### Penicillin g potassium [^1114uRYM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma [see WARNINGS]. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy.

- **Administration**: Penicillin G Potassium, USP by the intravenous route in high doses (above 10 million units) should be administered slowly because of the potential adverse effects of electrolyte imbalance from the potassium content of the penicillin. Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP contains 1.68 mEq potassium and 0.3 mEq of sodium per million units.

- **Superinfection risk**: The use of antibiotics may promote overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Indwelling intravenous catheters encourage superinfections. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

- **Prescribing guidelines**: Prescribing Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Periodic assessment of organ system function, including frequent evaluation of electrolyte balance, hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic systems, and cardiac and vascular status should be performed during prolonged therapy with high doses of intravenous penicillin G [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^114z9bWq]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Our outcomes were the binary results of antibiotic susceptibility tests, with resistance coded as 1, at various follow-up times (90, 180, 270, and 365 days). We considered antibiotic resistance results within the penicillin group, comprising ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as ciprofloxacin within the fluoroquinolones group. Notably, piperacillin/tazobactam was added as a penicillin-group outcome but not exposure because susceptibility to it is routinely tested, while it is very rarely prescribed in community settings in Israel. Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, served as an NCO for the IV independence assumption, explained below. We chose gentamicin due to its lack of association with the penicillin/beta-lactam family, its relative frequency in AMR test panels, and its infrequent use in outpatient settings. The bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were conducted using the automated VITEK 2 system, following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Intermediate results were considered resistant.

Our analysis focused exclusively on Escherichia coli isolates, which accounted for 71.6% of the total samples. Utilizing IV analysis, we estimated the risk difference of antibiotic resistance between individuals exposed to penicillins and those exposed to alternative antibiotic groups at the various post-antibiotic use follow-up times.

- **IV framework**: We assert that antibiotic allergies, particularly penicillin, can serve as an IV in studying antibiotic use and future outcomes.

### Assessment of the frequency of dual allergy to penicillins and cefazolin: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114s5deF]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Cefazolin is the preoperative antibiotic of choice because it is safer and more efficacious than second-line alternatives. Surgical patients labeled as having a penicillin allergy are less likely to prophylactically receive cefazolin and are more likely to receive clindamycin or vancomycin, which results in higher rates of surgical site infections.

To examine the incidence of dual allergy to cefazolin and natural penicillins, MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched without language restrictions for relevant articles published from database inception until July 31, 2020.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a total of 3228 studies were identified, and 2911 were screened for inclusion. These studies included patients who had index allergies to a natural penicillin and were tested for tolerability to cefazolin, or patients who had index allergies to cefazolin and were tested for tolerability to a natural penicillin.

Data were independently extracted by two authors, and Bayesian meta-analysis was used to estimate the frequency of allergic reactions. The main outcome measure was the dual allergy to cefazolin and a natural penicillin.

Seventy-seven unique studies met the eligibility criteria, yielding 6147 patients. Cefazolin allergy was identified in 44 participants with a history of penicillin allergy, resulting in a dual allergy.

### Anatomy of a successful stewardship intervention: Improving perioperative prescribing in penicillin-allergic patients [^114KWFz9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

To evaluate whether a series of quality improvement interventions to promote safe perioperative use of cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients improved the use of first-line antibiotics and decreased costs, a before-and-after trial was conducted following several educational interventions.

The study was set in an academic medical center and included patients undergoing a surgical procedure involving receipt of a perioperative antibiotic other than a penicillin or carbapenem between January 1, 2017, and August 31, 2019. Patients with and without a penicillin allergy label in their electronic medical record were compared with respect to the percentage who received a cephalosporin and the average antibiotic cost per patient.

A multidisciplinary team from infectious diseases, allergy, anesthesiology, surgery, and pharmacy surveyed anesthesiology providers about their use of perioperative cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients. Using findings from that survey, the team designed a decision-support algorithm for safe utilization and provided two educational forums to introduce this algorithm, emphasizing the safety of cefazolin or cefuroxime in penicillin-allergic patients without a history of severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction.

The results showed that the percentage of penicillin-allergic patients receiving a perioperative cephalosporin improved from approximately 34% to over 80% following algorithm implementation and the associated educational interventions. This increase in cephalosporin use was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in antibiotic cost per penicillin-allergic patient.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^1157LxWK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This study exploits a unique phenomenon, namely purported penicillin allergy, to estimate the causal effects of prior antibiotic use on antibiotic resistance in real-world primary care settings. Our analysis quantifies the impact of previous use of penicillins on resistance rates of future infections to three penicillins. The largest effect was observed in resistance to ampicillin, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and finally, piperacillin/tazobactam. The low number needed to harm (NNH) values estimated for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin suggest that consumption of penicillins may frequently lead to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to these antibiotics upon infections. In contrast, the higher NNH for piperacillin/tazobactam indicates a comparatively lower cost of resistance, suggesting that only a small number of patients exposed to penicillins would lose the ability to be effectively treated with this antibiotic due to resistance.

In line with both biological reasoning and previous knowledge, all three outcomes demonstrated a gradual decrease in the risk difference (RD) for antibiotic resistance with each subsequent time point, reflecting the diminishing impact of prior antibiotic use. In contrast, gentamicin, the negative-control antibiotic, displayed no such effect nor trend, further affirming the validity of our analysis. In our additional analysis, we compared past usage of penicillin with that of quinolones on corresponding AMR tests within the 180-day post-exposure period. The past use of penicillins was linked to resistance rates for penicillins, but this association was lower than the association between quinolones and their corresponding resistance.

### Antibiotic choice for group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^113iGmtF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

To evaluate the choice of antibiotic used for intrapartum Group B Streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis in pregnant individuals with reported penicillin allergies compared to those without reported penicillin allergies and investigate whether there are associated differences in neonatal outcomes, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study included mother-infant dyads of GBS-positive pregnant individuals who labored and delivered newborns at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation at a high-volume urban hospital from 2005 to 2018.

The type of antibiotic administered to the mothers for GBS prophylaxis, which was categorized as beta-lactam prophylaxis (defined as penicillin-class drug or cefazolin) or alternative prophylaxis (defined as vancomycin or clindamycin), was compared between those with a penicillin allergy documented in their medical records versus those who did not. Neonatal outcomes, including the number of postnatal blood draws, antibiotic administration, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, bacteremia, and hospital length of stay, were compared between these groups. Both bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed.

Results indicated that of 11,334 mother-infant pairs, 1,170 (10.3%) mothers had a penicillin allergy documented in their medical record. Among these, 49 (4.2%) received penicillin, 259 (22.1%) received cefazolin, 449 (38.4%) received clindamycin, and 413 (35.3%) received vancomycin. Patients with a reported penicillin allergy were significantly more likely to receive alternative GBS prophylaxis compared to those without penicillin allergies (73.7% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.01). Neonates of patients who received alternative GBS prophylaxis had differing outcomes compared to those without penicillin allergies.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^116TJFdo]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, our findings have implications for both guidelines and clinical practice, and methodological approaches to the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Clinically, our results provide causal estimates of the additional risk and number needed to harm (NNH) impacted by prior use of penicillins and quinolones in outpatient settings over different periods since exposure. Such estimates should also play a substantial role in the cost-benefit considerations when determining empiric antibiotic treatment guidelines. Specifically, penicillins induce substantial future resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, and, to a lesser extent, piperacillin tazobactam. Moreover, penicillins, compared to quinolones, appear to induce lower respective antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thereby enhancing their utility in subsequent treatments. Methodologically, we propose a novel approach, built on an original instrumental variable (IV), that opens a venue for further research on antibiotic groups inducing allergic reactions, such as cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and sulfonamides.

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: Population based matched cohort study [^117LycsR]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Compared with patients who did not receive penicillins, those receiving penicillins did not have an increased risk of MRSA (adjusted risk ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.20) but had an increased risk of C. difficile (1.18, 1.06 to 1.31). Patients receiving macrolide antibiotics had an increased risk of MRSA (1.72, 1.54 to 1.91) and C. difficile (1.30, 1.18 to 1.43). Those receiving clindamycin had an increased risk of MRSA (2.97, 2.11 to 4.16) and C. difficile (2.76, 2.00 to 3.81). Additionally, patients receiving fluoroquinolones showed an increased risk of MRSA (2.38, 2.12 to 2.67) and C. difficile (1.72, 1.54 to 1.93).

- **Mediation effects of alternative antibiotic use**:
	- The effect of a penicillin allergy on the risk of MRSA was 55% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes; 55% mediated through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 54% mediated through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 26% mediated through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 24% mediated through fluoroquinolones alone. The effect of penicillin allergy on C. difficile was 35% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes; 26% mediated through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 24% mediated through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 20% mediated through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 16% mediated through fluoroquinolones alone.

### Cephalosporins can be given to penicillin-allergic patients who do not exhibit an anaphylactic response [^1135Ysag]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

To assess the risk of intraoperative allergic reactions to cephalosporins in patients who claim to be allergic to penicillin, a retrospective chart review was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital. A total of 2,933 intraoperative anesthesia records of all adult orthopedic patients treated at our institution during a 14-month period (July 1996 to August 1997) were reviewed for antibiotic use and allergic reactions.

- **Main results**: Most of the 2,933 orthopedic patients, including 413 patients who were allergic to penicillin, received a cephalosporin (usually cefazolin) during their procedure. Only one of the penicillin-allergic patients may have had an allergic reaction to the cephalosporin, as diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone were given at the beginning of the case; however, no mention was made on the chart about itching, a rash, or hives. One of the non-penicillin-allergic patients developed a rash while the cephalosporin was infusing, requiring discontinuation of the antibiotic.

- **Conclusions**: Given the low incidence of allergic reactions, it appears to be safe to administer cephalosporins to patients who claim to be allergic to penicillin. However, no conclusion can be made concerning patients who report severe or anaphylactic reactions to penicillin, because these patients were probably excluded from the study.

### Pen-fast-ed: Utilizing the PEN-FAST decision tool to guide antibiotic prescribing in the emergency department [^115gvBEc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patient-reported penicillin allergies are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED), often leading to the use of non-beta-lactam antibiotics despite beta-lactams being the first-line therapy in most bacterial infections. The PEN-FAST clinical decision tool was developed and validated to identify patients with a low risk of true penicillin allergies that do not require formal skin testing for rechallenging. The tool consists of four questions that add up to a total score ranging from 0 to 5. Scores of 0–2 are associated with a low risk of true penicillin allergy (< 5% risk of true reaction), scores of 3 with a moderate risk (< 20% risk), and scores of 4–5 with a high risk (50% risk). The purpose of our study was to determine the safety and efficacy of our facility's implementation of pharmacist utilization of the PEN-FAST screening tool to assess purported penicillin allergies and rechallenge low to moderate risk patients in the ED.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study conducted from October 2023 to March 2024. Adult ED patients with a documented penicillin allergy and an order for aztreonam, levofloxacin, clindamycin, or a consult for pharmacy assistance with antibiotic selection were included. Patients were excluded if the order or consult was placed by a non-ED physician, no penicillin allergy was documented, the patient had previously tolerated a penicillin or cephalosporin per chart review, was unable to participate in the interview, or the completion of the assessment would delay patient care. The primary outcome was…

### A real-time prospective evaluation of clinical pharmaco-economic impact of diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' in a UK teaching hospital [^111JThWU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To perform a pharmaco-economic analysis of prescribing alternative antibiotics in patients with a diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' and assess whether collation of information from a structured history and liaison with the family physician could reduce costs.

- **Methods**: A prospective pro-forma-based interview of randomly selected in-patients and their family physician was used to assess the validity of the diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy'. Cost analysis of prescription of alternative antibiotics was performed and compared with first-line agents.

- **Results**: 102 patients were assessed, and only 40% (n = 41) were found to have a history consistent with penicillin hypersensitivity. Another 40% (n = 41) were likely 'not allergic', and 20% (n = 20) had 'indeterminate' reactions. The total cost of antibiotics prescribed for patients with penicillin allergy was 1.82–2.58-fold higher than for first-line antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Obtaining a structured history from the patient and family physician alone can enable an accurate identification of penicillin allergy status. The total acquisition cost of second-line antibiotics is higher than if these patients were prescribed first-line antibiotics.

### Treatment of patients with a history of penicillin allergy in a large tertiary-care academic hospital [^112qkMJs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics to patients with a history of penicillin allergy is common in clinical practice. Opting for non-beta-lactam antibiotics has its inconveniences and is often unnecessary because most of these patients are, in fact, not allergic.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine how physicians in a large Canadian tertiary-care academic hospital without allergists on staff treat patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted during a 1-year period among all patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, coronary care unit, and internal medicine wards. Files of patients with a record of penicillin allergy were reviewed to assess the need for antibiotics during their hospitalization and the decision-making process underlying the choice of antibiotic. The additional costs of alternative antibiotics were calculated.

- **Results**: The files of 1738 patients admitted over a 1-year period were hand-reviewed. A history of penicillin allergy was found in 172 patients (9.9%). The allergic reaction was described in only 30% of cases and left unmentioned in 20.7%. Beta-lactam antibiotics were used on 56 occasions despite a history of penicillin allergy. The use of alternative antibiotics in place of the beta-lactam standard of care carried an additional cost of $15,672 Canadian.

- **Conclusion**: Alleged penicillin allergy is common among hospitalized patients and leads to substantial additional costs. Poor documentation of penicillin allergy likely reflects a lack of knowledge on this issue in the medical community.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^117U3K23]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of penicillin allergy, AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering obtaining direct challenges (without prior skin tests) to cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains to determine the tolerance in patients with a history of non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations where penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended first-line agents, the issue of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to the routine use of alternative but potentially less effective agents.

Use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth. Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin.

The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Antibiotic choice for group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^116b5sMa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

To evaluate the choice of antibiotic used for intrapartum Group B Streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis in pregnant individuals with reported penicillin allergies compared to those without reported penicillin allergies and investigate whether there are associated differences in neonatal outcomes, this retrospective cohort study was conducted.

The study included mother-infant dyads of GBS positive pregnant individuals who labored and delivered newborns ≥ 35 weeks of gestation at a high-volume urban hospital (2005–2018). The type of antibiotic administered for GBS prophylaxis — beta-lactam prophylaxis defined as penicillin-class drug or cefazolin; alternative prophylaxis defined as vancomycin or clindamycin — was compared between those with a documented penicillin allergy and those without. Neonatal outcomes such as the number of postnatal blood draws, antibiotic administration, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, bacteremia, and hospital length of stay were compared between groups. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed.

Of 11,334 mother-infant pairs, 1170 (10.3%) mothers had a penicillin allergy documented in their medical record. Of them, 49 (4.2%) received a penicillin, 259 (22.1%) received cefazolin, 449 (38.4%) received clindamycin, and 413 (35.3%) received vancomycin. Patients with a reported penicillin allergy were significantly more likely to receive alternative GBS prophylaxis compared to those without penicillin allergy (73.7% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.01). Neonates of patients who received alternative prophylaxis had…

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^1135ZxjZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly concerning the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering penicillin skin testing in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE-mediated.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^112bGYXM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The potential benefits of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women with a suspected allergy include adherence to guideline-directed antibiotic therapy in the setting of group B streptococcus prophylaxis or cesarean delivery infection prophylaxis and reduction in exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Penicillin allergy testing to document those who truly require alternative treatments supports antibiotic stewardship to mitigate emerging drug resistance. Penicillin allergy testing should ideally occur preconception or at the time of initial allergy reaction. Obstetricians can also use preconception encounters as well as postpartum visits to counsel women regarding the benefits of penicillin allergy testing.

Recent publications, as well as the latest Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, advocate for the consideration of penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy. Given the low incidence of anaphylaxis, this study highlights the ability to perform allergy testing in the outpatient setting. In light of the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship and demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of testing, women with a reported penicillin allergy can undergo allergy testing in pregnancy.

### Is spurious penicillin allergy a major public health concern only in high-income countries [^1121QAt9]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The burden and adverse impact of penicillin allergy labels in high-income countries

Penicillin allergy labels (PALs) occur in 6% and 10% of the general population in England as well as the United States, respectively, and in 15%–20% of inpatients in the United States and England (local audit data). Importantly, 90%–95% of PALs are spurious (or inaccurate) and present a significant impediment to prompt and effective antimicrobial stewardship. This is related to multiple factors including gaps in knowledge and skills among prescribers, as well as inaccurate documentation and interpretation of side effects leading to mislabeling as penicillin allergy.

PALs lead to increased prescription of alternative second-line antibiotics such as quinolones, glycopeptides, and carbapenems. Apart from increased antibiotic costs, this enhances the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, iatrogenic infections such as Clostridioides difficile and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, surgical site infections, and delayed treatment of sepsis, which contributes to longer hospital stays.

To put AMR into a global perspective, it results in an estimated 700,000 deaths per year, and the burden is higher in low-income countries (LICs; as per World Bank classification; gross national income (GNI) per capita on 1 July 2020, < US$1036) and low-middle-income countries (LMICs; GNI, US$1036–US$4045). It has been suggested that if there are no mitigation strategies in place to address AMR by 2050, an estimated loss of 10 million lives alongside a cost of US$100 trillion has been predicted.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: A retrospective study of a health system intervention [^1159BhYZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common first-line antibiotic to prevent surgical-site infections. Patients with penicillin allergy labels often receive alternative antibiotics, which is associated with increased rates of surgical-site infections, multi-drug-resistant infections, and cost.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether a hospital-wide guideline recommending first-line surgical prophylaxis in patients with penicillin allergy labels can increase the use of cefazolin without compromising safety.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels. The main intervention was updated hospital-wide surgical guidelines recommending first-line prophylaxis in most patients with penicillin allergy labels. We compared the preintervention and postintervention groups. The primary outcome was cefazolin use. Secondary perioperative outcomes included alternative antibiotic use and severe allergic episodes (anaphylaxis).

- **Results**: The total sample comprised 7187 patients with penicillin allergy labels who underwent 8945 surgical encounters (median age [interquartile range], 61 [46–71] years; 4891 [68%] female). Cefazolin was used in 2256 (73%) patients in the preintervention group and 3390 (83%) patients in the postintervention group (P < 0.001), with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.87 (95% CI, 1.67–2.10). There was a decrease in the use of clindamycin from 14% to 8% (P < 0.001) and gentamicin from 16% to 8% (P < 0.001). There were no episodes of severe allergic reactions among patients who received guideline-directed therapy.

### The use of direct oral challenge to confirm allergies to penicillin class antibiotics in Danish children [^115A4rda]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Only 2.8% of the patients referred for investigation of a potential allergic reaction to penicillin had clinically significant challenge reactions. This could indicate that allergy to penicillin in children has previously been overestimated, as suggested by Esposito S et al. We extended the guidelines recommended by the EAACI Drug Allergy Interest Group by performing direct challenge (DC) in patients with a positive skin prick test (SPT) or specific IgE, patients who would otherwise have been regarded as allergic to penicillin. This could partly explain the lower percentage in our study.

The study increased focus on which symptoms predict a true allergic reaction to antibiotics. A macular exanthema rash alone, whether itching or not, was not likely to be associated with a true allergy to antibiotics, and antibiotic treatment should thus not be ended or changed. This corresponds to the division of symptoms into low-risk or high-risk as proposed by Vyles D et al.

We found no correlation between a positive DC, positive SPT, or high specific IgE. In non-IgE allergic reactions, the SPT and specific IgE have shown low sensitivity. In immediate IgE-mediated allergic reactions, the concentration of IgE to penicillin decreases if the time span is too long between the reaction and the SPT or measurement of IgE. The optimal timespan between reaction and test is between 1 and 12 months. Therefore, it has been proposed to perform DC without SPT and IgE, and only do a complete allergy work-up (SPT, IgE with/without DC) in patients with a history suggesting anaphylaxis.

### Introduction of a practice guideline for penicillin skin testing improves the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy [^1173cYwQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the introduction of a practice guideline for penicillin skin testing would increase the appropriateness of skin testing and reduce antibiotic costs for patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have infections caused by penicillin-susceptible pathogens. We measured the appropriateness of skin testing and daily antibiotic costs before and after the introduction of a guideline for penicillin skin testing. For patients who had negative results of skin testing and were subsequently treated with a penicillin instead of an alternative antibiotic, we calculated the difference between the actual costs and the projected costs of continuing alternative antibiotics without skin testing.

After the guideline was introduced, appropriateness of skin testing increased from 17% to 64%, but daily antibiotic costs did not change. For patients who had negative results of skin testing and who were subsequently treated with a penicillin, there was no difference between actual costs and the projected costs if they had not been skin tested. We conclude that introduction of a guideline for penicillin skin testing increases the percentage of eligible patients who have a skin test, and it does so without increasing costs.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy often receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

- **Objective**: To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

- **Methods**: A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline used a standard two-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

- **Results**: Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after versus before guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, versus 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P = .5) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs. 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs. 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs. 1.1%, P = .004), and fluoroquinolones (15.3% vs. 3.3%, P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: The implementation of the guideline significantly impacted the prescribing of antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergies.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^111SzC4K]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Balancing drug allergy with antibiotic stewardship is a difficult and ever-present challenge for the obstetrician. Antibiotics are administered to 30–74% of women during pregnancy, for a wide variety of indications. The most commonly used antibiotics include penicillin and other beta-lactams, clindamycin and other macrolides, and aminoglycosides.

Pregnant women with a self-reported penicillin allergy typically receive alternative antibiotics that are broader spectrum (e.g. cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin), which increases the risk for antibiotic resistance and maternal morbidity. In the general population, self-reported penicillin allergy occurs in 10% of patients; however, when tested, fewer than 2% have a proven (or true) allergic reaction. Penicillin allergy also decreases over time, with up to 80% of patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy losing sensitization 10 years later.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourages the consideration of allergy testing in women who self-report a penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergy can be confirmed through skin testing, but there are limited data to inform allergy testing in pregnancy. Two studies using skin testing with 27 and 56 pregnant women reported only 3% and 7% of women, respectively, had a true penicillin allergy, and none had anaphylaxis. Neither of these studies in pregnant women included a graded oral challenge, which is important because oral drug challenge is the gold standard for determining true drug allergy.

Our aim was to estimate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of outpatient pen…

### Why was there ever a warning not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin "allergy" [^112rygzX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

It is now well-established that avoiding β-lactam antibiotics, when they are the drugs of choice, results in significantly worse long-term global outcomes for patients. Much of this avoidable morbidity has been caused by widespread warnings in electronic health care record systems not to use cephalosporins in the setting of penicillin allergy. Historically, early impure penicillin preparations were associated with high rates, up to 1000-fold higher than those seen today, of immunologically mediated reactions. This instilled a rational fear of β-lactam-associated anaphylaxis in generations of physicians.

In the late 1970s, several editorial comments suggested a potential increased risk to patients with a history of penicillin allergy when given cephalosporins. This resulted in a warning that became embedded in the medical culture. However, over the past 40 years, compelling data have developed that refute this warning, showing that the risks of avoiding cephalosporins outweigh the benefits. In late 2017, Kaiser Permanente Southern California completely removed all warnings against the use of cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin allergy. The results have recently been published in JAMA Network Open. This Rostrum article provides some of the backstory on the establishment and removal of this warning for physicians who trained over the past 30 years.

### The use of perioperative cephalexin in penicillin allergic patients in dermatologic surgery: An advisory statement [^111jAcxu]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients report a penicillin allergy. Based on historical guidelines, patients with a penicillin allergy should receive an alternative to cephalexin for prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery.

- **Objective**: To determine, based on evidence, if cephalexin should be used as a first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was performed with defined search terms.

- **Results**: Less than 5% of those with penicillin allergy labels have a true penicillin allergy. For patients with a true, persistent penicillin allergy, there is an overall low cross-reactivity with cephalosporins, especially with those that do not share an identical R1 side chain. First-generation cephalosporins, including cephalexin, have a slightly higher risk of cross-reactivity in patients with a reported allergy to amino-penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin) but not other penicillins. The risk of severe cross-reactivity of cephalosporins in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies is extremely low. Cephalexin has a superior side effect profile and efficacy compared to alternatives.

- **Conclusion**: Cephalexin should be used as the first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with documented penicillin allergies, including anaphylaxis. There may be a higher risk of cross-reactivity with cephalexin in patients with a confirmed amino-penicillin allergy.
