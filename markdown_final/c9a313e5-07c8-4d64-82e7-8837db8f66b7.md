## Question

what is the time frame for a physiological nadir

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the time frame is for a physiological nadir. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "physiological nadir" means in general and how rhythmicity sets its timing. Then, I should verify canonical examples such as the circadian nadir of cortisol. Next, I will examine event-related nadirs like postprandial glucose dynamics and GH suppression testing. After that, I should consider sources of variability such as chronotype, behavior, and metabolic health. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical time frames and caveats about misalignment and therapeutic implications, ensuring the evidence matches each assertion before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition. A physiological nadir is the lowest point in the oscillation of a biological signal, and its time frame is dictated by the underlying rhythm: circadian cycles set a roughly 24-hour phase, ultradian rhythms operate over minutes to hours, and event-linked nadirs are anchored to a stimulus such as a meal or an oral glucose load. Hold on, I should verify that both circadian and event-related nadirs are relevant to clinical use; yes, endocrine physiology uses both constructs routinely, and their timing is shaped by the suprachiasmatic nucleus for circadian outputs and by acute metabolic stimuli for event-driven responses [^114y1vLJ] [^113By8X4].

> I will now examine the canonical circadian example, cortisol. In healthy nocturnal sleepers, cortisol rises from about 04:00, peaks within a few hours after waking, and then declines to reach a nadir around midnight, reflecting SCN-driven circadian control and sleep–wake modulation. Wait, let me verify the midnight nadir timing; Endocrine Reviews explicitly notes the nadir near midnight under normal alignment, which is consistent with clinical practice using late-night cortisol to probe diurnal integrity. Disruption of light exposure, sleep, or feeding can shift the phase and blunt amplitude, altering the nadir's timing and clinical interpretability [^114y1vLJ] [^112LcMcc] [^113By8X4].

> Next, I should review meal-related glucose dynamics. In people without diabetes on fixed meal times, premeal glucose averages in the low-90s mg/dL with postprandial peaks around 140 mg/dL, and the curve tends to return toward baseline within roughly 2–3 hours, implying that the post-peak trough typically occurs in that window in healthy physiology. I need to ensure this aligns with clinical targets; ADA pregnancy targets emphasize 1–2 hour postprandial goals, operationalizing the expectation that glucose should approach baseline by two hours in tight-control settings. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "the nadir is the pre-meal fasting baseline", but that was imprecise; the fasting baseline is the nadir for the fasting cycle, whereas within a single postprandial excursion the nadir refers to the lowest point after the peak as glucose declines, which in health approaches the premeal level by 2–3 hours but can vary and may overshoot below baseline in susceptible states such as reactive hypoglycemia [^1178bK45] [^114Lnah4] [^114PmDbR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hypoglycemic "nadirs". In clamp studies designed to induce hypoglycemia, investigators set a target glucose nadir of about 2.9 mmol/L for specified durations such as 5 or 30 minutes; that timing is defined by protocol and is not a spontaneous physiological nadir, so I should keep it conceptually separate from free-living postprandial troughs [^115LYkBH].

> I should confirm the growth hormone nadir context. For acromegaly surveillance, the Endocrine Society recommends measuring the nadir GH following an oral glucose load, typically sampled over 60–120 minutes to assess suppression; failure to suppress below the diagnostic cut point supports persistent disease. Let me double-check the time frame; yes, nadir GH during the OGTT occurs within that window, making the event-related nadir stimulus-anchored rather than circadian-anchored [^116iFVgu].

> Let me consider ultradian and high-frequency rhythms. Insulin secretion is pulsatile at approximately 3–10 minute intervals in the basal state and exhibits longer ultradian components around 1–2 hours; the troughs between pulses constitute frequent nadirs on the order of minutes, though clinically we rarely sample at that resolution outside research settings. I should confirm the pulse timescales; detailed physiological and pharmacokinetic analyses support these intervals and underscore why exogenous insulin cannot fully reproduce intra-minute nadir–peak patterns [^112U4KaK] [^116FoKwg].

> Next, I should review modifiers of nadir timing and amplitude. Chronotype, sleep, light, and meal timing can shift or blunt nadirs; for example, restricting eating to the evening altered endocrine acrophases and appeared to adversely affect glucose homeostasis, indicating that later eating can disturb normal timing relationships. But wait, what if metabolic health is impaired? Obesity and insulin resistance can blunt rhythmic amplitudes and flatten or delay nadirs, as shown in metabolic tissue clocks and glycemic challenges in animal models, with translational implications for humans with metabolic disease [^115RirMf] [^114nhDCV] [^116BMSkY].

> I need to ensure the clinical applications are explicit. Midnight or late-night cortisol helps detect loss of diurnal nadir in hypercortisolism; OGTT nadir GH at 60–120 minutes is used for acromegaly assessment; and postprandial glucose targets at 1–2 hours operationalize a return toward glycemic baseline as a surrogate for adequate metabolic handling in pregnancy and beyond. Let me double-check each linkage; the timing assertions align with endocrine guidelines and physiologic profiles in health, strengthening the clinical relevance of nadir timing across axes [^114y1vLJ] [^116iFVgu] [^114Lnah4].

> Therapeutically, I should review how nadir timing informs replacement and behavior. Hydrocortisone replacement cannot fully mimic the physiologic ultradian–circadian pattern, including the midnight nadir, so dose timing and formulations are tailored to approximate diurnal needs while acknowledging limitations. In parallel, chrononutrition strategies that avoid late eating may help preserve normal endocrine phase relationships and thereby support appropriate nadir timing and glycemic excursions. Wait, let me verify that both points are evidence-backed; yes, replacement constraints and meal timing effects are well documented in endocrine and cardiometabolic literature [^112zKy3X] [^114y1vLJ] [^115RirMf].

> Synthesis and answer: The time frame for a physiological nadir is determined by the governing rhythm and context. For circadian-driven hormones such as cortisol, the nadir occurs around midnight under normal alignment in diurnal humans. For meal-related metabolites like glucose, the postprandial trough typically occurs within about 2–3 hours after eating in healthy individuals, approaching the premeal baseline in that window, although earlier I mistakenly equated the nadir strictly with the premeal fasting level before correcting to the post-peak trough within the excursion. For dynamic testing such as the GH suppression test, the nadir is measured during the 60–120 minute window following the stimulus. Key caveat: circadian misalignment, late eating, sleep disruption, and metabolic disease can shift the phase, reduce the amplitude, or blunt the clarity of nadirs, altering both their timing and clinical interpretation [^114y1vLJ] [^1178bK45] [^116iFVgu] [^112LcMcc].

The physiological nadir is the **lowest point** of a biological parameter within a cycle, and its timing is **parameter-specific**. For glucose, the nadir typically occurs **2–4 hours postprandially** as insulin suppresses endogenous glucose production and enhances uptake [^1178bK45]. For cortisol, the nadir is around **midnight** (00:00–02:00) in diurnal humans, reflecting circadian HPA axis regulation [^114y1vLJ]. These nadirs are shaped by circadian rhythms, meal timing, and hormonal feedback, and can be altered by sleep, stress, or metabolic disease [^114y1vLJ] [^112LcMcc] [^116gDLhA].

## Definition and physiological significance

A physiological nadir is the **lowest point** of a biological parameter within a defined cycle and reflects coordinated regulation by circadian clocks, hormones, and metabolic processes [^115BKfjo]. It is a **marker of homeostasis** and system integrity, with **clinically relevant** timing and amplitude [^113By8X4].

## Glucose nadir: timing and determinants

### Normal glucose nadir timing

In healthy individuals, the glucose nadir typically occurs **2–4 hours postprandially** [^1178bK45], driven by insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production and increased peripheral uptake [^112U4KaK]. This corresponds to the postabsorptive period, when endogenous production balances utilization.

---

### Factors influencing glucose nadir timing

- **Meal composition and timing**: High-carbohydrate meals or late eating can delay and deepen the nadir by increasing insulin secretion and hepatic glucose uptake [^115RirMf].
- **Insulin sensitivity**: Higher sensitivity accelerates glucose clearance, leading to an earlier nadir; lower sensitivity delays it [^114M6fpg].
- **Circadian rhythms**: Circadian regulation of insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose production modulates nadir timing, with greater sensitivity in the morning and reduced sensitivity in the evening [^112U4KaK] [^114iEbhi].
- **Physical activity**: Activity increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, potentially advancing the nadir [^117KBfkg].

## Cortisol nadir: timing and determinants

### Normal cortisol nadir timing

Cortisol exhibits a robust circadian rhythm, with a nadir around **midnight** (00:00–02:00) in diurnal humans [^114y1vLJ]. This reflects circadian regulation of the HPA axis and supports metabolic homeostasis, sleep, and immune function [^112vSzLh].

---

### Factors influencing cortisol nadir timing

- **Circadian rhythms**: The SCN coordinates the HPA axis, determining the timing of the cortisol nadir [^114y1vLJ] [^113By8X4].
- **Sleep-wake cycles**: Sleep onset inhibits the HPA axis, contributing to the nocturnal nadir; sleep disruption or nocturnal awakenings can blunt or shift the nadir [^114y1vLJ].
- **Stress and psychological factors**: Acute or chronic stress can elevate cortisol levels, potentially delaying or blunting the nadir [^116gDLhA].
- **Metabolic state**: Insulin sensitivity and glucose availability can modulate HPA axis activity, influencing nadir timing [^115SuC6X].

---

## Clinical implications of physiological nadirs

- **Hypoglycemia**: In diabetes, insulin therapy or impaired counterregulation can cause hypoglycemia at the glucose nadir, necessitating careful monitoring and adjustment of insulin regimens [^114E2KQQ] [^113uFsSQ].
- **Circadian rhythm disorders**: Disruption of circadian rhythms can alter cortisol nadir timing, contributing to metabolic dysregulation, sleep disturbances, and increased cardiovascular risk [^112LcMcc] [^113By8X4].
- **Hormonal replacement therapy**: Understanding cortisol nadir timing is essential for optimizing glucocorticoid replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency, aiming to mimic physiological rhythms and minimize side effects [^112zKy3X] [^114y1vLJ].

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: Causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^112LcMcc]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Circadian (∼24-hour) timing systems pervade all kingdoms of life and temporally optimize behavior and physiology in humans. Relatively recent changes to our environments, such as the introduction of artificial lighting, can disorganize the circadian system, from the level of the molecular clocks that regulate the timing of cellular activities to the level of synchronization between our daily cycles of behavior and the solar day. Sleep/wake cycles are intertwined with the circadian system, and global trends indicate that these, too, are increasingly subject to disruption. A large proportion of the world's population is at increased risk of environmentally driven circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, and a minority of individuals are also genetically predisposed to circadian misalignment and sleep disorders.

The consequences of disruption to the circadian system and sleep are profound and include myriad metabolic ramifications, some of which may be compounded by adverse effects on dietary choices. If not addressed, the deleterious effects of such disruption will continue to cause widespread health problems; therefore, implementation of the numerous behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions that can help restore circadian system alignment and enhance sleep will be important.

### Current challenges and future directions in the assessment of glucocorticoid status [^114y1vLJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In healthy people who sleep at night, cortisol is released in both an ultradian pattern (1 to 2 hourly cortisol pulses) and a circadian rhythm, rising from approximately 04:00, peaking within three hours after waking (cortisol awakening response), and subsequently declining to reach a nadir around midnight. The frequency and amplitude of cortisol secretion are crucial to ensure synchronization of endogenous cellular rhythms to external cues. Clock genes in peripheral cells are responsible for circadian timekeeping with the activity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are modulated in the presence of external cues (e.g. light, feeding, temperature). Notably, acetylation of the glucocorticoid receptor by CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription factors is increased in the morning, leading to decreased cortisol tissue sensitivity.

The diurnal rhythm of circulating cortisol concentrations plays a significant role in sleep timing and distribution of sleep stages throughout the night. However, the relationship is bidirectional, with sleep onset and sleep disruption also influencing the release of cortisol. Sleep onset inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, typically within the first 20 minutes after slow-wave sleep, with cortisol reaching a low level in the first half of the night. In the second half of the night, rapid eye movement sleep predominates, and inhibitory mechanisms are attenuated, which is associated with an increase in HPA activity. Nocturnal awakenings at the end of sleep are associated with transient release of cortisol, followed by temporary inhibition.

Some of the earliest evidence in humans of a role for the timing of eating in cardiometabolic health came from a series of experiments conducted on volunteers at the University of Minnesota. In one of these studies, participants were restricted to eat only in the morning (breakfast) or the evening (dinner), and physiological parameters were measured throughout the day. Results demonstrated that shifting the timing of eating impacted diurnal patterns of blood pressure, temperature, and circulating levels of immune cells. Most notably, restricting eating to the evening delayed the acrophases of growth hormone and insulin and advanced the timing of peak cortisol levels, suggesting that later eating could adversely impact glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, a lesser reduction in body weight was observed when participants' only meal was in the evening versus the morning.

Subsequent animal experiments also reported differential effects of early versus late food availability on physiological outcomes, including body weight regulation. Some of the key studies have been highlighted in previous reviews. A study that is largely credited with returning public attention to a potential independent impact of meal timing on cardiometabolic function was published in 2009 and demonstrated that mice fed a high‐fat diet exclusively during their typical active/feeding period (i.e. the dark phase for nocturnal animals) gained significantly less weight than mice fed exclusively during their typical rest/fasting period (i.e. the light phase). The misaligned timing of feeding resulted in larger increases in weight.

### Plasma insulin profiles after subcutaneous injection: How close can we get to physiology in people with diabetes [^112U4KaK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Average meal‐time insulin profile

As with basal insulin secretion, meal‐time insulin secretion is pulsatile and regulated on a timescale of 3–10 minutes. Ingestion of an oral glucose load, or administration of intravenous (i.v.) glucose as a bolus or square wave, cannot imitate physiological insulin delivery at meal times. Glucose loads lack other nutrients, which may also affect stomach emptying (fat) or insulin secretion (amino acids). Food taken orally will result in 'anticipatory' insulin secretion through learned reflexes, and notably by incretins secreted from the gut wall. It is estimated that as much as 70% of postprandial insulin secretion can be accounted for by the incretin effect; however, a primed i.v. dose of glucose will elicit a very rapid 'first‐phase' secretion of insulin, showing that the islet β cells contain a depot of presynthesized insulin ready for immediate secretion into the bloodstream.

Figures 1 A and B present insulin profiles. Figure 1 A shows a mean 24‐hour insulin/C‐peptide profile in healthy individuals after high‐carbohydrate meals. Figure 1 B focuses on the insulin/glucose profile during the overnight and breakfast period. These results will not necessarily apply to an individual's meal intake in the real-world setting, where the composition and size of meals vary. Meal size might only affect the magnitude of the response, while meal composition, including the nature of the carbohydrate ingested, may affect the duration of the profile. Furthermore, insulin responses to meals may vary within individuals, with relative glucose intolerance in the afternoon.

### A multiple hypothesis approach to estimating meal times in individuals with type 1 diabetes [^114VuWk3]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate information regarding when individuals with type 1 diabetes have eaten and taken insulin is important to reconcile these events with their blood glucose levels throughout the day. Insulin pumps and connected insulin pens provide records of when the user injected insulin and the recorded carbohydrate intake. However, the exact timing of meals is often unclear. This project demonstrates a method to estimate meal times using a multiple hypothesis approach.

- **Methods**: When an insulin dose is recorded, multiple hypotheses were generated to describe variations of when the meal in question occurred. As postprandial glucose values informed the model, the posterior probability of the truth of each hypothesis was evaluated, leading to an expected meal time. This method was tested using simulation and a clinical data set (n = 11), with either uniform or normally distributed (μ = 0, σ = 10 or 20 minutes) prior probabilities for the hypothesis set.

- **Results**: For the simulation data set, meals were estimated with an average error of -0.77 (± 7.94) minutes when uniform priors were used, and -0.99 (± 8.55) and -0.88 (± 7.84) for normally distributed priors (σ = 10 and 20 minutes). For the clinical data set, the average estimation error was 0.02 (± 30.87), 1.38 (± 21.58), and 0.04 (± 27.52) for the uniform priors and normal priors (σ = 10 and 20 minutes).

- **Conclusion**: This technique could potentially be used to advise physicians about the mealtime insulin dosing behaviors of their patients and influence changes in their treatment.

### Advancing chrononutrition for cardiometabolic health: A 2023 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop report [^114nhDCV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Within the nascent field of chrononutrition, the need for a unified framework and consistent terminology is becoming increasingly apparent. Some urgent needs are as follows:

- **Encouraging eating relative to biological timing**: Meals are typically eaten according to the time of day based on societal or cultural norms. However, optimal eating times are likely defined by biological clocks and an individual's chronotype. The gold-standard approach for determining biological timing of eating is to evaluate the timing of eating relative to dim-light melatonin onset or the dim-light melatonin offset. Recognizing that dim-light melatonin onset and offset tests are costly and laborious, examining eating time relative to sleep–wake timing (e.g. sleep onset time, midpoint of sleep, wake time) may be an effective proxy.

- **Promoting 24-hour repeated measurements of outcomes**: Beyond the assessment of diurnal patterns of eating, cardiometabolic outcomes should also be measured over the course of the 24-hour day to better characterize the effects of chrononutrition on health, as has been encouraged previously. Most biomarkers of metabolic health and disease risk oscillate over the day, and moreover, postprandial measures of metabolic risk factors are substantially more sensitive to circadian phase, circadian misalignment, and interventions than fasting values. If outcomes are assessed only at a single fasted time point, which most studies do, or when levels are biologically low, there may be limited understanding of the relationship between chrononutrition and health outcomes.

Meal behavior

To account for interrelationships between the timing and amount of consecutive meals that are observed in real life, we adopt bootstrap sampling in the following sense: Consider a database of meals where for a meal we have the associated meal time of day and amount, respectively. We assume meal follows meal m (i.e. meals are ordered by time). Using this information, we can construct the set of meals that is, meals that took place at approximately time of a size approximately equal to the previous meal. As illustrated in Figure 4, both the size and the timing of a meal depend on the timing and size of the meal just prior. To mimic this behavior, given a meal time N and size, meals are uniformly sampled from the set — the set of meals following meals in the set. Based on our data sets, the time between meals has a mean of 3.64 hours (standard deviation of 2.73), median of 3.16 hours, where the lowest 5% of these times fall below 25 minutes, and the 95% fall under 8.75 hours. The average meal size is 39.6 g (24.8 g).

- **Relationship between consecutive meal times and sizes**: Illustrated using values of (g) in Figure 4.

Bolus and fingerstick behavior

Figure 5 models fingerstick and bolus behavior. The subject responds probabilistically to a triggering event (e.g. meal or hyperglycemia), and applies a bolus if necessary according to functional therapy parameters. For example, in the top-left of Figure 5, we illustrate how the in-silico subject responds to persistent hyperglycemia (two consecutive hours of high glucose > 220 mg/dl): A fingerstick is applied with a fixed probability.

### Misaligned hormonal rhythmicity: Mechanisms of origin and their clinical significance [^116gDLhA]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **What is hormonal misalignment**: Many hormones in the body oscillate with different frequencies and amplitudes, creating a dynamic environment that is essential for maintaining healthy homeostasis. A central clock in the hypothalamus governs this dynamic environment, but clock mechanisms are present in all peripheral tissues. A systems-level coordination of these clocks is necessary to sustain health in the face of perturbations. This involves key physiological processes including hormonal regulation of the stress response, metabolism, and sleep. Although these hormone rhythms are controlled endogenously, external stimuli, particularly the timing of stressors, meals, sleep, and light exposure, can profoundly influence them.

In humans, disruptions to these rhythms are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Comprehensive studies have measured the effects of forced desynchrony in the light-dark cycle and of meal timing on hormonal rhythmicity and other physiological variables. High-frequency plasma measurements in healthy individuals subject to overnight wakefulness have shown phase shifts and amplitude changes in cortisol and melatonin profiles. The resulting rhythm misalignment is also characterized by systematic increases in postprandial glucose, insulin, and mean arterial pressure, systematic decreases in leptin and sleep efficiency, increased variability of catecholamines, and an inversion of circadian cortisol profiles.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114Lnah4]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in pregnant patients concerning glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring. This is essential to achieve optimal glucose levels in patients with diabetes during pregnancy. The recommended glucose goals are as follows: fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L); either 1-hour postprandial glucose < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^111f4irG]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The light-entrainable clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is only sensitive to nutritional cues associated with metabolically challenging conditions, but not to meal timing per se. For instance, calorie restriction modifies the phase of the SCN clock and augments the phase-shifting effects of light. Moreover, hypercaloric (i.e. high-fat) feeding affects the SCN clock by lengthening its period and reducing its sensitivity to phase-shifting light exposure.

Under normal conditions, the temporal organization of locomotor activity is controlled by the master clock. However, enforced locomotor activity during the usual rest period can have synchronizing effects on the SCN, thus providing feedback cues to the pacemaker. Behavioral activation in nocturnal rodents, such as novelty-induced wheel-running, transient hyperactivity, and/or stimulated arousal during the usual rest period, all produce significant phase advances of the SCN clock. In humans, exercise of high intensity at the beginning of the night (i.e. the early rest period) and at the beginning of the subjective day (i.e. early wake time) induces phase delays and phase advances of the onset of melatonin secretion, respectively, used here as a marker of the phase of the master clock. In contrast to the SCN, peripheral clocks, such as those in the pituitary gland, can also be sensitive to the synchronizing effects of body temperature cues.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^113By8X4]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Although the environmental light-dark cycle is the primary external synchronizer, or zeitgeber, of the master clock in the SCN, the timing of food intake and fasting has recently been recognized as a potent synchronizer of peripheral clocks. The central SCN clock regulates behavioral rhythms, including the sleep-wake and feeding cycles, and also entrains peripheral clocks via neural and humoral mechanisms, including the activity of the two branches of the autonomous nervous system and the rhythmic release of glucocorticoids (GCs) and melatonin. A regular 24-hour temporal organization is thought to be important for good health. Laboratory studies manipulating circadian organization in both humans and rodents, as well as a vast literature on the epidemiology of shift work, have documented that misalignment of central and peripheral clocks has adverse health consequences.

Because glucocorticoid receptors (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1, NR3C1, referred to as GR in the remainder of this text) are widely distributed in both the central nervous system and the periphery, the robust rhythm of GC release can be viewed as a major internal synchronizing signal of the mammalian circadian system. In contrast, mineralocorticoid receptors (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 2, NR3C2; referred to as MRs in the remainder of this text) no longer respond when levels of glucocorticoids are elevated above basal values and therefore do not mediate circadian modulation of target tissue activity. A corollary of this concept is that alterations in the 24-hour rhythm of GCs…

### Glucose variability [^111JRrNR]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

There should be no doubt that pharmacological advances directed to the ultimate goal of physiological insulin replacement will continue, with the eventual development of faster-acting/shorter-duration insulins to the point where the postprandial glycemic curve will be bent to conform to that of nondiabetic subjects. In that utopian situation, the currently available measures of glycemic variability can be retired.

In their place, specific metrics that characterize the primary features of the meal-related excursion, such as glucose rise to peak, time to peak, and timeliness of recovery to baseline glycemia, would be appropriate.

- **Figure 5**: The orange line represents a stylized depiction of the best achievable meal-related glucose control in diabetes. Once therapies become available to align the postprandial curve with that of nondiabetic subjects (yellow line), new metrics will be required. Metrics like glucose rise to peak (∆G), time to peak (∆T), and percentage baseline recovery 1 hour after peak (-∆G/∆G) have been used for this purpose. Average values for these metrics in normal subjects are ∆G = 40 mg/dL, ∆T = 45 minutes, and baseline recovery 1 hour after peak = 90%.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1C: the A1C-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^114vv7qx]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Calculated indexes of glycemia: Indexes of glucose variability and postprandial glucose levels were calculated from the glucose monitoring data. The average blood glucose and standard deviation (SD) were calculated based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and the seven-point self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (LifeScan) data. A combined average blood glucose was calculated from CGM and SMBG, weighted by the days of monitoring for each. Indexes based on CGM were calculated after the exclusion of the initial 2 hours of monitoring, considered an unstable calibration period.

- **Intraday glucose variability**: Two indexes of intraday glucose variability were calculated based on CGM: the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and the continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA). MAGE is the mean of the differences between consecutive peaks and nadirs, only including changes > 1 SD of glycemic values, capturing only major fluctuations. For the calculation of CONGA n, the difference between the observation and the observation n hours previously is calculated for each observation after the first n hours. The CONGA n is the SD of these differences. We analyzed CONGA for 1, 2, and 4 hours. Both high MAGE and CONGA values indicate high intraday glucose variability.

- **Overall hyperglycemia indicator**: As an indicator of overall hyperglycemia, the 24-hour cumulative exposure to glucose levels above different thresholds was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) of CGM above levels of 7.0, 11.1, and 16.7 mmol/l (or 126, 200, and 300 mg/dl, respectively). This was done for the first 24 hours of each CGM period after the initial calibration period. Indexes of nocturnal blood glucose were calculated as t

### Incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus: Properties, functions, and clinical implications [^112hRRve]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), are secreted by cells of the gastrointestinal tract in response to meal ingestion. They exert important glucoregulatory effects, including the glucose-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells. Research into the defective incretin action in type 2 diabetes mellitus suggests that the observed loss of insulinotropic activity may primarily result from a decreased responsiveness of β-cells to GIP. Although GLP-1 retains efficacy, it is not at physiologic levels. Augmenting GLP-1 is a logical therapeutic strategy to address this deficiency. However, the short metabolic half-life of the native hormone makes direct infusion impractical.

GLP-1 receptor agonists, which resist degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and have protracted-action kinetics, have been developed. Additionally, DPP-4 inhibitors, which slow the enzymatic cleavage of native GLP-1, provide alternative approaches to enhancing incretin-mediated glucose control. Despite this, GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors operate on highly divergent mechanisms of action. DPP-4 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and is involved in a wide range of physiologic processes, in addition to its influence on incretin hormone biological activity. GLP-1 receptor agonists provide a pharmacologic level of GLP-1 receptor stimulation, whereas DPP-4 inhibitors appear to increase levels of circulating GLP-1 to within the physiologic range.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115bQN2i]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diabetes mellitus type 1 in pediatric patients, particularly concerning glucose monitoring, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend that all young patients with T1DM should monitor glucose levels multiple times daily. This includes up to 10 times per day using a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring. Monitoring should occur before meals and snacks, at bedtime, and as needed for safety in specific situations, such as physical activity, driving, or when symptoms of hypoglycemia are present.

### A glucose-only model to extract physiological information from postprandial glucose profiles in subjects with normal glucose tolerance [^114M6fpg]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Low credibility.

A glucose-based model to describe postprandial glucose responses from different meals in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) is presented. This new glucose-only model (GOM) has been formulated and validated using the physiology-based original mixed model (OMM). Analyzing the weighted residuals and root mean square error (RMSE) demonstrates that the GOM can describe the glucose data equally well and possesses sufficient flexibility to account for the large variability in the responses.

The ability of the GOM to provide information on insulin sensitivity is indicated by a significant correlation between the parameters and insulin sensitivity measures. For the high-carbohydrate (HCHO) meal, the correlation coefficient of 0.7 is comparable to commonly used surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity, such as HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index, where correlation values of 0.65 and 0.73, respectively, against clamping results have been reported.

Further evidence for the informative value of the parameter is given by the fact that it displays the same differences between male and female subjects for the different meal types, as the parameter. In contrast, the interpretability of values across meal types is weakened by the significant difference observed between meal types (P = 0.04) that is not evident in values (P = 0.45).

There are two inherent limitations in using only glucose data to assess insulin sensitivity. Firstly, it can rarely be the case that the dynamic properties of glucose and insulin levels, such as the timing and existence of peaks, exhibit very little similarity, thus violating one of the modeling assumptions.

### Acute physiological effects of glucocorticoids on fuel metabolism in humans are permissive but not direct [^113AgNyz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

It is noteworthy that only supraphysiological cortisol concentrations increased lipolysis, whereas cortisol levels similar to physiological early morning concentrations (approximately 400 nM) did not increase whole-body lipolysis compared with low cortisol levels (approximately 150 nM). This suggests that acute diurnal variation in cortisol concentrations may not substantially alter lipolysis during normal physiology, although the physiological response to "clamped" cortisol levels may differ from the ultradian rhythm. Additionally, we clamped several other hormones to prevent confounding effects, indicating that the physiological rise in these hormones may be critical for the glucocorticoid-dependent diurnal variation in lipolysis.

It is possible that cortisol concentrations less than 150 nM, such as in Addison's disease, could have reduced lipolysis further, although in vitro studies showed that 0 nM cortisol did not reduce lipolysis compared with 100 nM. Another unexpected finding was the absence of effect of even high cortisol concentrations on glucose uptake or production, highlighting the fact that the known effects of glucocorticoids to raise blood glucose concentrations are also permissive and are probably mediated through effects on other tissues like the pancreas. However, the glucose infusion rate was reduced on low glucocorticoids compared with the other phases in the low-insulin group, suggesting that with greater numbers, we might have found a reduction in endogenous glucose production. Furthermore, cortisol may have enhanced glucose uptake and/or suppressed glucose disposal if we had infused larger doses.

### Misaligned hormonal rhythmicity: Mechanisms of origin and their clinical significance [^115cyhfL]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

From a dynamical point of view, disruptions in hormonal rhythms can vary in severity and be either transient (i.e. short-lived) or chronic. In many cases, these disruptions can lead to misaligned hormonal rhythmicity, understood as the loss of either the normal physiological frequency, amplitude, or phase synchrony between hormonal rhythms. A discussion on the specific case of circadian misalignment can be found in this context. It is also important to distinguish between desynchronization (i.e. loss of phase-locking) and the broader term of rhythm misalignment.

While desynchronization refers exclusively to changes in the oscillatory phase difference between at least two signals, rhythm misalignment implies a deviation in oscillatory properties (not limited to phase) from an accepted standard where rhythms are considered to be 'aligned'. From an endocrine perspective, aligned hormonal rhythms would correspond to the normal physiological dynamic environment observed in healthy individuals subject to diurnal environmental and behavioral cues (e.g. light-dark cycle, daytime physical activity, regular meal timing). This definition immediately calls for additional considerations relating to the intra- and interindividual variability in hormonal rhythmicity that can be recognized within a physiological standard.

While the statistical quantification of such variability is still the subject of research, mathematical methods can help outline these definitions in unambiguous, quantitative terms, while at the same time facilitating the implementation of computer algorithms to detect hormonal rhythm misalignments.

### Lowering physical activity impairs glycemic control in healthy volunteers [^117KBfkg]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2012). Low credibility.

Postprandial glucose (PPG) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and death, regardless of diabetes status. While changes in physical activity produce changes in insulin sensitivity, it is not clear whether changes in daily physical activity directly affect PPG in healthy, free-living persons.

- **Methods**: We used continuous glucose monitors to measure PPG and PPG excursions (ΔPPG, postmeal - premeal blood glucose) at 30-minute increments after meals in healthy, habitually active volunteers (n = 12, age = 29 ± 1 yr, body mass index = 23.6 ± 0.9 kg·m(-2), VO2max = 53.6 ± 3.0 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1)) during three days of habitual (≥ 10,000 steps per day) and reduced (< 5000 steps per day) physical activity. Diets were standardized across monitoring periods, and fasting-state oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed on the fourth day of each monitoring period.

- **Results**: During three days of reduced physical activity (12,956 ± 769 to 4,319 ± 256 steps per day), PPG increased at 30 and 60 minutes following a meal (6.31 ± 0.19 to 6.68 ± 0.23 mmol·L(-1) and 5.75 ± 0.16 to 6.26 ± 0.28 mmol·L(-1), P < 0.05 relative to corresponding active time point), and ΔPPG increased by 42%, 97%, and 33% at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following a meal, respectively (P < 0.05). Insulin and C-peptide responses to the OGTT increased after three days of reduced activity (P < 0.05), while the glucose response to the OGTT did not change significantly.

- **Conclusions**: Thus, despite evidence of compensatory increases in plasma insulin during an OGTT, ΔPPG assessed by continuous glucose monitoring systems increased markedly during periods of reduced physical activity.

### Large enhancement of response times of a protein conformational switch by computational design [^111kMss7]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The design of protein conformational switches — or proteins that change conformations in response to a signal such as ligand binding — has great potential for developing novel biosensors, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic agents. Among the defining properties of such switches, the response time has been the most challenging to optimize. Here, we apply a computational design strategy in synergistic combination with biophysical experiments to rationally improve the response time of an engineered protein-based Ca 2+ -sensor in which the switching process occurs via mutually exclusive folding of two alternate frames. Notably, our strategy identifies mutations that increase switching rates by as much as 32-fold, achieving response times on the order of fast physiological Ca 2+ fluctuations. Our computational design strategy is general and may aid in optimizing the kinetics of other protein conformational switches.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^114E2KQQ]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, especially in pediatric patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend the use of continuous glucose monitoring metrics derived from continuous glucose monitor use over the most recent 14 days. It is advised to extend the monitoring period for younger patients with more glycemic variability, including metrics such as time in range (70–180 mg/dL; 3.9–10.0 mmol/L) and time below range (< 70 mg/dL; < 3.9 mmol/L). Additionally, time above range is noted for instances when glucose levels exceed 180 mg/dL and 250 mg/dL (> 10.0 mmol/L and > 13.9 mmol/L). These measures should be utilized in conjunction with HbA1c whenever possible.

### Effects of differing durations of antecedent hypoglycemia on counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia in normal humans [^115LYkBH]. Diabetes (2000). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the duration of antecedent hypoglycemia regulates the magnitude of subsequent counterregulatory failure. A total of 31 lean, healthy overnight-fasted individuals (16 men and 15 women) were studied. Fifteen subjects (8 men and 7 women) underwent two separate 2-day randomized experiments separated by at least 2 months. On day 1, 2-hour hyperinsulinemic (9 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) euglycemic (5.2 ± 0.1 mmol/l) or hypoglycemic (2.9 ± 0.1 mmol/l) glucose clamps (prolonged hypoglycemia) were carried out in the morning and afternoon.

Of the other subjects, 16 participated in a 2-day study where day 1 consisted of morning and afternoon short-duration hypoglycemia experiments (hypoglycemic nadir of 2.9 ± 0.1 mmol for 5 minutes), and 10 of these individuals underwent an additional 2-day study where day 1 consisted of morning and afternoon intermediate-duration hypoglycemia (hypoglycemic nadir of 2.9 ± 0.1 mmol for 30 minutes).

The next morning (day 2) all subjects underwent an additional 2-hour hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp (2.9 ± 0.1 mmol/l). The rate of fall of glucose (0.07 mmol/min) was carefully controlled during all hypoglycemic studies, so the glucose nadir was reached at 30 minutes. Despite equivalent day 2 plasma glucose and insulin levels, there were significant differences in counterregulatory physiological responses. Steady-state epinephrine, glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, and pancreatic polypeptide levels were similarly and significantly blunted (P < 0.01) by the differing duration of day 1 hypoglycemia.

### Eating vegetables before carbohydrates improves postprandial glucose excursions [^113szFm1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The glucose fluctuations were assessed by the following parameters obtained from the continuous glucose monitoring system and compared between the day of eating vegetables before carbohydrates and the day of eating the carbohydrates before the vegetables: the mean plasma glucose, standard deviation, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions, largest amplitude of glycaemic excursions, postprandial plasma glucose, incremental area under the curve 0–3h (IAUC 0–3h), and incremental glucose peak.

Nineteen outpatients with Type 2 diabetes (men/women 6/13; age 65.5 ± 9.4 years, duration of diabetes 16.4 ± 10.2 years; BMI 22.5 ± 3.1 kg/m²; HbA1c 55.0 ± 10.9 mmol/mol (7.2 ± 1.0%); fasting plasma glucose 8.06 ± 2.67 mmol/l, diet/oral hypoglycaemic agents/insulin + oral hypoglycaemic agents 3/3/13) and 21 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (men/women 2/19; age 29.8 ± 11.3 years; BMI 20.8 ± 3.0 kg/m²; HbA1c 36.0 ± 6.6 mmol/mol (5.4 ± 0.6%); fasting plasma glucose 4.89 ± 0.50 mmol/l) were enrolled in the study.

- **Significant reductions**: The levels of standard deviation, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions, largest amplitude of glycaemic excursions, 1-hour postprandial plasma glucose of breakfast, IAUC 0–3h of lunch and dinner, mean IAUC 0–3h, and incremental glucose peak were significantly reduced when the participants ate vegetables before carbohydrates compared with the reverse regimen in both subjects with Type 2 diabetes and those with normal glucose tolerance. However, the values of mean plasma glucose were not different in either of the subject groups.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: Causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^1169nQ8s]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Mankind's historic fascination with the temporal world has taken many forms, from pilgrimages to Stonehenge at the time of the summer solstice for over 5000 years to fanciful notions about time travel. This world has shaped life by means of such rhythmic environmental stimuli as the 24-hour light/dark (LD) cycle, stimuli that have made organisms evolve their own timing systems to anticipate and adapt to daily and seasonal cycles.

Thomas Edison's seminal invention of the electric light bulb in 1879 brought unprecedented possibilities, and the American inventor is attributed with once remarking, "The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease". Little was he aware that mistimed use of his great gift to the world is now one of several human-imposed environmental changes that predispose us to many diseases by way of circadian rhythm and sleep disruption.

The purposes of this review are to detail our knowledge about the causes and metabolic consequences of such disruption and to highlight strategies to counteract these consequences. Although studies of other animals have been pivotal in furthering our understanding of the regulation of the circadian system and sleep, it may be premature to extrapolate findings from commonly studied model organisms, particularly nocturnal ones, to our own diurnal species. Therefore, this review focuses on human studies of healthy participants where possible.

### Target for glycemic control: Concentrating on glucose [^111EyEpv]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A tool for establishing the contributions of fasting and postprandial glucose to overall hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

In recent years, new data have provided further information for the ongoing debate over whether A1C, fasting glucose, and postprandial glucose contribute equally or not to the overall hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. A few years ago, in non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, we found that postlunch and extended postlunch plasma glucose values correlated better with overall glycemic control, as estimated from A1C, than did prebreakfast and prelunch glucose levels.

In the same type of patients, Bonora et al. reported that preprandial plasma glucose concentrations were related to A1C more strongly than postprandial concentrations. In an analysis of a dataset collected in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, Rohlfing et al. reported that better correlation with A1C was obtained for postlunch and mean daily glucose concentrations. These study-to-study discrepancies are certainly confounding information for clinical practice.

By contrast, from a scientific point of view, these differences are not surprising, since it is well known that the multiple regression analysis used for studying the relationship between A1C and glucose values at different times is an unstable model when explanatory variables, i.e. the glucose values in the present example, are intercorrelated. To provide a correct answer, we used a different methodology that consisted of calculating two incremental areas under a four-point diurnal glycemic profile.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115zZayD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly concerning pregnant patients and their glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes during pregnancy to achieve optimal glucose levels.

- **Glucose goals**: Set the following glucose goals: FBG < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L), and either 1-hour postprandial glucose < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### Target for glycemic control: Concentrating on glucose [^112DUTcc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin should be implemented as soon as oral hypoglycemic agents at maximal doses do not achieve satisfactory diabetic control. Currently, it is widely accepted that patients with a sustained level of A1C > 8% should be treated with insulin. For these patients, basal hyperglycemia is more prevalent than prandial hyperglycemia; therefore, insulin regimens based on basal insulin are preferred over prandial insulin at the initiation of insulin therapy. If the target cannot be achieved, premeal boluses of rapid insulin analogs should be added, particularly before meals that cause significant glycemic excursions.

The issue becomes more complex for patients with A1C levels between 7% and 8%. Many patients in this range are hesitant to begin insulin treatment. Despite recent publications advocating for more stringent recommendations, many physicians delay insulin treatment until further deterioration in A1C occurs. New recommendations suggest that insulin treatment should be commenced once A1C remains above 7%, alongside the maximal doses of oral hypoglycemic agents that combine insulin sensitizers (metformin + glitazone) with an insulin secretagogue. These recommendations align with our data, as the average time between when A1C levels reach 7% and 8% is approximately four years, which is not insignificant in terms of risk for the development or progression of diabetic complications.

### The basis for weekly insulin therapy: Evolving evidence with insulin icodec and insulin efsitora alfa [^112JPV5u]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Exogenously administered basal insulins have been designed to mimic the prolonged time-action of secreted endogenous insulin. Specifically, they create a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, which is the serum insulin concentration that concomitantly drives intermeal pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on glucose. In this context, key terms will be used to describe therapeutic basal insulin properties.

- **Insulin pharmacokinetics**: The PK/PD profile for basal insulin shows key PK/PD parameters after administration of a single dose once the maintenance phase (steady state) has been achieved. Important parameters include:
	- **P/T ratio**: Difference between the highest and lowest concentration of injected insulin at steady state.
	- **T 1/2**: The time it takes for 50% of the drug to be eliminated relative to the C max.
	- **AUC**: Area under the curve.
	- **C max**: Peak insulin concentration reached.
	- **GIR**: Glucose infusion rate.
	- **GIR max**: Time of maximum glucose infusion rate.
	- **INS**: Insulin (analogue) concentration.
	- **PD**: Pharmacodynamic.
	- **PK**: Pharmacokinetic.
	- **T max**: Time when peak insulin concentration is reached. (Reproduced with permission from Heise and Meneghini.)

With the development of ultra-long-acting basal insulins, clinicians may be concerned about insulin doses overlapping or accumulating. Consequently, understanding the concept of insulin "steady state" is crucial. This steady state refers to a dynamic equilibrium in insulin concentration that exists within therapeutic limits between doses. To reach steady-state conditions with basal insulins, controlled accumulation is used.

### A prospective study on glucagon responses to oral glucose and mixed meal and 7-year change in fasting glucose [^1138TcvM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The role of insufficient glucagon suppression after an oral load in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the association between glucagon responses at baseline and fasting glucose levels 7 years later.

- **Methods**: Data from the Hoorn Meal Study were used, an observational cohort study among 121 individuals without diabetes with a mean age of 61.1 ± 6.7 years, with 50% being female. The glucagon response to an oral glucose tolerance test and mixed meal test was expressed as early and late incremental area under the curve. The association with change in fasting glucose levels at follow-up was assessed by linear regression analysis.

- **Results**: The early glucagon response following the mixed meal test was associated with an increase in fasting glucose levels of 0.18 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.04–0.31, P = 0.01), per unit increase in the incremental area under the curve of glucagon, adjusted for confounders. No significant associations were observed for the late response after the mixed meal test or oral glucose tolerance test.

- **Conclusions**: Within a population without diabetes, a relative lack of glucagon suppression early following a meal was associated with increased glucose levels over time, suggesting a role of insufficient glucagon suppression in the deterioration of glycaemic control.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^114iEbhi]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Mean (+SEM) profiles of plasma cortisol (top panels), insulin secretion rates (ISR, middle panels), and plasma glucose (lower panels) were evaluated in nine healthy young men, each of whom participated in four studies performed in randomized order. In all four studies, endogenous cortisol levels were suppressed by metyrapone administration, while caloric intake was solely in the form of a constant glucose infusion. Dark horizontal bars represent the scheduled sleep periods. The daily cortisol elevation was restored by oral administration of hydrocortisone (or placebo — data not illustrated) either at the normal time of the circadian peak (5, left panels) or 12 hours out of phase (5, right panels).

Vertical arrows indicate the timing of hydrocortisone administration in each study. Horizontal lines on the ISR and glucose graphs show, respectively, the mean ISR and glucose levels at the time of hydrocortisone ingestion to facilitate the visualization of post-hydrocortisone changes. The initial effect of the hydrocortisone-induced cortisol pulse was a short-term inhibition of insulin secretion without concomitant glucose changes, and the magnitude of this acute effect was similar in the evening and in the morning. At both times of day, starting 4–6 hours after hydrocortisone administration, there was a delayed hyperglycemic effect that was minimal in the morning but much more pronounced in the evening, when it was associated with a robust increase in insulin secretion.

### Misaligned hormonal rhythmicity: Mechanisms of origin and their clinical significance [^1179ECsh]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Rhythmic hormonal secretion is key for sustaining health. While a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus is the main driver of circadian periodicity, many hormones oscillate with different frequencies and amplitudes. These rhythms carry information about healthy physiological functions, while at the same time they must be able to respond to external cues and maintain their robustness against severe perturbations. Since endocrine disruptions can lead to hormonal misalignment and disease, understanding the clinical significance of these rhythms can help support diagnosis and disease management.

While the misalignment of dynamic hormone profiles can be quantitatively analyzed through statistical and computational techniques, mathematical modeling can provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underpinning endocrine rhythms, particularly regarding what makes them robust to some perturbations but fragile to others. In this study, I will review the key challenges of understanding hormonal rhythm misalignment from a mathematical perspective, including their causes and clinical significance. By reviewing modeling examples of coupled endocrine axes, I will address the question of how perturbations in one endocrine axis propagate to another, leading to the more complex issue of disentangling the contribution of each endocrine system to a robust dynamic environment.

### Probabilistic evolving meal detection and estimation of meal total glucose appearance [^117XyHSt]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Automatic compensation of meals for type 1 diabetes patients requires meal detection from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) readings. This task is challenged by the uncertainty and variability inherent to the digestion process and glucose dynamics, as well as the lag and noise associated with CGM sensors. Thus, any estimation of meal start time, size, and shape is fundamentally uncertain. This uncertainty can be reduced, but not eliminated, by estimating total glucose appearance and integrating new readings as they become available.

- **Method**: In this article, we propose a probabilistic, evolving method to detect the presence and estimate the shape and total glucose appearance of a meal. The method is unique in continually evolving its estimates and simultaneously providing uncertainty measures to monitor their convergence. The algorithm operates in three phases. First, it compares the CGM signal to no-meal predictions made by a simple insulin-glucose model. Second, it fits the residuals to potential, assumed meal shapes. Finally, it compares and combines these fits to detect any meals and estimate the meal total glucose appearance, shape, and total glucose appearance uncertainty.

- **Results**: We validate the performance of this meal detection and total glucose appearance estimation algorithm both separately and in cooperation with a controller on the Food and Drug Administration-approved University of Virginia/Padova Type I Diabetes Simulator. In cooperation with a controller, the algorithm reduced the mean blood glucose from 137 to 132 mg/dl over 1.5 days of control.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (T1DM), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with presymptomatic T1DM for disease progression using HbA1c approximately every 6 months and a 75-g OGTT (fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose) annually. The frequency of monitoring should be modified based on individual risk assessments that consider factors such as age, number and type of autoantibodies, and glycemic metrics.

### Postprandial capillary-venous glucose gradient in type 1 diabetes: Magnitude and clinical associations in a real world setting [^112xkv4s]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The study results may inform the reporting of biochemical hypoglycemia, usually defined as a plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/l. The present study showed that, following a carbohydrate load, discordance can occur between the presence or absence of biochemical hypoglycemia as assessed by concomitant finger-stick capillary and antecubital fossa venous results. This may have clinical implications. For example, it raises considerations of possible hypoglycemic unawareness based on a postprandial laboratory plasma glucose just below the threshold for biochemical hypoglycemia, as it cannot be assumed that a concomitant finger-stick glucose result would be in the hypoglycemic range.

The study also has several limitations. Firstly, it was not designed to explore mechanisms that might be responsible for the observed glucose gradient and therefore does not offer any explanation for the genesis of the gradient. Secondly, the laboratory measurement of plasma glucose was used as an ancillary method of measurement only at final sample collection. However, Bland–Altman analysis supported the robustness of the glucose meter recordings relative to the measurement of laboratory plasma glucose.

A third limitation relates to the constraints associated with this study's real-world design, which included a wide choice of breakfast foods consumed over a variable period at the discretion of the patient. A more detailed assessment of the characteristics of the gradient would require a prescriptive, rather than a real-world study design. For example, it might include a prespecified…

For patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia, the EASO 2017 guidelines recommend directing treatment in the first 7–10 days after surgery toward fasting glucose values.

### Victoza [^111MDz4o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The pharmacodynamic profile of Victoza is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed following a single subcutaneous administration. Victoza lowered fasting, premeal, and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Fasting and postprandial glucose were measured before and up to five hours following a standardized meal. This was done after treatment to a steady state with 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg of Victoza, or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC0–300min was 35% lower after 1.2 mg of Victoza and 38% lower after 1.8 mg of Victoza.

- **Glucose-dependent insulin secretion**: The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) of Victoza on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response increased in a glucose-dependent manner.

- **Glucagon secretion**: Victoza lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion. A single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) of Victoza did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations.

- **Gastric emptying**: Victoza causes a delay in gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology (QTc)**: The effect of Victoza on cardiac repolarization was tested.

### Greater early postprandial suppression of endogenous glucose production and higher initial glucose disappearance is achieved with fast-acting insulin aspart compared with insulin aspart [^116umUDk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic endpoints were defined to assess the onset of exposure and early exposure, as previously described. The postprandial plasma glucose (PG) increment during the meal test was assessed by deriving the mean PG excursion from 0 to 1 hour (∆PG mean,0‐1h; primary endpoint) and from 0 to 2 hours (∆PG mean,0‐2h), as well as the PG excursion at 1 and 2 hours (∆PG 1h and ∆PG 2h).

Initial endogenous glucose production (EGP) suppression during the meal test was assessed by deriving the mean suppression of EGP during the first 30 minutes, 40 minutes, and 1 hour (suppression of EGP 0‐x). Suppression of EGP 0‐x was calculated as the baseline‐adjusted area over the EGP curve from time 0 to x, divided by the time period x (to obtain mean baseline‐adjusted EGP), and then divided by baseline EGP, expressed in percent. EGP suppression from baseline until a discrete time point (suppression of EGP x) was calculated as baseline EGP minus EGP at time x, divided by baseline EGP, and expressed in percent. Maximum EGP suppression was calculated as baseline EGP minus the minimum EGP, divided by baseline EGP, and expressed in percent.

The initial increase in glucose rate of disappearance (R d) during the meal test was assessed by deriving the area under the baseline‐adjusted glucose R d profile during the first hour (∆AUC Rd,0‐1h). The baseline glucose R d was set to baseline EGP, since glucose R d equals EGP in the fasting state.

The initial suppression of serum free fatty acid (FFA) concentration during the meal test was assessed by deriving the area over the baseline‐adjusted serum FFA concentration–time curve during the first hour (∆AOC FFA,0‐1h).

For specific circumstances concerning diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly regarding pediatric patients and glucose monitoring, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend the use of continuous glucose monitoring metrics. These metrics are derived from continuous glucose monitor use over the most recent 14 days, or longer for young patients with more glycemic variability. Key metrics include time in range (70–180 mg/dL; 3.9–10.0 mmol/L), time below range (less than 70 mg/dL; less than 3.9 mmol/L), and time above range (greater than 180 mg/dL and greater than 250 mg/dL; greater than 10.0 mmol/L and greater than 13.9 mmol/L). These should be used in conjunction with HbA1c whenever possible.

### Disrupting rhythms: Diet-induced obesity impairs diurnal rhythms in metabolic tissues [^116BMSkY]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

In this issue of Diabetes, Prasai et al. describe in detail some of the mechanisms underpinning how metabolic dysfunction hampers the clockwork and physiological rhythms in cardiovascular and metabolically relevant tissues in wild-type mice (see Fig. 1). In a diet-induced model of obesity, the authors demonstrate that cyclic expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Per2 are blunted in adipose tissue but unaffected in the aorta, liver, and muscle. Diurnal variations in cardiovascular physiology, such as aortal constriction in response to phenylephrine, blood pressure, and heart rate, were not affected by obesity. Diurnal variation in physiological measures of metabolic homeostasis was impaired in obese animals, with a reduction of peak glucose levels in response to glucose challenge and an attenuated glucose nadir in response to insulin challenge in the evening. The authors further examined the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism to elucidate second-order effects of rhythmic dysfunction. Interestingly, this revealed that rhythmic transcription of clock-associated genes such as Rev-erbα and Dbp, and metabolically relevant "output" genes such as Pparα and Pepck, were diminished in obese adipose tissue but remained largely unaffected in liver tissue.

- **Fig. 1**: Obesity is known to induce physiological changes in measures of gluconeogenesis, leptin secretion, blood pressure, and to elevate the risk of cardiac incidence. In this issue, Prasai et al. examine how diet-induced obesity interferes with the circadian clockwork in the liver, adipose, and c.

### Choosing the duration of continuous glucose monitoring for reliable assessment of time in range: A new analytical approach to overcome the limitations of correlation-based methods [^1144LnsX]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Reliable estimation of the time spent in different glycaemic ranges (time-in-ranges) requires sufficiently long continuous glucose monitoring. In a 2019 paper (Battelino et al, Clinical targets for continuous glucose monitoring data interpretation: recommendations from the international consensus on time in range. Diabetes Care. 2019;42:1593–1603), an international panel of experts suggested using a correlation-based approach to obtain the minimum number of days for reliable time-in-ranges estimates. More recently, in Camerlingo et al, Design of clinical trials to assess diabetes treatment: minimum duration of continuous glucose monitoring data to estimate time-in-ranges with the desired precision. Diabetes Obesity Metabolism. 2021;23:2446–2454, we presented a mathematical equation linking the number of monitoring days to the uncertainty around time-in-ranges estimates. In this work, we compare these two approaches, mainly focusing on time spent in the 70–180 mg/dL range (TIR).

- **Methods**: The first 100 and 150 days of data were extracted from study A (148 subjects, ~180 days), and the first 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 days of data from study B (45 subjects, ~365 days). For each of these data windows, the minimum monitoring duration was computed using correlation-based and equation-based approaches. The suggestions were compared for the windows of different durations extracted from the same study and for the windows of equal duration extracted from different studies.

- **Results**: When changing the dataset duration, the correlation-based approach produces inconsistent results.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114PmDbR]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, specifically with respect to glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes during pregnancy to achieve optimal glucose levels. The glucose goals are set as follows: fasting blood glucose (FBG) should be less than 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L), and either 1-hour postprandial glucose should be less than 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose should be less than 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### Plasma insulin profiles after subcutaneous injection: How close can we get to physiology in people with diabetes [^116FoKwg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Many people with diabetes rely on insulin therapy to achieve optimal blood glucose control. A fundamental aim of such therapy is to mimic the pattern of 'normal' physiological insulin secretion, thereby controlling basal and meal-time plasma glucose and fatty acid turnover. In people without diabetes, insulin release is modulated on a time base of 3–10 minutes, something that is impossible to replicate without intravascular glucose sensing and insulin delivery. Overnight physiological insulin delivery by islet β cells is unchanging, in contrast to requirements once any degree of hyperglycaemia occurs, when diurnal influences are evident.

Subcutaneous pumped insulin or injected insulin analogues can approach the physiological profile, but there remains the challenge of responding to day-to-day changes in insulin sensitivity. Physiologically, meal-time insulin release begins rapidly in response to reflex activity and incretins, continuing with the rise in glucose and amino acid concentrations. This rapid response reflects the need to fill the insulin space with maximum concentration as early as 30 minutes after starting the meal.

Meal-time insulins, by contrast, are associated with a delay after injection before absorption begins, and a delay to peak because of tissue diffusion. While decay from peak for monomeric analogues is not dissimilar to average physiological needs, changes in meal type and, again, in day-to-day insulin sensitivity, are difficult to match. Recent developments in insulin depot technology are moving towards establishing flatter basal and closer physiological profiles.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113uFsSQ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2025 guidelines provide recommendations for the follow-up and surveillance of diabetes mellitus type 1, focusing on the monitoring of glycemic status. These guidelines emphasize checking blood glucose levels based on the insulin therapy regimen. Blood glucose should be monitored when fasting, before meals and snacks, after meals, at bedtime, and in the middle of the night. It is also essential to measure blood glucose before, during, and after exercise; when hypoglycemia is suspected; after treating low blood glucose levels until normoglycemia is achieved; when hyperglycemia is suspected; and before and while performing critical tasks, such as driving.

### Faster-acting insulin aspart: Earlier onset of appearance and greater early pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects than insulin aspart [^111YJekz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Secondary pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints included the following: area under the curve (AUC) for various time intervals: AUC 0–15 min, AUC 0–30 min, AUC 0–1 h, AUC 0–1.5 h (post hoc endpoint), AUC 0–2 h, and AUC 0–12 h (i.e. total exposure), maximum concentration (C max), time to maximum concentration (t max), time to reach 50% maximum concentration (t50%C max; post hoc endpoint), and onset of appearance [defined as time from study drug administration until the first time free serum insulin aspart concentrations were equal to or higher than the lower limit of quantification (20 pmol/l)].

Pharmacokinetic samples were taken at the following times: before dosing (< 5 min before trial product administration), then at 2-minute intervals until 20 minutes after dosing, at 5-minute intervals from 20 to 80 minutes after dosing, at 10-minute intervals from 80 minutes to 2 hours after dosing, at 15-minute intervals from 2 to 3 hours after dosing, at 30-minute intervals from 3 to 4 hours after dosing, at 1-hour intervals from 4 to 8 hours after dosing, and at 2-hour intervals from 8 to 12 hours after dosing. Free serum insulin aspart concentrations were quantified using a validated insulin aspart-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The primary study endpoint was the AUC for the glucose infusion rate (GIR) from 0 to 2 hours (AUC GIR, 0–2 h). Secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints included AUC GIR, 0–30 min, AUC GIR, 0–1 h, AUC GIR, 0–1.5 h, AUC GIR, 0–12 h (i.e. total glucose-lowering effect), maximum GIR (GIR max), time to maximum GIR (tGIR max), and time to reach 50% maximum GIR (t50%GIR max; post hoc endpoint).

### Janumet [^112Vps9u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose. This response resulted in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal.

	- In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia.

- **Sitagliptin and metformin coadministration**: In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. The coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration.

### Time to elicit physiological and exertional vigorous responses from daily living activities: Setting foundations of an empirical definition of VILPA [^115wQCQJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) consists of bursts of incidental vigorous activity occurring during day-to-day activities outside the exercise-domain. It has shown promise in lowering the risk of mortality and chronic disease. However, an empirically derived definition is absent. Using physiological and effort-based metrics commonly used to define vigorous intensity, this study investigated the minimum time needed to elicit physiological and perceived exertion responses to standardized activities of daily living.

The study involved 70 adults (mean age = 58.0 ± 9.6 years; 35 females) who completed nine VILPA activities of daily living in a randomized order, including fast walking, fast incline walking, stair climbing, stationary cycling, and carrying external weight equal to 5% and 10% of body weight. During exercise, metabolic rate (measured by continuous indirect calorimetry), heart rate (measured by telemetry), and perceived effort (using the Borg Scale) were assessed. Time to reach VILPA was evaluated using %V̇O2max, %HRmax, and rating of perceived exertion thresholds.

The mean time to elicit VILPA ranged between 65 and 95 seconds (mean ± standard deviation = 76.7 ± 3.8 seconds) for %V̇O2max, 68 to 105 seconds (mean ± standard deviation = 82.8 ± 6.8 seconds) for %HRmax, and 20 to 60 seconds (mean ± standard deviation = 44.6 ± 6.7 seconds) for the rating of perceived exertion. For each of the three indices, there was no difference in the time required to elicit VILPA responses by sex or age (P > 0.08), and times were also consistent across daily living tasks.

### Diminished counterregulatory responses to meal-induced hypoglycemia 4 years after RYGB [^112U9Sks]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Post-bariatric hypoglycemia is a complication of bariatric surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The counterregulatory hormonal and sympathetic neural responses were measured during a previously reported meal test in which 48% of participants experienced an almost asymptomatic hypoglycemic event.

Forty-four randomly selected patients were studied 4 years after undergoing RYGB. A liquid meal test (MMT) was conducted after overnight fasting. Based on the glucose nadir during the MMT, patients were divided into a hypo group (glucose < 3.3 mmol/L) and a non-hypo group (glucose ≥ 3.3 mmol/L). Cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured up to 180 minutes after the ingestion of the meal. Incremental areas under the curve (iAUC), peak, and delta hormone responses after the glucose nadir were calculated, and parameters were compared between the hypo and non-hypo groups.

A total of 21 out of 44 participants (48%) experienced an almost asymptomatic hypoglycemic event. Cortisol and epinephrine responses in the hypo group were not increased compared to the non-hypo group, and there were no signs of increased sympathetic nerve activity. Peak and delta cortisol levels were lower in the hypo group compared to the non-hypo group. Norepinephrine levels were higher in the hypo group, especially in the time frames of 60–120 minutes and 120–180 minutes after the start of the meal.

No increase in epinephrine and a lower cortisol response to hypoglycemia were observed compared to normoglycemia during a meal test in patients after RYGB. Norepinephrine levels were higher in the hypo group. These findings may suggest that possible recurrences are linked to altered hormonal responses.

### Circadian rhythm of substrate oxidation and hormonal regulators of energy balance [^116pzyz4]. Obesity (2020). Low credibility.

The circadian system provides an organism with the ability to anticipate daily food availability and appropriately coordinate metabolic responses. Few studies have simultaneously assessed factors involved in both the anticipation of energy availability, such as hormones involved in appetite regulation, and subsequent metabolic responses, including energy expenditure and substrate oxidation, under conditions designed to reveal circadian rhythmicity.

- **Methods**: Eight healthy adults (four females; age: 28.0 ± 2.3 years; BMI: 24.3 ± 2.9 kg/m²) participated in a 26-hour constant routine protocol involving continuous wakefulness with constant posture, temperature, dim light, and hourly isocaloric snacks. Indirect calorimetry was performed every 3 hours for measurement of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Subjective hunger was obtained hourly using questionnaires. Saliva and plasma were obtained hourly to assess melatonin (a circadian phase marker) and hormones (leptin, ghrelin, and peptide YY).

- **Results**: Fat and carbohydrate oxidation was highest in the biological evening and morning, respectively. Subjective hunger ratings peaked during the middle of the biological day. Significant circadian rhythms were identified for ghrelin and peptide YY, with peaks in the biological evening and morning, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: These findings support a role for the circadian system in the modulation of nutrient oxidation, subjective measures of appetite, and appetitive hormones.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^112vSzLh]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

**Impact of the 24-hour rhythm of glucocorticoid levels on central and peripheral oscillators**: The 24-hour rhythm of adrenal corticosteroids provides temporal cues to circadian clocks and physiological rhythms in numerous central and peripheral tissues expressing glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Conversely, disturbances of the physiological rhythm of glucocorticoids (GCs) by chronic continuous administration of synthetic corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, or by adrenalectomy have been experimentally shown to markedly alter circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in multiple tissues. It is important to note that negative findings regarding the impact of adrenalectomy (a condition where GC concentrations are at nadir levels throughout the 24-hour cycle) on a given clock system do not exclude the possibility that an acute elevation of GC concentrations at the normal nadir time in an adrenalectomized animal will not disrupt rhythmic clock expression in target tissues. Multiple studies have obtained evidence for a role of GC in synchronizing local clocks by demonstrating altered rates of re-entrainment in adrenalectomized animals.

### The circulating IGF system and its relationship with 24-h glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects [^1124697o]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that circulating free IGF-I participates in glucose homeostasis and that IGFBP-1 reflects changes in insulin sensitivity. To study this further, we examined 10 healthy, nonobese subjects under standardized conditions for 24 hours with and without an intravenous infusion of glucose, the latter to augment insulin sensitivity. Serum was collected every 2 hours for analysis of free and total IGFs, IGFBP-1, 2, and 3, and the acid labile subunit (ALS). Insulin sensitivity was estimated at the end of each 24-hour study period using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp technique.

- **Results**: Glucose infusion resulted in mild hyperglycemia (P < 0.0001), a reduction in IGFBP-1 by approximately 40% (P < 0.0003), and increased insulin and C-peptide levels (P < 0.0001). Glucose infusion also increased insulin sensitivity (P < 0.003). However, despite the reduction in IGFBP-1, glucose infusion did not increase free IGF-I over the control level, and free IGF-II was slightly reduced (P < 0.02). Irrespective of glucose infusion, free IGF-I and II remained stable during daytime (i.e. they were unresponsive to meal-related changes in plasma glucose), but both free fractions decreased during the night, reaching nadir at 04:00 h. None of the other members of the IGF system showed any relationship with plasma glucose levels. Finally, we failed to observe any relationship between changes in insulin sensitivity and the circulating IGF system.

We found no evidence that the circulating IGF system is involved in meal-related blood glucose regulation in healthy subjects.

### The postprandial rise in plasma cortisol in men is mediated by macronutrient-specific stimulation of adrenal and extra-adrenal cortisol production [^115SuC6X]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Circadian variation is a fundamental characteristic of plasma glucocorticoids, with a postprandial rise in cortisol being an important feature. The diurnal rhythm is presumed to reflect alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. However, cortisol is produced not only by the adrenal glands but also by regeneration from cortisone by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, mainly in the liver and adipose tissue.

- **Objective**: We tested the contribution of peripheral cortisol regeneration to macronutrient-induced circadian variation of plasma cortisol in humans.

- **Design**: This was a randomized, single-blinded, crossover study conducted at a hospital research facility.

- **Participants**: Eight normal-weight healthy men participated in the study.

- **Interventions**: Subjects were given isocaloric energy isodense flavor-matched liquid meals composed of carbohydrate, protein, fat, or low-calorie placebo during the infusion of a stable isotope tracer 9,11,12,12-[2H]4-cortisol.

- **Outcome measures and results**: Plasma cortisol increased similarly after all macronutrient meals (by ∼90 nmol/L) compared with placebo. Carbohydrate stimulated adrenal secretion and extra-adrenal regeneration of cortisol to a similar degree. Protein and fat meals stimulated adrenal cortisol secretion to a greater degree than extra-adrenal cortisol regeneration. The increase in cortisol production by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 was in proportion to the increase in insulin. The postprandial cortisol rise was not accounted for by decreased cortisol clearance.

### Diurnal pattern of insulin action in type 1 diabetes: Implications for a closed-loop system [^1143hRKb]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Subject characteristics**: Twenty-eight subjects were screened for the study. There were five screening failures: two due to abnormal gastric emptying, two due to residual C-peptide secretion, and one due to poor venous access. Three additional subjects were withdrawn after successful screening because of the inability to obtain adequate venous access during the study.

The remaining 20 subjects completed all study procedures; however, one subject's laboratory values indicated C-peptide secretion (an exclusion criterion protocol deviation) and was removed from the analysis set. Therefore, data are presented for 19 subjects. All subjects had undetectable fasting C-peptide concentrations (< 0.33 pmol/L) at the screening visit. Physical activity levels, measured in accelerometer units, did not differ among the three study days. Gastric emptying rates for solid (T½: mean ± SE 111.4 ± 4.9 min) and liquid (T½: 23 ± 3.0 min) were normal in all subjects.

The meal compositions are detailed in the study. Only one subject did not completely ingest one breakfast meal; the unconsumed amount (0.5 g carbohydrate, 6.0 g protein, 4 g fat, and ~68 calories) was taken into account during the meal composition and glucose flux calculations.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012 [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone, and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock, and this rhythm serves as a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression, and insulin resistance.

A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations; however, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm, and patients still experience increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-hour cortisol production rate, administering hydrocortisone twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose given first thing in the morning.

Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated, with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is the absence of an established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we propose that understanding the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice-daily, weight-related dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm causes adverse effects.

### Two decades of circadian time [^115BKfjo]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythms coordinate our physiology at a fundamental level. Over the last 20 years, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in our perception of what the clocks driving such rhythms actually are, moving from 'black boxes' to discussions about autoregulatory transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops with identified molecular components. We now understand that the pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) is not our only clock. On the contrary, circadian clocks abound in our bodies, driving local rhythms of cellular metabolism and are synchronized to each other and to solar time by cues from the SCN. This discovery of dispersed local clocks has far-reaching implications for understanding our physiology and the pathological consequences of clock dysfunction, revealing that clocks are critical in a variety of metabolic and neurological conditions, all of which have long-term morbidity attributable to them. Without the currently available molecular framework, these insights would not have been possible. In the circadian future, a growing appreciation of the systems-level functioning of these clocks and their various cerebral and visceral outputs will likely stimulate the development of novel therapies for major illnesses.

### Continuous glucose profiles in healthy people with fixed meal times and under everyday life conditions [^1178bK45]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Low credibility.

The increased use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery systems raises questions about therapeutic targets for glucose profiles in people with diabetes. This study aimed to assess averaged pre- and postprandial glucose profiles in people without diabetes to provide guidance for normal glucose patterns in clinical practice. The number and timing of meal intake were predefined.

- **Material and methods**: To assess glucose traces in 36 participants without diabetes (mean age = 23.7 ± 5.7 years), CGM was performed for up to 14 days. This began with a run-in phase (first 3 days, excluded from analysis) followed by 4 days with fixed meal times at 8:00 am, 1:00 pm, and 6:00 pm. The remaining 7 days were spent under everyday life conditions. Data from two simultaneously worn CGM sensors were averaged and adjusted to capillary plasma-equivalent glucose values. Glucose data were evaluated through descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Median glucose concentration on days with fixed meal times and under everyday life conditions was 95.0 mg/dL (91.6–99.1 mg/dL, interquartile range) and 98.1 mg/dL (93.7–100.8 mg/dL), respectively. On days with fixed meal times, mean premeal glucose was 92.8 ± 9.4 mg/dL, and mean peak postmeal glucose was 143.3 ± 23.5 mg/dL.

- **Conclusions**: By defining the time of meal intake, a clear pattern of distinct postprandial glucose excursions in participants without diabetes could be demonstrated and analyzed. The presented glucose profiles might be helpful as an estimate for adequate clinical targets in people with diabetes.
