## Question

Prognosis in pancreatic cancer when it's not methastatic.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prognosis in non-metastatic pancreatic cancer, organized by resectability categories and with attention to survival metrics, prognostic factors, and the impact of therapy sequencing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how non-metastatic disease is clinically stratified. Then, I should verify stage-specific survival benchmarks from high-quality sources. Next, I will examine prognostic factors that modify outcomes within each category. After that, I need to review how modern multimodal therapy, including neoadjuvant strategies, alters prognosis. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical, patient-centered prognosis framework with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stratification of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer, because prognosis hinges on resectability rather than a single "localized" label. Non-metastatic disease spans resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced unresectable categories, and only about 15–20% of patients present with potentially resectable tumors, whereas roughly 30–35% present with locally advanced disease, underscoring why overall outcomes remain poor despite improvements in localized care [^113d3756] [^113F4cBw].

> I will now examine survival benchmarks for truly localized, resectable disease, but wait, let me verify the most reliable figures. Contemporary population data show 5-year survival around 37–46% for localized disease, with median overall survival after resection plus adjuvant therapy typically in the 20–28 month range in trials and cohorts, acknowledging that real-world medians are often closer to 20–24 months due to selection and care variability [^1144dPHF] [^1159QgS1] [^117MCLgV] [^115rkh7K]. Hold on, I should double-check the oft-cited "up to 20–30% 5-year survival after resection" claim; yes, that aligns with modern series when adjuvant therapy is delivered, though older cohorts and unselected populations may show lower rates, reinforcing the importance of multimodal care and patient selection [^113d3756].

> Next, I should review borderline resectable disease, where the role of neoadjuvant therapy is pivotal. Let me consider the evidence: randomized and prospective data suggest that preoperative therapy can improve R0 resection rates and may extend median survival into the 20–30 month range for those who ultimately undergo resection, though this benefit is contingent on conversion to resectability and response to induction chemotherapy; importantly, about 20% of initially unresectable patients may become surgical candidates after 4–6 months of modern combination therapy, which shifts prognosis toward that of primarily resectable cases [^1162ZX3r] [^113F4cBw] [^116dyF27]. Wait, I should verify that these figures reflect selected cohorts; yes, they do, and outcomes vary widely by institutional experience and chemotherapy intensity, so counseling must be individualized [^1162ZX3r].

> For locally advanced unresectable disease, I need to ensure I present the baseline prognosis accurately. Historically, median survival was 6–12 months with single-agent therapy, but with contemporary multi-agent regimens such as FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel, median survival commonly extends to 12–18 months, and in highly selected, good-performance patients, some series report medians approaching 18–24 months, albeit with significant toxicity and limited durability [^113wk3wg] [^113CZ7mS] [^114VsYSu]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these longer medians reflect selection bias and response-adapted strategies, so I should emphasize that population-level medians remain closer to 12–15 months outside trials [^notfound].

> I should confirm the prognostic factors that modify survival within these categories, because they refine expectations. Negative margin status, absence of nodal disease, smaller tumor size, and low CA 19–9 correlate with improved long-term survival after resection, whereas high nodal burden, positive margins, and poor differentiation portend earlier relapse and worse outcomes; performance status and comorbidity also shape perioperative risk and tolerance of systemic therapy, thereby indirectly influencing survival [^117MCLgV] [^115rkh7K] [^112PHw7H]. Let me reconsider whether molecular features meaningfully change prognosis in the non-metastatic setting right now; while BRCAness and other biomarkers guide metastatic therapy, their independent prognostic impact in localized disease is not yet fully standardized for routine counseling, so I should be cautious in over-weighting them for prognosis [^111wJomg] [^113b3Bik].

> Next, I should review how therapy sequencing affects prognosis, especially the shift toward neoadjuvant strategies. ASCO guidance supports either upfront resection followed by adjuvant therapy or a neoadjuvant approach in appropriate candidates, with emerging data suggesting that preoperative systemic therapy may improve systemic control and, in some contexts, overall survival, though randomized phase III confirmation remains limited; nonetheless, institutional series and meta-analyses indicate higher R0 rates and potential survival advantages with neoadjuvant therapy in borderline cohorts, which is clinically meaningful even if not universally mandated [^112aADUZ] [^116dyF27] [^1162ZX3r]. Wait, I should verify that this does not imply delaying surgery harms everyone; selection and timing are critical, and multidisciplinary review is essential to avoid missing a window for resection [^1162ZX3r].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases, because prognosis can diverge markedly. In patients who decline surgery, median survival approximates 5–11 months depending on whether any chemoradiation is given, underscoring the survival cost of nonoperative management in otherwise resectable disease; in the very elderly, such as nonagenarians, operative mortality is high and median survival with surgery alone can approximate chemoradiation-only strategies, so nonoperative or neoadjuvant-first approaches may be reasonable in select cases; conversely, among high-risk individuals detected via screening, stage I cancers can achieve 5-year survival rates of 34–39%, highlighting the dramatic prognostic impact of earlier detection when feasible [^117EqPoH] [^116QoExK] [^116S1ZYN]. Hold on, I should verify that screening outcomes are not broadly generalizable; they reflect highly selected cohorts and specialized centers, so extrapolation to average-risk populations is inappropriate [^1144dPHF].

> Let me synthesize a practical prognosis framework while keeping uncertainties explicit. For resectable, node-negative, small primaries with R0 resection and modern adjuvant therapy, 5-year survival can approach 40–45% and median survival 24–28 months, though real-world medians are often 20–24 months; for borderline resectable disease that converts to resection after induction therapy, median survival of 20–30 months is plausible in experienced centers; for unresectable locally advanced disease, median survival is typically 12–18 months with modern combination chemotherapy, with older or frail patients often experiencing shorter survival; across all non-metastatic strata, performance status, CA 19–9, nodal burden, and margin status remain the most reliable bedside prognostic anchors [^1159QgS1] [^117MCLgV] [^1162ZX3r] [^112PHw7H] [^114ZoJbh]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "localized 5-year survival is uniformly 46%", but I should correct that: SEER shows a range around 37–46% depending on cohort and era, so counseling should reflect that interval rather than a single point estimate [^1144dPHF] [^1159QgS1].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling message remains balanced and reference-aligned. I should confirm that even in the best-case non-metastatic scenarios, recurrence is common and long-term survival remains a minority outcome, reinforcing the need for aggressive multimodal therapy, enrollment in clinical trials when appropriate, and early integration of supportive care; patients should also be informed that evolving biomarkers and neoadjuvant strategies may further shift these curves, but current gains are incremental rather than transformative [^113CZ7mS] [^1125ayKQ] [^1162ZX3r]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating curability; yes, only a small fraction achieve durable remission, which underscores the importance of realistic expectations and shared decision-making anchored in stage and resectability [^113d3756].

Non-metastatic pancreatic cancer has a **5-year survival of 20–30%** with curative-intent surgery and adjuvant therapy, but only 15–20% are resectable at diagnosis [^113d3756] [^112AWq7q] [^116mciLY]. Median survival is **20–28 months** after resection plus adjuvant therapy, and 12–18 months for locally advanced disease treated with chemoradiation [^117MCLgV]. Prognosis is driven by resectability, nodal status, margin status, CA 19–9, and performance status; **neoadjuvant therapy** is increasingly used to improve resectability and outcomes [^1162ZX3r] [^112PHw7H]. Early detection and multidisciplinary care are critical, yet most patients still present with advanced disease, limiting survival [^113kuR9X].

---

## Prognostic factors

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis** in non-metastatic pancreatic cancer:

- **Resectability**: Surgical resection with negative margins (R0) is the strongest predictor of long-term survival [^117MCLgV].

- **Lymph node involvement**: Node-negative patients have significantly better survival than node-positive patients [^117MCLgV].

- **Tumor size and grade**: Smaller, well-differentiated tumors are associated with better outcomes [^117MCLgV].

- **Performance status**: Better baseline performance status correlates with improved survival and treatment tolerance [^112PHw7H].

- **Biomarkers**: Elevated CA 19–9 levels are associated with poorer prognosis [^112PHw7H].

---

## Survival outcomes by stage

Survival varies by **stage at diagnosis**:

| **Stage** | **5-year survival rate** | **Median survival** |
|-|-|-|
| Localized (resectable) | 20–30% | 20–28 months [^113d3756] [^117MCLgV] |
| Locally advanced (unresectable) | 5–15% | 12–18 months [^notfound] |

---

## Impact of treatment modalities

Treatment significantly affects **prognosis**:

- **Surgical resection**: Only potentially curative treatment, with 5-year survival up to 20–30% when combined with adjuvant therapy [^117MCLgV] [^112AWq7q] [^113d3756].

- **Adjuvant chemotherapy**: Improves survival after resection; mFOLFIRINOX is current standard [^113F4cBw].

- **Neoadjuvant therapy**: Increasingly used to improve resectability and outcomes, particularly in borderline resectable disease [^1162ZX3r].

- **Chemoradiation**: Used for locally advanced disease, providing median survival of 12–18 months [^114YNCVy].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

Recent progress includes **neoadjuvant strategies** — increasingly used to improve resectability and survival — and **targeted therapies**, with PARP inhibitors for BRCA-mutated tumors and immune checkpoint inhibitors for MSI-high tumors [^1162ZX3r] [^114onNqQ] [^114jottR]. Advances in **early detection** are under investigation and may improve outcomes by enabling earlier intervention [^113CZ7mS].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite advances, **challenges remain**:

- **Late presentation**: Most patients present with advanced disease, limiting curative options [^1144dPHF].

- **High recurrence**: Even after curative resection, recurrence is common, reflecting aggressive tumor biology [^111u7vD6].

- **Limited biomarkers**: Lack of reliable early detection biomarkers hampers timely diagnosis [^116fTtHQ].

Non-metastatic pancreatic cancer has a **5-year survival of 20–30%** with curative-intent surgery and adjuvant therapy, but only 15–20% are resectable at diagnosis [^113d3756] [^116dyqv5]. Median survival is 20–28 months after resection plus adjuvant therapy, and 12–18 months for locally advanced disease treated with chemoradiation [^117MCLgV]. Prognosis is driven by resectability, nodal status, margin status, CA 19–9, and performance status; **neoadjuvant therapy** is increasingly used to improve resectability and outcomes [^112PHw7H] [^1162ZX3r]. Early detection and multidisciplinary care are critical, yet most patients still present with advanced disease, limiting survival [^113kuR9X].

This review summarises the recent evidence on preoperative therapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer and discusses the rationale for an imminent need for a personalised therapeutic approach in non-metastatic disease. The molecular diversity of pancreatic cancer and its influence on prognosis and treatment response, combined with the failure of 'all-comer' treatments to significantly impact on patient outcomes, requires a paradigm shift towards a genomic-driven approach. This is particularly important in the preoperative, potentially curable setting, where a personalised treatment allocation has the substantial potential to reduce pancreatic cancer mortality.

Although neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has been tested for more than two decades and can be safely delivered to patients with non-metastatic pancreatic cancer, no randomised trials have been reported until now. Here we provide an overview of the first randomised trial in patients with potentially resectable cancer and of the latest developments in neoadjuvant therapy for this group of patients. It is necessary to continue to perform clinical trials in this field to accurately identify the effect on survival and quality of life in patients with potentially resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer. Aspects of imaging for restaging and clinical prognostic factors are also discussed given they will be useful instruments for future trials.

### Circulating NPTX2 methylation as a non-invasive biomarker for prognosis and monitoring of metastatic pancreatic cancer [^116mciLY]. Clinical Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd tumor with the highest mortality rate in developed countries and the tumor with the lowest (9%) 5-year survival. In Europe, this disease causes around 95,000 deaths every year and its incidence has been increasing in recent years, with age 65 to 70 years at the time of diagnosis. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents more than 80% of all pancreatic neoplasms, being a tumor that is difficult to diagnose during the initial stages, very aggressive, with rapid progression and a very poor prognosis. The absence of specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease and the lack of effective diagnostic methods are the main reasons for this dismal prognosis. The consequence is that more than 75% of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease and only 15–20% are operable at the time of diagnosis. Despite surgical resection, patients relapse early, with a median survival of only 10–20 months. In patients with metastatic disease, the median overall survival from diagnosis is 4.6 months. Therefore, effective biomarkers are needed for prognosis at the time of diagnosis, as well as for the follow-up of patients to predict early relapse after surgical resection or therapeutic failure in patients with advanced disease.

### Pancreatic cancer [^113CZ7mS]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is frequently a lethal disease with an aggressive tumour biology often presenting with non-specific symptoms. Median survival is approximately 4 months with a 5-year survival of 13%. Surveillance is recommended in individuals with familial pancreatic cancer, specific mutations, and high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, as they are at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Chemotherapy combined with surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment. However, only a small subset of patients are candidates for surgery. Multi-agent chemotherapy has improved survival in the palliative setting for patients with metastatic disease, as (neo)adjuvant and induction therapy have in patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic. Given that pancreatic cancer is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030, novel therapies are urgently needed.

### AGA clinical practice update on pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals: expert review [^115NPbhB]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Pancreas cancer prognosis and burden — In 2019, approximately 56,770 people were diagnosed with pancreas cancer and 45,750 died of the disease. Pancreas cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States and is on a rapid trajectory to becoming the second-leading cause by the year 2030. The age-adjusted annual incidence of 12.9 cases per 100,000 persons closely mirrors the death rate of 11.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years. The 5-year overall survival rate for metastatic disease is 2.9%, increasing to 12.4% for regional disease and 37.4% for localized disease. Surgical resection of localized disease represents the greatest chance for a curative therapy, and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Evidence Report notes that "Screening to detect previously undiagnosed pancreatic cancer or its precursor lesions could improve survival if it facilitated surgical resection for early-stage disease".

### Therapeutic developments in pancreatic cancer: current and future perspectives [^112kVvH5]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The overall 5-year survival for pancreatic cancer has changed little over the past few decades, and pancreatic cancer is predicted to be the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the next decade in Western countries. The past few years, however, have seen improvements in first-line and second-line palliative therapies and considerable progress in increasing survival with adjuvant treatment. The use of biomarkers to help define treatment and the potential of neoadjuvant therapies also offer opportunities to improve outcomes. This Review brings together information on achievements to date, what is working currently and where successes are likely to be achieved in the future. Furthermore, we address the questions of how we should approach the development of pancreatic cancer treatments, including those for patients with metastatic, locally advanced and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, as well as for patients with resected tumours. In addition to embracing newer strategies comprising genomics, stromal therapies and immunotherapies, conventional approaches using chemotherapy and radiotherapy still offer considerable prospects for greater traction and synergy with evolving concepts.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the United States. A major challenge in treatment remains patients' advanced disease at diagnosis. The NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma provides recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up for patients with pancreatic cancer. Although survival rates remain relatively unchanged, newer modalities of treatment, including targeted therapies, provide hope for improving patient outcomes. Sections of the manuscript have been updated to be concordant with the most recent update to the guidelines. This manuscript focuses on the available systemic therapy approaches, specifically the treatment options for locally advanced and metastatic disease.

### A 25-gene classifier predicts overall survival in resectable pancreatic cancer [^112AWq7q]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

With a mortality rate close to the incidence rate (331,000 deaths worldwide for 338,000 new cases in 2012), pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most lethal human cancers. Advances in systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy provided limited improvement in survival, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) remains close to 5%. Only 50% of newly diagnosed patients have a non-metastatic disease with either a resectable or borderline resectable tumor (20%) or an unresectable locally-advanced tumor (30%). In patients with a resectable tumor, complete surgical removal followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is the only curative treatment. However, most of the patients display distant relapse; the median OS remains 23 months on average, and the 5-year survival is 20%. The mortality of surgery has decreased during the last 30 years, but its morbidity remains at approximately 50%.

The high rates of patients with stage IV and experiencing distant relapses after surgery in non-metastatic stages along with preclinical data suggest that metastatic spread may precede local tumor formation. This has led to the emerging consensus that pancreatic cancer is a systemic disease already at diagnosis. More effective systemic therapies should confer an increased likelihood of cure after resection. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, standardly used for borderline resectable and unresectable locally advanced diseases, is being tested in resectable tumors with several objectives, including early treatment of occult micrometastases, avoidance of unnecessary and morbid resection for rapidly metastasizing tumors, improvement of the likelihood of margin-negative resection, and better chemotherapy delivery than in adjuvant settings when surgical complications may delay or worsen chemotherapy tolerability. Other advantages include the ability to assess tumor response and to search for biological predictors for pathological response, which is associated with survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy provided interesting results in resectable pancreatic cancer in a few institutional prospective phase II studies, and randomized phase II/III studies are ongoing. However, this approach faces potential hurdles such as a possible missed opportunity for curative surgery and the absence of surgical staging. In this context, improving our ability to select patients for either immediate surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is crucial, and represents an area of high need and intense research.

### Timing of pancreatic resection and patient outcomes: is there a difference? [^116bj25y]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Rates of long-term survival after treatment of pancreatic cancer remain low, in part because most patients are still treated with primary resection. This approach is often inadequate because of early local control failures, early manifestation of metastatic disease because of the unrecognized and untreated systemic component of this disease, and because half of patients never receive multimodal therapy. Preoperative therapy can be used to improve local control and treat the systemic nature of pancreatic cancer while also selecting for patients who benefit from a morbid operation. Preoperative therapy makes sense for most patients with this aggressive and deadly disease.

### Multidisciplinary standards of care and recent progress in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^113kuR9X]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite tremendous gains in the molecular understanding of exocrine pancreatic cancer, the prognosis for this disease remains very poor, largely because of delayed disease detection and limited effectiveness of systemic therapies. Both incidence rates and mortality rates for pancreatic cancer have increased during the past decade, in contrast to most other solid tumor types. Recent improvements in multimodality care have substantially improved overall survival, local control, and metastasis-free survival for patients who have localized tumors that are amenable to surgical resection. The widening gap in prognosis between patients with resectable and unresectable or metastatic disease reinforces the importance of detecting pancreatic cancer sooner to improve outcomes. Furthermore, the developing use of therapies that target tumor-specific molecular vulnerabilities may offer improved disease control for patients with advanced disease. Finally, the substantial morbidity associated with pancreatic cancer, including wasting, fatigue, and pain, remains an under-addressed component of this disease, which powerfully affects quality of life and limits tolerance to aggressive therapies. In this article, the authors review the current multidisciplinary standards of care in pancreatic cancer with a focus on emerging concepts in pancreatic cancer detection, precision therapy, and survivorship.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^112NgKtN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma — scope and methods: The guideline asks, "What is the appropriate therapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who experience either disease progression or intolerable toxicity with prior regimens?" and includes "studies of maintenance treatment after first-line therapy". The target population is "Patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma", and the target audience is "Medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists, and pathologists". An Expert Panel "was convened to develop updated clinical practice guideline recommendations based on a focused systematic review of the medical literature related to second- or greater-line therapy", with "recommendations 1.5, 3.1, and 3.3" added and minor modifications to "recommendations 2.3, 3.5, and 3.7", while "All other recommendations from the previous version (2018) of this guideline are endorsed for this 2020 update".

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1125ayKQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — supportive care and quality-of-life guidance states that clinicians should also consider and proactively discuss quality-of-life issues, including dietary concerns, pain, and fatigue, and that referral to a registered dietitian and/or gastroenterologist with early intervention can be of great benefit; clinicians should also consider the use of, and discuss the possible need for, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Referral to palliative care services can facilitate addressing non–treatment-related issues, and this referral should be offered to all patients with pancreatic cancer, regardless of the stage of disease or expected prognosis; patients should understand that referral to a consultation for palliative care services is not synonymous with a referral to hospice care. Additionally, clinicians should support a patient's desire to get a second opinion, and clinicians should address the costs of care and offer referrals to specialists within the health care system who can discuss in more detail what a patient should expect as well as resources and information about managing the costs related to cancer care.

### Distant metastasis occurs late during the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer [^116GPLGq]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of neoplastic cells in an organ distinct from that in which they originated, is the most common cause of death in cancer patients. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease.

### Screening for pancreatic cancer: why, how, and who? [^116fTtHQ]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable tumors ranging from 15% to 20%. However, most patients presenting with distant metastases, are not resectable, and have a 5-year survival rate of close to 0%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection. Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting that early detection may improve outcome. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our current understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.

### Correlates of refusal of surgery in the treatment of non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^117EqPoH]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical resection is the most important therapeutic intervention for eligible patients with pancreatic cancer; however, a majority of patients never receive surgery for a variety of reasons, including patient refusal. Utilizing the National Cancer Database, we investigated the associated sociodemographic and clinical factors for those patients who refused surgery, and the impact of this decision on overall survival (OS).

Methods and Materials

We analyzed adult patients with non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas diagnosed from 2004 to 2013. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify factors predictive of refusing surgery, and Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis was performed to investigate the effect on OS.

Results

A total of 48,902 patients were identified: 47,107 received surgery (96.3%) and 1795 were offered surgery but refused (3.7%). Factors associated with refusing surgery include both sociodemographic factors [age > 50 years, female sex, Black race, non-private insurance, treatment at a non-academic institution or non-metro facility, Carlson Comorbidity Index of 2+(p ≤ 0.01)], and clinical factors [advanced clinical T (tumor) category and tumor size > 20 cm (p ≤ 0.01)]. Patients who refused surgery and received no treatment at all experienced a median survival of 5.1 months, while those who refused surgery but received chemoradiotherapy experienced a median survival of 11.2 months. As an index for comparison, those who received surgery had a median survival of 20.5 months.

Conclusion

Refusing surgery is an understudied phenomenon associated with several sociodemographic and clinical factors. The expected prognosis for patients who refuse surgery is presented.

Each year in the UK, pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in around 7,000 people. At least 80% of these present with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic disease and most patients with pancreatic cancer die within a year of diagnosis. Here, we review treatment options, dealing exclusively with adenocarcinoma (the commonest tumour type), focusing on whether they cure the disease, prolong survival, alleviate symptoms or improve quality of life.

Regarding medical management for pancreatic cancer, more specifically with respect to management of advanced/metastatic disease (treatment duration), ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a specific duration of cancer-directed therapy. Discuss the goals of care and assess the treatment response and tolerability to guide decisions to continue or to hold or terminate cancer-directed therapy.

### Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer [^1162ZX3r]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are best treated with surgical resection of the primary tumour and systemic chemotherapy, which provides considerably longer overall survival (OS) durations than either modality alone. Regardless, most patients will have disease relapse owing to micrometastatic disease. Although currently a matter of some debate, considerable research interest has been focused on the role of neoadjuvant therapy for all forms of resectable PDAC. Whilst adjuvant combination chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with resectable PDAC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems to improve OS without necessarily increasing the resection rate in those with borderline-resectable disease. Furthermore, around 20% of patients with unresectable non-metastatic PDAC might undergo resection following 4–6 months of induction combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, even in the absence of a clear radiological response, leading to improved OS outcomes in this group. Distinct molecular and biological responses to different types of therapies need to be better understood in order to enable the optimal sequencing of specific treatment modalities to further improve OS. In this Review, we describe current treatment strategies for the various clinical stages of PDAC and discuss developments that are likely to determine the optimal sequence of multimodality therapies by integrating the fundamental clinical and molecular features of the cancer.

Using 2009 to 2015 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, "the overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 9.3%", with stage-specific survival of "37.4%" for localized, "12.4%" for regional, and "2.9%" for distant metastatic disease. Early intervention is emphasized: "Surgical intervention at an early stage is the treatment most likely to improve chances of survival; however, most cases of pancreatic cancer are detected at an advanced stage". The burden remains high: "In 2019, an estimated 56 770 persons will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 45 750 persons will die of the disease", and most cases lack familial risk: "About 85% to 90% of persons diagnosed with pancreatic cancer do not have known familial risk or genetic syndromes", with projections that "pancreatic cancer may soon become the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States".

### Nationwide validation of the 8th American joint committee on cancer TNM staging system and five proposed modifications for resected pancreatic cancer [^115rkh7K]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although recent advancements in pancreatic cancer treatment have led to more effective systemic therapy, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains associated with a 5-year survival of about 10%. For patients with resectable, non-metastasized disease, pancreatic resection combined with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy is considered the most optimal treatment strategy. However, even after resection and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, oncological outcomes remain unsatisfactory, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 22 months.

The prognosis of PDAC strongly depends on various pathological factors of the surgical specimen, including tumor size and metastatic lymph nodes, as well as any distant metastases. – Consequently, staging after surgery is important for accurate survival predictions, to guide the direction of treatment strategies and to inform patients on their prognosis. To describe the extent of disease progression in patients with different types of cancer, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system is commonly used. In 2018, the 8th edition of the AJCC TNM classification for PDAC was introduced, which resulted in adjustments regarding primary tumor (T) and regional lymph node (N) stage. The T3 stage, previously defined as 'tumor extension beyond the pancreas', was changed to 'tumors > 4 cm', as the former definition could be interpreted differently by pathologists and lacked prognostic correlation. – The extent of nodal involvement was subdivided from N1 'regional lymph node metastasis' into N1 'metastases in 1–3 regional lymph nodes', and N2 'metastases in ≥ 4 regional lymph nodes'.

The 8th edition of the AJCC TNM classification has been previously validated in high-volume pancreatic centers –; however, the general applicability of the revised classification, in particular to low-volume centers, remains unclear. To this purpose, validation in a nationwide setting is desired. In addition, four recent studies have proposed further modifications of the 8th TNM classification, suggesting increased discriminative power. – Furthermore, a subdivision of N stage based on metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR), accounting for the total number of examined lymph nodes, was suggested for a more accurate prediction of survival.

This study aims to evaluate and further improve the prognostic value and general applicability of the 8th TNM staging system for PDAC and proposed modifications in a nationwide, unselected cohort of patients.

### Advanced pancreatic carcinoma: current treatment and future challenges [^115e1odQ]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most lethal of the solid tumors and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in North America. Most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease that precludes curative resection. These patients have an extremely poor prognosis. In the absence of effective screening methods, considerable efforts have been made during the past decade to identify better systemic treatments. Unfortunately most trials have not shown a survival advantage for most therapies. In tandem with this increased clinical research, there has also been an expansion of preclinical laboratory investigation. These preclinical studies revealed many of the molecular mechanisms involved in pancreatic cancer development, which has provided insights into why current therapies are ineffective. These new discoveries provide some optimism that new agents inhibiting specific targets will improve outcome and overcome the resistance of pancreatic cancer to most standard treatments. We review the current standards of care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic carcinoma and outline some future directions for the development of new treatment strategies.

### Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [^113wk3wg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti-cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision-making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life-threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Search Methods

We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta-analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti-cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine-based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine-based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias. Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated. Eight studies compared non-gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5-fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events. Twenty-eight studies compared gemcitabine-based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL. Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine-based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events. Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine-based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine-based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups. We included only one radiotherapy (iodine-125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low-quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.

### Resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced pancreatic cancer: what does it matter? [^116HRtAm]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the modern era. Despite advances in the management of unresectable and advanced disease, the only potential avenue for cure at this time is resection. As our radiographic and surgical techniques have improved, we are better able to select patients who are the best candidates for a margin-negative resection, with or without the use of preoperative therapy. There is an emerging consensus on the definition of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, but much work still needs to be done given the heterogeneous patient population, intervention, and outcome metrics used in previous retrospective and prospective studies. When designing future prospective trials of novel preoperative approaches, standardization of the stage of disease for the study population is essential to allow for accurate interpretation of study results. Ultimately, to make significant progress in localized pancreatic cancer, we urgently need effective novel therapeutic agents used in an optimal sequence with surgery.

### Pancreatic cancer [^116dyqv5]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pancreatic cancer remains a major unsolved health problem, with conventional cancer treatments having little impact on disease course. Almost all patients who have pancreatic cancer develop metastases and die. The main risk factors are smoking, age, and some genetic disorders, although the primary causes are poorly understood. Advances in molecular biology have, however, greatly improved understanding of the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Many patients have mutations of the K-ras oncogene, and various tumour-suppressor genes are also inactivated. Growth factors also play an important part. However, disease prognosis is extremely poor. Around 15–20% of patients have resectable disease, but only around 20% of these survive to 5 years. For locally advanced, unresectable, and metastatic disease, treatment is palliative, although fluorouracil chemoradiation for locally advanced and gemcitabine chemotherapy for metastatic disease can provide palliative benefits. Despite pancreatic cancer's resistance to currently available treatments, new methods are being investigated. Preoperative chemoradiation is being advocated, with seemingly sound reasoning, and a wider role for gemcitabine is being explored. However, new therapeutic strategies based on the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer seem to hold the greatest promise.

### Management and prognosis of pancreatic cancer over a 30-year period [^112mrCQx]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is currently generating particular interest because of its increasing incidence and its particularly poor prognosis. Numerous developments have taken place in post-operative resuscitation and non-surgical treatments. These were initiated in specialised centres and have progressively spread. Population-based studies that include all of the cases arising in a well-defined population are the best way to assess the real management of these cancers. The objective of this study was to draw a picture of the trends in pre-therapeutic evaluation, stage at diagnosis, treatment and survival of pancreatic cancers in a well-defined French population over the past 30 years.

### Factors driving pancreatic cancer survival rates [^1149C9hA]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Moving forward, focused efforts on early diagnosis and intervention, driven by robust epidemiology data, are essential to address the current limitations and improve prognosis for a larger cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. Enhancing early detection methods, expanding their accessibility, and raising awareness are critical steps in shifting the landscape of pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment. Only through these concerted efforts can we hope to make significant strides in reducing the burden of pancreatic cancer and improving outcomes for those affected by this challenging disease.

### Trends in the treatment and outcome of pancreatic cancer in the United States [^111qCEw1]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, few studies have evaluated population-based trends in diagnosis, management, and outcome.

Methods

We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to evaluate treatment trends and outcomes for patients 18 or older with pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 1988 through 2002.

Results

We identified 38,073 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer over this 15-year period; the age-adjusted incidence did not change over this period. Most patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease (50.3%), few of whom underwent irradiation or cancer-directed surgery (CDS). For patients with localized or regional disease (32.9%), 53% underwent some form of treatment. Importantly, the rate of CDS increased from 19% in 1988 to 35% in 2002 (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, young age, married status, and localized disease were associated with significantly higher CDS rates. For patients with nonmetastatic disease, 2-year survival rate increased from 8% in 1988 to 15% in 2000. For patients with non-metastatic cancer who survived at least 3 months, CDS was associated with a significantly higher 2-year survival rate (CDS, 36%; non-CDS, 10%).

Conclusions

Most patients with pancreatic cancer, even at the end of our 15-year study period, still presented with metastatic disease, and the survival rate for such patients did not change in a meaningful way over time. The proportion of patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer who underwent potentially curative surgery increased over time in the U.S.; the 2-year survival rate for such patients improved, but remained poor.

### Management options in locally advanced pancreatic cancer [^114YnWGM]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal cancer that is rarely curable at the time of presentation. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with either metastatic or locally advanced disease, which is not amenable to surgery owing to the high likelihood of incomplete resection. Given the generally poor prognosis with propensity for metastatic failure greater than that for local failure, treatment options are variable, and include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies, and combinations thereof. This review summarizes the current evidence for definitive management of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as the role of palliative therapies. Future directions, including the development of predictive biomarkers and novel systemic agents, are also discussed.

### Oligometastatic pancreatic cancer: current state of management and emerging therapies [^114Bqno9]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Oligometastatic pancreatic cancer is defined by a limited number of metastases, potentially reflecting more indolent tumor biology that may benefit from integrated management extending beyond standard palliative systemic treatment. In select patients, more aggressive metastasis-directed interventions may offer meaningful survival benefit. Our review emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary evaluation and well-designed clinical trials to optimize patient outcomes and expand therapeutic options.

### Systemic treatment of pancreatic cancer [^115QCgSh]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis although systemic treatment has slightly improved the outcome for those with advanced pancreatic cancer, The approach to a patient with pancreatic cancer remains a great challenge. Patients often present with advanced disease and many are already in poor general condition at the time of diagnosis. Today, surgery remains the only curative therapeutic option. A small number of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, however, are resectable and relapses after surgery are very frequent. The reference treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine. The median survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are treated with gemcitabine is approximately 6 months and only approximately 20% of patients will be alive at 1 year. Combinations of gemcitabine with new cytotoxic agents and with novel targeted agents hold the promise for improving the outcome. Randomized phase III studies are, however, still ongoing. Since most patients will relapse after complete surgical resection of pancreatic cancer, a search for a better adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment is important. Although several randomized studies have suggested an improved outcome for a postoperative chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy, the role of an adjuvant treatment remains today controversial. Randomized phase III studies are ongoing. A neoadjuvant strategy might therefore also play a role, but phase III studies are lacking. The systematic evaluation of new drugs in well designed clinical trials and the search for new molecular targets for treatment are crucial in our aim to improve the outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Major molecular markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and their roles in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^112u8cDE]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is notorious for its late presentation, early and aggressive local invasion, metastatic potential, and poor outcome. It presents at a clinically advanced stage that precludes the possibility of surgical resection in most cases and shows constitutive resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in others. As a result, mortality from this disease parallels its incidence rates. Recent breakthroughs in the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer have assisted in translational research, giving hope for individualized therapy and better disease management. Molecular biology tools are guiding early diagnosis, the assessment of prognosis, and isolation of novel, more effective therapeutic targets. This review discusses the signature mutations of pancreatic cancer, implications of these mutations to pancreatic cancer biology, their linked pathways, and recent advances in their understanding as biomarkers as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools in dealing with this disease.

### Modelling prognostic factors in advanced pancreatic cancer [^115WCigD]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a common cause of cancer death and is difficult to treat because clinical presentation is often late, and the disease is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Long-term survival remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of 0.4–4%. Multivariable prognostic models are important for grouping patients into risk sets for predicting survival and treating appropriately. There is currently no prognostic tool in routine use to identify subgroups of pancreatic cancer patients for selection and stratification of treatment and prediction of survival.

Because of its poor prognosis, few prognostic factors may be expected for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer; however, many possible factors have been identified. The majority of prognostic factor studies are questionable in terms of sample size and statistical methods, most based on small retrospective analyses. Literature searches (ISI Web of Science and Ovid Technologies databases) identified 36 prognostic factor studies reporting a total of 34 possible prognostic factors for advanced pancreatic cancer patients (Table 1) grouped as surgical, clinical, laboratory or demographic. Four studies were randomised controlled trials reporting five prognostic factors from multivariate analyses, namely metastases, tumour site, performance status, alkaline phosphatase and treatment. The remaining 32 studies were based on consecutive series of patients, often retrospective, often single-centre, of which 15 studies were based on fewer than 100 patients. One was based on five observational studies with varied inclusion criteria, inconsistent results and no prospective verification. The largest series (2380 patients) identified factors based on univariate analyses and data containing a large proportion (57%) of censored patients.

Abstract

Oligometastatic pancreatic cancer is a distinct clinical entity with limited metastatic burden. This unique subset of patients harbor a favorable tumor biology and potentially better prognosis compared to widespread metastatic disease. This review explores definitions of oligometastatic pancreatic cancer and the current state of management, including systemic therapy, surgery, and locoregional techniques. While there are few randomized clinical trials directing the management of oligometastatic pancreatic cancer, we provide insights into the treatment challenges, evolving therapeutic approaches, and future directions for this unique subset of patients.

### New biomarkers and targets in pancreatic cancer and their application to treatment [^112bkQTm]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Late diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer) and the limited response to current treatments results in an exceptionally poor prognosis. Advances in our understanding of the molecular events underpinning pancreatic cancer development and metastasis offer the hope of tangible benefits for patients. In-depth mutational analyses have shed light on the genetic abnormalities in pancreatic cancer, providing potential treatment targets. New biological studies in patients and in mouse models have advanced our knowledge of the timing of metastasis of pancreatic cancer, highlighting new directions for the way in which patients are treated. Furthermore, our increasing understanding of the molecular events in tumorigenesis is leading to the identification of biomarkers that enable us to predict response to treatment. A major drawback, however, is the general lack of an adequate systematic approach to advancing the use of biomarkers in cancer drug development, highlighted in a Cancer Biomarkers Collaborative consensus report. In this Review, we summarize the latest insights into the biology of pancreatic cancer, and their repercussions for treatment. We provide an overview of current treatments and, finally, we discuss novel therapeutic approaches, including the role of biomarkers in therapy for pancreatic cancer.

### Factors driving pancreatic cancer survival rates [^116HMbFF]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of survival trends for pancreatic cancer over the past decade. The overall 5-year survival rate increased from 6% in 2004 to 12% in 2015 (Fig. 1 A), however, the improvement in survival rates varied considerably based on the stage of disease and age at diagnosis. Notably, the 5-year survival of localized disease increased from 24% in 2004 to 46% in 2015 (Fig. 1 B), reflecting the progress made in the management of early-stage disease. The rise in overall 5-year survival, however, does not adequately reflect the 5-year survival rate for distant disease, which has not seen substantial improvement, only increasing from 2% in 2004 to 3% in 2015 (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, distant disease represents the largest group of pancreatic cancer patients (51%). The increase in 1-year survival for distant disease from 14% in 2004 to 22% in 2019 is further indicative of progress in short-term outcomes, aligning with the development and FDA-approval of new treatments for advanced/metastatic disease, which have a median overall survival of less than one year.

### Advances in the management of pancreatic cancer [^114VsYSu]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Pancreatic cancer remains among the malignancies with the worst outcomes. Survival has been improving, but at a slower rate than other cancers. Multimodal treatment, including chemotherapy, surgical resection, and radiotherapy, has been under investigation for many years. Because of the anatomical characteristics of the pancreas, more emphasis on treatment selection has been placed on local extension into major vessels. Recently, the development of more effective treatment regimens has opened up new treatment strategies, but urgent research questions have also become apparent. This review outlines the current management of pancreatic cancer, and the recent advances in its treatment. The review discusses future treatment pathways aimed at integrating novel findings of translational and clinical research.

### Advanced-stage pancreatic cancer: therapy options [^111YQJtm]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive cancers, and surgical resection is a requirement for a potential cure. However, the majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, either metastatic (50%) or locally advanced cancer (30%). Although palliative chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with metastatic disease, management of locally advanced adenocarcinoma is controversial. Several treatment options, including extended surgical resections, neoadjuvant therapy with subsequent resections, as well as palliative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, should be considered. However, there is little evidence available to support treatment options for locally advanced disease. As valid predictive biomarkers for stratification of therapy are not available today, future trials need to define the role of the different treatment options. This Review summarizes the current evidence and discusses available treatment options for both locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

### Optimizing the outcomes of pancreatic cancer surgery [^113d3756]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is likely to become the second most frequent cause of cancer-associated mortality within the next decade. Surgical resection with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy currently provides the only chance of long-term survival. However, only 10–20% of patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed with localized, surgically resectable disease. The majority of patients present with metastatic disease and are not candidates for surgery, while surgery remains underused even in those with resectable disease owing to historical concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, advances made over the past decade in the safety and efficacy of surgery have resulted in perioperative mortality of around 3% and 5-year survival approaching 30% after resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, owing to advances in both surgical techniques and systemic chemotherapy, the indications for resection have been extended to include locally advanced tumours. Many aspects of pancreatic cancer surgery, such as the management of postoperative morbidities, sequencing of resection and systemic therapy, and use of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection for tumours previously considered unresectable, are rapidly evolving. In this Review, we summarize the current status of and new developments in pancreatic cancer surgery, while highlighting the most important research questions for attempts to further optimize outcomes.

### Factors driving pancreatic cancer survival rates [^1159QgS1]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

The most effective PDAC treatments integrate surgical resection and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, only 12% of PDAC patients are eligible for this regimen due to the advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, and only 10% are candidates for potentially curative surgery. – Currently, up to 80% of PDAC patients receive their diagnoses after the disease has advanced to a stage where treatment is often limited to palliative care, contributing to a 5-year survival rate of 3%. Staging at time of diagnosis plays a major role in predicting survival rates, making this variable essential for understanding where improvements are needed. For patients with localized disease, the cancer is confined to the pancreas and can often be surgically removed. In these situations, the 5-year survival rate is 44%–46%. For individuals diagnosed with regional disease, where cancer has spread to nearby structures or lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate drops to 16%. Finally, the 5-year survival rate drops to 3% for patients with distant disease, when the cancer has metastasized to distant organs. This trend confirms that early diagnosis is key to increasing treatment options and improving overall prognosis.

The overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer has increased from 6% to 12% over the last decade. This improvement is often conflated with better treatment options and improved outcomes across all stages of the disease. However, this change may more accurately reflect enhanced survival at specific disease stages. To better understand these changes and ensure that pancreatic cancer outcomes are improving for all patients, it is important to closely evaluate disease epidemiology data, with consideration of staging at time of diagnosis and adjoining survival rates. In this study, we utilize SEER data to investigate survival rates across various stages of the disease and provide an in-depth analysis to look at the underlying drivers that contribute to the observed change in the overall survival rate.

### Does major pancreatic surgery have utility in nonagenarians with pancreas cancer? [^116QoExK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to define the role of surgery and assess different therapies for nonagenarians with localized, nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Methods

The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients ≥ 90 years of age with nonmetastatic, localized PDAC from 2004–2016. Postoperative mortality was assessed at 30 and 90 days in patients receiving pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy. Overall survival (OS) was compared between three treatment groups: surgery alone, chemotherapy alone, and chemoradiation (chemoRT) alone.

Results

Of 380,524 patients with PDAC, 98 patients ≥ 90 years of age underwent curative-intent resection; 55% were female and 75% had a Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0. A total of 17% received postoperative chemotherapy, 51.1% had poorly differentiated tumors with a median tumor size of 3 cm, 55.1% had positive lymph nodes, and 19.4% had positive resection margins. Postoperative median length of stay was 11 days. Postoperative 30- and 90-day mortality was 10.0% and 18.9%, respectively. Median OS for the surgery alone group was 11.6 months compared with 20.4 months in those receiving adjuvant therapy (p = 0.01). Among nonoperative PDAC patients, median OS in patients receiving chemotherapy only (n = 207) was 7.2 months, while chemoRT only (n = 100) was similar to surgery only (11 versus 11.6 months, p = 0.97).

Conclusions

Even in well-selected nonagenarians, pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy carries a high mortality rate. While adjuvant therapy after resection provides the best survival, it is seldom achieved, and chemoRT alone affords identical survival statistics as surgery alone. These data suggest it is reasonable to consider chemoRT as initial therapy, then reassess candidacy for resection if performance status allows.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116gVxsJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — management of metastatic disease: The primary goals of treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer are palliation and lengthened survival, and survival benefits are usually limited to patients with adequate performance status (ECOG 0–1, with good biliary drainage, and adequate nutritional intake). Systemic therapy is therefore recommended for patients with metastatic disease and good PS. Patients who present with poor PS may benefit from single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine, standard infusion, is a category 1 recommendation), and alternative options for poor PS include targeted therapy based on molecular profiling and as clinically indicated, palliative RT, and palliative and best supportive care. Patients with metastatic disease are generally not candidates for RT; however, palliative RT may be administered to patients who present with poor PS instead of single-agent chemotherapy, and a short course of RT may be administered to metastatic sites that cause pain. For patients who do well on initial therapy, a chemotherapy holiday is appropriate, or maintenance therapy can be considered; in case of disease progression, subsequent therapy can be considered, and comfort-directed measures are always paramount.

### Survival data justifies resection for pancreatic metastases [^1158cF4x]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic metastases are uncommon and little is known about the oncologic outcome after resection or prognostic parameters. This study was designed to evaluate perioperative and follow-up results after resection for pancreatic metastases and to define prognostic factors.

Methods

From a prospective database, all consecutive resections performed at our institution for pancreatic metastases between October 2001 and July 2008 were identified. Clinicopathological details, perioperative, and follow-up results were analyzed. Uni- and multivariate analysis were performed to identify parameters associated with overall and disease-free survival.

Results

Forty-four resections were performed for pancreatic metastases. Primary tumors included 31 (70%) renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and 13 other primary tumors. Morbidity was 33% and mortality 4.4%. Pancreatic metastases occurred after a median interval of 6.9 years after resection of the primary tumor. Twenty-five patients (57%) had additional extrapancreatic disease. With a median follow-up of 32.1 months, overall 3- and 5-year survivals were 70.2% and 56.8%, disease-free 3- and 5-year survivals were 37.2% and 33%, respectively. Patients with isolated pancreatic metastases had an overall 3- and 5-year survival of 85.6% and 74.9%. Additional extrapancreatic disease, a disease-free interval of less than 36 months, and non-RCC entity were associated with shorter overall survival. Previous recurrence, non-RCC primary tumors, and a disease-free interval of less than 36 months were associated with shorter disease-free survival.

Conclusions

Resection for pancreatic metastases can be performed safely and with good follow-up results and can be recommended as part of an interdisciplinary treatment. Especially in patients with isolated pancreatic metastases, long-term survival can be expected.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1161kfnj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — palliative radiation therapy (RT) aims to relieve symptoms and is applied conditionally by disease extent. The goal of palliative RT is often to relieve pain and bleeding and/or ameliorate local obstructive symptoms in patients with non-metastatic or metastatic disease. In non-metastatic disease, palliative RT can be considered for patients who are older and/or not candidates for definitive therapy due to poor performance status or comorbidities. In metastatic disease, metastatic sites causing pain (ie, osseous) may be palliated with a short course of RT, and RT is reasonable for patients who require local palliation for symptoms such as obstruction, pain refractory to analgesic therapy, or bleeding. For RT dosing/planning, palliative RT is commonly used, although specific dose and fractionation recommendations should take into account burden of metastatic disease, normal tissue tolerance, and expected survival.

Management of resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma — surgical role, risks, survival, and prognostic factors: Surgical resection is the only potentially curative technique for managing pancreatic cancer, yet > 80% of patients present with disease that is not resectable; in experienced centers studies demonstrated an acceptably low (< 5%) mortality; even under the most optimal clinical trial conditions, the median survival of resected patients following adjuvant therapy ranges from 20.1 to 28.0 months; and negative margin status (ie, R0 resection), tumor DNA content, small tumor size, and absence of lymph node metastases are cited as the strongest prognostic indicators for long-term survival.

### Managing inoperable pancreatic cancer: the role of the pancreaticobiliary physician [^114PKu7z]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite our understanding of pancreatic cancer (PC), the majority of patients with this disease are incurable. Both the incidence and mortality rates for PC have increased over the last decade. At diagnosis, the majority of patients have locally advanced PC, less than 20% of patients are eligible for potentially curative resection and approximately one-third have metastatic disease. The combination of frequent advanced presentation, low resection rates and poor responses to chemotherapy make PC one of the most lethal tumours. The treatment goals are to maintain local control, manage tumour-related morbidities and improve quality of life. Patients with inoperable PC are likely to experience significant symptoms associated with their tumour, including pancreatic insufficiency, nutritional deficiencies, pain, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and diabetes. As a result, guidance on the management of patients with inoperable PC is critical. PC is commonly referred centrally to specialist centres particularly for surgery; however, the majority do not undergo surgical intervention and thus the importance of pancreaticobiliary physicians and endoscopists. This review will focus on the non-operative management of patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and review some of the issues that centralisation has contributed to.

### Short-and long-term survival in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 1993–2013 [^11574gHv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Background: During the past 2 decades, numerous clinical trials have focused on improving outcomes in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPDAC). The efficacy of new treatments has been demonstrated among highly selected patients in randomized phase III trials; hence, it is not clear to what extent these advances are reflected within the broader mPDAC population. Materials and Methods: Survival statistics were extracted from the SEER database for patients diagnosed with mPDAC between 1993 and 2013. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazard models. Results: The study population consisted of 57,263 patients diagnosed with mPDAC between 1993 and 2013; 52% were male, with a median age of 69 years (range, 15–104). Superior prognosis correlated with younger age, being married, tumor located within the head of the pancreas, lower grade disease, and more recent year of diagnosis. Median overall survival (OS) remained stable at 2 months between 1993 and 2013. Improvements in OS were seen for younger patients (age < 50 years) and those with a more recent year of diagnosis (2009–2013). The percentage of patients who died within 2 months of initial diagnosis decreased between 1993 and 2013 (from 63.5% to 50.6%; P < .0001). The percentage of patients surviving ≥ 12 months improved from 4.9% in 1993 to 12.7% in 2013 (P < .0001). Conclusions: In recent years a modest improvement in OS has been seen among younger patients with mPDAC. The percentage of patients living beyond 1 year has significantly increased over time; however, the percentage of those dying within 2 months remains substantial.

### Pancreatic cancer [^111HQ7nS]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer, and advances in patients' management have also taken place. Evidence is beginning to show that screening first-degree relatives of individuals with several family members affected by pancreatic cancer can identify non-invasive precursors of this malignant disease. The incidence of and number of deaths caused by pancreatic tumours have been gradually rising, even as incidence and mortality of other common cancers have been declining. Despite developments in detection and management of pancreatic cancer, only about 4% of patients will live 5 years after diagnosis. Survival is better for those with malignant disease localised to the pancreas, because surgical resection at present offers the only chance of cure. Unfortunately, 80–85% of patients present with advanced unresectable disease. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer responds poorly to most chemotherapeutic agents. Hence, we need to understand the biological mechanisms that contribute to development and progression of pancreatic tumours. In this Seminar we will discuss the most common and deadly form of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

### The role of radiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma [^117HuCFG]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

The prognosis for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma remains dismal despite advances in chemotherapy and radiotherapy over the past few decades. The use of radiotherapy for pancreatic carcinoma is often disputed because of the hypothesis that patients with pancreatic cancer die from distant metastases. It is well accepted that the greatest chance for cure of pancreatic cancer involves surgical resection of the primary tumor. However, there is much controversy about the role of radiotherapy in local disease control. The aim of this Review is to discuss data from the available studies, both prospective and retrospective, that evaluate treatment options for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. We focus on the benefits associated with local therapies, including radiotherapy and surgical resection, as they relate to improved local disease control, prolonged overall survival and improved symptom control.

### Current management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer [^111CdKum]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Almost 30% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with large, locally advanced tumors in the absence of distant metastases. Because surgical resection is frequently contraindicated by vascular invasion, locally advanced pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis with a 6–10-month median survival. Recent advances in the multimodality treatment of other gastrointestinal malignancies have not altered the management of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, a clinical dilemma reflected by the number of nonrandomized trials and anecdotal reports addressing this difficult disease. Our review summarizes the current status of aggressive surgical resection and neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and suggests a treatment algorithm for patients with this disease based upon published clinical evidence.

### Management of the primary tumor and limited metastases in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer [^115fCoki]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

New combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy have been proven to increase response rates and survival times compared with single-agent gemcitabine for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These responses have been dramatic for a subset of patients, therefore raising questions about the management of limited metastatic disease with surgery or other ablative methods. Similarly, for patients having a complete radiographic response to chemotherapy in the metastatic compartment, whether to consider local therapy in the form of radiation or surgery for the primary tumor is now an appropriate question. Therefore, collaboration among experts in surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology has led to the development of guiding principles for local therapies to the primary intact pancreatic tumor for patients with limited metastatic disease and those who have had a significant response after systemic therapy.

### Pancreatic cancer: challenges and opportunities [^114ZJrSH]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

PC remains a challenging disease to treat. Although survival statistics for PC patients are currently bleak, our understanding of the complicated etiology and molecular mechanisms of PC has improved tremendously in recent years. Early identification of PC is the most desirable objective. Efforts should be made to determine appropriate biomarkers for early tumor detection, and to open new perspectives on immunotherapy. Precision medicine and multidisciplinary team collaboration should become a trend in the treatment of PC, and will deliver the best therapeutic schedule for individual patients.

### Radiation therapy in operable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer [^113vLjye]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

It is well established that the development of distant metastatic disease represents the dominant pattern of tumor recurrence/progression among patients with operable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, the contribution of localized or locoregional tumor burden to pancreatic cancer-associated morbidity and mortality may be underappreciated, and therefore balancing competing considerations of systemic versus local disease control becomes important in therapeutic decision-making. The role of local therapies, particularly radiation therapy, has remained somewhat controversial in this disease context. Several phase II and III trials have sought to address the relative importance and role of radiation in both the localized and locally advanced settings, including the sequencing of this modality relative to systemic therapy and its optimal means of administration. However, differences and limitations in study design have produced mixed results, particularly in terms of the contribution of radiation to overall survival benefit. An emerging paradigm that makes conceptual sense and remains the subject of active investigation is to start with a defined period of systemic treatment, thus limiting radiation to the subset of patients who do not manifest with metastatic disease during initial therapy and are therefore most likely to benefit from local control.

### Improving outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer [^115QDiE8]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Research studies aimed at improving the outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have brought about limited progress, and in clinical practice, the optimized use of surgery, chemotherapy and supportive care have led to modest improvements in survival that have probably reached a plateau. As a result, PDAC is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death in Western societies within a decade. The development of therapeutic advances in PDAC has been challenging owing to a lack of actionable molecular targets, a typically immunosuppressive microenvironment, and a disease course characterized by rapid progression and clinical deterioration. Yet, the progress in our understanding of PDAC and identification of novel therapeutic opportunities over the past few years is leading to a strong sense of optimism in the field. In this Perspective, we address the aforementioned challenges, including biological aspects of PDAC that make this malignancy particularly difficult to treat. We explore specific areas with potential for therapeutic advances, including targeting mutant KRAS, novel strategies to harness the antitumour immune response and approaches to early detection, and propose mechanisms to improve clinical trial design and to overcome various community and institutional barriers to progress.

### Defining the optimal duration of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: time for a personalized approach? [^1141vtpW]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Neoadjuvant treatment for PDAC is gaining popularity both in literature and clinical practice. This trend is driven by several factors, including the potential for higher resectability rates and increased percentage of patients completing multimodality therapy, which has the potential to translate to improved OS. Limitations in treatment response and identification of the optimal treatment regimen and duration are critical to overcome in the near future to improve outcomes for this devastating disease. While recent research into biomarkers, newer imaging modalities, and novel therapies has given hope for an improvement in the prognosis of this disease, there is much work to be done to achieve a drastic decrease in its mortality.

### Prognostic nomogram for nonresectable pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy [^114ZoJbh]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A nomogram is progressively being used as a useful predictive tool for cancer prognosis. A nomogram to predict survival in nonresectable pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy has not been reported.

Methods

Using prospectively collected data on patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy at five Japanese hospitals, we derived a predictive nomogram and internally validated it using a concordance index and calibration plots.

Results

In total, 531 patients were included between June 2001 and February 2013. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stages were III and IV in 204 and 327 patients, respectively. The median survival time of the total cohort was 11.3 months. A nomogram was generated to predict survival probabilities at 6, 12, and 18 months and median survival time, based on the following six variables: age; sex; performance status; tumour size; regional lymph node metastasis; and distant metastasis. The concordance index of the present nomogram was higher than that of the AJCC TNM staging system at 12 months (0.686 vs 0.612). The calibration plots demonstrated good fitness of the nomogram for survival prediction.

Conclusions

The present nomogram can provide valuable information for tailored decision-making early after the diagnosis of nonresectable pancreatic cancer.

### Impact of tumor grade on prognosis in pancreatic cancer: should we include grade in AJCC staging? [^115ACxpS]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Our data make a strong case for inclusion of tumor grade into current staging for pancreatic cancer; therefore, we proposed a novel TNMG staging system. With the addition of grade to the current AJCC staging system, we are better able to tease out the "best case scenario" patients in stage IA (low-grade tumors, < 2 cm, node negative and localized to the pancreas) and show an improvement in median survival of 3 months compared with stage IA in TNM staging (< 2 cm, node negative and localized). We can also identify the "bad actors" in stage IIA (high-grade tumors, node negative, and locally invasive) and move them to stage IIB in TNMG staging; again an improvement in median survival of 2 months compared with stage IIA in TNM staging. Furthermore, dividing stage IV patients into stage IVA (low grade with median survival 8 months) and stage IVB (high grade with median survival 5 months) provides better risk stratification in the very patient population most likely to enroll in future clinical trials to evaluate potential new therapies. Moreover, in support of our contention that discrimination in survival is improved with TNMG staging, the overall "spread" in median survival for TNMG staging is 25 months (range 5–30 months), which compares with 21 months with TNM staging (range 6–27 months).

### Development and validation of a prognostic model to predict the prognosis of patients who underwent chemotherapy and resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a large international population-based cohort study [^11642zJM]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, pancreatic cancer (PaC) is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Resection remains the cornerstone of curative treatment for medically fit patients with resectable locoregional PaC. However, only a small proportion of patients with PaC undergo resection. In the United States (US) and Europe during 2012–2014, resection rates ranged from 13% (Estonia) to 21% (Slovenia) for all-stage PaC and from 35% (Norway) to 69% (Denmark) for stage I–II PaC. The 3-year overall survival remains poor even for patients with stages I–II PaC who underwent resection (< 60 years, 23–39%; 60–69 years, 16–31%; and ≥ 70 years, 17–30%). Chemotherapy has been routinely recommended for resected PaC; however, it remains challenging to get many patients to adjuvant therapy after pancreatectomy.

### Current and future strategies for combined-modality therapy in pancreatic cancer [^1172Bnr7]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of pancreatic cancer remains a challenging task that often requires a multidisciplinary approach to confer optimal response and, ideally, maximize survival. A combination of locoregional approaches such as surgery and radiotherapy, along with systemic therapies for eradication of micrometastases, should be considered both for patients who are operative candidates and for those with locally advanced, unresectable disease. How best to combine these modalities in terms of schedule, timing, and choice of agents is a question that continues to be actively investigated. Some of these data are equivocal or conflicting; thus standards of care for combined-modality treatment have not been uniformly accepted to date. This article provides an overview of combined-modality therapy, focusing on the major studies that have guided our current approach to the treatment of pancreatic cancer and examining new strategies that are likely to improve outcomes and survival for patients in the future.

### Stratified survival of resected and overall pancreatic cancer patients in Europe and the United States in the early twenty-first century: a large, international population-based study [^112tqV6j]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide; > 340,000 individuals receive this diagnosis annually with similar incidence and mortality rates. PaC incidence is especially high in developed countries, being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western societies. In the EU, PaC incidence has been stable or moderately increasing over the past decades, and it was estimated to have caused 91,500 deaths in 2017 and to cause 111,500 deaths in 2025, potentially becoming the third leading cause of cancer death.

The prognosis for PaC is poor, with 5-year survival of only ~ 5%. Due to lack of effective early screening methods, more than half of PaCs are detected at advanced stages and are treated largely palliatively. According to the current guidelines, only tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages I–II PaCs are usually resectable, although the resectability criteria are differentially and arguably defined. While resection could markedly improve the long-term survival in selected patients, less than one-fifth of diagnosed cases are considered eligible for resection. Patients with resectable PaC who undergo resection have much better survival rates than those who cannot undergo resection.

We previously described the low and varying resection rates for PaC in Europe and the United States. When counseling PaC patients who are considering surgery or who have already undergone resection, it is important to provide survival estimates for the resected subgroup. However, at this time, population-based survival estimates are only available for overall patients without differentiation by resection or TNM stage, according to which, however, survival might vary greatly. Survival odds in resected PaC data from institutional reports would be accompanied with relatively high patient selection, making the generalizability questionable. Based on multiple national databases, this large investigation aimed to comprehensively and robustly provide 1-month to 5-year overall survival estimates at the population level for overall (resected and unresected) and resected PaC patients diagnosed in the early twenty-first century in Europe and the United States stratified by TNM stage and age. Furthermore, survival trends over time in each country were explored.

In breast cancer, "patients… evaluated within 8 weeks of one or more of several indicators of poor prognosis" had "a greater likelihood of documenting end-of-life discussions but without a difference in QOL or mood versus standard care". A surgical trial reported specialized palliative care "did not improve QOL", whereas "in a trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer… with a clinical prognosis of approximately 1 year, early specialized palliative care improved QOL versus standard oncology care". Notably, "the evidence has not shown any adverse events from palliative care interventions".

### Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy in curable pancreatic cancer [^113rX8NY]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the United States and the fourth leading cause of cancer death. Afflicting approximately 37,000 Americans yearly, more than 80% of patients are unresectable and, therefore, incurable at the time of their diagnosis. Although surgical resection offers the only opportunity for cure, it remains largely unsuccessful; most patients who are candidates for surgical resection relapse and die in fewer than 5 years. This mortality leaves a 5-year overall survival of about 4% for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Perhaps the most daunting realization for physicians involved in the management of this disease is the understanding that these numbers have not changed in more than 30 years. As surgery remains the foundation of curative therapy for pancreatic cancer, this article reviews the data on adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with radiotherapy as efforts to boost cure rates.

### Treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer: the role of radiation therapy [^114YNCVy]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer remains associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Surgical resection can be curative, but the majority of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Treatment for patients with locally advanced disease is controversial. Therapeutic options include systemic therapy alone, concurrent chemoradiation, or induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation. We review the evidence to date regarding the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), as well as evolving strategies including the emerging role of targeted therapies. We propose that if radiation is used for patients with LAPC, it should be delivered with concurrent chemotherapy and following a period of induction chemotherapy.

### Locally advanced pancreatic cancer: current therapeutic approach [^116rbgL1]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Even though pancreatic cancer accounts for only 2% of all cancer diagnoses in the U.S., it is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death and one of the most difficult malignancies to manage. Because of the usually late onset of symptoms, only 10%-15% of patients present with resectable disease, whereas the remaining 85%-90% present with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. Despite a lack of consistent evidence from previous clinical trials, chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy is the most commonly used approach in treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The most appropriate chemotherapy in combination with radiation is still debatable between 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine, and novel trends to prevent resistance and enhance efficacy incorporate biologically targeted agents. This paper reviews the current management options, controversies, and ongoing and future directions for the treatment of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

### Early onset pancreatic cancer: a controlled trial [^111DKHe5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is the thirteenth most common cancer worldwide with an incidence of about 8 to 10 cases per 100,000 population per year in the developed world. The prognosis is dismal with a mere 1–2% overall 5-year survival rate, making pancreatic cancer the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the US.

Following best treatment, with R0 resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, a 5-year survival rate of up to 20% is possible, but for patients with metastatic disease the median survival is below 6 months.

In Sweden the median age of onset of pancreatic cancer is 72 years. In a subgroup of patients pancreatic cancer manifests before 50 years of age, defined as early onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC). Epidemiological studies propose that this subgroup is approximately 5–10% of all pancreatic cancers and carries a large burden, one third, of years-of-potential-life-lost of the total mortality burden of pancreatic cancer. The same study also states that smokers could be overrepresented in EOPC. In the largest demographic study so far with 136 patients reported from Memorial Sloan Kettering (< 45 years at diagnosis) no differences could be noted in smoking, hereditary burden or survival when compared to other pancreatic cancer studies or registers.

Altogether there is scarce information and data of EOPC regarding biology and etiology and it would be of interest to elucidate potential risk factors and to establish prognosis regarding survival in this subgroup of pancreatic cancer since the years-of-potential-life-lost is great considering the poor prognosis.

We performed a retrospective analysis of the pancreatic cancers from 1993 through 2008 at the Lund University Hospital, Sweden, and compared EOPC with matched controls with the aim to identify possible differences as compared to the whole group of pancreatic cancer.

### Survival statistics gone awry: pancreatic cancer, a case in point [^116FjAGn]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Resections for pancreatic cancer have been performed for 65 years, with approximately 20,000 reported. A number of authors claim a 5-year survival rate of 30% to 58%. Review of the literature reveals only about 1,200 5-year survivors; however, 10 times as many individual resected survivors have been reported (in various countries), and nonresected survivors are overlooked. This high survival percentage is obtained by reducing the subset on which calculations are based and by using methods such as the Kaplan-Meier method, which produces higher figures as increasing numbers of patients are lost to follow-up. After adjustments, hardly more than 350 resected survivors could be found. Revision of statistical methods is urgently needed.

### Neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable and non-resectable pancreatic cancer [^116CpQna]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly becoming a valid treatment option for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). In borderline resectable disease, neoadjuvant therapy is employed to improve the probability of margin-clear resections. In non-metastatic, non-resectable pancreatic cancer, treatment primarily aims to induce disease control, but may achieve conversion to surgical resectability in some patients. Several treatment modalities including chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or the sequential use of both have been investigated in numerous, mostly small and non-randomized studies. Nevertheless, there is a consistent finding that neoadjuvant therapy can induce resectability in up to 30%-40% of LAPC patients. Once resection has been achieved, overall survival appears to be comparable to that observed for primarily resectable patients. Thus, patient selection evolves as an important aspect of neoadjuvant therapy; retrospective analyses identified induction chemotherapy as an appropriate tool to define LAPC patients who may benefit most from subsequent treatment with CRT. The clinical importance of induction chemotherapy may further increase once highly active protocols such as the FOLFIRINOX or the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel regimen are introduced into novel multimodality treatment concepts.

### Validation of the American joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging system for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER) analysis [^113SKd6r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The 8th edition of the AJCC staging system for pancreatic cancer incorporated several significant changes. This study sought to evaluate this staging system and assess its strengths and weaknesses relative to the 7th edition AJCC staging system.

Methods

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004–2013), 8960 patients undergoing surgical resection for non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. Concordance indices (c-index) were calculated to evaluate the discriminatory power of both staging systems. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the impact of T and N classification on overall survival.

Results

The c-index for the AJCC 8th staging system [0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59–0.61] was comparable with that for the 7th edition AJCC staging system (0.59; 95% CI, 0.58–0.60). Stratified analyses for each N classification system demonstrated a diminishing impact of T classification on overall survival with increasing nodal involvement. The corresponding c-indices were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55–0.60) for N0, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.51–0.55) for N1, and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50–0.56) for N2 classification.

Conclusion

This is the first large-scale validation of the AJCC 8th edition staging system for pancreatic cancer. The revised system provides discrimination similar to that of the 7th-edition system. However, the 8th-edition system allows for finer stratification of patients with resected tumors according to extent of nodal involvement.

### Incidence, prognosis, and possible treatment strategies of peritoneal carcinomatosis of pancreatic origin: a population-based study [^112qb1RQ]. Pancreas (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with pancreatic cancer. In an era where therapeutic options for PC of multiple origins are emerging, our aim was to provide population-based data on incidence, treatment, and prognosis of PC of pancreatic origin.

Methods

All patients with a condition diagnosed as nonendocrine pancreatic cancer between 1995 and 2009 in the area of the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were included.

Results

In total, 2924 patients had a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer of which 265 patients (9%) presented with synchronous PC. An increasing trend could be noted in patients treated with chemotherapy in more recent years (11% in 1995–1999 and 22% in 2005–2009; P = 0.060). Median survival in patients presenting with PC was only 6 weeks (95% confidence interval, 5–7 weeks) and did not improve over time, contrasting improvements among patients with nonmetastasized disease (19–30 weeks) and patients with metastasized disease confined to the liver (8–12 weeks).

Conclusion

Prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer presenting with PC remains extremely poor. Treatment options are scarce and, given the magnitude of the problem, efforts should be undertaken to develop effective treatments in experimental and clinical studies.

### Stage classification and prognosis assessment in localized pancreatic cancer: It takes two to tango… [^112PHw7H]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Accompanying ArticleFree accessORIGINAL REPORTSImproved Clinical Staging System for Localized Pancreatic Cancer Using the ABC Factors: A TAPS Consortium Study Although the 5-year survival of patients diagnosed with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has increased from 32% to 44% over the 2018–2023 period. 1, 2predicting the probability of cure and selecting the optimal therapeutic strategy in individual patients remains extremely difficult. Anatomical disease extent, especially regarding vascular involvement, is mostly perceived as a technical challenge for the surgeon to achieve a R0 resection; similarly, patient's performance status and comorbidities are perceived as factors altering the risk/benefit ratio of surgical intervention.

At multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, each of the ABC factors demonstrated independent prognostic value in terms of overall survival; when combined in a simplified clinical point score, five different groups of patients with nonmetastatic PDAC with 5-year survival rates ranging from 4. 8% to 47% were discriminated. Thus, the authors suggest that staging of patients with localized PDAC at diagnosis should be based on anatomy, CA 19–9, and PS.
3. 6Disease burden, reflected by cancer stage and codified using the TNM classification, 7, 8is arguably the most important determinant of prognosis in patients with cancer. 9, 10However, cancer staging not only serves to determine prognosis but also to guide patient care, to assist in evaluating treatment results, to enable cancer research and the exchange of information between different centers, and to support global cancer control activities.

It has long been recognized that many factors, besides anatomical extent of disease, can contribute to prognosis. Many attempts at including additional prognostic factors in staging classifications have been made, leading to the development of a separate Union for International Cancer Control /American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer 11or the inclusion of the levels of serum tumor markers in the prognostic group classification of testicular cancer. 12More complex prognostic staging systems, incorporating TNM parameters along with additional prognostic clinicopathological factors, have been proposed, for example, for metastatic breast cancer. 13Although potentially important to facilitate a more accurate determination of prognosis, such attempts may be fraught by the inconsistent use of terms and definitions, resulting in uncertainty and confusion, rather than precision.

This may limit the utility of the TNM classification, particularly in geographical regions in which the necessary biomarker tests are unavailable. 7, 14. 15, 16A unanimous consensus was reached that anatomical extent of disease should be considered and presented separately from other prognostic factors but could still be combined with other factors in the framework of prognostic groups. 15According to such terminology, the ABC system would fall in the prognostic groupor prognostic stage grouprather than in the stageor anatomical stage groupcategory. Pathological pancreatic cancer staging introduced by the 8th TNM edition has been widely validated and recognized as resulting in more balanced distribution among stages, enhanced prognostic discrimination, and an overall better balance between simplicity, ease of use, and prognostic ability. 17–21Clinical TNM staging in localized pancreatic cancer, however, remains an unresolved challenge.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Recommendations BRCAmutations, and TRK alterations are provided for all treatment-eligible patients to select patients for recommended therapies, including pembrolizumab, olaparib, larotrectinib, or entrectinib, or potential clinical trials. The Expert Panel continues to endorse the remaining recommendations for second-line chemotherapy, as well as other recommendations related to treatment, follow-up, and palliative care from the 2018 version of this guideline. Additional information is available at www. asco. org/gastrointestinal-cancer-guidelines. Introduction 1and an estimated 460, 000 new cases worldwide in 2018. 2A diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with poor prognosis as a result of early micrometastatic spread, and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic pancreatic cancer is approximately
2. 9%.

3 4ASCO guidelines are assessed annually for potential updating, or an update can be triggered whenever new potentially practice-changing evidence is published. In 2018, new evidence triggered a focused update of the recommendations for second-line therapy for patients who had experienced progression or intolerable toxicity with first-line therapy, including the addition of pembrolizumab as an option for mismatch repair–deficient or microsatellite instability–high tumors, as well as associated testing recommendations. 5 5This 2020 update of the 2018 recommendations was triggered by new evidence for poly polymerase inhibitor olaparib as an option for maintenance therapy after first-line treatment, as well as new studies of tissue agnostic agents that target fusions of the neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinase, and NTRKgene fusions. Results of testing can lead to therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, programmed death-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, TRK fusion inhibitors, and clinical trials of targeted therapies. Genomic testing is recommended as part of an initial assessment to ensure that the results of testing are available at the time of treatment decision where applicable after first-line therapy. NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3. TRK fusions were identified using next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization as routinely obtained by each participating site.

### Pancreatic cancer [^117K4Zpb]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat; the risk is greater for men, smokers, and those with diabetes. There are some studies that link high levels of red meat consumption to increased risk of pancreatic cancer, though meta-analyses typically find no clear evidence of a relationship. Smokers' risk of developing the disease decreases immediately upon quitting, and almost returns to that of the rest of the population after 20 years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed.

Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis; after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 12% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival considerably varies depending on the type of tumor. Cystadenocarcinomas account for 1% of pancreatic cancers, and they have a better prognosis than the other exocrine types. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare form, mostly occurring in childhood, and with a relatively good prognosis.

Other exocrine cancers include adenosquamous carcinomas, signet ring cell carcinomas, hepatoid carcinomas, colloid carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells. Solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rare low-grade neoplasm that mainly affects younger women, and generally has a very good prognosis. Signs and symptoms Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself. This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms. Hereditary pancreatitis gives a greatly increased lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of 30–40% to the age of 70.

Screening for early pancreatic cancer may be offered to individuals with hereditary pancreatitis on a research basis. Some people may choose to have their pancreas surgically removed to prevent cancer from developing in the future. PanNETs have been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and von Hippel Lindau syndromes.
- Chronic pancreatitis appears to almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset pancreatitis may be a symptom of a tumor. The risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with familial pancreatitis is particularly high. The first is pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. These lesions are microscopic abnormalities in the pancreas and are often found in autopsies of people with no diagnosed cancer. These lesions may progress from low to high grade and then to a tumor.

### Approach to patients with pancreatic cancer without detectable metastases… [^111u7vD6]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

The poors outcomes associated with pancreatic cancer clearly reflect the advanced stage of disease at diagnosis for most patients. Through this lens, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that roughly 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer have no clinically detectable metastases at presentation. Herein, we discuss how patients with localized pancreatic cancer are currently managed. The primary goal of care for patients with resectable and borderline-resectable tumors is cure, facilitated by achieving margin-negative resection of the primary disease and delivering effective adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy. For patients with locally advanced disease, the focus is on limiting local progression and outgrowth of metastatic disease and maintaining quality of life. The neoadjuvant setting provides a particularly favorable setting for evaluating new systemic strategies.

Given the array of new targets, including immunomodulatory approaches, there is reason for optimism that we can markedly improve survival for all patients with pancreatic cancer and enter an era in which surgery with curative intent actually fulfills this goal on a much more regular basis. Introduction Of the estimated 47, 000 new cases of pancreatic cancer in 2015, 1approximately 50% will be classified as clinically localized, with 35% of patients diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that precludes surgical resection and the remainder diagnosed with primary tumors that are potentially resectable. Cross-sectional imaging is critical for defining tumor-vessel relationships that, in the absence of metastatic disease, determine the potential for margin-negative pancreatectomy. Because more active cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens have been developed, treatment of localized pancreatic cancer continues to evolve.

This has been manifest by systemic therapy replacing radiation therapy as the backbone of treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and by the increasing use of preoperative systemic treatment for patients in whom surgery is contemplated, particularly for those patients with borderline resectable tumors. Ultimately, optimal treatment planning for patients with localized pancreatic cancer is predicated on adequate assessment of the potential for margin-negative resection, assessment of the patient's perioperative risk as influenced by performance status and comorbidities, assessment of disease biology to guide rational treatment sequencing, and development of a surgical plan designed to maximize adherence to oncologic principles. In this article, we discuss these concepts, the current status of management for localized pancreatic cancer, and ongoing and upcoming clinical trials of significance.

Resectable Pancreatic Cancer In 2015, fewer than 20% of newly diagnosed patients with pancreatic cancer will be classified as having resectable disease. For those patients who do undergo resection, relapse is unfortunately the rule rather than the exception, and median survival, as revealed by recent prospective randomized studies, hovers around 23 months. 4In the absence of metastatic disease, tumors are classified as clearly resectable if the following criteria are fulfilled: there is a clear plane between the tumor and the major arteries, there is no contact with the superior mesenteric vein and/or portal vein or less than 180 degrees of contact without venous deformity, and the SMV-PVs are patent. 2, 8Unfortunately, even in the setting of margin-negative resection, the risk is high for both local and systemic recurrence and, in the absence of adjuvant therapy, the 5-year survival is roughly 10% to 13%.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma management | JCO oncology practice… [^113F4cBw]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

PDAC accounts for more than 85% of all solid pancreatic tumors. 2Frustratingly, despite many decades of research and clinical trials, its prognosis remains poor with a 5-year relative survival of 11. 5% for all stages and only
3. 1% for metastatic disease. 3Surgical resection is the only potential curative treatment for PDAC. However, because of lack of early symptoms and no current screening strategies, up to 80% of patients present with advanced or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, which precludes them from surgical resection.
4. Practical Clinical Staging On the basis of whether a distant organ is involved, PDAC can be divided into metastatic or nonmetastatic disease. For the nonmetastatic group, on the basis of resectability, it can be further classified as resectable, borderline resectable, or unresectable/locally advanced disease. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

Gem/nab-paclitaxel versus Gem as adjuvant treatment for RPC was evaluated in the APACT trial. The primary end point of disease-free survival by the independent reviewer was not met in the initial report-disease-free survival with Gem followed by surgery and adjuvant Gem or immediate surgery followed by adjuvant Gem. Updated results from 2022 showed a sobering mOS of 15. 7 versus
14. 3 months, but with some durability of effect, with a 5-year OS of 20. 5% versus
6. 5%, in favor of neoadjuvant CRT. Key Points The new standard of care for RPC is upfront surgical resection followed by 6 months of mFOLFIRINOX. For patients who are not candidates for mFOLFIRINOX, 6 months of Gem and Cap or Gem alone can be considered. Data on benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy are lacking. Ongoing trend is neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There appears to be no significant difference between mFOLFIRINOX and Gem/nabP. The only phase III clinical trial is PREOPANC, which included patients with both RPC and BRPC.

In the BRPC subgroup, the study 13showed that, compared with immediate surgery, preoperative CRT with Gem resulted in an improved mOS. In addition, preoperative CRT led to a significant improvement of R0 rate when compared with immediate surgery.
14. Key Points Currently, no standard-of-care recommendation for BRPC is available. Multidisciplinary discussion upfront is recommended. Clinical trial evaluation is encouraged. Neoadjuvant treatment followed by re-evaluation of resectability is the common practice. Neoadjuvant treatments include induction chemotherapy, preoperative chemoradiation, or a combination of both. However, no specific neoadjuvant regimen is recommended off study because of limited evidence. Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer/LAPC Nearly 30% of patients with PDAC present with locally advanced disease at initial diagnosis.

- Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the pancreas.
- Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer.
- Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss.
- Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose early.
- Tests that examine the pancreas are used to diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer.
- Some people decide to get a second opinion.
- Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options. There are many risk factors for pancreatic cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to pancreatic cancer. Learn more about how cancer develops at What Is Cancer. Having one or more of these risk factors does not mean that you will get pancreatic cancer.

Many people with risk factors never develop pancreatic cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose early. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:

- There aren't any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer.
- The signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, when present, are like the signs and symptoms of many other illnesses.
- The pancreas is hidden behind other organs such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and bile ducts. Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options.

The prognosis and treatment options depend on:

- whether the tumor can be removed by surgery
- the stage of the cancer
- the patient's general health
- whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred. Pancreatic cancer can be controlled only if it is found before it has spread, when it can be completely removed by surgery. If the cancer has spread, palliative treatment can improve the patient's quality of life by controlling the symptoms and complications of this disease.
- Stage 0
- Stage I pancreatic cancer
- Stage II pancreatic cancer
- Stage III pancreatic cancer
- Stage IV pancreatic cancer
- The following groups are used to plan treatment:

- Resectable pancreatic cancer
- Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer
- Locally advanced pancreatic cancer
- Metastatic pancreatic cancer
- Recurrent pancreatic cancer. Cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body. Cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the tumor, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It is important to know the stage of the pancreatic cancer to plan the best treatment. There are several staging systems for cancer that describe the extent of the cancer. Pancreatic cancer staging usually uses the TNM staging system. Your cancer may be described by this staging system in your pathology report.
