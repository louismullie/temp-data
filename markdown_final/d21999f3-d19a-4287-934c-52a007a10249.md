## Question

Foes albumin raise blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albumin raises blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between endogenous serum albumin levels and exogenous intravenous (IV) albumin infusions. Then, I should verify the physiologic rationale via colloid oncotic pressure and volume expansion. Next, I will examine clinical evidence for IV albumin's hemodynamic effects across contexts (postoperative hypovolemia, dialysis hypotension, cirrhosis, critical illness). After that, I need to review epidemiologic data on serum albumin concentration and blood pressure and consider confounding by volume and inflammation. I will also separate the concept of albuminuria as a vascular risk marker from serum albumin physiology. Finally, I should synthesize guideline recommendations and provide a practical bottom line with caveats and monitoring, ensuring I anchor key points to high-quality guidance and trials [^114LRCTv] [^113wu56y].

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't mix mechanisms. Serum albumin refers to the endogenous plasma protein concentration, whereas IV albumin is an administered colloid solution (often 5% or 20%) used primarily for plasma volume expansion, oncotic support, and specific indications in cirrhosis; the question "Does albumin raise blood pressure?" could mean either whether increasing serum albumin concentration is associated with higher BP or whether IV albumin acutely elevates BP by expanding effective circulatory volume, and I should keep these as separate but related lines of reasoning [^113wu56y] [^114fLvXr].

> I will now examine the physiologic rationale. Albumin is the dominant contributor to plasma colloid oncotic pressure, so giving IV albumin should retain water intravascularly, increase preload, augment cardiac output via the Frank-Starling mechanism, and thereby increase arterial pressure in hypovolemic or vasodilated states; conversely, changes in measured serum albumin can reflect shifts in distribution, dilution, and inflammation rather than a direct pressor effect, so I need to ensure I don't over-interpret concentration changes as causal for BP changes [^114LRCTv] [^113wu56y].

> Next, I should review direct hemodynamic data. In a randomized trial of postoperative hypovolemic patients, colloids including 5% albumin increased plasma volume substantially more than saline (median 19% vs 3%) and resulted in greater increases in cardiac index and left ventricular stroke work during a filling pressure–guided challenge, consistent with improved preload and, by implication, the capacity to raise BP when volume-responsive, although the study emphasized cardiac output rather than mean arterial pressure as the primary readout [^1113Rgcd].

> Wait, let me verify how this translates to routine use. In dialysis populations prone to intradialytic hypotension, IV albumin is often used to support plasma refilling, but careful reviews highlight that albumin is "not nearly as effective a volume expander as might be assumed" based on pure oncotic theory, benefit is context-dependent, and costs and potential risks (e.g., with hyperoncotic solutions in sepsis) must be weighed, so its BP effect can be modest and inconsistent outside clear volume responsiveness [^1144aKTP].

> I need to check the cirrhosis-specific evidence because that's where albumin is most codified. Guidelines recommend albumin for large-volume paracentesis (typically 8 g per liter removed) to prevent circulatory dysfunction, for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis at 1.5 g/kg day 1 and 1 g/kg day 3, and as part of hepatorenal syndrome management with vasoconstrictors, with the clinical goal being maintenance of effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion more than targeting BP per se; importantly, the certainty for patient-important outcomes is sometimes low, but practice is conditionally endorsed and widely implemented [^113cgVjx] [^1136RXKN] [^113hz4jE] [^112YsWPL] [^111NKKKY] [^112ibAZK] [^114fLvXr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in critical illness. Contemporary guidance advises against routine use of IV albumin for volume replacement in ARDS, and neonatal guidance advises against albumin for preterm hemodynamic support, reflecting uncertain benefit and potential harm in those settings; I initially thought this extended to burns broadly, but wait, I should correct myself: the American Burn Association suggests albumin can be considered within 24 hours to improve urine output and reduce crystalloid burden in deteriorating resuscitations, whereas another guideline panel advises avoidance for routine replacement in adult burns, so recommendations diverge by society and clinical scenario [^113u35pK] [^111uWbBQ] [^112XNjdi] [^115YDwcF].

> Let me consider observational data on serum albumin and BP. Cross-sectional population data show a positive association between serum albumin within the physiologic range and higher systolic and diastolic BP, with several mmHg differences across albumin strata; however, this is associative, not causal, and susceptible to confounding by hydration, nutrition, inflammation, and metabolic factors, so I should be cautious not to interpret it as albumin "raising" BP in a mechanistic sense [^112SxV33].

> I should double-check the directionality when fluid status changes. In peritoneal dialysis patients, reducing extracellular fluid volume increased measured serum albumin while simultaneously lowering systolic BP markedly, suggesting that hemoconcentration and inflammation dynamics dominate serum albumin levels, and that effective circulating volume — not albumin concentration per se — is the primary driver of BP changes in this context; inflammation as a negative acute-phase influence on albumin further complicates interpretation of serum levels [^113AyVaq] [^111nSY5Z].

> Next, I should review albuminuria separately, because urinary albumin excretion is a vascular risk signal, not a volume expander. Higher urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios, even within the "high-normal" range, predict incident hypertension and BP progression over time in multiple cohorts, reflecting endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease rather than a causal effect of circulating albumin on BP, which is a distinct concept from IV albumin's oncotic action [^113CYbc6] [^111AyME5] [^116thpkP] [^1152B1sY].

> But wait, what if fluid boluses themselves can be harmful despite transient hemodynamic gains. Re-analyses of the FEAST pediatric trial found that albumin or saline boluses were associated with worse outcomes, with plausible mechanisms including hemodilution, acidosis, and respiratory or neurologic compromise, underscoring that BP elevation is not synonymous with improved survival and that bolus indications must be tightly selected; this caveat applies primarily to severely ill children in low-resource settings but reinforces the need for careful patient selection [^115NHxww] [^112wGYWq] [^113JLtDt] [^1163uVB2].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. IV albumin can raise blood pressure transiently by expanding plasma volume in patients who are preload responsive or vasodilated, with the clearest clinical roles in cirrhosis-related indications and select resuscitation contexts; however, its BP effect is variable, often modest, and context-dependent, and routine use solely to "raise BP" is not recommended outside evidence-based indications, whereas serum albumin concentration itself does not directly raise BP and observed epidemiologic associations are largely confounded by volume status and inflammation [^1113Rgcd] [^114fLvXr] [^113u35pK] [^112SxV33] [^113AyVaq] [^111nSY5Z].

> Practically, I need to ensure therapy aligns with guidelines: prioritize crystalloids for initial hypovolemia, use IV albumin for large-volume paracentesis, SBP, and HRS in cirrhosis as recommended, avoid routine albumin in ARDS and preterm neonates, consider albumin in deteriorating burn resuscitation per burn-specific guidance, and be cautious in dialysis hypotension where benefits are uncertain; monitor for fluid overload and renal effects, and remember that urine albumin is a risk biomarker for future hypertension, warranting cardiovascular risk reduction and guideline-concordant evaluation rather than albumin infusion [^113cgVjx] [^1136RXKN] [^112YsWPL] [^111NKKKY] [^113u35pK] [^111uWbBQ] [^112XNjdi] [^115YDwcF] [^1144aKTP] [^113CYbc6] [^1175ZuJn].

Yes, albumin can acutely raise blood pressure when administered intravenously [^1113Rgcd] by expanding plasma volume and increasing cardiac output [^1144aKTP], but the effect is typically **modest and short-lived**. In chronic settings, higher serum albumin is associated with higher blood pressure [^112SxV33], likely reflecting **shared risk factors rather than a direct causal effect**. Albumin is **not recommended for routine blood pressure management** [^114fLvXr] and should be used cautiously in patients at risk of fluid overload or hypertension [^113u35pK].

## Physiological mechanisms linking albumin and blood pressure

Albumin is the primary contributor to plasma **oncotic pressure** [^111nSY5Z], which retains fluid intravascularly and maintains effective circulating volume [^114LRCTv]. Intravenous albumin raises oncotic pressure, draws interstitial fluid into the vasculature, expands plasma volume [^1113Rgcd], and increases preload and cardiac output — changes that can acutely raise blood pressure [^1144aKTP].

---

## Clinical evidence of albumin's effect on blood pressure

### Acute effects of intravenous albumin administration

Clinical studies show that intravenous albumin can **acutely increase blood pressure**, particularly in hypovolemia or hypotension [^1144aKTP]. After cardiac or major vascular surgery, colloid loading (including albumin) increased plasma volume, preload, and cardiac output more than saline, with a modest rise in blood pressure [^1113Rgcd]. In dialysis, albumin is sometimes used to prevent intradialytic hypotension by promoting plasma refilling, but its effectiveness remains **limited and controversial** [^1144aKTP].

---

### Chronic association between serum albumin and blood pressure

Observational data suggest a **positive association** between serum albumin and blood pressure within the physiological range. In the Oslo Health Study [^112SxV33], each standard deviation increase in serum albumin corresponded to a 1–3 mmHg rise in systolic and diastolic pressure. However, this likely reflects shared risk factors (e.g. obesity, metabolic syndrome) rather than a direct causal relationship.

---

## Clinical scenarios where albumin administration affects blood pressure

Albumin is used in specific clinical scenarios in which its volume-expanding properties can **influence blood pressure** [^114xAjJj]:

- **Large-volume paracentesis**: Albumin is recommended [^113zw6Nc] after removal of > 5 L ascites to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction [^113cgVjx] and hypotension [^114fLvXr].

- **Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)**: Albumin is used with vasoconstrictors [^112ibAZK] to improve effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion [^113wu56y], potentially increasing blood pressure [^112YsWPL].

- **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)**: Albumin is recommended [^1162mKa6] to reduce renal impairment and mortality, partly by stabilizing hemodynamics [^113hz4jE] [^1136RXKN].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While albumin can acutely raise blood pressure, it **carries risks**, particularly in patients prone to fluid overload or hypertension:

- **Fluid overload and pulmonary edema**: Albumin can cause or worsen fluid overload, particularly in heart failure or renal impairment [^114fLvXr] [^112wGYWq].

- **Hypertension**: Albumin can acutely increase blood pressure, potentially exacerbating hypertension or causing hypertensive complications [^1113Rgcd].

- **Cost and resource utilization**: Albumin is expensive [^1144aKTP] and resource-intensive, limiting routine use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend albumin for specific indications (e.g. large-volume paracentesis, HRS, SBP) [^115teLsQ] [^113hz4jE] but **do not support routine use** for blood pressure management [^114fLvXr]. Albumin should be used cautiously in patients at risk of fluid overload or hypertension, with close monitoring of hemodynamics and fluid status [^113u35pK].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Effect on blood pressure** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Intravenous albumin administration | Acute increase in blood pressure due to plasma volume expansion [^1113Rgcd] | Recommended in specific scenarios (e.g. large-volume paracentesis, HRS, SBP) [^113zw6Nc] [^112YsWPL] |
| Chronic serum albumin levels | Positive association with blood pressure, likely due to shared risk factors [^112SxV33] | No recommendation for routine albumin administration to manage blood pressure |
| Hypoalbuminemia | Associated with lower blood pressure [^113GY2Fv] and poor outcomes [^111Nt5EN] | Albumin administration may be considered in specific clinical contexts [^113B8aVV] |

Albumin can acutely raise blood pressure via plasma volume expansion [^1113Rgcd], but the effect is **modest and transient** [^1144aKTP]. Chronic associations between albumin and blood pressure likely reflect shared risk factors rather than causality [^112SxV33]. Albumin **should not be used routinely** for blood pressure management [^114fLvXr] and should be used cautiously in patients at risk of fluid overload or hypertension.

### Intravenous albumin for mitigating hypotension and augmenting ultrafiltration during kidney replacement therapy [^1144aKTP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Among its many functions, owing to its oversized effect on colloid oncotic pressure, intravascular albumin helps preserve the effective circulatory volume. Hypoalbuminemia is common in hospitalized patients and is found especially frequently in patients who require KRT either for AKI or as maintenance hemodialysis. In such patients, hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with morbidity, intradialytic hypotension, and mortality. Intravenous albumin may be administered in an effort to prevent or treat hypotension or to augment fluid removal, but this practice is controversial.

Theoretically, intravenous albumin administration might prevent or treat hypotension by promoting plasma refilling in response to ultrafiltration. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that albumin administration is not nearly as effective a volume expander as might be assumed according to its oncotic properties. Although intravenous albumin is generally considered to be safe, it is also very expensive. In addition, there are potential risks to using it to prevent or treat intradialytic hypotension. Some recent studies have suggested that hyperoncotic albumin solutions may precipitate or worsen AKI in patients with sepsis or shock; however, the overall evidence supporting this effect is weak.

In this review, we explore the theoretical benefits and risks of using intravenous albumin to mitigate intradialytic hypotension and/or enhance ultrafiltration and summarize the evidence relating to this practice. This includes studies relevant to its use in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

### Serum albumin and blood pressure: a population-based, cross-sectional study [^112SxV33]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Information about the association between serum albumin and blood pressure is limited. The purpose of the present paper was to investigate this relationship in different age groups in males and females.

- **Methods**: In the cross-sectional Norwegian Oslo Health Study, the concentration of serum albumin and blood pressure was determined in 5,071 men and women aged 30–75 years. The albumin-blood pressure relationship was studied using multiple regression.

- **Results**: In general, men had higher albumin values than women, and young subjects had higher albumin values than older subjects. Within all age groups and both sexes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased with increasing albumin concentration within the physiological range. An increase in the albumin concentration over the physiological range from approximately 40 to 50 g/l was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure between 5 and 11 mmHg in males, depending on age, and between 6 and 17 mmHg in females. Corresponding increases in diastolic blood pressure were between 3 and 7 mmHg in males, and 4 to 9 mmHg in females. Per one SD increment in the albumin concentration, the blood pressure increase was 1–3 mmHg.

- **Conclusion**: Within the different age groups, irrespective of sex and age, a positive association was found between serum albumin and blood pressure. Since albumin, in contrast to high blood pressure, is considered to be cardioprotective, the two variables probably affect cardiovascular risk through unrelated mechanisms.

### Cardiac response is greater for colloid than saline fluid loading after cardiac or vascular surgery [^1113Rgcd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). High credibility.

To study the effects on volume expansion and myocardial function of colloids or crystalloids in the treatment of hypovolaemic hypotension after cardiac and major vascular surgery, a single-centre, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients (n = 67) were subjected to a 90-minute filling pressure-guided fluid challenge with saline 0.9% or the colloids gelatin 4%, hydroxyethyl starch 6%, or albumin 5%. Biochemical variables and haemodynamics (transpulmonary thermodilution) were measured.

An amount of 1800 (1300–1800) mL of saline or 1600 (750–1800) mL of colloid solution (P < 0.005) was infused. Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) decreased in the saline group and increased in the colloid groups (P < 0.001). Plasma volume increased by 3.0% (-18 to 24) in the saline versus 19% (-11 to 50) in the colloid groups (P < 0.001). Cardiac index increased by a median of 13% (not significant) in the saline group and by 22% in the colloid groups (P < 0.005). The rise in the left ventricular stroke work index was greater in the colloid than in the saline groups. The different colloids were equally effective. The rise in cardiac index related to the rise in plasma volume and global end-diastolic volume, confirming plasma volume and preload augmentation by the fluid loading.

After cardiac or major vascular surgery, the pressure- and time-guided fluid response is dependent on the type of fluid used. Colloid fluid loading leads to a greater increase in preload-recruitable cardiac and left ventricular function compared to saline.

### Interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein levels change in chronic dialysis patients prior to death [^113GY2Fv]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

This international study may contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological phenomena occurring before death in this highly vulnerable group of patients. The main message for the clinical practitioner is that the temporal evolutions of albumin, systolic blood pressure (SBP), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are as important to follow as their absolute levels. This insight should also serve as a wake-up call for dialysis providers, as they may need to implement information systems that allow physicians to track not only the absolute levels of variables but also their dynamics.

Although a decline in albumin levels or rises in CRP usually alerts health-care providers, a consistent and unintended decline in SBP by more than 2–5 mm Hg per quarter or an IDWG drop by more than 0.2% per quarter may go unnoticed. On an operational level, the identification of temporal patterns can be supported by patient reports that depict both absolute levels and trends of variables.

Moreover, the results of our study offer guidance for the development of predictive models. We speculate that it might be possible to construct multivariate algorithms by combining IDWG, SBP, and serum albumin levels that may be more predictive of the risk of death than each individual parameter. Such models may appreciate even subtle intraindividual dynamics, such as mild drops in SBP over the course of months and a decline of serum albumin even within the normal range, which are likely to escape notice in a busy clinical setting. Paradoxically, some of these changes in key indicators may be welcomed as the result of successful interventions.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients, and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms.

Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient-important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: Primary objectives were to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary objectives included assessing the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

- **Search methods**: We utilized standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. Searches were performed in the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lo

### Renin: Friend or foe [^115Ehyge]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Renin maintains blood pressure through vasoconstriction when there is inadequate salt to maintain volume. In populations where blood pressure is more often high than low, and vascular death is more common than hemorrhage or dehydration, therapeutic reductions in renin secretion or response are valuable. Whether long-term benefits are due entirely to blood pressure reduction remains unproved. The pathway can be blocked at its rate-limiting step (beta blockade or direct renin inhibition), the synthesis of the active product, angiotensin II, or at the receptor for angiotensin.

Because renin and sodium are the two main factors in blood pressure control, and renin levels vary inversely with sodium load, blood pressure control requires a combination of natriuresis and blocking the consequential increase in renin activity. Being a large and stable molecule, renin is among the easiest and cheapest of hormone measurements. Understanding the simple biochemistry and physiology of renin permits optimal use of the drugs acting to raise or suppress this hormone.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^115NHxww]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The physiological basis and development of composite scores for respiratory function, cardiovascular function, and detection of raised intracranial pressure and neurological function are described in detail in the web appendix (pp 3–6).

To assess respiratory compromise, we used respiratory rate (which increases as respiratory function worsens) and oxygen saturation (which decreases as respiratory function worsens). Vital signs were normalized as described in the appendix, with published normal values. We converted the age-adjusted degree of tachypnea and pulse oximetry measurements to the same direction of effect and weighted the contribution of oxygen saturation:

Respiratory score = (respiratory rate – mean respiratory rate for age) + 5 × (100 – oxygen saturation)

Cardiovascular responses to developing shock maintain blood pressure with vasoconstriction and increasing heart rate. If these fail, blood pressure falls. We combined age-adjusted degree of tachycardia, age-adjusted degree of hypotension, and weighted peripheral capillary refill time into a measure of cardiovascular compromise:

Cardiovascular score = (heart rate – mean heart rate for age) + (mean systolic blood pressure for age – systolic blood pressure) + 25 × (capillary refill time)

Raised intracranial pressure is associated with decreasing conscious level, bradycardia, and hypertension (the latter two are components of Cushing's triad). We combined the weighted level of consciousness measured on the AVPU scale (alert = 0; responds to verbal stimulus = 1; responds to painful stimulus = 2; unresponsive = 3), and age-a

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111nSY5Z]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is largely a function of increased vascular permeability and increased interstitial volume. In this section, we will discuss the role of inflammation in mediating these responses, not only in pathologic states but also in life events such as pregnancy, lactation, and cancer growth.

- **Inflammation, increased capillary permeability, and hypoalbuminemia**: Increased vascular permeability for cells and plasma solutes is a universal reaction in trauma, critical illness, chronic disease, life events, multiple or isolated organ failure, and cancer. This response is evident in circumstances including edema in healing wounds and the necessity to maintain intravascular volume by "overhydrating" traumatized or postsurgery patients. Adequately resuscitated patients are maintained in a positive fluid balance of 5–10 liters after clean elective major surgery or other types of trauma. Fluid resuscitation is necessary in these circumstances to avoid hypovolemia and the development of shock. The same happens in children after burns, where fluid balance is positive despite the effort to prevent overhydration. The fact that fluid retention inevitably and visibly occurs in wounds, as well as at the whole-body level after trauma and burns, could reflect that this response is beneficial to some extent but may become harmful when the inflammatory stimulus cannot be adequately overcome or treated. In wounds, virtually every type of immune cell appears, producing cytokines and growth factors that support the healing process.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^1163uVB2]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Proposed physiological model of the adverse effects of fluid bolus: Bolus fluid reduces haemoglobin concentration, resulting in decreased tissue oxygenation, increasing anaerobic metabolism and metabolic acidosis. According to the Stewart model, maintenance of normal plasma pH is controlled by (1) the strong ion difference (charge difference between strong cations (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺) and strong anions (Cl⁻ and lactate⁻); (2) pCO₂; and (3) charge from weak acids (phosphate, albumin). Bolus of normal saline or 5% albumin (which have similar electrolyte content) caused hyperchloraemia and dilution of bicarbonate, resulting in a reduction in the strong ion difference. Hyperchloraemic acidosis increases the need for respiratory compensation through increased carbon dioxide excretion to maintain pH. Worsening of respiratory function due to bolus results in hypoxia (as evidenced by low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory score). This outcome, together with an inability to increase respiratory rate, impairs excretion of carbon dioxide (not shown in our study). Increasing carbon dioxide causes cerebral vasodilation, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. Fluid bolus might also directly cause cerebral oedema. The combination of adverse effects on haemoglobin concentration, acidosis, and respiratory and neurological function induced by modest albumin or saline fluid boluses might overwhelm compensatory mechanisms in the most severely ill patients, resulting in increased mortality.

### Relationship between diurnal blood pressure, renal hemodynamic function, and the renin-angiotensin system in type 1 diabetes [^113Jpccw]. Diabetes (2003). Low credibility.

In patients with diabetes, altered diurnal blood pressure (BP) regulation, characterized by a high night-to-day (N/D) ratio or "nondipping", is associated with increases in albumin excretion and a decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through an unknown mechanism. Given that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation and defective glucose control contribute to adverse renal outcomes, we examined renal responses to high glucose and manipulation of the RAS in adolescents (mean age 14 ± 2 years) with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes. These patients were segregated into two groups based on the presence or absence of a normal N/D BP ratio.

- **Renal hemodynamic comparisons during glycemic states**: In the first experiment, comparisons were made during euglycemia (4–6 mmol/l) and hyperglycemia (9–11 mmol/l), maintained by modified clamp techniques. The induction of hyperglycemia resulted in a significant increase in GFR and filtration fraction (FF) in the high N/D ratio group.

- **Renal response to angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion**: In the second experiment, the renal response to graded Ang II infusion was examined while subjects were euglycemic and salt replete. A high N/D ratio was associated with an enhanced FF response to Ang II.

- **Impact of ACE inhibition**: In the third experiment, the N/D ratio and GFR were assessed after three weeks of ACE inhibition. This maneuver corrected the high N/D ratio but had no effect on glomerular hyperfiltration.

These results suggest that RAS activation does not explain the hyperfiltration state or poor outcomes in this population. However, the observed deleterious hemodynamic responses to high glucose and Ang II and the insensitivity to…

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^113wu56y]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Albumin constitutes 60% of plasma protein in healthy individuals, and its main physiologic function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure, thereby maintaining intravascular volume. Hypoalbuminemia in cirrhosis is due to both decreased synthesis and increased catabolism. Albumin is used in patients with cirrhosis not only for its volume-expanding effect but also for its antioxidant, immune-modulating, and endothelial-stabilizing properties. The circulating albumin in cirrhotic patients is structurally modified and functionally impaired, thereby unable to perform at full functional capacity.

The normal antioxidant and scavenging properties of albumin, due to the presence of a free cysteine moiety at position 34 (cys-34), help in clearing reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and various bacterial products. These antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of albumin also have beneficial effects on cardiac output in patients with advanced cirrhosis by improving cardiac contractility. However, increased oxidative stress in patients with cirrhosis transforms the albumin to an oxidized state from its normal reduced state, rendering it unable to perform the scavenger and detoxification functions as it cannot bind to free radicals.

Although a recent study suggests that routine use of albumin in decompensated cirrhosis admitted into hospital was unable to prevent renal dysfunction, the inflammation-suppressing effect of albumin is seen in higher doses. Therefore, a meta-analysis found that a total of 600 g of albumin given over the course of HRS treatment provides significant benefits.

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19·1 million participants [^117Q4McV]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.

- **Methods**: For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and aging to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.

- **Findings**: We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19·1 million adults. Global age-standardized mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7–128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg (121·0–123·6) in women; age-standardized mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·9–79·5) for men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·9–77·6) for women. Global age-standardized prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24.1% (21.4–27.1) in men and 20.1% (17.8–22.5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income Western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest levels.

### Can a reduction in extracellular fluid volume result in increased serum albumin in peritoneal dialysis patients [^113AyVaq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serum albumin predicts survival in end-stage renal failure. The literature has emphasized the dependence of albumin on inflammation. We previously proposed an independent relationship with overhydration. At the time of writing, there is no proven therapy that increases serum albumin in dialysis patients. We investigated whether decreasing dry weight increases serum albumin in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Twenty-one subjects (15 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients and 6 continuous cycled peritoneal dialysis patients) were assessed at 0 and 4 weeks. Body weight, blood pressure, 4-site skin-fold thickness, subjective global assessment score, and use of antihypertensive medication were recorded. Fluid samples were collected for the estimation of serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and 24-hour dialysate and urine volume. The extracellular fluid volume was estimated by multiple-frequency bioelectric impedance.

Between the 0- and 4-week assessments, dialysis prescription was altered to increase the daily ultrafiltrate volume (1.00 ± 0.71 L to 1.29 ± 0.75 L; P = 0.04). Significant decreases were seen in body weight (70.7 ± 12.1 kg to 69.9 ± 12.2 kg; P = 0.0002), extracellular fluid volume (16.2 ± 3.3 L to 15.5 ± 3.2 L; P = 0.0006), systolic blood pressure (147.7 ± 26.3 mm Hg to 124.2 ± 20.9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (84.2 ± 14.5 mm Hg to 76.6 ± 11.7 mm Hg; P = 0.01), and number of antihypertensive drugs (1.9 ± 1.0 to 1.6 ± 1.1; P = 0.02). Serum albumin increased (34.6 ± 4.1 g/L to 35.9 ± 3.6 g/L; P = 0.01). C-reactive protein did not change.

### Progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes - beyond blood pressure control: an observational study [^113h1YzN]. BMC Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The results of our study indicate that hypoalbuminemia independently predicted GFR decline. In a study investigating the relationship between blood pressure and diabetic kidney disease progression, Dillon found that mean serum albumin was associated with a decline in GFR. However, since serum albumin could decrease as kidney disease progresses due to anorexia and malnutrition, this association could be attributed to reverse causality. Using a similar approach to that employed in our study, Ueda et al. reported that baseline serum albumin was a predictor of the development of ESKD in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. This study used reciprocal creatinine and/or the development of ESKD as endpoints rather than GFR decline; moreover, the population was quite different from the predominantly Caucasian U.S. male veterans examined in our study. Nevertheless, these data, in conjunction with the RENAAL and IDNT data, in which hypoalbuminemia was also an independent predictor of progression in type 2 diabetes, support the relationship between hypoalbuminemia and GFR decline.

Why would hypoalbuminemia be predictive of kidney disease progression? One possibility is that the serum albumin level reflects the degree of proteinuria, a known risk factor for progression in most kidney diseases, including diabetes. However, this is not the sole explanation for the association between serum albumin level and disease progression, because hypoalbuminemia is significantly associated with GFR decline after adjustment for the effects of proteinuria. Since many patients with…

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^113og6it]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods - Study design**: We hypothesized that fluid bolus-induced deaths in FEAST would be associated with detectable changes in cardiovascular, neurological, or respiratory function, oxygen carrying capacity, or blood biochemistry. Several scoring systems exist to predict severity and outcome in pediatric intensive care; however, these existing scores do not enable evaluation of changes in individual organ systems because they combine markers of dysfunction of multiple organ systems. Furthermore, these scores use blood or intensive care variables that are not routinely available in the low-resource settings where FEAST was done.

There are no reliable and established methods to quantify the severity of cardiovascular dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, or raised intracranial pressure outside of an intensive care setting. To analyze the effects of fluid bolus on the physiological status of each organ system, we developed composite scores to describe respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological function. We assessed their validity by comparison and analysis of their relationships in all available data from FEAST and four other cohorts of ill children, and then used the composite scores to identify differences in respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular function between the bolus and no bolus groups of FEAST. We also compared changes in acid-base balance and hemoglobin concentration in bolus and no bolus groups of FEAST. The overall structure of the study and the pre-planned and post-hoc analyses are shown in Figure 1.

### Urine albumin/creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g is a predictor of incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [^116thpkP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016).

Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) below 30 mg/g is considered a significant predictor of new-onset hypertension and cardiovascular mortality. The study explores the implications of low ACR levels in relation to these health outcomes. It suggests that routine screening for urine ACR can be an essential tool in identifying individuals at risk for developing hypertension and cardiovascular complications.

### Elevation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 is predisposed by family history of hypertension and contributes to blood pressure elevation [^1119pNaL]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Intracellular lipid chaperones known as fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a group of molecules that coordinate lipid responses in cells. FABPs are abundantly expressed 14–15-kDa proteins that can reversibly bind hydrophobic ligands such as saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids with high affinity. These proteins have been proposed to facilitate the transport of lipids to specific compartments in the cell, such as the endoplasmic reticulum for signaling, trafficking, and membrane synthesis, the mitochondria or peroxisome for oxidation, and cytosolic or other enzymes to regulate their activity, the nucleus for lipid-mediated transcriptional regulation, and lipid droplets for storage. One of the FABPs, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), known as adipocyte FABP (A-FABP) or aP2, is expressed in both adipocytes and macrophages and plays important roles in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and the development of atherosclerosis.

Adipose tissue is now known to secrete a variety of proteins called adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, leptin, and adiponectin, which are implicated in a wide range of biological phenomena. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that FABP4 is secreted from adipocytes and that increased concentration of FABP4 is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and carotid atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the relationship between FABP4 and essential hypertension. Since insulin resistance is involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, we hypothesized that an increase in serum FABP4 induces and/or exacerbates hypertension.

### Albuminuria: An underappreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease [^111Ps4Zb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Albumin is a small, negatively charged protein that represents 10% of total body protein and 50% of total plasma protein. Its physiological role includes maintaining plasma oncotic pressure and transporting various endogenous and exogenous ligands through the bloodstream to target cells. In healthy individuals, the endothelial layer of the glomerulus acts as a barrier that minimizes albumin movement from the blood into the urine. A urine albumin level of less than 30 mg in a 24-hour urine sample is considered normal. Pathologic albuminuria, which is defined as 30 mg or more in a 24-hour urine sample, involves structural damage in the glomerulus and is associated with an increased risk for undesirable cardiovascular and kidney outcomes.

Cardiovascular and kidney diseases share many risk factors and pathological processes that can lead to albuminuria. Albuminuria is often detected in conditions like hypertension and diabetes, both of which are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although it is primarily mentioned in the context of diabetic kidney disease, albuminuria has a strong, independent association with hypertension. Among 9198 patients in a primary care setting, microalbuminuria (based on test strips that detect urine albumin concentrations of 20 mg/L or more) was found in 43% of patients with hypertension only, 51% of patients with diabetes only, and was most prevalent in patients with both conditions (58%).

### Accelerated or out of control: The final months on dialysis [^112dJcTe]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality rates in dialysis patients can be as high as 20% per year. Recent epidemiologic evidence indicates common patterns in biological and clinical indicators before death. Blood pressure, serum albumin levels, C-reactive protein, body weight, and other indicators exhibit changes at a population level, with an accelerated rate occurring months before death. The escalation of inflammation, evidenced by a surge in C-reactive protein, appears to be a central event. The etiology of blood pressure decline before death remains unclear. Although progressive heart failure is well documented in dialysis patients and a potential cause for decline, adaptive functional changes must be considered. In the general population, an inverse relationship between body weight and blood pressure is well described, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that blood pressure decline before death is an adaptive response to a decline in body weight.

Comparable trajectories of biological indicators before death are documented in non-renal illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and certain malignancies. Descriptive analysis of clinical and laboratory variables clearly indicates an accelerated time course in most instances, hinting at a loss of regulatory functions in numerous physiological subsystems. Two reasons can be considered for this: (a) important control loops may be damaged by the long-term effects of the disease, impairing the system's ability to react appropriately to perturbations; and (b) although the regulatory functions may remain intact, they are challenged by factors not specified in the text.

### Role of salt sensitivity, blood pressure, and hyperinsulinemia in determining high upper normal levels of urinary albumin excretion in a healthy adult population [^113LwzXq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of blood pressure (BP), salt sensitivity (SS), and the cardiovascular metabolic syndrome in determining the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in glucose-tolerant, normoalbuminuric (< 20 mg/day) healthy adults.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated 177 healthy subjects (age, 38.3 ± 0.9 years; weight, 75.2 ± 1.1 kg; body mass index, 28.8 ± 0.4 kg/m²; systolic BP, 117 ± 1 mm Hg; diastolic BP, 77.5 ± 0.8 mm Hg; UAE, 8.2 ± 0.3 mg/24 h). Subjects with UAE levels of 15 to 20 mg/day had higher systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressures than those with UAE levels less than 15 mg/day (P < .0001). Hypertension (HT) and SS were more prevalent in the high normal UAE group (15 to 20 mg/day) compared to groups with lower UAE (47% vs. 8% for HT and 67% vs. 24% for SS). In normotensives (n = 156), no differences in BP were observed among the different UAE strata; however, the prevalence of SS was greater in the high (57%) compared to the low normal (17% to 21%) UAE groups. Similar levels of UAE, BP, and similar prevalence of SS were found in men with and without abdominal obesity, despite obesity being associated with hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia.

- **Conclusions**: In healthy normoalbuminuric adults, high normal UAE is associated with SS in normotensives, and with SS and higher BP in a mixed population (88% normotensive and 12% hypertensive). Abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia were not related to UAE. Therefore, UAE levels of 15 to 20 mg/day should be accepted as microalbuminuri.

### Is longitudinal pulse pressure a better predictor of 24-hour urinary albumin excretion than other indices of blood pressure [^115PftmY]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The strong relationship between urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and pulse pressure (PP) in cross-sectional studies suggests that pressure pulsatility may contribute to renal microvascular injury. The longitudinal relationships between UAE and the various indices of blood pressure (BP) are not well studied. We compared the associations of UAE with the longitudinal exposure to PP and systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs.

UAE was measured from 24-hour urine collections in 450 community-dwelling subjects (age: 57 ± 15 years, 53% women, all with UAE < 200 µg/min). For each subject, longitudinal indices of BP were estimated by dividing the area under the curve of serial measurements of BP (median: 5) during 1 to 22 years preceding UAE measurement by the number of follow-up years. The median (interquartile range) UAE was 4.7 µg/min (3.3 to 7.8 µg/min) in women and 5.2 µg/min (3.7 to 9.8 µg/min) in men.

- **Analysis in women**: UAE was not related to longitudinal indices of BP.
- **Analysis in men**: In multivariable-adjusted models that included either longitudinal systolic and diastolic BPs or longitudinal PP and mean BP, UAE was independently associated with systolic (standardized regression coefficient [beta] = 0.227; P = 0.03) but not with diastolic (beta = -0.049; P = 0.59) BP and with PP (beta = 0.216; P = 0.01) but not with mean BP (beta = 0.032; P = 0.72). Comparisons between these two models and stepwise regression analyses indicated that, of the four longitudinal indices of BP, PP was the strongest predictor of UAE in men. The pulsatile component of BP confers the highest risk for BP-induced renal microvascular complications.

### Renal handling of albumin: A critical review of basic concepts and perspective [^114WgVFF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Biochemical and physiological processes that underlie the mechanism of albuminuria are completely reassessed in this article in view of recent discoveries that filtered proteins undergo rapid degradation during renal passage, and the resulting excreted peptide fragments are not detected by conventional urine protein assays. This means that filtered protein and/or albumin levels in urine have been seriously underestimated.

The concept that albuminuria is a result of changes in glomerular permeability is questioned in light of these findings and also in terms of a critical examination of charge selectivity, shunts, or large-pore formation and hemodynamic effects. The glomerulus appears to function merely in terms of size selectivity alone, and for albumin, this does not change significantly in disease states. Intensive albumin processing by a living kidney occurs through cellular processes distal to the glomerular basement membrane. Failure of this cellular processing primarily leads to albuminuria.

This review brings together recent data about urinary albumin clearance and knowledge of receptors known to process albumin in both health and disease states. We conclude with a discussion of topical and controversial issues associated with the proposed new understanding of renal handling of albumin.

### Human albumin infusion for treating oedema in people with nephrotic syndrome [^113B8aVV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Oedema is a common clinical symptom in people with nephrotic syndrome, and human albumin has been widely used in its treatment by increasing vascular volume and thereby inducing diuresis. It may be used with or without diuretics such as furosemide. However, the quantitative contribution of human albumin in treating oedema is not fully understood. If human albumin were found to be effective and safe, it could help clinicians develop therapeutic strategies to improve the management of diuretic resistance associated with nephrotic syndrome.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of human albumin infusion for treating oedema associated with nephrotic syndrome.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 June 2019 through contact with the Information Specialists, using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effect of human albumin infusion compared with placebo or no intervention, human albumin with diuretics compared with diuretic alone, human albumin compared with diuretics and other treatments, clinical outcomes, death, quality of life, kidney function, and adverse effects in people with nephrotic syndrome. We excluded cross-over studies.

### Modification of the relationship between blood pressure and renal albumin permeability by impaired excretory function and diabetes [^113r3bdE]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

In animal models, reduced nephron mass impairs renal arteriolar autoregulation, increasing the vulnerability of the remaining nephrons to elevated systemic blood pressure (BP). A feature of the resulting glomerular capillary hypertension is an increase in glomerular permeability. We sought evidence of a similar remnant nephron effect in human chronic kidney disease. In participants from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999 to 2010 (N = 23,710), we examined the effect of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the relationship between brachial artery BP and albumin permeability. Renal albumin permeability increased exponentially with systolic BP > 110 mm Hg, and this association was modified by independent interactions with both excretory impairment and diabetes mellitus.

Each 10 mm Hg increase in systolic BP was accompanied by an increase in fractional albumin excretion of 1.10-, 1.11-, 1.17-, 1.22-, and 1.38-fold for participants with eGFR ≥ 90, 90 > eGFR ≥ 60, 60 > eGFR ≥ 45, 45 > eGFR ≥ 30, and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, adjusted for age, sex, race, antihypertensive use, eGFR category, diabetes mellitus, smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, and C-reactive protein. A 10 mm Hg systolic BP increment was associated with increases in fractional albumin excretion of 1.10- and 1.21-fold in nondiabetic and diabetic participants, respectively. Using urine albumin creatinine ratio as an alternative measure of albumin leak in eGFR-adjusted analyses gave the same conclusions.

Our findings are consistent with the premise that alterations in renal hemodynamics associated with decreased nephron mass and concomitant diabetes mellitus influence the permeability characteristics of the glomerular filtration barrier.

### Obesity modulates the association between systolic blood pressure and albuminuria [^116czKVj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with albuminuria and the onset of kidney disease. The increased vulnerability of the glomerular microcirculation to elevated systemic blood pressure is postulated to contribute to adverse effects of obesity on the kidney. We hypothesized that obesity modulates the association between systolic blood pressure (sBP) and albuminuria.

- **Methods**: The relationship between obesity and albuminuria, measured by fractional albumin excretion (FEalb) or albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), was modeled using linear/logistic regression in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohorts from 1999–2010 (N = 23,710). Associations between sBP and albuminuria were examined across different strata of waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) using interaction terms.

- **Results**: Obesity was associated with albuminuria through an interaction with sBP. Among participants in the 4th/5th quintiles of waist circumference, each 10 mmHg increase in sBP was accompanied by approximately double the increment in FEalb observed among those in quintile 2 (14% versus 7%, P < 0.01). Furthermore, albuminuria was present with sBP > 110 mmHg in quintile 5 of waist circumference, whereas in quintile 2, FEalb did not increase until sBP exceeded 130 mmHg. Findings were consistent when defining obesity by BMI or waist circumference and when quantifying albuminuria by ACR or FEalb. Assessing albuminuria as the odds ratio of ACR > 30 mg/g also yielded similar results.

- **Conclusion**: The interaction between sBP and obesity supports the hypothesis that obesity modulates the relationship between blood pressure and albuminuria.

### Renal albumin absorption in physiology and pathology [^114LRCTv]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, serving multiple functions: as a carrier of metabolites, hormones, vitamins, and drugs; as an acid/base buffer; as an antioxidant; and by supporting the oncotic pressure and volume of the blood. The presence of albumin in urine is considered to result from the balance between glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Albuminuria has been accepted as an independent risk factor and a marker for both renal and cardiovascular diseases. In the past decade, evidence has suggested that albumin itself may cause the progression of renal disease. Thus, reducing proteinuria and, particularly, albuminuria has become a target to prevent the deterioration of renal function.

Studies have shown that albumin and its ligands induce the expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. It has been hypothesized that increased filtration of albumin causes excessive tubular reabsorption, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis, ultimately leading to the loss of renal function. Additionally, it is known that tubular dysfunction may itself cause albuminuria due to decreased reabsorption of filtered albumin. Recently, it has been suggested that significant amounts of albumin fragments are excreted in the urine as a result of tubular degradation. Thus, although both tubular and glomerular dysfunction influence renal handling of albumin, it appears that tubular reabsorption plays a central role in mediating the effects of albumin on renal function. The present paper will review the mechanisms for tubular albumin uptake.

### Moderately increased albuminuria unmasked hypertension [^1147fL1Y]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 30 mg/day (20 µg/min); persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/day (20–200 µg/min) is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called microalbuminuria). In addition to being associated with diabetic nephropathy, moderately increased albuminuria has also been linked to cardiovascular disease in patients with as well as without diabetes. We present a case report of a man with moderately increased albuminuria who developed hypertension, which was only detected by an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring procedure.

### High normal levels of albuminuria and risk of hypertension in Indo-Asian population [^111AyME5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Urine albumin excretion in the high normal range — measured as urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) 10–29 mg/g — predicts hypertension in European-origin populations. However, the prognostic significance of UACR in the high normal range for incident hypertension is unclear in Indo-Asians. This study aimed to examine the relationship between normal to high normal levels of UACR and incident hypertension.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nested cohort study within a cluster randomized controlled trial in Pakistan on 1272 normotensive non-diabetic adults aged ≥ 40 years with UACR < 30 mg/g. Incident hypertension was defined as new onset of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg, or initiation of antihypertensive therapy.

- **Results**: A total of 920 (72.3%) participants completed the 2-year follow-up. During this period, 105 (11.4%) developed incident hypertension. In the multivariable model, the odds [95% confidence interval (CI)] for incident hypertension were 2.45 (1.21–4.98) for those in the fourth (top) quartile (≥ 6.1 mg/g) and 2.12 (1.04–4.35) in the third quartile (3.8–6.1 mg/g) compared to those in the lowest quartile (< 2.8 mg/g). Additionally, a significant interaction between UACR and baseline SBP was observed, suggesting that the odds (95% CI) of incident hypertension with UACR were greater at lower baseline SBP (interaction P = 0.044).

- **Conclusions**: High normal levels of albuminuria, as measured by UACR, predict hypertension in non-diabetic Indo-Asians, and this relationship may be enhanced in individuals with low baseline SBP. Further research is necessary to understand this relationship fully.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: Expert review [^111NKKKY]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It consists of compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages; median survival is more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. With each stage, there is progressive worsening of portal hypertension and the vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, resulting in a progressive decrease in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion. Vasoconstrictors reduce portal pressure via splanchnic vasoconstriction and are used in the management of variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin increases effective arterial blood volume and is used in the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is employed in the reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis.

Because a potent vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and recent trials have explored the use of IV albumin in other settings, a best practice update was considered relevant regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in the following three specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on these issues.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^112wGYWq]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is the recommended management of shock, but increased mortality was observed in febrile African children in the FEAST trial. We hypothesized that fluid bolus-induced deaths in FEAST would be associated with detectable changes in cardiovascular, neurological, or respiratory function, oxygen-carrying capacity, and blood biochemistry.

We developed composite scores for respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological function using vital sign data from the FEAST trial. These scores were used to compare participants from FEAST with those from four other cohorts and to identify differences between the bolus (n = 2097) and no bolus (n = 1044) groups of FEAST. We calculated the odds of adverse outcome for each ten-unit increase in baseline score using logistic regression for each cohort. Within FEAST participants, haemoglobin and plasma biochemistry were compared between bolus and non-bolus patients. We assessed the effects of these factors, along with the vital sign scores, on the contribution of bolus to mortality using Cox proportional hazard models, and used Bayesian clustering to identify subgroups that differed in response to bolus. The FEAST trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69856593.

Increasing respiratory (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.07–1.11), neurological (1.26, 1.21–1.31), and cardiovascular scores (1.09, 1.05–1.14) were associated with death in FEAST (all p < 0.0001), and with adverse outcomes for specific scores in the four other cohorts. In FEAST, fluid bolus increased respiratory and neurological scores and decreased cardiovascular function.

### Genetic bases of urinary albumin excretion and related traits in hypertension [^114HWXTC]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and animal studies have recognized the potential role of genetic factors in the development of microalbuminuria and related traits, such as renal insufficiency, end-stage renal disease, and nephroangiosclerosis, in hypertension. To unravel genetic variants of susceptibility, candidate gene, linkage, and genome-wide scan analyses have been used. Despite the significant efforts made in the field, there is limited sound knowledge about the major genetic variants causing susceptibility to renal damage in hypertension, as many associations were not replicated or only showed association in specific subgroups of patients.

Initially focusing on genes from the most important physiological pathways of blood pressure regulation, linkage and genome-wide scans have also detected genes involved in lipid metabolism and protein components of the glomerular structures as potential candidate genes. Well-designed large-scale genome-wide analyses and replication studies with significant cohorts can help in the future to clarify the genetic bases of renal damage in hypertension. Combined strategies may contribute toward a better understanding of the genetic basis of urinary albumin excretion and renal damage in hypertension.

### Low-grade albuminuria and the risks of hypertension and blood pressure progression [^113CYbc6]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

It has been postulated that glomerular hyperfiltration and endothelial dysfunction are early features of essential hypertension that may antedate blood pressure elevation. Microalbuminuria, a marker of glomerular hyperfiltration and endothelial dysfunction, has been described in individuals with established hypertension, but its role as a biomarker of preclinical stages of this disease has not been investigated prospectively.

- **Methods and results**: We examined the association between urinary albumin excretion and the risks of hypertension and blood pressure progression in 1,499 nonhypertensive individuals (58% women) without diabetes. During a mean follow-up of 2.9 years, 230 participants (15%) developed hypertension, and 499 (33%) progressed to a higher blood pressure category (defined by the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure). In multivariable logistic regressions that adjusted for known risk factors, the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) was a significant predictor of incident hypertension (adjusted OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, per 1-SD increment in log UACR). Compared with those in the lowest UACR quartile, participants in the highest quartile (men: > 6.66 mg/g; women: > 15.24 mg/g) had an approximately 2-fold risk of developing hypertension (adjusted OR 1.93, P = 0.006) and 1.5-fold risk of blood pressure progression (adjusted OR 1.45, P = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Urinary albumin excretion predicts blood pressure progression in nondiabetic, nonhypertensive individuals incrementally.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112XNjdi]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, and specifically fluid resuscitation, the ABA 2024 guidelines recommend considering administering albumin within the first 24 hours of resuscitation to improve urinary output and reduce the total volume of resuscitation fluids. Administer albumin in rescue situations where resuscitation is deteriorating despite receiving escalating amounts of crystalloids.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114H1vMf]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, specifically in relation to the management of ascites, the BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend considering the administration of intravenous albumin (20% or 25% solution) after paracentesis of less than 5 L. This should be at a dose of 8 g albumin per liter of ascites removed in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure or a high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury (AKI).

### Drug insight: The role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^114xAjJj]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiological function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. A better understanding of albumin's other physiological functions has expanded its application beyond the maintenance of intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction developing after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies.

Use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy; however, its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute on chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, the dose of albumin required, and predictors of response so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### The effects of dietary patterns on urinary albumin excretion: results of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial [^114Kcxrh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Dietary studies aimed at decreasing urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) typically achieve this by reducing protein intake through the substitution of higher protein animal products with lower protein plant foods.

- **Study design**: We evaluated AER while increasing protein intake in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial, a randomized, parallel group, 8-week controlled feeding study.

- **Setting & participants**: The study included 378 individuals without diabetes, with either prehypertension or stage I hypertension.

- **Intervention**: The DASH diet provided 18% of energy from protein and emphasized low-fat dairy products. The fruit/vegetable (FV) and control diets each provided 15% of energy from protein.

- **Outcome**: The primary outcome measured was AER.

- **Measurements**: AER was measured using immunoassay at baseline and after 8 weeks, along with assessing covariates.

- **Results**:
	- Baseline AER had a geometric mean value of 4.0 ± 0.2 (SE) mg/24 h.
	- Among 285 participants with a baseline AER of less than 7 mg/24 h, AER remained unchanged across diets: control diet at 2.5 ± 0.2 mg/24 h, FV diet at 3.0 ± 0.2 mg/24 h, and DASH diet at 2.8 ± 0.2 mg/24 h.
	- In contrast, for 93 participants with a baseline AER of 7 mg/24 h or greater, end-of-feeding AER was significantly lower in the FV diet (6.6 ± 1.0 mg/24 h) compared to the control (11.4 ± 1.8 mg/24 h; P = 0.01) and DASH diets (11.7 ± 1.6 mg/24 h; P = 0.005). There was no significant difference between the DASH and control diets (P = 0.9).

- **Limitations**: The study did not assess long-term changes in AER.

- **Conclusions**: A decrease in AER after 8 weeks was observed only in participants with high-normal baseline AER on the FV diet, following a pattern distinct from the DASH and control diets.

### C-reactive protein modifies the relationship between blood pressure and microalbuminuria [^116t5oGi]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and microalbuminuria reflect intimately related components of the atherosclerotic disease process. Epidemiological studies found only modest associations between CRP and microalbuminuria. Blood pressure, one of the components of the metabolic syndrome in the general population, is the main determinant of microalbuminuria in diabetes and hypertension. We questioned whether CRP modifies the relationship of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors with microalbuminuria in a cross-sectional study in 8,592 inhabitants from Groningen, The Netherlands.

The crude data showed an increase in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with increasing CRP quartiles (4.8%, 9.6%, 14.5%, and 18.6%). Specifically, this increase was more pronounced in subjects with systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg (prevalence: 8.6%, 19.6%, 28.5%, and 39.9%) and in those with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg (prevalence: 6.7%, 13.6%, 20.4%, and 25.1%). Controlling for other risk factors in multivariate analyses, the positive interaction persisted (P = 0.0004). No significant interactions between other risk factors and CRP with respect to the risk of microalbuminuria were encountered. Thus, CRP modifies the relation between blood pressure and microalbuminuria.

### Interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein levels change in chronic dialysis patients prior to death [^1131gNW6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Reports from a United States cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients suggested that weight loss, a decline in pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure, and decreased serum albumin may precede death. However, no comparative studies have been reported in such patients from other countries. Here, we analyzed dynamic changes in these parameters in hemodialysis patients and included 3,593 individuals from 5 Asian countries; 35,146 from 18 European countries; 8,649 from Argentina; and 4,742 from the United States.

In surviving prevalent patients, these variables appeared to have notably different dynamics than in patients who died. While in all populations the interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, and serum albumin levels were stable in surviving patients, these indicators declined starting more than a year ahead in those who died, with the dynamics being similar irrespective of gender and geographic region.

In European patients, C-reactive protein levels were available on a routine basis and indicated that levels of this acute-phase protein were low and stable in surviving patients, but rose sharply before death. Thus, relevant fundamental biological processes start many months before death in the majority of chronic hemodialysis patients. Longitudinal monitoring of these dynamics may help to identify patients at risk and aid the development of an alert system to initiate timely interventions to improve outcomes.

### Albumin transport and processing by the proximal tubule: Physiology and pathophysiology [^113EDP8G]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Significant epidemiological and clinical trial evidence supports the association between increased urinary albumin excretion, cardiovascular events, and renal failure. An increase in albumin excretion has traditionally been considered to reflect a 'glomerular' leak of protein; however, it is now recognized that significant tubular reabsorption of albumin occurs under physiological conditions. These conditions may be modified by genetic determinants, systemic disease, and drug therapies.

The endocytosis of albumin by the proximal tubule is a highly regulated process depending on protein-protein interactions between several membrane proteins and scaffolding and regulatory molecules. The elucidation of these interactions is an ongoing research focus. There is also mounting evidence for a transcytotic pathway for retrieval of albumin from the tubular filtrate. The molecular basis for the role of albuminuria in both interstitial renal disease and cardiovascular pathology continues to be defined. The clinical implications of albuminuria due to a glomerular leak vs. reduced tubular reabsorption of albumin are now under consideration. In particular, the prognostic implication of microalbuminuria induced by the more potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors is under study.

The currently defined mechanisms underpinning the tubular reabsorption of albumin, how these are modified by pathology and pharmacology, and the clinical implications are the subject of this review.

### Identification of circulating proteins associated with blood pressure [^1166Ji22]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Circulating proteins in blood are involved in various physiological processes, but their contributions to blood pressure regulation remain partially understood. In traditional observational studies, identifying circulating proteins causally associated with blood pressure is challenging because of potentially unmeasured confounding and possible reverse causality.

- **Methods**: Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to estimate the causal effects of 2,270 circulating proteins (data sourced from 8 genome-wide association studies) on diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure. Colocalization analyses were then used to investigate whether the circulating proteins and blood pressure traits shared causal genetic variants. To further verify the findings, we subsequently performed Steiger filtering analyses, annotation of protein-altering variants, assessment of overlap between protein quantitative trait loci and expression quantitative trait loci, protein-protein interaction and functional enrichment analyses, and drug target evaluation. To provide more potential biomarkers, we further evaluated the epidemiological associations of 2,923 circulating proteins with blood pressure and hypertension by cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses using individual data in the UK Biobank.

- **Results**: Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses identified 121 circulating proteins with putative causal effects on at least one blood pressure trait. Many of the identified proteins are enriched in the pathways relevant to blood pressure regulation.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: Is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in acutely ill patients and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

- **Summary background data**: Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with a total of 291,433 patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis. Separately, nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients were included to assess correcting hypoalbuminemia.

- **Results**: Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcomes. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, and prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay by 28% and 71%, respectively. Resource utilization increased by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

- **Conclusions**: Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^113JLtDt]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In light of the unresolved questions raised by FEAST, we believed that there was both a need and an obligation to fully use all the available data from the FEAST trial to understand why fluid bolus was associated with increased mortality. We postulated that the increased mortality in bolus recipients resulted from a measurable adverse effect of bolus fluids on cardiovascular function, respiratory function, raised intracranial pressure or neurological function, oxygen carrying capacity, or the biochemical and acid-base status of bolus recipients. To test this hypothesis, we developed composite scores to measure respiratory function, cardiovascular function, and identify raised intracranial pressure using sequential vital sign data from FEAST. We compared the function of each system, as well as plasma biochemistry and acid-base balance, in the bolus and no bolus groups of FEAST.

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: A pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19·1 million participants [^115jTC87]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

The estimated number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, comprising 597 million men and 529 million women. At the global level, this increase was attributable to population growth and aging, offset partly by falling age-specific prevalence.

- **Prevalence trends in high-income regions**: In the high-income western super-region, the absolute number of people with raised blood pressure has decreased steadily since 1975 because the steep decrease in prevalence outweighed the effect of population growth and aging. Nonetheless, 141 million adults in the constituent countries had raised blood pressure in 2015. Similarly, in central and eastern Europe, the number of people with raised blood pressure peaked in 1988 and went below its 1975 levels in 2002, driven by decreasing prevalence. In high-income Asia Pacific, the number of people with raised blood pressure has decreased since 2007 but is still higher than it was in 1975.

- **Trends in low-income and middle-income regions**: In other low-income and middle-income super-regions, the number of people with raised blood pressure is still increasing. In Latin America and the Caribbean, central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, this rise is a net effect of increase due to population growth and aging and decrease due to lower age-specific prevalence. In Oceania, South Asia, East and Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, three-quarters or more of the rise is attributable to population growth and aging, and the remainder is due to an increase in prevalence.

In 2015, 258 million (23%) of the 1.13 billion adults with raised blood pressure lived in these regions.

### Association between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio within normal range and hypertension among adults in the United States: Data from the NHANES 2009–2018 [^116USfFg]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Outcome ascertainment**: The main outcome variable, blood pressure (BP), was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained personnel following standardized protocols. After a 5-minute quiet rest in the seated position, three BP readings were taken consecutively, and the participant's maximum inflation level was determined. If the blood pressure measurement was interrupted or incomplete, a fourth measurement could be taken.

	- All systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were taken at the Mobile Examination Center. In the present study, we calculated the average of the systolic and diastolic BP readings for further analyses. If only one BP reading was available, then it was used as the final record. Hypertension was defined as a mean SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, or a mean DBP ≥ 80 mmHg, or if participants were taking hypertension medication or were informed of a hypertension diagnosis by a physician/health professional.

### Albumin-to-creatinine ratio predicts change in ambulatory blood pressure in normotensive persons: A 7.5-year prospective study [^1152B1sY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The relationship between urinary albumin excretion and blood pressure (BP) has been found to be positive in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. It is not known, in a normotensive and nondiabetic sample, whether elevated urinary albumin levels predict future increases in BP.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, we followed a cohort of 108 individuals who were initially free of hypertension and diabetes for an average of 7.7 years. Urinary albumin excretion was determined at baseline by radioimmunoassay in a 24-hour collection. Ambulatory BP monitoring was used to assess BP at baseline and at 7.5-year follow-up. Regression models were used to evaluate the relationship of baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio to baseline BP and average rate of change in BP before and after controlling for several potential confounding variables.

- **Results**: Baseline albumin-to-creatinine ratio was not associated with baseline ambulatory BP, but was positively associated with change in ambulatory BP. Before and after controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, age, body mass index at baseline, and change in body mass index, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was found to be a significant independent predictor of change in awake and sleep systolic and diastolic BPs (all P < .05). It also independently predicted hypertension status at follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: In healthy normotensive individuals, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio predicts change in ambulatory BPs 7.5 years later. This finding suggests that urinary albumin excretion may be an important marker for processes that influence BP changes over time.

### Serum albumin concentration as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115Es1m3]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum albumin is a strong prognostic indicator for many disease processes, yet limited data exist regarding its prognostic relationship in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This study aims to assess the relationship of hypoalbuminemia with disease severity and mortality in this population.

- **Hypothesis**: Serum albumin concentrations are a predictor of outcomes in PAH.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all patients with World Health Organization group 1 PAH evaluated between March 2001 and August 2008 was performed. Patients were stratified into groups based on serum albumin concentration ≤ 3.3 g/dL (hypoalbuminemia) vs. > 3.3 g/dL. Clinical, hemodynamic, and survival comparisons were made between groups using the Student t-test and χ² test, followed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 163 out of 273 (59.7%) patients had a documented serum albumin concentration. Hypoalbuminemia was present in 41 (25.2%) patients, and serum albumin ≤ 3.3 g/dL represented the lowest quartile of serum albumin. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had higher rates of renal dysfunction (26.8% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.0069) and hepatic dysfunction (29.3% vs. 6.6%, P < 0.001), and lower hemoglobin levels (11.6 vs. 13.4 g/dL, P < 0.001). Hemodynamic and functional capacity assessments were comparable between groups. Independent predictors of mortality included low albumin levels (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.485, P = 0.008), high right atrial systolic area (HR: 1.062, P = 0.003), low Fick-derived cardiac index (HR: 1.465, P = 0.016), and high New York Heart Association functional class.
