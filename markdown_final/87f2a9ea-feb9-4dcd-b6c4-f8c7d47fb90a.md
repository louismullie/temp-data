## Question

Vasovagal

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vasovagal syncope, specifically seeking a detailed overview of its definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, natural history, diagnostic criteria, and the role of tilt-table testing. They also want information on non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management, device therapy, considerations for special populations, risk stratification, and a practical treatment algorithm, while acknowledging controversies and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core pathophysiology. Vasovagal syncope is a reflex-mediated transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoperfusion from hypotension and/or bradycardia, typically triggered by orthostatic stress, pain, fear, or emotional distress, and often preceded by a prodrome of pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, warmth, and lightheadedness, with rapid and complete recovery afterward [^113UDpre] [^116mVcFM]. Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic mechanisms: in younger patients vasodilation predominates, whereas in adults a fall in cardiac output from venous pooling is more central, with systemic vascular resistance remaining above baseline, which helps explain age-related differences in therapy response and the limited utility of pacing when bradycardia is a late phenomenon [^111NU554] [^111BD2fR].

> I need to check the epidemiology and natural history next. Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope across ages, with a lifetime prevalence near 35% and median age of first event around 14 years. By age 60, approximately 42% of women and 32% of men have had at least one episode, and most have their first event before age 40 [^113vd15B] [^114RRBnG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis. Although VVS is generally benign, recurrence is common, with a 1‑year recurrence around 25–35% and a strong relationship to prior frequency, yet spontaneous remission is frequent after specialist evaluation, and many patients improve even without specific therapy, which is crucial when counseling and selecting treatments [^113pfgR9] [^1166ZV8c].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and the role of history versus testing. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, anchored by typical triggers, prodrome, and recovery features; ESC guidance highlights high-probability features such as pain, fear, or prolonged standing with a progressive prodrome, and quantitative history tools can discriminate VVS from other causes with high sensitivity and specificity when structural heart disease is excluded [^116mVcFM] [^113zdwZq]. I should double-check tilt-table testing indications: it is reasonable when the diagnosis remains uncertain after initial evaluation, to differentiate convulsive syncope from epilepsy, or to identify pseudosyncope, but it should not be used to predict response to medical therapy, and protocols commonly use 70° head-up tilt for 30–40 minutes with adjuncts like low-dose isoproterenol or nitrates to improve sensitivity at the cost of specificity [^112QTi3J] [^1167WJ5n] [^115ft4h1].

> Now, I will examine non-pharmacologic management, which is foundational. Education and reassurance about the benign nature of VVS, trigger recognition, and prodrome awareness are first-line and guideline-endorsed, along with liberalizing fluids to about 2–3 liters per day and salt to roughly 6–9 grams daily unless contraindicated by hypertension, heart failure, or kidney disease [^1152XvUp] [^1153K9BP]. Physical counter-pressure maneuvers such as leg crossing with lower-body isometrics, squatting, or arm tensing are effective when patients have a sufficiently long prodrome and are strongly recommended; supervised multimodal physical training combining tilt training with aerobic exercise has shown promising reductions in recurrence and improved adherence to home programs, though orthostatic training alone has mixed and often unsustained results in trials [^11792nHs] [^116fpQSE] [^112TEPTM]. But wait, what if medications contribute to hypotension? Reducing or withdrawing hypotensive drugs when clinically feasible is a reasonable strategy in selected patients [^115ev3nK].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapy, starting with midodrine, because I need to ensure I align with the strongest evidence. Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, has consistent randomized data showing about a 30–40% relative risk reduction in recurrence, with a number needed to treat near 5 in a high-burden cohort; it is reasonable for recurrent VVS without hypertension, heart failure, or urinary retention, though dosing is three times daily and supine hypertension is a concern [^113niPUy] [^113uCbo4] [^117FgEYt]. Hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness: a 2023 network meta-analysis also ranked midodrine as effective for reducing spontaneous syncope, reinforcing its role as first-line pharmacotherapy in appropriate patients [^112Udcii].

> Let me consider fludrocortisone next, and I should be cautious about overinterpreting results. POST 2 did not meet its prespecified primary endpoint but showed a signal for benefit after dose stabilization and in adjusted analyses; guidelines suggest it may be reasonable in younger patients with orthostatic VVS, low-normal blood pressure, and no contraindications, acknowledging the evidence is modest and adverse effects like hypokalemia and hypertension can occur [^116mM314] [^115E9XsL] [^117Fixwt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fludrocortisone had a stronger primary outcome signal, but I should correct that impression and frame it as a conditional option after salt/fluid optimization and midodrine considerations [^116mM314].

> I should review beta-blockers carefully because age matters. In younger patients, beta-blockers are ineffective or potentially harmful, whereas in patients aged about 42 years or older, there may be age-related benefit. POST showed no overall benefit, but subgroup and pooled analyses suggest a possible reduction in recurrence in older adults, so if considered, metoprolol is reasonable in those over 40 with recurrent VVS, ideally avoiding use in younger patients [^116V4H6N] [^1125tn33] [^1123BXRR]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance: beta-blockers are not beneficial in children and may increase recurrence, so they should be avoided in pediatric VVS [^115HDvf2].

> Next, I should review SSRIs and other agents. SSRIs may be considered in recurrent VVS, particularly with coexisting anxiety, based on small trials and pathophysiologic rationale, though evidence quality is limited; fluoxetine showed signal for benefit in a network meta-analysis, but larger confirmatory trials are needed before routine use [^111ZttBT] [^112Udcii]. Atomoxetine reduced positive tilt responses in trials but lacks robust evidence for reducing spontaneous syncope, so it remains investigational for clinical decision-making [^112Udcii].

> I will now examine device therapy, and I need to ensure I do not overstate indications. Pacemakers have a very limited role in typical VVS; although older unblinded studies suggested benefit, blinded trials like SYNPACE showed no superiority of active pacing over inactive pacing, and physiology explains why pacing the right heart cannot correct the early fall in stroke volume and cardiac output during vasovagal reactions; current guidance reserves pacing for highly selected older patients with documented asystolic pauses, often requiring ILR confirmation and ISSUE-3-like criteria, and even then, expectations should be modest [^115uxvpN] [^111BD2fR] [^111Hkj8w] [^112ZjE1f]. Wait, let me verify the bottom line: pacing is not first-, second-, or third-line for most VVS and should be considered only in exceptional cases with clear cardioinhibitory physiology and injury risk [^1113g7Xy].

> Let me consider special populations and risk stratification. In older adults, VVS may present with fewer prodromes and more hypotensive phenotypes, increasing injury risk. Syncope-related injuries are common, with higher risk in women, those with higher BMI, morning events, home events, and absent prodromes, so counseling on injury prevention and environmental modification is essential [^1132UnSL] [^116gJfiP]. In pediatrics, reassurance, education, and midodrine are key, and beta-blockers should be avoided. Pregnancy-related hemodynamic changes predispose to VVS, though most cases are benign, and management emphasizes conservative measures and individualized risk assessment [^115iPLiR] [^1118r7ro] [^115HDvf2] [^11726J54].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies and evidence gaps. Cardioneuroablation targeting ganglionated plexi shows promising observational and early controlled data for cardioinhibitory VVS, but larger randomized trials are needed and placebo effects must be considered in future designs. Compression stockings are being rigorously tested in COMFORTS-II to address venous pooling, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with VVS, though causality and the role of supplementation remain unproven [^111RvM5V] [^115DAgJu] [^113m9dy7]. Hold on, I should verify that these remain investigational for routine care. Yes, they should not change standard algorithms yet [^111RvM5V].

> I will now synthesize a practical treatment algorithm, but let me first confirm the sequence with guidelines. Start with education, trigger avoidance, and salt/fluid liberalization. Teach counter-pressure maneuvers for prodromal symptoms. If recurrences persist, consider midodrine as first-line pharmacotherapy in appropriate patients. If midodrine is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider fludrocortisone in younger patients with low-normal blood pressure. In patients aged 42 years or older with recurrent episodes, a cautious trial of metoprolol may be reasonable. Reserve pacing for highly selected older patients with documented asystolic pauses and significant injury risk after ILR confirmation, and consider SSRIs when anxiety coexists and other measures fail [^1153K9BP] [^11792nHs] [^113uCbo4] [^115E9XsL] [^1125tn33] [^111Hkj8w] [^111ZttBT]. I should double-check that this aligns with both ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC guidance. Yes, it reflects the conservative-first, age-tailored, evidence-cautious approach endorsed by both societies [^1153K9BP] [^116mVcFM].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key controversies and uncertainties are transparent. The evidence base for many VVS therapies is limited by small trials, heterogeneity, and placebo effects, especially in device and tilt-based interventions. Spontaneous remission and the marked improvement seen in control arms complicate interpretation. And the field still needs larger, blinded, patient-centered RCTs to clarify comparative effectiveness and to define subphenotypes that respond to specific therapies [^112ZjE1f] [^1166ZV8c] [^114RRBnG]. Hold on, I should verify that this uncertainty is communicated during shared decision-making. Yes, counseling should explicitly acknowledge these limitations and tailor choices to symptom burden, injury risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113sa8Xi].

Vasovagal syncope is a **reflex-mediated transient loss of consciousness** due to abrupt hypotension and bradycardia, typically triggered by prolonged standing, pain, fear, or emotional stress [^116mVcFM]. It is diagnosed clinically with supportive history and, when needed, tilt-table testing [^112QTi3J]; most cases are managed with education, hydration, salt loading, and physical counter-maneuvers [^1153K9BP], while midodrine or fludrocortisone are options for frequent or severe episodes [^113niPUy] [^116mM314]. Prognosis is **generally benign**, though injuries can occur, and pacing is reserved for refractory, cardioinhibitory cases with documented asystole [^111Hkj8w].

---

## Pathophysiology

Vasovagal syncope results from a **paradoxical autonomic response** to triggers such as prolonged standing, pain, fear, or emotional stress [^112SgaTL]. The reflex involves:

- **Initial sympathetic activation**: Increased heart rate and vascular tone to maintain blood pressure during upright posture [^117HR1JK].

- **Paradoxical switch**: Excessive parasympathetic activation and sympathetic withdrawal cause vasodilation and bradycardia, leading to hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion [^112SgaTL].

- **Recovery**: Reflex normalization restores blood pressure and consciousness [^111NU554].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Triggers | Prolonged standing, pain, fear, emotional stress, warm environments [^113UDpre] |
| Prodrome | Lightheadedness, nausea, diaphoresis, pallor, visual disturbances [^116mVcFM] |
| Syncope | Brief loss of consciousness (< 1–2 minutes), rapid recovery [^113yR2ne] |
| Postictal state | Fatigue, confusion, or weakness lasting minutes to hours [^113yR2ne] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with additional testing when the diagnosis is uncertain:

- **History and physical examination**: Identify triggers, prodrome, and exclude cardiac or neurologic causes [^116mVcFM].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Rule out arrhythmias or structural heart disease [^117Wths9].

- **Tilt-table testing**: Useful when diagnosis is unclear or to differentiate from other causes (e.g. epilepsy, pseudosyncope) [^112QTi3J].

- **Implantable loop recorder (ILR)**: Consider in recurrent, unexplained syncope with low risk of fatal outcomes [^113rUyfq].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **tailored to frequency, severity, and patient preference**:

### Non-pharmacological measures

Non-pharmacological measures are **first-line** and include education on triggers and prognosis, increased salt and fluid intake, and physical counter-pressure maneuvers (leg crossing, lower-body muscle tensing, squatting) [^113X2zhA] [^111Ajwe5] [^11792nHs]. Orthostatic training may be considered for motivated patients, though evidence is limited [^112TEPTM].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

Pharmacological therapy is reserved for **recurrent or severe cases**. Midodrine, an **alpha-agonist**, reduces recurrence and is reasonable in patients without hypertension, heart failure, or urinary retention [^113niPUy] [^113uCbo4]. Fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, may be considered in young patients with low-normal blood pressure and no contraindications [^117Fixwt]. Beta-blockers may be considered in patients older than 40 years, though **evidence is mixed** [^1125tn33] [^114zfCSp]. SSRIs are an option for **recurrent vasovagal syncope**, particularly with anxiety [^111ZttBT].

---

### Advanced interventions

Advanced interventions are reserved for **refractory cases**. Dual-chamber pacing is considered for selected patients with recurrent syncope, prolonged spontaneous pauses, or documented asystole [^111Hkj8w]. Cardioneuroablation is an emerging therapy targeting cardiac ganglia, with early observational data showing promise but requiring further study [^111RvM5V].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Vasovagal syncope is **generally benign**, though injuries can occur, especially with frequent episodes or absent prodrome [^116gJfiP]. Recurrence is common, but many patients experience spontaneous remission or improvement after evaluation and reassurance [^1166ZV8c]. Quality of life is significantly impacted by fear of recurrence, anxiety, and activity restriction [^117KF1s6].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pediatric patients**, in whom education, reassurance, and lifestyle measures are emphasized, with midodrine considered if symptoms persist [^115iPLiR] [^1118r7ro]. In older adults, vasovagal syncope may present atypically and carry a higher risk of injury, warranting careful evaluation and management [^1132UnSL]. During pregnancy, vasovagal syncope is relatively common and usually benign, but evaluation is necessary to exclude other causes [^11726J54].

---

Vasovagal syncope is a **common, benign reflex syncope** with a clear pathophysiology and characteristic presentation. Management centers on education, lifestyle measures, and selective pharmacotherapy, with advanced interventions for refractory cases. Prognosis is favorable, but recurrence and injury risk necessitate individualized care and patient counseling.

### Pacing in vasovagal syncope: a physiological paradox? [^111BD2fR]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

The physiological principles underlying pacemaker treatment in patients with vasovagal syncope have never been reviewed. Current knowledge suggests that pacing the right heart is unlikely to correct blood pressure during a vasovagal reaction. In adults, the reason for this is that stroke volume is dictated by central blood volume contained in the cardiopulmonary vessels within the chest (ie, left ventricular preload). Preceding posture-triggered vasovagal syncope, there is a significant fall in central blood volume and therefore in stroke volume and cardiac output long before the onset of bradycardia. This explains why high rate cardiac pacing does not improve cardiac output or blood pressure during presyncope. Contradictory results between physiological theory and trial evidence underlying pacemaker treatment at present cannot be explained. Placebo effects during pacing for vasovagal syncope should be considered. More work is needed to solve the dilemma.

### Syncope: advances in diagnosis and treatment 2024 [^112YVe8x]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Full comprehension of the recent advances in vasovagal syncope (VVS) pathophysiology requires familiarity with the guidelines on syncope management issued by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS/ACC/AHA) in 2017 and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2018. The advances perceived by the authors to be some of the most important are covered under the following five section headings: Better understanding of the evolution of VVS; Important changes in tilt‐testing methodology and interpretation, value of electrophysiological studies (EPS) in prediction of syncope; Drug therapy of VVS; Invasive treatment of VVS (Figure 1 Central Illustration).

### Vehicle operation in patients with vasovagal syncope… [^117CYcSW]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Physicians in nine countries were asked how they evaluate and treat patients with vasovagal syncope. They were also asked to report whether their patients were involved in a motor vehicle accident before or after treatment was initiated. Most physicians routinely used the upright tilt-table test to confirm vasovagal syncope, with a smaller percentage conducting follow-up testing to assess the effectiveness of treatment. Treatment typically consisted of beta-adrenergic drugs or disopyramide. Additional therapies included patient reassurance, fludrocortisone, sertraline, scopolamine patches and ergot alkaloids. In patients with positive initial results on tilt-table testing and negative results following treatment, physician response to the resumption of driving varied widely, from immediate resumption to one year of abstinence. The average recommended time without driving was approximately 54 days.

When results of follow-up testing indicated that treatment was not effective, the variation was even greater. The presence of premonitory symptoms before syncope influenced most respondents to allow driving at an earlier time. Three quarters of the respondents were more cautious about allowing patients to resume driving commercial vehicles, but there was no consensus on the duration of time without driving. Respondents were unable to identify the number of syncope-related accidents before treatment but indicated that only 0. 1 to
0. 2 percent of patients had been in such an accident after treatment had been initiated. The authors conclude that when treatment of cardiac arrhythmia is effective, based on head-up tilt-table testing, the average time recommended before resumption of driving was two months, with great variation among respondents. If therapy is not effective, decisions about the resumption of driving were made on an individual basis.

The presence of objective criteria, such as "warning" signs and fainting while sitting, influenced physician decision making. In some states, patients who have lost consciousness must be reported, and specific periods of abstinence from driving are mandated. editor's note: Patients with vasovagal, or neurally mediated, fainting experience a combination of vasodepressor and cardioinhibitory responses. Tilt-table testing is useful in determining susceptibility to this type of fainting, with a sensitivity of 60 to 80 percent and a specificity of 80 to 90 percent. Patients with severe syncope who are not treated should probably not be permitted to drive a commercial vehicle. — r. s.

Regarding medical management for syncope, more specifically with respect to management of vasovagal syncope (general principles), ACC/AHA/HRS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider reducing or withdrawing medications causing hypotension when appropriate in selected patients with vasovagal syncope.

### Clinical associations of injuries caused by vasovagal syncope: a cohort study from a tertiary syncope unit [^116gJfiP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Syncope‐related injury is an important outcome in patients with VVS with a considerably high incidence. Prior history of syncope‐related trauma, overweight and obesity, and female sex are patient characteristics indicative of injury risk. Moreover, experiencing VVS in the morning, at home, while standing, or in the absence of prodromal symptoms are associated with higher injury rates, and the absence of prodromes is associated with moderate‐to‐severe injury. Patients and physicians should attempt to minimize the risk of both syncope and injury in these situations and take precautionary measures in high‐risk environments and for high‐risk individuals. Future prospective studies can further elaborate the predictors of VVS‐associated injury.

### Neurohormones in vasovagal syncope: are they important? [^112SgaTL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS), first described by Sir Thomas Lewis in the 1930s, results from a neurocardiogenic reflex‐mediated inhibition of sympathetic activity, increase in parasympathetic activity, bradycardia, and hypotension that lead to peripheral and cerebral hypoperfusion, culminating in transient loss of consciousness and a cascade of associated symptoms. 1, 2 VVS is often caused by orthostatic (upright) stress, or an emotional or painful trigger. 2 While manifestations may be similar irrespective of the trigger, no specific test has proven adequate to reproduce the reflex. VVS is episodic and difficult to predict. Head‐up tilt‐table testing (HUT) often used to evaluate patients is neither sensitive, nor specific in assessing VVS. 3, 4 Despite its limitations, the method can provide valuable research and clinical insights 5, 6

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Torabi et al 7 report results obtained from a careful and systematic study on a subset of a large population of consecutive patients, of whom 72% (827/1141) qualified for study, 56% (466/827) of those were diagnosed with VVS based on clinical assessment and/or HUT‐testing, 37% (173/466) of those had VVS specifically without pharmacological stimulus, and 93% (161/173) of those had no missing data values. Venous blood samples were collected from all 827 patients while they were in the supine position (baseline) and after 3 minutes of HUT. The goal of the study was to determine whether circulating levels of several neurohormones, measured at baseline and early during HUT, are associated with shorter or longer time to VVS. Of those having a positive test for VVS, norepinephrine, C‐terminal‐pro‐arginine vasopressin, C‐terminal‐endothelin‐1, mid‐regional‐fragment of pro‐atrial natriuretic peptide, and pro‐adrenomedullin were measured in relation to time‐from‐tilt onset to VVS. To our knowledge, this is the first study to have analyzed so many neurohormones at 1 time in a large number of patients with suspected VVS, and thus we considered this report with interest.

### Therapeutic options for neurocardiogenic syncope: a meta-analysis of randomised trials with and without blinding [^114RRBnG]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurocardiogenic syncope is common with a lifetime incidence of > 35% with one-third of these individuals suffering significant psychological and physical injury.

Syncope typically results from a vasodepressor response (hypotension), a cardioinhibitory response (bradycardia) or a combination of both mechanisms. Despite the great variety of proposed therapies, including medications, cardiac pacemaker devices and physical training programmes, it is not clear which therapies are effective beyond placebo.

Syncope could be considered an objective endpoint because loss of consciousness can be thought of as binary, and it might be argued that blinding therefore is unnecessary. Furthermore, blinding and placebo control introduce additional cost and complexity in trial. However, it has been repeatedly found within cardiology that even with endpoints thought to be objective, for example, blood pressure, blinding is essential for reliable results. The merits and need for blinded, placebo-controlled trials have not been tested when evaluating syncope management approaches.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of therapies to prevent recurrent syncope. We specifically test whether blinding makes an important difference.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^1163HFxQ]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — methodology and evidence base states that recommendations are, whenever possible, evidence based, supported by an initial extensive evidence review that included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases. Key search words included but were not limited to a wide range of topics such as autonomic neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, and ventricular arrhythmia, with additional relevant studies considered during guideline writing and summarized in finalized evidence tables included in the Online Data Supplement. An independent ERC was commissioned to perform a systematic review of clinical questions, and a report titled "Pacing as a Treatment for Reflex-Mediated (Vasovagal, Situational, or Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity) Syncope" is published in conjunction with the guideline.

### Familial vasovagal syncope associated with migraine [^111ue8eL]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Syncope affects all age groups and is characterized by a brief sudden loss of consciousness followed by fast recovery. Vasovagal syncope, the most common type, is generally assumed to be due to venous pooling and an abnormal sympathetic response. In approximately 20% of cases, more than one family member is affected. Vasovagal syncope has been documented in a high proportion of patients with migraine. Three generations of a family with comorbid vasovagal syncope and migraine are described. Data were collected from the medical files (index patient and eight siblings) and interviews with the patient's mother. Information was available for 21 family members. Eleven of the 14 family members with a diagnosis of migraine (78%) also had vasovagal syncope, and 11 of the 12 family members with vasovagal syncope (92%) also had migraine. Age at first episode of syncope ranged from 2 to 7 years; age at first migraine headache was less than 10 years in most cases. The high incidence rates combined with the lack of gender predominance may point to a possible common pathophysiology of the two disorders and, perhaps, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Further investigations are needed to corroborate a genetic link.

### The pathophysiology of the vasovagal response [^111NU554]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

In part I of this study, we found that the classical studies on vasovagal syncope, conducted in fit young subjects, overstated vasodilatation as the dominant hypotensive mechanism. Since 1980, blood pressure and cardiac output have been measured continuously using noninvasive methods during tilt, mainly in patients with recurrent syncope, including women and the elderly. This has allowed us to analyze in more detail the complex sequence of hemodynamic changes leading up to syncope in the laboratory. All tilt-sensitive patients appear to progress through 4 phases: (1) early stabilization, (2) circulatory instability, (3) terminal hypotension, and (4) recovery. The physiology responsible for each phase is discussed. Although the order of phases is consistent, the time spent in each phase may vary. In teenagers and young adults, progressive hypotension during phases 2 and 3 can be driven by vasodilatation or falling cardiac output. The fall in cardiac output is secondary to a progressive decrease in stroke volume because blood is pooled in the splanchnic veins. In adults a fall in cardiac output is the dominant hypotensive mechanism because systemic vascular resistance always remains above baseline levels.

### Compression stockings for treating vasovagal syncope (COMFORTS-II) trial: rationale and design of a triple-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled trial [^115DAgJu]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Reduced venous return is an important trigger of vasovagal syncope (VVS). Elastic compression stockings (ECS) can modify venous return and be of therapeutic interest; however, evidence for ECS efficacy in VVS is scarce. This randomized controlled trial was designed to address the issue.

Methods

COMFORTS-II is a multicenter, triple-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of ECS in preventing VVS recurrences. Using central online randomization, 268 participants will be allocated to 2 arms (1:1 ratio), wearing intervention ECS (25–30 mm Hg pressure) or sham ECS (≤ 10 mm Hg pressure). All participants will receive standard VVS treatment in the form of education, and lifestyle modification recommendations (drinking 2–3 l/d of fluids and consuming 10 g/d-roughly half a tablespoon-of table salt). Adherence to ECS treatment will be evaluated through diary sheets, and compared between study arms. Follow-up continues for 1 year, and is conducted via a 24/7 phone line available to patients and trimonthly visits. The co-primary outcomes are proportion of participants with any syncopal recurrence and time to first syncopal episode. Secondary outcomes include frequency of VVS spells, time intervals between recurrences, and incidence of any patient-reported adverse effects.

Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, COMFORTS-II is the first clinical trial to assess ECS efficacy among patients with VVS, addressing an important gap in evidence for VVS treatments.

### Vasovagal syncope: hypothesis focusing on its being a clinical feature unique to humans [^116AG6p9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Humans live primarily in the upright position; as a result, there is a constant struggle between gravity and needed supply of blood flow to the brain. In certain circumstances brain blood supply may become temporarily insufficient, resulting in syncope. Among the numerous causes of syncope in humans, vasovagal syncope (VVS) is by far the most common. However, despite intensive research, many aspects of the pathophysiology of VVS remain unknown; among these, one of the least well understood is the basis for why VVS is restricted, among vertebrates, to Homo sapiens. In this manuscript we review proposals that have been offered in an attempt to address the issue of the origin of VVS and, although highly speculative, we suggest a new hypothesis (the "brain theory") to try to address the question of why humans, to the exclusion of other species, remain susceptible to VVS. This theory suggests that VVS evolved to offer protection to the brain's functional integrity under certain conditions of severe threat. Although seemingly a disadvantageous evolutionary adaptation, the faint causes the body to take on a gravitationally neutral position, and thereby provides a better chance of restoring brain blood supply and preserving long-term brain function.

### Pharmacologic prevention of recurrent vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Udcii]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is a transient loss of consciousness that currently imposes a high burden on health care systems with limited evidence of the comparative efficacy of available pharmacologic interventions. This study aims to compare all pharmacologic therapies suggested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through systematic review and network meta-analysis. A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted to identify RCTs evaluating pharmacologic therapies for patients with VVS. The primary outcome was spontaneous VVS recurrence. The secondary outcome was a positive head-up tilt test (HUTT) after receiving intervention, regarded as a lower level of evidence. Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using random-effect network meta-analysis. Pairwise meta-analysis for comparison with placebo was also performed when applicable. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis was conducted to rank the treatments for each outcome. Twenty-eight studies with 1744 patients allocated to different medications or placebo were included. Network meta-analysis of the reduction in the primary outcome showed efficacy for midodrine (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.35–0.85) and fluoxetine (especially in patients with concomitant anxiety) (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16–0.84). In addition, midodrine and atomoxetine were superior to other treatment options, considering positive HUTT (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.23–0.59; and RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.28–0.86, respectively). Overall, midodrine was the only agent shown to reduce spontaneous syncopal events. Fluoxetine also seems to be beneficial but should be studied further in RCTs. Our network meta-analysis did not find evidence of the efficacy of any other medication.

### Fludrocortisone for the prevention of Vasovagal syncope: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116mM314]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence whether being on fludrocortisone prevents vasovagal syncope.

Objectives

The authors sought to determine whether treatment with fludrocortisone reduces the proportion of patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope by at least 40%, representing a pre-specified minimal clinically important relative risk reduction.

Methods

The multicenter POST 2 (Prevention of Syncope Trial 2) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that assessed the effects of fludrocortisone in vasovagal syncope over a 1-year treatment period. All patients had > 2 syncopal spells and a Calgary Syncope Symptom Score > -3. Patients received either fludrocortisone or matching placebo at highest tolerated doses from 0.05 mg to 0.2 mg daily. The main outcome measure was the first recurrence of syncope.

Results

The authors randomized 210 patients (71% female, median age 30 years) with a median 15 syncopal spells over a median of 9 years equally to fludrocortisone or placebo. Of these, 96 patients had ≥ 1 syncope recurrences, and only 14 patients were lost to follow-up before syncope recurrence. There was a marginally nonsignificant reduction in syncope in the fludrocortisone group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46 to 1.03; p = 0.069). In a multivariable model, fludrocortisone significantly reduced the likelihood of syncope (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.94; p = 0.024). When the analysis was restricted to outcomes after 2 weeks of dose stabilization, there was a significant benefit due to fludrocortisone (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.89; p = 0.019).

Conclusions

The study did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating that fludrocortisone reduced the likelihood of vasovagal syncope by the specified risk reduction of 40%. The study demonstrated a significant effect after dose stabilization, and there were significant findings in post hoc multivariable and on-treatment analyses.

Tilt-table testing — suspected vasovagal syncope (VVS) after inconclusive initial evaluation: If the diagnosis is unclear after initial evaluation, tilt-table testing can be useful for patients with suspected VVS, with test interpretation based on an inducible presyncope/syncope associated with hypotension with or without bradycardia and hemodynamic patterns (cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, or mixed), and there is general consensus that a tilt-table angle of 70 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes would provide optimal yield; adjunctive low-dose isoproterenol infusion or sublingual nitrates may improve sensitivity but decrease specificity.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

### Impedance cardiography: a role in vasovagal syncope diagnosis? [^117GbQbt]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Background

vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope in all age groups, with diagnosis usually based on history, examination and basic investigations to exclude alternative causes of syncope. Where doubt exists, the head-up tilt (HUT) test is used for diagnosis but is time consuming and lacks a gold standard to accurately assess sensitivity and specificity. Alternative methods of diagnosing vasovagal syncope would thus be useful.

Objective

to investigate the potential for impedance cardiography (ICG)-derived haemodynamic measures to predict HUT test outcome in unexplained syncope.

Design

prospective controlled study.

Subjects

eighty-six patients with unexplained syncope and 43 non-syncopal controls.

Methods

all subjects underwent continuous heart rate, blood pressure and ICG measurements during 10 min supine rest and during HUT. Vasovagal syncope was diagnosed when patients experienced symptom reproduction with concomitant haemodynamic derangements.

Results

during rest prior to HUT, the syncopal group had higher mean heart rate (P = 0.0008) and lower baroreceptor effectiveness index (P < 0.0001) compared to non-syncopal controls. On comparing patients who presented with unexplained syncope who subsequently had a positive HUT (therefore a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope 55 [64%]; mean age 47 years, range 17–85) to those having a negative tilt test (n = 31; mean age 47 years, range 17–88), there were no significant differences found in cardiovascular or autonomic parameters prior to HUT. A predictive ROC curve model at a 85% threshold allowed using cardiac index (CI), end-diastolic index (EDI) and left ventricular work index (LVWI) would identify those who would have a positive HUT from baseline cardiovascular measurements (CI > 3.5, EDI > 77, LVWI > 4.7) with 93% sensitivity and 17% specificity.

Conclusion

supine haemodynamic measures derived from transthoracic ICG can simply, non-invasively and sensitively differentiate HUT-positive patients from those with negative tilt tests. Further work is needed, particularly in older patients, before this technique can be used in clinical practice.

### Neurohormones in vasovagal syncope: are they important? [^1114XEN8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The quests to discover the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to VVS and identify biomarkers capable of predicting syncope continue. Torabi et al have opened our eyes to the potential complexities and dynamic relationships between several neurohormones and VVS. While the roles of epinephrine and vasopressin as possible triggers of VVS are apparent, the mechanisms by which other neuropeptides such as adrenomedullin and endothelin‐1 influence orthostasis remain unclear. Studies to date, including the one by Torabi et al, have focused on correlating hemodynamics with measurements of neurohormones in blood. Most, if not all, of the neurohormones under consideration (eg, epinephrine, vasopressin, and endothelin) exert multiple actions on multiple target tissues, often binding to receptor subtypes with opposing effects on heart, vasculature, and nervous system. Future studies investigating effects of selective neurohormone receptor antagonists on orthostasis are encouraged.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) management — key continued recommendations are as follows: Midodrine is reasonable in patients with recurrent VVS with no history of hypertension, HF, or urinary retention. The usefulness of orthostatic training is uncertain in patients with frequent VVS. Fludrocortisone might be reasonable for patients with recurrent VVS and inadequate response to salt and fluid intake, unless contraindicated. Beta blockers might be reasonable in patients 42 years of age or older with recurrent VVS. Encouraging increased salt and fluid intake may be reasonable in selected patients with VVS, with suggested amounts including ingestion of 2 to 3 L of fluid per day and a total of 6 to 9 g (100 to 150 mmol) of salt per day, or about 1 to 2 heaping teaspoonfuls, unless contraindicated. In selected patients with VVS, it may be reasonable to reduce or withdraw medications that cause hypotension when appropriate. In patients with recurrent VVS, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor might be considered.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Reflex-mediated syncope pacing — conclusions and limitations state that there are very limited data on the benefits of pacing in reflex-mediated (vasovagal, situational, and carotid sinus hypersensitivity) syncope, and the lower incidence of syncope with pacing in open-label studies versus lack of benefit in blinded studies suggests an expectation effect. Unfortunately, only 2 double-blinded studies met inclusion, and the small number of double-blinded studies (2 trials) yields meta-regression coefficients with CIs so wide that meaningful interaction cannot be excluded. The evidence does not support the routine use of pacing beyond patients with recurrent syncope and asystole documented by implantable loop recorder (e.g., meeting ISSUE-3 entry criteria). Additional rigorously designed randomized, double-blinded trials with sufficient sample size and follow-up are needed, and limitations include challenges from combining vasovagal and carotid sinus hypersensitivity studies and outcome ascertainment bias in the majority of unblinded studies.

### Medical therapy and physical maneuvers in the treatment of the vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117KF1s6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can both present with pre-syncope and syncope resulting from systemic hypotension. While not directly responsible for increased mortality, both of these conditions can have a tremendous deleterious impact on the daily lives of patients. This negative impact can take the form of both physical symptoms and injury, but also a psychological impact from living in fear of the next syncopal episode. Despite these similarities, these are different disorders with fixed damage to the autonomic nerves in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as opposed to a transient reflex hypotension in "neurally mediated" vasovagal syncope. The treatment approaches for both disorders are parallel. The first step is to educate the patient about the pathophysiology and prognosis of their disorder. Next, offending medications should be withdrawn when possible. Non-pharmacological therapies and maneuvers can be used, both in an effort to prevent the symptoms and to prevent syncope at the onset of presyncope. This is all that is required in many patients with vasovagal syncope. If needed, pharmacological options are also available for both vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, many of which are focused on blood volume expansion, increasing cardiac venous return, or pressor agents to increase vascular tone. There is a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data to support the use of these pharmacological agents. We aim to review the literature on these different therapy choices and to give recommendations on tailored approaches to the treatment of these conditions.

### Implementation of supervised physical training to reduce vasovagal syncope recurrence: a randomized controlled trial [^116fpQSE]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physical techniques used for the prevention of vasovagal syncope have limited evidence for efficacy. We aimed to evaluate multimodal supervised physical training as a treatment approach.

Methods

In this 1:1 randomized trial, patients with ≥ 2 episodes of clinically diagnosed vasovagal syncope were included. On top of standard care, the intervention arm performed supervised tilt training and aerobic exercise in six sessions at a cardiac rehabilitation center (three sessions during the first month, and then at 3-month intervals), plus home tilt training. The control arm received standard care with a similar protocol of home tilt training. The primary outcome was time to first syncopal recurrence during 1 year of follow-up.

Results

Fifty participants were randomized (mean age: 34.5 ± 14.8 years; 64% female). The rate of syncopal recurrence was 28% and 64% within the intervention and control arms, respectively, with significantly higher syncope-free survival at 1 year in the intervention arm (Log-rank p = .003). The frequency of recurrent syncopal events was significantly lower with physical training (p = .017). Participants in the intervention arm reported significantly higher adherence to the home tilt training program (80% vs. 52%; p = .037).

Conclusion

Among patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope, a supervised program of tilt training and aerobic exercise reduced syncopal recurrence. Future trials are warranted to further investigate multimodal supervised physical techniques as a therapeutic approach in treating vasovagal syncope.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and vasovagal syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m9dy7]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most prevalent type of syncope and its management includes pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic interventions. Recently, studies have investigated vitamin D levels in VVS patients. In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we aim to review these studies to find possible associations between vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D levels with VVS. International databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were searched with keywords related to "vasovagal syncope" and "vitamin D". Studies were screened and the data were extracted from them. Random‐effect meta‐analysis was conducted to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for vitamin D levels in comparison to VVS patients and controls. Also, VVS occurrence was measured and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for comparison of vitamin D deficient cases and nondeficient individuals. Six studies were included with 954 cases investigated. Meta‐analysis showed that patients with VVS had significantly lower vitamin D serum levels in comparison to non‐VVS cases (SMD −1.05, 95% CI −1.54 to −0.57, p ‐value < .01). Moreover, VVS occurrence was higher in vitamin D‐deficient individuals (OR 5.43, 95% CI 2.40 to 12.27, p ‐value < .01). Our findings which show lower vitamin D levels in VVS patients can have clinical implications in order for clinicians to pay attention to this when approaching VVS. Further randomized controlled trials are certainly warranted to assess the role of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with VVS.

### Needle phobia: a vasovagal response during acupuncture… [^113QiSmW]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

It was my first time receiving acupuncture treatment for a stomachache. When I saw the needles, I felt inexplicable nervousness and fear. The tips of those tiny needles looked so sharp through the light. The luster of cold metal reminded me of weapons from ancient times, such as arrows and swords. I had seen a movie that had a scene where people used acupuncture needles as instruments of torture. It's incredible that I feared those tiny needles, even though I was trying to be brave. I felt sore and heavy on my belly and legs during the treatment. After a few minutes, I had a growing sense of faintness with dizziness, nausea, and a cold sweat. My physician said that fainting is a phenomenon of syncope, and she withdrew all the acupuncture needles immediately. After drinking a cup of warm water and resting, I recovered in a few minutes. Since then, I have not had the courage to do acupuncture therapy again.

I have a fear of needles, and it was terrible to experience syncope while undergoing treatment. — s. z. COMMENTARY The phenomenon of fainting during acupuncture was first mentioned in the ancient Chinese medicine book Huangdi Neijing, which scholars date between the late Warring States period and the Han dynasty. This reaction to acupuncture is familiar in Western contexts as needle phobia. Needle phobia can be a true phobia or a vasovagal response, which can be so severe that the patient begins to fear the debilitating effects of syncope almost more than the needles themselves. Recent systematic reviews have found the following interventions to be effective for needle phobia in children: distraction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavior therapy. In adults, interventions have not been as thoroughly studied, but the following are recommended: breathing techniques, applied muscle tension, and exposure.

Hypnosis has been recommended in managing vasovagal responses to acupuncture, or using alternatives to needles, such as laser technology.

### Prevention of syncope trial (POST): a randomized, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol in the prevention of vasovagal syncope [^116V4H6N]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies that assessed the effects of beta-blockers in preventing vasovagal syncope provided mixed results. Our goal was to determine whether treatment with metoprolol reduces the risk of syncope in patients with vasovagal syncope.

Methods and Results

The multicenter Prevention of Syncope Trial (POST) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, trial designed to assess the effects of metoprolol in vasovagal syncope over a 1-year treatment period. Two prespecified analyses included the relationships of age and initial tilt-test results to any benefit from metoprolol. All patients had > 2 syncopal spells and a positive tilt test. Randomization was stratified according to ages < 42 and ≥ 42 years. Patients received either metoprolol or matching placebo at highest-tolerated doses from 25 to 200 mg daily. The main outcome measure was the first recurrence of syncope. A total of 208 patients (mean age 42 ± 18 years) with a median of 9 syncopal spells over a median of 11 years were randomized, 108 to receive metoprolol and 100 to the placebo group. There were 75 patients with ≥ 1 recurrence of syncope. The likelihood of recurrent syncope was not significantly different between groups. Neither the age of the patient nor the need for isoproterenol to produce a positive tilt test predicted subsequent significant benefit from metoprolol.

Conclusions

Metoprolol was not effective in preventing vasovagal syncope in the study population.

### Age-dependent effect of β-blockers in preventing vasovagal syncope [^1123BXRR]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

β-blockers have little effectiveness in preventing vasovagal syncope in unselected populations, but they might be effective in older patients. We determined whether β-blockers prevent vasovagal syncope in an age-related fashion.

Methods and Results

Two populations were studied. A proportional hazards analysis was performed on an observational cohort study of 153 patients with vasovagal syncope, 52 of whom received β-blockers. A multivariable proportional hazards model stratified by center was performed on 208 participants in the randomized Prevention of Syncope Trial (POST), examining the interaction between age group and treatment with metoprolol. Age-specific hazard ratios were estimated for both studies and combined using the inverse variance meta-analytic method. In the cohort study, the hazard ratio for syncope if treated with β-blockers was 1.54 (95% CI, 0.78–3.05) for patients aged < 42 years and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.12–1.92) for patients aged ≥ 42 years. In POST, the proportional hazards model showed interactions between age and treatment effect (P = 0.026). The hazard ratio for patients aged ≥ 42 years who received metoprolol was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.25–1.10); in patients aged < 42 years, the hazard ratio was 1.62 (95% CI, 0.85–3.10). A pooled analysis of both studies yielded an estimate of the hazard ratio of 1.58 (CI, 1.00–2.31) for patients aged < 42 years, and the hazard ratio was 0.52 (CI, 0.27–1.01) for patients aged ≥ 42 years. The 2 age groups differed significantly in response to β-blockers (P = 0.007).

Conclusions

β-blocker treatment may suppress vasovagal syncope in middle-aged patients aged > 42 years.

### Worsening of symptoms before presentation with vasovagal syncope [^113HQBsc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Much of the natural history of vasovagal syncope is unknown. We determined whether patients presenting for care have had a recently worsened syncope frequency.

Methods and Results

We compared 208 subjects in the referral-based Prevention of Syncope Trial (POST) and 122 subjects who fainted ≥ 1 in a community survey study. Their mean ages and gender proportions were similar. The POST population had a higher median lifetime syncope frequency (1.16 vs 0.12 spells/year, P < 0.0001) and more subjects began fainting at age ≥ 35 years (26% vs 6%, P < 0.0001). In POST, the median frequency of syncopal spells in the preceding year was higher than in all previous years (3 vs 0.57, P < 0.0001). POST subjects presented sooner after their first spell (median 11.0 vs 16.8 years, P = 0.0002), and after their last spell (median 0.3 vs 7.4 years, P < 0.0001). POST subjects ≥ 35 years old had a shorter history than similar community-survey subjects (2.8 vs 14.9 y, P < 0.0001) and presented earlier after their first syncopal spell than POST subjects with a younger onset of syncope (median 2.8 vs 14.7 y, P < 0.0001), despite having fewer faints (median 6 vs 10, P = 0.0002).

Conclusions

Many syncope patients present for care after a recent worsening of their frequency of syncope.

### Incidence of syncope during pregnancy: temporal trends and outcomes [^11726J54]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Syncope is the sudden, transient loss of consciousness that occurs as a result of global cerebral hypoperfusion. 1 It is a relatively common clinical problem, presenting in a bimodal distribution, with the highest incidence occurring between ages 10 to 30 and in patients older than 65 years. 2 The most common cause of syncope in adolescents and young adults, including women of childbearing age, is vasovagal syncope.

Syncope may be a manifestation of a number of clinical conditions occurring on a spectrum of severity from deadly underlying heart conditions such as arrhythmia to benign conditions such as vasovagal episodes. This is reflected in the prognosis of 1‐year mortality estimates ranging from as low as 0% for vasovagal syncope up to 30% in the context of cardiac syncope. 3 Moreover, it has been shown that there is a significant association between syncope and the presence of cardiovascular disease, and the relationship appears to be stronger among young people. 4 The pregnant mother undergoes a number of hemodynamic changes 5 including reduced systemic vascular resistance, increased blood volume and heart rate, and eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. These changes may predispose her to the development of syncope. 6

There are currently limited data on the incidence of syncope in pregnancy. 7 Moreover, the effect of a transient fall in blood pressure on maternal and fetal outcomes is not well described. While most case reports suggest a benign course for both mother and child, there are no long‐term follow‐up data. Given this paucity of evidence, we sought to describe temporal trends in the incidence of syncope during pregnancy using a large, contemporary, population‐based cohort of women in a defined geographic area with a single‐payer healthcare system with universal access. Additionally, neonatal outcomes, including rates of preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age, and congenital anomalies were examined, overall, and according to the timing (first occurrence in first, second, or third trimester), and number (≥ 1) of syncope episodes during pregnancy. The frequency of syncope and other cardiovascular events in the mother in the year following the delivery was also evaluated.

### How and when to pace in vasovagal syncope [^111VDhf4]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

This article discusses the indications for pacing in vasovagal syncope. It also reviews the literature on pacing results; notably, there are two small randomized controlled trials of pacing versus no therapy (or continued nondevice therapy) that show a clear benefit for pacing. The mode of benefit is, as yet, unclear. Pacing has to be dual chamber with some form of rate hysteresis. Ways of improving pacemaker therapy delivery in vasovagal syncope are anticipated.

Vasovagal syncope — general role of pacemaker therapy and patient selection: In general, cardiac pacing has a very limited role in patients with typical vasovagal syncope, and there are currently no positive placebo-controlled studies on pacemakers with patients younger than 40 years with vasovagal syncope; for these patients, cardiac pacing should be the last choice. Pacing should be considered only in highly selected patients, such as those significantly older than 40 years and patients who experience frequent recurrences associated with repeated injury, limited prodromes, and documented asystole. Establishing a relationship between symptoms and severe bradycardia is essential before considering permanent pacing, and prolonged ECG monitoring, usually by an ILR, is usually necessary.

Management of specific conditions in syncope states that although potential causes of syncope are multiple, a treatment decision is usually fairly straightforward for cardiac or orthostatic causes, and that vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common cause in the general population. Treatment remains challenging in patients who have recurrences despite conservative therapy, and studies are needed to differentiate "arrhythmic syncope" versus "nonarrhythmic syncope" versus "aborted SCD" in patients with inheritable arrhythmic conditions. Prospectively designed multicenter or national registries are needed to gather clinical information from patients with reflex syncope, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to continue the identification of effective treatment approaches to patients with recurrent reflex syncope.

### High remission rates in vasovagal syncope: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and randomized studies [^1166ZV8c]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to quantify the degree of improvement in vasovagal syncope after assessment and to identify predictive factors.

Background

No treatments for vasovagal syncope have been proved effective, but patients in all prospective studies appear to show a reduction in the likelihood of fainting.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of studies published from 1993 through 2013. Inclusion criteria were: 1) vasovagal syncope frequency in the preceding 1 to 2 years; and 2) the proportion of subjects with syncope in at least the first follow-up year. Random-effects methods were used.

Results

Of 338 screened studies, 17 were analyzed, with a mean of 112 subjects (range 9 to 511 subjects). In the preceding epoch, 97% of subjects fainted, with 2.6 ± 1.0 syncopal spells per year. In the follow-up year, the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 syncope recurrence was 677 of 1,912 (35.4%), and in the meta-analysis, the proportion of subjects fainting was only 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.46; p < 0.001). Subjects in larger studies were less likely to faint than those in randomized trials (relative risk: 0.35 vs. 0.55; p = 0.004). The probabilities of ≥ 1 syncope recurrence in the observational versus randomized studies were 0.30 (95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 0.37) and 0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 0.62), respectively (p < 0.001). None of the degree of blinding, type of intervention, age, sex, and number of recent faints predicted the probability of syncope recurrence. Heterogeneity was very high in all analyses (I² = 60% to 96%).

Conclusions

The spontaneous remission rate in highly symptomatic syncope patients is high, and remission occurs in all types of studies. Improvement was more likely in larger and observational studies.

Recommendations — lifestyle and medical treatment for vasovagal syncope: Education, reassurance, and promoting salt and fluid intake are indicated for patients with vasovagal syncope, unless contraindicated (Class I, Level E). Reducing or withdrawing medications that can cause hypotension can be beneficial for patients with vasovagal syncope (Class IIa, Level E). Physical counterpressure maneuvers can be useful for patients with vasovagal syncope who have a sufficiently long prodromal period (Class IIa, Level B-R). The use of fludrocortisone seems reasonable for patients with frequent vasovagal syncope who lack contraindications for its use (Class IIb, Level E). Beta-blockers may be considered for patients older than 40 years with frequent vasovagal syncope (Class IIb, Level B-R). The use of midodrine seems reasonable for patients with frequent vasovagal syncope and no hypertension or urinary retention (Class IIb, Level B-R).

### Key challenges in the current management of syncope [^1125sY5T]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly present with syncope at emergency departments and other facilities for urgent care. Syncope is understood by physicians to be a transient, self-terminating period of cerebral hypoperfusion that usually results from systemic hypotension, and clinical guidelines for the care of patients with presumed syncope are available. However, the diagnosis and management of such patients continue to pose important diagnostic, therapeutic, and economic challenges, which are the focus of this Review. First, we discuss how to improve symptom characterization to distinguish syncope from other forms of transient loss of consciousness and syncope mimics. Second, we compare methods of risk stratification in patients with suspected syncope, and recommend the introduction of syncope clinics with enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient care at reduced expense. Third, we highlight the importance of the appropriate selection of diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in these syncope clinics. Finally, we address the difficulties associated with therapy for the most-common form of syncope — vasovagal or reflex syncope.

### Vasovagal syncope in the older patient [^1132UnSL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) has been diagnosed with increasing frequency in older patients since the head-up tilt-table test (HUT) was described over 2 decades ago. The incidence and prevalence of VVS in this age group remains unknown. Older individuals are more likely to display a dysautonomic hemodynamic pattern with a predominantly hypotensive response during HUT. The positivity rates to passive and isoprotenerol-provoked HUT are reduced with age, but positivity rates for glyceryl-trinitrate-induced HUT are comparable with younger subjects. Few studies into treatment strategies have included older subjects. This is a review of the existing literature on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic tools, and treatment strategies for VVS in older patients, highlighting important areas for future research.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — scope, populations, and goals: The guideline states it provides guidance on the management of adult and pediatric patients with suspected syncope, is not a review of mechanisms, and, due to the plausible association of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in selected populations, discusses risk stratification and SCD prevention when appropriate. The document explains that the terms "selected populations" and "selected patients" are used to direct clinicians to exercise judgment, and when recommending referral to specialists the writing committee agreed to make Class IIa recommendations because of the paucity of outcome data. Within this guideline, older adults are defined using age > 75 years unless otherwise specified. The goals include to define syncope as a symptom across populations and circumstances, to provide guidance and recommendations on evaluation and management across settings and causes, and to identify knowledge gaps to foster future research. A systematic review on "Pacing as a Treatment for Reflex-Mediated (Vasovagal, Situational, or Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity) Syncope" was published in conjunction with this guideline.

Possible future directions for treatment of syncope

Cardioneuroablation (CNA) is a novel emerging therapy for the treatment of cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope. This therapeutic concept aims for vagal denervation through the targeting of ganglionated plexi located on the epicardial surface of the heart's atrium. Observational data of 465 cases of radiofrequency CNA have been documented to date with meta-analysis suggesting subsequent high rates of freedom from syncope. The first controlled trial of this therapeutic procedure has since been published, randomising 48 patients to either ablation or optimal non-pharmacological therapy, again suggesting significant improvement in freedom from syncope. While larger randomised trials are needed to support these findings, it is equally important to consider the potential placebo effect of the procedure, and this should be considered in future trial designs.

Other future therapeutic approaches, particularly where vasodepressor components predominate, may focus on reducing peripheral blood pooling, for example, within the splanchnic circulation, and aim to ensure appropriate blood distribution should this mechanism cause a reduction in systemic blood pressure.

Aims

Recently, some studies revealed the efficacy of pacemaker implantation in decreasing recurrences in patients with vasovagal syncope. As these studies were not blinded or placebo-controlled, the benefits observed might have been due to a bias in the assessment of outcomes or to a placebo effect of the pacemaker. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in order to ascertain if pacing therapy reduces the risk of syncope relapse.

Methods and Results

Twenty-nine patients (53 ± 16 years; 19 women) with severe recurrent tilt-induced vasovagal syncope (median 12 syncopes in the lifetime) and 1 syncopal relapse after head-up tilt testing underwent implantation of a pacemaker, and were randomized to pacemaker ON or to pacemaker OFF. During a median of 715 days of follow-up, 8 (50%) patients randomized to pacemaker ON had recurrence of syncope compared to 5 (38%) of patients randomized to pacemaker OFF (p = n.s.); the median time to first syncope was longer in the pacemaker ON than in pacemaker OFF group, although not significantly so (97 [38–144] vs 20 [4–302] days; p = 0.38). There was also no significant difference in the subgroups of patients who had had a mixed response and in those who had had an asystolic response during head-up tilt testing.

Conclusion

Our data were unable to show a superiority of active pacing versus inactive pacing in preventing syncopal recurrence in patients with severe recurrent tilt-induced vasovagal syncope.

### Evidence-based treatment for vasovagal syncope [^111FfqaT]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Only a minority of patients with vasovagal syncope require treatment, and most can be managed conservatively. Patients should be encouraged to liberalize their fluid and salt intake, unless they have contraindications such as hypertension. All patients should be taught physical counterpressure maneuvers. Midodrine is the first-line therapy for patients having frequent presyncope or syncope or for those with brief or no prodromes. The routine use of beta-blockers, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, fludrocortisone, and pacemakers is discouraged. Whether loop recorders can be used to target treatment is under investigation, as is fludrocortisone.

### Effect of metoprolol on quality of life in the prevention of syncope trial [^114fhGdW]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vasovagal syncope is common, often recurrent, and reduces quality of life. No therapies have proven useful to improve quality of life in adequately designed randomized clinical trials. Beta-blockers have mixed evidence for effectiveness in preventing syncope.

Methods

The Prevention of Syncope Trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational, clinical trial that tested the hypothesis that metoprolol improves quality of life in adult patients with vasovagal syncope in a 1-year observation period. Randomization was stratified in strata of patients < 42 and ≥ 42 years old. The quality of life questionnaires Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Euroqol EQ-5D were completed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment by 204, 132, and 121 patients, respectively.

Results

There were 208 patients, mean age 42 ± 18, of whom 134 (64%) were females. All had positive tilt tests. There was no improvement in quality of life during the trial in the entire group or in either treatment arm. Patients in the metoprolol treatment arm did not have improved quality of life compared to the patients in the placebo arm using either the SF-36 or EQ5D after either 6 or 12 months. Finally, there was no improvement in quality of life associated with metoprolol use in patients either < 42 or ≥ 42 years of age.

Conclusion

Metoprolol does not improve quality of life in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and a positive tilt test.

Vasovagal syncope diagnosis — key clinical features and tilt-table testing include that there are 4 categories of key diagnostic features (predisposing situations, prodromal symptoms, physical signs, and recovery time and symptoms), and "Prolonged" can mean as little as 2–3 minutes distinguishing vasovagal syncope from initial orthostatic hypotension. During events, fine and coarse myoclonic movements have been observed in approximately 10% of cases, and unconsciousness usually lasts less than 1–2 minutes with patients often feeling very tired for minutes to hours after the episode. Tilt-table tests feature prolonged passive postural stress and the vasovagal reflex is often triggered by adjunctive agents such as isoproterenol, nitrates, and clomipramine, with a positive response defined as clinically reminiscent presyncope or syncope associated with hypotension and usually bradycardia. When patient populations with strong presumptive evidence are studied, the sensitivity approaches 78%–92%, and the currently recommended protocols have specificities of approximately 90% compared with the response of asymptomatic patients, but the use of high doses of isoproterenol during tilts exceeding 10 minutes at 80° head-up tilt is accompanied by reduced specificity. The tilt test has not been prospectively validated with populations with rigorously defined vasovagal syncope, there is no "ideal" protocol given the inexorable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, and tilt testing, when positive, suggests a tendency or predisposition to vasovagal syncope and does not establish it as the cause of the patient's syncope.

### Evaluation and management of vasovagal syncope… [^117HR1JK]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is characterized by the common faint, resulting from "vagally" mediated cardioinhibition. The resulting brady-cardia reduces cerebral blood flow to a level inadequate to maintain consciousness. Because of the episodic nature of vasovagal syncope and the heterogeneity of the patient population, it is difficult to make specific therapy recommendations. Fenton and associates reviewed the current understanding of vasovagal syncope to provide a diagnostic and therapeutic approach. The vagus nerve transmits afferent signals from the aortic arch baroreceptors, regulating arterial pressure. Increases in arterial flow stimulate efferent vagal outflow, inhibiting sympathetic drive and decreasing blood pressure. Assumption of an upright position with pooling of blood in the lower extremities activates this autonomic cycle and results in increased sympathetic tone to the vasculature and heart, causing vasoconstriction, increased heart rate and maintenance of blood pressure.

The vasovagal response is caused by excessive venous pooling that paradoxically results in vasodilatation and bradycardia rather than the appropriate physiologic responses of vasoconstriction and tachycardia. Other modulating factors that may be present during syncope include serotonin, adenosine and opioids. Nitric oxide has also been implicated in the vaso dilatory response associated with vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope usually has a gradual onset, although sudden loss of consciousness without warning can occur. Precipitating factors may be the sight of blood, a loss of blood, sudden stress or pain, surgical manipulation or trauma. Before the syncopal event, the patient may report weakness, lightheadedness, yawning, nausea, diaphoresis, hyperventilation, blurred vision or impaired hearing. Sitting or lying down may abort the syncopal episode.

The authors conclude that beta blockers are probably the appropriate first-line agent in most cases of vasovagal syncope because of their antagonistic actions to catecholamines. Clinical guidelines for can be based on blood pressure and vital signs. A conservative nondrug approach should be used in patients with infrequent occurrences and recognizable prodromal symptoms. The role of pacing is unclear at present. Counseling about avoidance of volume depletion is important for all patients with vasovagal syncope. — r. s.

Vasovagal syncope — epidemiology and outcomes — emergency department cohorts generally feature older patients with mean ages around 60–65 years, and approximately 35% of patients with syncope remain undiagnosed. Approximately 30%–50% of patients with syncope are diagnosed with an autonomically mediated form, most of which are vasovagal. The overall 1-year recurrence rate is approximately 25%–35%, and this rate can be predicted by the number of syncopes in the year prior to assessment. Most patients stop fainting after assessment and in the absence of specific therapy.

### Rationale for the assessment of metoprolol in the prevention of vasovagal syncope in aging subjects trial (POST5) [^116BXK3X]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is a common problem associated with a poor quality of life, which improves when syncope frequency is reduced. Effective pharmacological therapies for VVS are lacking. Metoprolol is a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist that is ineffective in younger patients, but may benefit older (≥ 40 years) VVS patients. Given the limited therapeutic options, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of metoprolol for the prevention of VVS in older patients is needed.

Structure Of Study

The POST5 is a multicenter, international, randomized, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol in the prevention of VVS in patients ≥ 40 years old. The primary endpoint is the time to first recurrence of syncope. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive metoprolol 25 to 100 mg BID or matching placebo, and followed up for 1 year. Secondary end points include syncope frequency, presyncope, quality of life, and cost analysis. Primary analysis will be intention to treat, with a secondary on-treatment analysis.

Power Calculations

A sample size of 222, split equally between the groups achieves 85% power to detect a hazard rate of 0.3561 when the event rates are 50% and 30% in the placebo and metoprolol arms. Allowing for 10% dropout, we propose to enroll 248 patients.

Implications

This study will be the first adequately powered trial to determine whether metoprolol is effective in preventing VVS in patients ≥ 40 years. If effective, metoprolol may become the first line pharmacological therapy for these patients.

### Distinguishing cardiac syncope from vasovagal syncope in a referral population [^117Wths9]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify characteristics that distinguish cardiac from vasovagal syncope.

Study Design

We compared characteristics of patients ≤ 18 years of age with vasovagal and cardiac syncope. Vasovagal syncope subjects represented all patients presenting to outpatient cardiology during a 1-year period for initial evaluation of syncope diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. Cardiac patients were all patients identified by review of diagnoses known to include syncope as a symptom who presented with syncope to the emergency department or inpatient or outpatient cardiology during a 10-year period identified with cardiac etiology.

Results

There were 89 patients 4–18 years of age with vasovagal syncope and 17 patients 4 months to 17 years of age with cardiac syncope. When we compared patients with cardiac syncope to those with vasovagal syncope, we found that syncope surrounding activity was present in 65% vs 18% (P < .001), family history of cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death was identified in 41% vs 25% (P = 0.2), abnormal findings on the physical examination supporting cardiac diagnosis were present in 29% vs 0% (P < .001), and abnormal findings on electrocardiograms were found in 76% vs 0%, respectively (P < .001). Screening for cardiac disease using any 1 of these 4 characteristics had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 60%. Using this screening rule, we found that 60% of patients with vasovagal syncope would not have been referred to cardiology.

Conclusions

Cardiac and vasovagal syncope have dramatic differences in presentation. A screening rule that uses historic features, physical examination findings, and electrocardiogram will accurately separate patients requiring further evaluation for cardiac etiology from those with vasovagal syncope in whom cardiology referral is unnecessary.

### Diagnostic and societal impact of implementing the syncope guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (SYNERGY study) [^116N8bZW]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Syncope is the type of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) that is due to global cerebral hypoperfusion; it is characterised by a rapid onset, short duration and complete and spontaneous recovery. Syncope is very common, affecting up to 40% of all people at least once in a lifetime. It accounts for ~ 1% of all emergency department (ED) visits and is associated with high healthcare costs. The differential diagnosis is broad, and the causes of syncope range from benign to life-threatening conditions. Recurrent syncope has a significant impact on quality of life. Effective diagnosis and treatment of the underlying may reduce this burden.

There is huge variation in the management of syncope. The diagnosis is often inaccurate, inefficient, delayed or unknown. Although vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of TLOC, it is not claimed by any specialty nor taught in detail. As a result, specialists often restrict their evaluation to tests for those disorders within their own specialty. Neurologists may, for example, focus on tests for epilepsy, while cardiologists concentrate on tests for arrhythmias and structural heart disease.

The 2018 European Society of Cardiology Syncope (ESC) Syncope Guidelines provide guidance for the initial syncope evaluation, risk stratification and follow-up of syncope; the latter includes the availability of a dedicated multidisciplinary syncope unit. Implementation of earlier versions of the ESC Syncope Guidelines in several European countries increased diagnostic yield and accuracy. Such studies are, as yet, lacking the methodology of comparing two sequential groups and also lacking for the latest most recent 2018 ESC Syncope Guidelines. Another understudied aspect of syncope care includes the added value of quick follow-up at the syncope unit.

The SYNERGY pre-post study (short for 'SYNcope algorithms in the EmeRGgencY department with structured follow-up') evaluated the simultaneous implementation of the ESC Syncope Guidelines in the ED together with quick access to a dedicated outpatient syncope unit. We compared diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome before and after this intervention in a multicentre pre-post study involving five Dutch hospitals. We also investigated diagnostic yield, syncope-related healthcare and societal costs.

### Midodrine for the prevention of vasovagal syncope: a randomized clinical trial [^113niPUy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vasovagal syncope is common, responds poorly to treatment, and causes physical trauma and poor quality of life. Midodrine prevents hypotension and syncope during tilt tests in patients with vasovagal syncope.

Objective

To determine whether midodrine can prevent vasovagal syncope in usual clinical conditions.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01456481).

Setting

25 university hospitals in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

Patients

Patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and no serious comorbid conditions.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or midodrine and followed for 12 months.

Measurements

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least 1 syncope episode during follow-up.

Results

The study included 133 patients who had had a median of 6 syncope episodes in the prior year (median age, 32 years; 73% female). Compared with patients receiving placebo, fewer patients receiving midodrine had at least 1 syncope episode (28 of 66 [42%] vs. 41 of 67 [61%]). The relative risk was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; P = 0.035). The absolute risk reduction was 19 percentage points (CI, 2 to 36 percentage points), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 patient from having syncope was 5.3 (CI, 2.8 to 47.6). The time to first syncope was longer with midodrine (hazard ratio, 0.59 [CI, 0.37 to 0.96]; P = 0.035; log-rank P = 0.031). Adverse effects were similar in both groups.

Limitation

Small study size, young and healthy patients, relatively short observation period, and high proportion of patients from 1 center.

Conclusion

Midodrine can reduce the recurrence of syncope in healthy, younger patients with a high syncope burden.

Primary Funding Source

### Vasovagal syncope and related disorders… [^113Wb92B]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The management of patients in whom a primary abnormality in blood pressure regulation results in hypotension and loss of consciousness presents clinical challenges. The hypotension may be primary, or it may be secondary to a condition such as tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia. Vasovagal syncope describes this condition, as well as other conditions that are considered to be dysautonomic responses to upright posture, such as orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Bloomfield and associates reviewed the pathophysiology of these two causes of syncope and developed an algorithm to guide diagnosis and treatment. In patients with vasovagal syncope, the initial cardiovascular response to an upright posture appears to be relatively normal. Syncope occurs after an abrupt decrease in blood pressure, sometimes accompanied by a marked decrease in heart rate after a delayed period of head-up tilt, which triggers blood pooling in the lower extremities.

The mean time to syncope in patients undergoing a tilt-table test is 25 minutes. The dysautonomic response occurs in the presence of a failing autonomic system. Patients with this condition are unable to compensate for the acute decrease in venous return that occurs with upright position, causing orthostatic hypotension. This failure to compensate can occur immediately or be delayed because of blood pooling in the lower extremities. The difference in mechanisms causing vasovagal syncope and the dysautonomic response result in different treatment considerations. For an algorithm detailing diagnosis and treatment of vasovagal syncope and related disorders. The initial approach to treatment involves education about ways to avoid syncopal episodes. Adjusting potentiating medications, including peripherally active alpha antagonists and nitrates, can be useful in preventing recurrences when clinically possible.

An assessment of volume status and an increase in dietary salt may also reduce syncopal episodes. Empiric therapy with beta blockers or fludrocortisone can be initiated without a tilt-table test in patients with vasovagal syncope, and therapy with fludrocortisone or midodrine is indicated in patients with suspected orthostatic intolerance. Assessment of treatment efficacy should emphasize reducing symptoms and assessing side effects. Treatment for 12 months is reasonable, at which time medication is stopped or tapered.

### Drugs and pacemakers for vasovagal, carotid sinus and situational syncope [^115HskE3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neurally mediated reflex syncope is the most common cause of transient loss of consciousness. In patients not responding to non-pharmacological treatment, pharmacological or pacemaker treatment might be considered.

Objectives

To examine the effects of pharmacological therapy and pacemaker implantation in patients with vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus syncope and situational syncope.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2008), PubMed (1950 until February 2008), EMBASE on OVID (1980 until February 2008) and CINAHL on EBSCOhost (1937 until February 2008). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomized controlled trials and randomized cross-over trials of pharmacological treatment (beta-blockers, fludrocortisone, alpha-adrenergic agonists, selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, anticholinergic agents or salt tablets) or dual chamber pacemaker treatment. Studies were included if pharmacological or pacemaker treatment was compared with any form of standardised control treatment (standard treatment), placebo treatment, or (other) pharmacological or pacemaker treatment. We did not include non-randomized studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias. Using a standardised data extraction form, they extracted characteristics and results of the various studies. In a consensus meeting they discussed any disagreements that had occurred during data extraction. If no agreement could be reached, a third reviewer was asked to make a decision. Summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals of treatment effect were calculated using relative risks, rate ratios or weighted means differences depending on the type of outcome reported.

Main Results

We included 46 randomized studies, 40 on vasovagal syncope and six on carotid sinus syncope. No studies on situational syncope matched the criteria for inclusion in our review. Studies in general were small with a median sample size of 42. A wide range of control treatments were used with 22 studies using a placebo arm. Blinding of patients and treating physicians was applied in eight studies. Results varied considerably between studies and between types of outcomes. For vasovagal syncope, the occurrence of syncope upon provocational head-up tilt testing was lower upon treatment with beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and anticholinergic agents compared to standard treatment. For carotid sinus syncope, the occurrence of syncope upon carotid sinus massage was lower on midodrine treatment compared to placebo treatment in one study.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the pharmacological or pacemaker treatments for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope. Larger studies using patient relevant outcomes are needed.

### Syncope diagnostic scores [^115ruRpM]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of syncope poses unique challenges. Syncope has multiple etiologies, with most carrying benign prognoses, and a few less common causes carrying a risk of serious morbidity or death. The history at first glance carries few clues. Faced with this many patients are heavily investigated with tests known to be both useless and expensive. For these reasons considerable emphasis has been placed on developing evidence-based and quantitative histories that might distinguish among the main causes of syncope. Quantitative histories were first developed in populations of several hundred patients with definite diagnoses of various losses of consciousness. Their derivation and use mirror those of experienced clinicians. The first score - the Calgary Syncope Seizures Score - discriminates between epileptic convulsions and syncope with a sensitivity and specificity of about 94%. The second score, the Calgary Syncope Score for normal hearts, discriminates between vasovagal syncope and other causes of syncope with a sensitivity and specificity of about 90%. The third score, the Calgary Syncope Score for Structural Heart Disease, diagnoses ventricular tachycardia with 98% sensitivity and 71% specificity. It also accurately predicts serious arrhythmic outcomes and all cause death. Gaps in the accuracy of the second score have been identified and are being addressed. These scores are proving useful in the clinic, and as entry criteria for observation studies, genetic studies, and randomized clinical trials. A very simple score predicts vasovagal syncope recurrences, based on the number of faints in the preceding year. Work from several centres indicates that scores will distinguish among competing causes of syncope in select populations, such as those with bifascicular heart block, Brugada syndrome, and Long QT syndrome.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® syncope [^117RZSz7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syncope and presyncope lead to well over one million emergency room visits in the United States each year. Elucidating the cause of syncope or presyncope, which are grouped together given similar etiologies and outcomes, can be exceedingly difficult given the diverse etiologies. This becomes more challenging as some causes, such as vasovagal syncope, are relatively innocuous while others, such as cardiac-related syncope, carry a significant increased risk of death. While the mainstay of syncope and presyncope assessment is a detailed history and physical examination, imaging can play a role in certain situations. In patients where a cardiovascular etiology is suspected based on the appropriate history, physical examination, and ECG findings, resting transthoracic echocardiography is usually considered appropriate for the initial imaging. While no imaging studies are considered usually appropriate when there is a low probability of cardiac or neurologic pathology, chest radiography may be appropriate in certain clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Vasovagal syncope — investigation recommendations state that tilt-table testing can be useful for assessing patients with suspected vasovagal syncope who lack a confident diagnosis after the initial assessment; tilt-table testing is a reasonable option for differentiating between convulsive syncope and epilepsy, for establishing a diagnosis of pseudosyncope, and for testing patients with suspected vasovagal syncope but without clear diagnostic features; implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can be useful for assessing older patients with recurrent and troublesome syncope who lack a clear diagnosis and are at low risk of a fatal outcome; and tilt testing is not recommended for predicting the response to specific medical treatments for vasovagal syncope.

### Diagnostic criteria for vasovagal syncope based on a quantitative history [^113zdwZq]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Our goal was to develop historical criteria for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope.

Methods and Results

We administered a 118-item historical questionnaire to 418 patients with syncope and no apparent structural heart disease. The prevalence of each item was compared between patients with positive tilt tests and those with syncope of other, known causes. The contributions of symptoms to diagnoses were estimated with logistic regression, point scores were developed, and the scores were tested using receiver operator characteristic analysis. The accuracy of the decision rule was assessed with bootstrapping. Data sets were complete for all subjects. The causes of syncope were known in 323 patients and included tilt-positive vasovagal syncope (235 patients) and other diagnoses such as complete heart block and supraventricular tachycardias (88 patients). The point score correctly classified 90% of patients, diagnosing vasovagal syncope with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The decision rule suggested that 68% of an additional 95 patients with syncope of unknown cause and a negative tilt test have vasovagal syncope.

Conclusion

A simple point score of historical features distinguishes vasovagal syncope from syncope of other causes with very high sensitivity and specificity.

Vasovagal syncope — fludrocortisone: The POST 2 trial compared fludrocortisone to placebo in patients with recurrent, apparent, vasovagal syncope and showed only a strong trend to treatment benefit; the trial has not undergone peer review and has not been published, and a small pediatric trial showed that children who took placebo had a better long-term outcome than those who took fludrocortisone; in the absence of compelling evidence, it seems reasonable to attempt therapy with fludrocortisone in patients whose symptom severity merits it.

### Review of the evaluation and treatment of vasovagal reactions in outpatient procedures [^113mPqtL]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A vasovagal reaction is a commonly encountered event in outpatient procedures. There is a paucity of discussion on vasovagal reactions (VVRs) in the dermatologic surgery literature. However, recent investigations in the physiology, evaluation, and treatment of VVRs have been reported in other specialties.

Objective

A comprehensive review of the physiology, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of VVRs.

Materials and Methods

A search as performed using the PubMed/MEDLINE databases. Search terms included "vasovagal", "vasovagal reaction", "syncope", "reflex syncope", "neurocardiogenic syncope", and "fainting".

Results

Studies demonstrate greater understanding in the physiology of a vasovagal reaction. Although permanent sequelae are uncommon, it is important to respond in a prompt manner. A variety of treatment and prevention options are presented.

Conclusion

Vasovagal reactions should be carefully evaluated. Additional studies may provide greater data in understanding and managing vasovagal reactions.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^1131VSyQ]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal and situational syncope — non-pharmacologic measures: All patients should be taught physical isometric counterpressure manoeuvres (PCM), which now form the cornerstone of therapy together with education and reassurance. In patients who continue to faint despite adequate lifestyle measures and PCMs, tilt training may be considered, particularly in the younger, very symptomatic, well-motivated patients, despite lack of proven efficacy, because it can act by reassuring the patient without side effects. For situational syncope, treatment strategies are similar to VVS and rely heavily on avoiding or ameliorating the triggering event, with attenuation by maintenance of central volume, protected posture, and slower changes in posture.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) — clinical features and treatment context: VVS is the most common cause of syncope and a frequent reason for ED visits, with underlying pathophysiology resulting from a reflex causing hypotension and bradycardia that is triggered by prolonged standing or exposure to emotional stress, pain, or medical procedures; given the benign nature of VVS and its frequent remissions, medical treatment is usually not required unless conservative measures are unsatisfactory, although in some patients effective treatment is needed as syncopal events may result in injury and an impaired quality of life (QoL).

Conservative and medical treatment — general considerations — reducing the number of medications that cause hypotension can be helpful, provided that it does not worsen conditions such as hypertension and heart failure; several narrative and systematic reviews have evaluated the benefits of lifestyle and medical therapies, and while results have generally been positive in uncontrolled trials and short-term controlled trials, those of long-term, placebo-controlled prospective trials have been less encouraging; furthermore, only the most motivated patients will commit to medical therapy to prevent a handful of yearly syncopal episodes.

### Causes of impaired consciousness while driving… [^112DsgdM]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients who have syncope or presyncope while driving represent a diagnostic problem; electrophysiologic studies may identify a cause. Blitzer and associates retrospectively reviewed the records of 71 persons who had unexplained impaired consciousness while driving and were referred for electrophysiologic testing. All patients had tilt-table testing, electro-physiologic studies, and evaluation of implantable cardiac defibrillators, if present. Results of all other testing on these patients also were collected. Using commonly recognized test end points, a presumptive diagnosis was made in 57 patients. Vaso-vagal syncope was diagnosed in 21 patients who had a suggestive history and a positive tilt-table test. Eighteen patients had an inducible supraventricular tachycardia on electrophysiologic study.

Twelve patients had ventricular tachycardia, either inducible on electrophysiologic study or found on evaluation of their cardiac defibrillators. Advanced atrioventricular block was noted in seven patients. One patient was diagnosed with vestibular disease, and one patient was diagnosed with a seizure. Treatment based on these diagnoses prevented any further episodes of impaired consciousness during the follow-up period. One patient had a recurrence after ablation of supraventricular tachycardia; tilt-table testing showed that the correct diagnosis was vasovagal syncope. This patient was treated successfully with beta blockers. The authors conclude that vasovagal syncope is a common cause of impaired consciousness while driving. Electrophysiologic testing can detect arrhythmias in these patients.

A combination of tilt-table testing and electrophysiologic studies results in a high yield of diagnoses, allowing a greater likelihood of preventing further episodes through proper treatment.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) overview — pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment context are summarized as follows: VVS is the most common cause of syncope and a frequent reason for emergency department (ED) visits; it results from a reflex causing hypotension and bradycardia, is typically associated with a prodrome, and is generally benign with frequent remissions. Medical treatment is usually not required unless conservative measures are unsatisfactory, although effective treatment may be needed because events may cause injury and impaired quality of life; evidence-based therapeutic options are limited, and preliminary data for cardiac ganglia plexi ablation are encouraging but insufficient for recommendations, with an algorithm referenced for treatment of VVS.
