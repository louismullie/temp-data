## Question

1. In the square $A B C D$, construct the inscribed circle $\odot 0$, which is tangent to $A B$ at point $Q$ and to $C D$ at point $P$. Connect $P A$ and $P B$ to form the isosceles $\triangle P A B$. Rotating these three figures (the square, the circle, and the isosceles triangle) around their common axis of symmetry $P Q$ for one full revolution results in a cylinder, a sphere, and a cone. The volume ratio $V_{\text {cylinder }}$: $V_{\text {sphere }}: V_{\text {cone }} = $

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the volume ratio of a cylinder, a sphere, and a cone generated by rotating a square, an inscribed circle, and an isosceles triangle around their common axis of symmetry. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric setup and how the axis of rotation is defined. Then, I should verify the dimensions of the cylinder, sphere, and cone from the 2D configuration. Next, I will compute each volume using standard formulas. Finally, I will simplify the ratio and double-check for any algebraic errors before stating the final answer.

> Let me first confirm the geometric setup. In square ABCD, an inscribed circle is tangent to AB at Q and to CD at P, so PQ is a diameter of the circle and lies along the vertical midline of the square; this PQ line will be the axis of rotation. The isosceles triangle PAB has PA = PB because P is equidistant from A and B, and the rotation of triangle PAB around PQ generates a cone. Wait, let me verify the axis claim: yes, PQ is indeed the axis of symmetry for the square, the circle, and triangle PAB, so rotating around PQ is consistent with the problem statement.

> I need to assign a convenient scale to make the algebra clean. Let the side length of the square be 2r, so the inscribed circle has radius r and its center O is at the square's center; then the distance from AB to CD is 2r, and the points of tangency Q and P are at the midpoints of AB and CD, respectively. Hold on, I should verify that this scaling preserves generality: since we are computing a ratio, the absolute size cancels out, so setting the square side to 2r is fine.

> Now, I will derive the cylinder. Rotating the square around PQ sweeps out a right circular cylinder with radius equal to half the side length, which is r, and height equal to the side length, which is 2r. So the cylinder volume is V_cylinder = πr²h = πr²(2r) = 2πr³. Wait, let me double-check the height: yes, the height along PQ is the full side length of the square, 2r, so this is correct.

> Next, I should confirm the sphere. Rotating the inscribed circle around its diameter PQ generates a sphere of radius r, so the sphere volume is V_sphere = (4/3)πr³. I should confirm that the axis of rotation is indeed a diameter; yes, PQ is a diameter, so this is correct.

> For the cone, I need to be careful. Rotating isosceles triangle PAB around PQ generates a right circular cone. The radius of the cone's base is the horizontal distance from the axis to A or B, which is r (half the square side), and the height is the vertical distance from P to the line AB, which is 2r (the full side of the square). So the cone volume is V_cone = (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)πr²(2r) = (2/3)πr³. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the height might be r, but that would be incorrect; the height is the perpendicular distance from P to AB, which is the full side length 2r, so the cone volume is indeed (2/3)πr³.

> Now I will compute the ratio. The volumes are 2πr³: (4/3)πr³: (2/3)πr³. Dividing through by (2/3)πr³ gives 3: 2: 1. Hold on, I should verify the arithmetic: 2πr³ ÷ (2/3)πr³ = 3, (4/3)πr³ ÷ (2/3)πr³ = 2, and (2/3)πr³ ÷ (2/3)πr³ = 1, so the simplified ratio is 3: 2: 1. I should double-check that I didn't invert any terms; no, the order is cylinder: sphere: cone, which matches the problem statement.

> Final answer: The volume ratio V_cylinder: V_sphere: V_cone is 3: 2: 1.

The volume ratio of the cylinder, sphere, and cone formed by rotating the square, inscribed circle, and isosceles triangle around the axis of symmetry PQ is **3: 2: 1**. This result follows from the standard volume formulas: the cylinder has volume (π r² h = 2π r³), the sphere has volume ([4/3]π r³), and the cone has volume ([1/3]π r² h = [2/3]π r³), where (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle and (h = 2r) is the height of the cylinder and cone.

## Geometric setup and dimensions

Let the square ABCD have side length (2r), so the inscribed circle has radius (r) and is tangent to AB at Q and CD at P. The axis of rotation is the vertical line PQ, which is the common axis of symmetry for the square, circle, and triangle PAB.

- **Cylinder**: Formed by rotating the square around PQ; radius (r), height (2r).
- **Sphere**: Formed by rotating the inscribed circle around PQ; radius (r).
- **Cone**: Formed by rotating triangle PAB around PQ; base radius (r), height (2r).

## Volume calculations

Using standard formulas, the volumes are:

| **Shape** | **Formula** | **Dimensions** | **Volume** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cylinder | π r² h | (r), (h = 2r) | 2π r³ |
| Sphere | [4/3]π r³ | (r) | (\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3) |
| Cone | [1/3]π r² h | (r), (h = 2r) | [2/3]π r³ |

---

## Volume ratio

The ratio of the volumes is:

V_cylinder: V_sphere: V_cone = 2π r³: [4/3]π r³: [2/3]π r³

Divide through by ([2/3]π r³):

3: 2: 1

---

Thus, the volume ratio of the cylinder, sphere, and cone is **3: 2: 1**.

### Sequential metamaterials with alternating poisson's ratios [^015483f3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Three-dimensional version

This work's proposed concept for achieving alternating Poisson's ratios is not limited to 2D extrusions only. If a 2D cell design is copied and rotated 90 o about its central axis as shown in Fig. 7, a 3D unit cell version is generated. The 2D design's extrusion thickness must, however, be equal to the T parameter labeled in Fig. 2 for the resulting 3D design to be geometrically compatible. The 3D version will possess the same large-deformation Poisson's-ratio behavior as its 2D analog, but it will be twice as stiff. Thus, the MATLAB tool provided in this paper enables the design of both 2D and 3D metamaterials that achieve desired alternating Poisson's ratios. For the 3D designs to function the same as their 2D analogs, however, it's necessary that the geometry of some of the 2D hard stops be altered. The circular feature labeled Hard stop (1) in Fig. 1b should, for instance, be changed from a cylinder to a sphere and the three other mating surfaces should be triangular wedges with inverse sphere shapes cut from their ends as shown in Fig. 7. Additionally, the flat features labeled Hard stop (5) in Fig. 1b should be changed to triangular wedges as shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7
Two-dimensional (2D) designs can be transformed into three-dimensional (3D) versions that achieve the same alternating Poisson's ratio.

These 3D versions are generated by rotating a copy of their 2D version 90° about its central axis. Some 2D-version hard stops need to be adapted for the 3D version to function with the same alternating Poisson's ratio.

Results

The GVA

The most time- and resource-intensive step of the classic drop CFU method is the dilution series that must be run to count individual colonies across several orders of magnitude. We reasoned that the geometry of a cone could create a dilution series in a single step as the cross section at the tip is less than the cross section near the base. Analytically, the probability of a colony forming at any point along the cone's axis is proportional to the cross-sectional area at that point (Fig. 1a, cyan circle). This probability is defined as the probability density function (PDF) equal towhere x is the perpendicular distance from the tip along the x axis and h is the total length of the cone (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c; see Supplementary Information for derivation). Equation (1) is applicable for arbitrary cones or pyramids that are axially symmetric (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The total CFU concentration in the cone can be estimated aswhere (x 1, x 2) are the positions of the first and last colony in the counted sub-volume and V is the volume of the cone. Thus, the highest CFU density resolvable is proportional to the dynamic range of the PDF. In contrast to a cylinder or a wedge, the cone achieves the maximum dynamic range in the PDF by changing shape in all 3 dimensions (Fig. 1b). Importantly, this probability does not depend on the radial (y, z) position of a colony within the cone, only on the perpendicular distance from the tip along the cone's axis (x).

C, The magnetic microstructure has been nulled within, and the frequency is calculated at the point. The frequency is induced by an external field. The mesoscopic region is tested as a cube, sphere and cylinder.

3.1.3 Simulation (b). The voxel‐averaged Larmor frequency in a sample with varying microstructure

The purpose of the next simulation was to validate Equation (21) describing the MRI‐measured Larmor frequency when the sample consists of a slowly varying magnetic microstructure, and quantify the error we obtain when (b1) we filter the measured Larmor frequency (as described in Equation 8), (b2) neglect the sampling PSF (as explained in Appendix A.2) and finally (b3) partition the magnetic microstructure in order to compute the macroscopic contribution (cf. Equation 57 in Appendix A.2) to the measured Larmor frequency.

Figure 5 illustrates the sample used to test the error from these three points. We constructed a sample consisting of 27 cubes, denoted, stacked(blue square in Figure 5A). Each cube had side length(see Figure 5) and contained a configuration of cylinders with a randomly chosen axially symmetric orientation dispersion and volume fraction(i.e. different for each cube). Susceptibility variations were introduced by randomly choosing a normalized microscopic susceptibilityfor each cube (in reality, but as we only consider field ratios the absolute magnitude is irrelevant). The sample was further partitioned into smaller cubeswith center points denotedand with side length, i.e. one‐third of the larger cubes(indicated by the orange square in Figure 5A). This construction ensured a sample with a more slowly varying microstructure across, as seen at, since the abrupt edges between the cubesare far away. Thus, every large cubewith a distinct magnetic microstructure contained 27 smaller cubes, and so the entire sample was partitioned into 729 cubesstacked.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

Anisotropic performance of sampling lattice

Now, the aliasing analysis is further extended to a metasurface composed of a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, which is a more general case (Supplementary Note 5). While square lattice and hexagonal lattice are commonly employed in metasurfaces, it is possible to generate an arbitrary sampling lattice using two nonparallel vectors. Akin to a previous 1D case, we can construct a diffraction diagram for identifying diffraction regimes from the array of light cones positioned at each point generated by the linear combination of the reciprocal basis vectors (Fig. 3a, b). For instance, Fig. 3c presents the diffraction diagram for a square lattice at a sampling level of 1.58, where yellow, red, and blue colored spectral regions in the diagram represent AF, WW, and SW diffraction regimes, respectively.

### Defined chromosome structure in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^20d8852c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

3D reconstruction of TEM imaging and cell volume

Mycoplasma cells were scraped into fresh growth medium at 50-fold the concentration of the original culture. The cell suspension was put on a 3 × 3 mm piece of glass and left at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells on the glass were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS containing 75 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) and 68 mM NaCl for 3 min at RT, rinsed with 0.2 mL PBS once and then thoroughly washed in water. The fixed cells were frozen at a liquid nitrogen temperature using CryoPress (Valiant Instruments, St Louis, MO), deep-etched, rotary-shadowed by platinum at an angle of 30°, and backed with carbon in a jet freezing device vacuum (JFDV) freeze-etching machine (JEOL Ltd, Akishima, Japan). Replicas were floated from the glass by slowly immersing the surface into full-strength hydrofluoric acid, cleaned with commercial bleach, rinsed in water, and picked up onto Formvar-coated 400-mesh copper grids as described. Series of replica images were taken by tilting the sample stage over 30° to both sides in 5° intervals, using a transmission electron microscope (JEM1010, JEOL) at 80 kV.

TEM images tilted with angles −30, −25, −20, −15, −10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 were registered by cross-correlation with Matlab and rotated to ensure a vertical rotation axis. The outline of the cell in each image was determined by thresholding using Fiji, followed by manual removal of background contamination and filling of gaps inside the bacteria. From these binarized images the sample area could be extracted by counting pixels within the cell area. The volume of the cell was then calculated by assuming each cell is rotationally symmetric along its long axis (Supplementary Movie 3). The cell was segmented into cylinders and cones along this axis, and the volume was computed as the sum of both the cylinder and cone volumes as follows:

where V cyl is the volume of a cylinder of height h and radius r, and V cone is the volume of a cone of height h and radius r.

To reduce the error caused by inaccuracies in manual image editing and/or a lack of rotational symmetry, the final volume was calculated as the average of the volumes determined for individual images.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^325fb91c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,… Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### Sphere of arbitrarily polarized exceptional points with a single planar metasurface [^1d03c06b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological properties of arbitrary EP

We previously showed that an EP-induced reflection zero enables us to accumulate a topological phase covering the fullrange by encircling the EP within a rationally chosen two-dimensional parameter space. In the following, we demonstrate that relying on the topological phase accumulated while encircling an EP exhibiting arbitrarily polarized eigenstate (linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized cases correspond to the first, second, and third column in Fig. 2, respectively), we can manipulate the phase of light on a single polarization channel for any arbitrary polarization with a single metasurface by varying incidence conditions. To observe the EP complex-square-root dependency of the eigenvalue surfaces, we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in the two-dimensional parameter space of, corresponding to the rotation angles of the two metallic nanorods. These two parameters are expected to control the co- and cross-polarization ratio. By sweeping them in the vicinity of the parameters corresponding to the EP with linearly polarized eigenstates, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the reflection matrix present two intersecting Riemann surfaces, which coalesce at the EP (See Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Furthermore, at the intersecting point, the reflection coefficient ofcomponent is zero (singularity), as shown in Fig. 3a, consistent with the EP nature of this coalescence point. As we previously pointed out, we obtain a phase winding around the EP singularity that realizes a fullphase coverage, of interest for the design of polarization-converting metasurfaces. It should be noted that due to its topological nature, the accumulated phase always coversregardless of the trajectory followed in parameter space, as long as the loop encircles the conversion zero in reflection. EP-induced topological phase can thus be employed for hologram construction by choosing four unit-cell designs sufficiently far away enough from the zero point to have higher efficiency, corresponding to four different rotation angles around the singularity center (indicated by the black triangles in Fig. 3a). EPs with circularly polarized coalesced eigenstates are also realized, as presented in the second column of Fig. 3, where we obtain similar degeneracy of eigenvalues and an equivalent topological phase pattern (Fig. 3b). For completeness, the last column shows an example of EP with elliptically polarized coalesced eigenstates, characterized by. The topological phase still shows the 2winding, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth mentioning that, for a fixed geometry, other arbitrarily polarized topological phases can also be realized under different incident conditions. In contrast, the other anti-diagonal channel of the reflection matrix reveals no topological phase, as illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, corresponding to the EPs showing linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, respectively. Overall, this demonstrates that the topological phase accompanying an EP in a two-dimensional parameter space can be designed to act on any arbitrary polarization state and, thus, allows to modulate the wavefront of any polarization. With the detailed four structures around each EP summarized in Fig. 3g (black triangles in Fig. 3a–f), a 2phase variation can be covered and used for wavefront manipulation. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3h. Building on this design versatility and exploiting the 2phase acquired by beams of adequate polarization when encircling EPs with coalesced eigenstate of the same polarization, we can fabricate a single metasurface simultaneously displaying EPs for three different polarizations (linear, circular, and elliptical). In the following section, we illustrate this by spectrally and spatially monitoring the occurrence of zeros in one anti-diagonal Jones matrix component, while the other components are nonzero. In the last section, we combine the full capabilities of our approach to produce one and the same meta-holograms generated thanks to the 2ET phase for three different polarizations (illustration shown in Fig. 3i).

### Passive appendages generate drift through symmetry breaking [^40d5e9f2]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Numerical simulations of a two-dimensional body

We discretize the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a staggered-grid, finite-volume formulation using a second-order semi-implicit time integration scheme. The no-slip boundary condition is enforced at Lagrangian points by appropriate regularized surface forces. A uniform grid size of h = 1/25 dimensionless length units is sufficient to reproduce previous workon freely falling circular cylinder in terms of trajectory. The dimensionless length is the diameter of the cylinder, D. The equations for the motion of the rigid body are coupled to fluid solver implicitly. This ensures numerical stability at density ratios between solid and fluid as low as ρ s / ρ f = 1.0001. The resulting linear equation system is solved using approximation of block-LU decompositionand direct solver. The freely falling cylinder with the splitter plate is placed in a large computational box with no-slip boundary conditions imposed at the walls. The box dimensions depend on the duration of transient behaviour; typical size used is 40 D in width and 110 D in height. A uniform cartesian grid covers a large region, typical size is 20 D wide and 90 D high. In the region between the uniform mesh and domain boundary, the mesh is expanded smoothly. The no-slip boundary condition at the box wall is always at least 10 D away from the body. The time-dependent simulation is continued until it reaches a terminal motion. The angle of drift is obtained using linear regression of the trajectory in the terminal regime. The obtained angle is compared with corresponding simulation of the cylinder alone, using the same mesh and the same initial conditions. The cylinder alone has a small drift (around 0.3 degrees) due to boundary effects. To increase the accuracy, we subtract the unphysical drift from the results of cylinder with splitter plate for all lengths. The angle of splitter-plate orientation is determined as a mean over terminal regime.

### Mining extreme properties from a large metamaterial database [^aed43ea3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In the superior metamaterials (blue stars in Fig. 3A), struts are concentrated near one main axis, forming multiple stiff triangles. These concentrated struts focus on the enhancement of modulus in a certain loading direction. Although the pronounced voids in corresponding metamaterials created by this concentration might appear counterintuitive in the design paradigm for obtaining extreme modulus, our findings still confirm that the concentrated struts near the main axis are crucial for achieving extreme modulus. This finding challenges the conventional design strategy, which always pursues regular and symmetric architectural topology. It also highlights the importance of a diverse architecture database in mining extreme properties.

Figure 3B illustrates the entire space of the reciprocal Poisson's ratios, ν xy and ν yx, for all metamaterials in the database (the density plot of the data points and scatter plots for eleven groups are provided in Supplementary Fig. 9). The top right subplot in Fig. 3B illustrates a certain range between −2.5 ≤ ν ≤ +2.5. The size of scatters increases in proportion to the maximum magnitude of ν xy and ν yx, namely, max(| ν xy |, | ν yx |). According to the Neumann's principle, the range of Poisson's ratios is strongly related to the symmetry of materials. Isotropic materials exhibit high architectural symmetry with Poisson's ratios bounded between −1.0 ≤ ν ≤ +0.5, as observed in most bulk materials. For orthogonally isotropic materials, medium architectural symmetry extends the range to −1.0 ≤ ν ≤ +1.0, such as classic chiral and star metamaterials (insets c9, c11, and c12 in Fig. 2). Furthermore, anisotropic metamaterials with six independent elastic constants exhibit low architectural symmetry in orthogonal directions and have no bound on the range of their Poisson's ratios. However, as shown in the subplots of Fig. 3B, classic metamaterials are confined to a quite narrower range of −2.0 ≤ ν ≤ +1.0 due to their high-symmetric architectures, despite the classic re-entrant metamaterials (insets c7, c8, and c10 in Fig. 2). The high-symmetric architectures are related to the reflection axis or rotation center, but the low-symmetric architectures possess none of them. Therefore, the preference of inspired manual design for obtaining high-symmetric architectures is exactly an obstacle to mining the extreme Poisson ratio. On the contrary, our database extends the range of Poisson's ratio to −65.034 ≤ ν ≤ +69.602, far beyond ~30 times compared with the reported space. The diverse design results of anisotropic metamaterials in our database are derived from the generation of various building blocks with low architectural symmetry, which provide an important foundation for uncovering extreme Poisson's ratios. Despite this considerable extension in the range of extreme Poisson's ratios, all the metamaterials in the database still conform to the thermodynamic stability condition 0 < ν xy ⋅ ν yx < 1. This condition indicates the positive strain energy density and the positive definiteness of the stiffness matrix to ensure mechanical feasibility. Consistent with this condition, the reciprocal Poisson's ratios exhibit the same sign and are bounded within the area enclosed by the hyperbola, ν yx = 1/ ν xy, as shown in Fig. 3B. Moreover, the bound metamaterials (blue circles in Fig. 3B) within the interval 0.8 < ν xy ⋅ ν yx < 1.0 account for 30% of the entire database, demonstrating the capacity to generate a large number of prospective architectures for mining extreme properties approaching the theory bound.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^72cfa113]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Simulation (a). The size of

Figure 7 shows the ratio of model and ground truth Larmor frequency for different sizes of the mesoscopic region and volume fraction for a bundle of uniformly positioned parallel rectangular rods. For a small mesoscopic cavity, the relative error from replacing the nearby microstructure with a homogeneous medium with the same average susceptibility is high. As the mesoscopic cavity increases, the actual positions of the cylinders become less important, and the ratio can be seen to converge to 1. The SD is clearly lowest for high volume fraction due to a larger number of involved rods. Additionally, it is clear that the coarse‐grained Larmor frequency can be decomposed using any cavity shape for.

FIGURE 7
Simulation (a): The mean error (circles) and standard deviation (colored bands) of the estimated Larmor frequency is shown as a function of the size of the mesoscopic regioncompared with the width of the rods. The error can be seen to converge to below 5% whenis around 10for all three cavity geometries. This underscores that the shape of the mesoscopic region is irrelevant; only size matters.

Figure 8 shows that the mean squared difference(cf. Figure 4A and 4B) and mean center field(cf. Figure 4C) converge towards zero, no matter the cavity shape and dimensionality, with the convergence rate corresponding to the sum, i.e. Here, is the structural disorder exponent andthe dimensionality. In Appendix C we derive this scaling relation.

### Structural dynamics of DNA strand break sensing by PARP-1 at a single-molecule level [^28e2592f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We select conformations whose simulated efficiencies are within an error of ΔE = 0.05 compared to the experimental result. This accounts for both the error in the isotropic Förster Radius (ΔR iso = 2 Å translates to ΔE = 0.04 in the simulations, see also section "Determination of the isotropic Förster radius") and the error of the measurement derived from the uncertainties in the correction factors (ΔE = 0.03, see section "Burst selection and quantification of burst-wise parameters").

Every linear dsDNA molecule has a unique axis. We are interested in the angle between the axes of the 5′- and 3′-stems. As a convention, the direction of their axes is defined from the nick to the respective loop. We define the axis of each DNA stem as the longest axis determined from a principal component analysis, considering all atoms belonging to the respective stem, but omitting the four bases of the tetraloop and the base pair next to the loop. All structures are aligned with respect to the 3′-stem, such that we can represent every selected conformation as a unit vector/orientation (representing the 5′-stem) in a spherical coordinate system. This allows us to compute the angle between the axes of the two stems for every conformation. We obtain histograms of these angles where we re-weight the relative frequency in the equally spaced bins according to the differing surface of the ring on the unit sphere. For the computation of mean angles and standard deviations, we considered two axially symmetric scenarios: the orientations lie in a spherical cone or in an open spherical sector (the symmetric difference of two cones with the same mean axis). In the view along the mean axis, they represent a circle and an annulus, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 21). In the case of a spherical cone, we have a single mean axis which is computed by the normalized sum over all axes. The standard deviation is retrieved from the corrected histogram. If the orientations lie within an open spherical sector, we do not have one unique mean orientation, but it is axially degenerate, i.e. it is on a lateral surface of a cone. However, the mean polar angle between the stems is still uniquely defined, if we assume that the open spherical sector is directed along the 3'-axis. Thus, both the mean angle and the standard deviation are computed by the corrected histogram.

### Classical dynamics: spinning eggs – a paradox resolved [^c48c550a]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

If a hard-boiled egg is spun sufficiently rapidly on a table with its axis of symmetry horizontal, this axis will rise from the horizontal to the vertical. (A raw egg, by contrast, when similarly spun, will not rise.) Conversely, if an oblate spheroid is spun sufficiently rapidly with its axis of symmetry vertical, it will rise and spin about the vertical on its rounded edge with its axis of symmetry now rotating in a horizontal plane. In both cases, the centre of gravity rises; here we provide an explanation for this paradoxical behaviour, through derivation of a first-order differential equation for the inclination of the axis of symmetry.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^5c3a73df]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular mass (LVM) by linear (M‑mode) dimensions — method and key limitations — is described as modeling the left ventricle as a prolate ellipse with a major/minor axis ratio of 2: 1 and converting the myocardial shell volume to mass using the specific gravity of myocardium (1.05 g/ml). There are four principal limitations in the calculation of LVM using linear methods: the "Cube" formula is not accurate when the 2: 1 axis ratio requirement is not met, cubing primary measurements magnifies small errors, these measurements are insensitive to small changes in mass, and they are highly dependent on imaging quality and observer expertise.

### Molecular plasticity of herpesvirus nuclear egress analysed in situ [^f6b5f79a]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

For visualisation of ordered and disordered NEC regions, template matching was repeated on four vesicles, one of which was fully contained within the tomogram. Aligned particles were first cleaned by cross-correlation coefficient, and then manually cleaned to remove those that were outside hexagonally arrayed regions or those that were clearly misaligned (for example, centred on the membrane rather than the NEC layer). To determine the positions of particles missed by manual picking, the lattice formed by the particles was expanded to create new model points, by assuming C6 symmetry and an inter-hexamer distance of 110 nm, then aligned using a cylindrical mask with 22 nm diameter (roughly a single hexamer), and again cleaned manually and by cross-correlation coefficient. This process was repeated until the number of points remained roughly constant (Supplementary Fig. 8).

For HSV-1 NEC vesicles the same procedure was followed as described above using a spherical PrV NEC map as an initial reference binned four times. Four spherically shaped vesicles from four different tomograms were available for particle picking. A total of 1,421 particles were used, resulting in 8,526 particles in the final average after symmetrisation.

Nascent NEC

First, we established that the nascent NEC lattice resembles the spherical NEC lattice in perinuclear vesicles. This way, the spherical lattice map (with a high signal-noise ratio) could be used for template matching of the NEC in nascent budding sites. Model points were picked manually at three sites containing capsids in proximity of NEC patches, and their Y axes (normal to the membrane) were oriented to the nearest capsid centre. An initial reference was generated by averaging manually picked positions with random rotations around the Y axis. The average volume converged into a hexagonal lattice resembling the spherical NEC map. Subsequently, particles (generated using IMOD drawing tools) from 28 budding events in eight tomograms were aligned to an average volume of spherical NEC from perinuclear vesicles with volumes binned four times. Symmetry expansion was used to locate all hexagonal regions as described above (Supplementary Fig. 8). The resolution of the final map was not determined.

### A fully automated method for accurate measurement of geometrical distortion in magnetic resonance imaging of a 3D-lattice phantom [^a8b6cdc6]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

This paper describes an automated method for extracting the apparent positions of fiducial points from 2D or 3D images of a phantom. We consider a 3D-lattice phantom for two main reasons: first, ease of manufacture and isotropy of its structure with respect to coordinate projections; second, a connected structure allowing to uniquely assess the adjacency relationship between fiducial points even if geometric distortions arising from main magnet inhomogeneity and gradient fields non-linearity is severe as observed in open-bore systems. In order to validate our proposed method and compare different choices for the parameters of our phantom (i.e. number and distance between grids and thickness of its branches) we developed in-house a software for simulating 2D or 3D volume images of the phantom, using customizable MRI sequence parameters and Spherical Harmonic Coefficients for the fields. We deem worthy of note that using simulated images is the only way to evaluate the estimated position error, since it allows to compare the estimates to their theoretical counterparts. Furthermore, the use of simulated images allows to evaluate the robustness of the method with respect to image quality in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratios and geometric distortion, and allows to evaluate different phantom geometries without having to manufacture them. The proposed method can be easily extended to phantoms having an arbitrary overall shape, as long as it is a fully connected structure. Specifically, it is easy to design a phantom with fiducial points laying outside of the homogeneity sphere, so that indirect measurement of the fields becomes possible, for example by using the recent method proposed by Acquaviva et al. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, with an average positioning offset of 0.052 mm (with a 0.99 quantile of 0.12 mm) when working on images featuring a differential Signal-to-Noise Ratio within Region-of-Interest (ROI) equal to 105 (20.2 dB) and a ROI-to-background SNR of 20 dB. Estimating the positions of 6859 fiducial points in a volume, our highest density case, was carried out in less than 30 min on a desktop personal computer.

### Arbitrary lattice symmetries via block copolymer nanomeshes [^8ad6128c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of block copolymers is a powerful motif for spontaneously forming well-defined nanostructures over macroscopic areas. Yet, the inherent energy minimization criteria of self-assembly give rise to a limited library of structures; diblock copolymers naturally form spheres on a cubic lattice, hexagonally packed cylinders and alternating lamellae. Here, we demonstrate multicomponent nanomeshes with any desired lattice symmetry. We exploit photothermal annealing to rapidly order and align block copolymer phases over macroscopic areas, combined with conversion of the self-assembled organic phase into inorganic replicas. Repeated photothermal processing independently aligns successive layers, providing full control of the size, symmetry and composition of the nanoscale unit cell. We construct a variety of symmetries, most of which are not natively formed by block copolymers, including squares, rhombuses, rectangles and triangles. In fact, we demonstrate all possible two-dimensional Bravais lattices. Finally, we elucidate the influence of nanostructure on the electrical and optical properties of nanomeshes.

### Spatially selective delivery of living magnetic microrobots through torque-focusing [^5455cff0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The array of permanent magnets responsible for generating a magnetostatic selection field was based on a "magic sphere" geometry, formed by an axisymmetric revolution of a second-order Halbach cylinder(Fig. 4C). The desired distribution of magnetization was approximated with 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm stacks consisting predominantly of ferrite ceramic permanent magnets (grade Y35) affixed to a 3D printed frame that held them at the appropriate angles. To ensure access to the working volume, magnets were omitted from the poles of the magic sphere, and sintered NdFeB magnets (N45) were strategically incorporated around the equator of the array to improve the isotropy of the field-free point. The results of an axisymmetric finite element model show the expected distribution of magnetostatic field magnitude, with a central field-free region that is an oblate spheroid with its shortest axis coinciding with the axis of symmetry.

Strong RMFs are routinely generated at the scale of tens of centimeters for industrial applications such as 3-phase industrial motors, which acted as a source of inspiration for the RMF coil geometry in this setup. Three independent stators were wound around a 3D printed frame and driven with 3-phase current to produce an adequately homogenous RMF, with its plane of rotation perpendicular to the axis of the cylindrical working volume (Fig. 4D). The target field magnitude of 20 mT was achieved in the 5.5 cm diameter, 8.5 cm long working volume, but continuous operation was limited in practice to 15 mT based on heat rejection capabilities.

The two DC offset coils were arranged in the same basic concentric geometry as the RMF coils, residing between the RMF coils and the permanent magnet array (Fig. 4A). These coils were formed manually from 3 mm copper tubing and arranged geometrically using a set of 3D printed guides and flow splitting manifolds (Fig. S9). Electrical current was run in series through these coils, whereas chilled water flowed in parallel to cool the setup to temperatures safe for anesthetized rodents. Thermal contact between the RMF coils and the DC offset coils was made via electrically non-conductive thermal epoxy.

### 2D material programming for 3D shaping [^0d7f1bf4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cone singularities

The Riemann theorem suggests that our method can form any curved shapes of thin sheets by conformally morphing 2D hydrogels. However, in practice, the accessible Ω r limits accessible 3D configurations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduced the concept of cone singularities (Fig. 3). The idea is to first map a 3D shape on a cone surface (K = 0) and then unfold the cone surface to the 2D plane (without further area distortion) by cutting the surface through cone points, rather than directly mapping a shape to the plane (as shown in Fig. 2). This approach can significantly reduce Ω r, as a 3D shape can be conformally mapped to a cone surface with lower area distortion than to the plane and the cone surface can be isometrically flattened to the plane.

### A spheroid weighted-axis converter of vestibular schwannoma size: maximum diameter and cisternal volume [^2fe66e25]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate spheroid models of vestibular schwannoma (VS) size for bidirectional conversion of maximum diameter in the cistern and 3-dimensional volume.

Study Design

Methodological study.

Setting

Academic tertiary referral center.

Subjects and Methods

Magnetic resonance imaging studies from 91 patients with VS from 2003 to 2011 were analyzed. Linear measurements defining meatal and cisternal components were extracted. Geometrically based conformal models of tumor volume were compared with measured tumor volume using a semiautomated computerized tracing method. Models were inverted to predict maximum axial cisternal length at the level of the internal auditory canal (IAC).

Results

A spheroid-weighted axis converter (SWC) of VS size was identified by minimizing input measurement parameters while maximizing output prediction performance. Computation steps of tumor volumes were (1) meatal-measure tumor lengths along the IAC and at the porus acusticus and take the average of a cone and cylinder and (2) cisternal-measure maximum tumor length in the axial IAC plane, use the median major:minor axis ratio of 1.26:1 to estimate minor axis length, take the geometric mean of axial dimensions to estimate axis length in the coronal plane, and apply input lengths to a spheroid. Performance error of this SWC had interquartile ranges of 33% for volume and 2 to 3 mm for maximum cisternal length.

Conclusion

Reporting variability of VS tumor size has made it difficult to reconcile outcomes studies. We propose an accessible tool for bidirectional conversion of volumetric and linear indices of tumor size to unlock potential for meta-analyses of disparate data sets.

Stereological principles in quantitative image analysis — Stereology is the statistical science providing practical methods for extracting accurate and precise quantitative structural information from imaging data sets of irregular objects. Stereological methods make no assumptions regarding shape, size, orientation, or spatial distribution of objects and are unbiased by design instead of relying on geometric model assumptions that may introduce bias. Stereology is the method of choice for quantifying lung structure in microscopy with rigorously defined standards, principles, and practical applications, and the same principles apply to CT, micro-CT, PET, MRI, and other modalities ("in vivo morphometry"), with use documented in the brain, heart, and lung.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^5f354c75]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### The effect of realistic geometries on the susceptibility-weighted MR signal in white matter [^45d68875]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Single Axon Simulations

We first investigate the effect of geometry of a single axon on the local magnetic field perturbation. Six different geometric cases and their field perturbations were generated to examine the effect of axon shape and orientation. Figure 3 a–d shows axons as ellipses of increasing eccentricities, ranging from circular (eccentricity 0) to more elliptical. Figure 3 e, f demonstrates the effect of rotation of the highest eccentricity ellipse relative to H, ranging from orthogonal to parallel. Differences in signal behavior can be attributed solely to the changes in axon shape because volume fractions of myelin, intra‐axonal space, and extra‐axonal space are conserved.

The signal magnitude and phase for each ellipse is plotted in Figure 3 g, h, demonstrating distinct magnitude and phase profiles with particularly pronounced differences in signal phase. The signal phase shows increasing accumulation in the first 30 ms as the axon becomes increasingly elliptical. Rotations of a noncircular geometry can also drive significant signal changes: for example, signal phase corresponding to Figure 3 d, f are opposite in sign after 55 ms despite having identical shape.

### Optimal coil array design: the two-coil case [^202c1833]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

The optimization problem for coil arrays is largely unsolved, even for the case of a two-coil system. This paper reports a systematic computer simulation to investigate the maximal achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a two-coil receiver system where, using cancellation circuitry, mutual inductance is made zero. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical solutions with respect to two-coil geometry are considered. SNR is measured at a single point at a certain depth and also along a longitudinal or transverse line at the same depth. The conducting medium containing these regions of interest is assumed to be an infinite half space, an infinite cylinder or a finite sphere. The previous coil array design using a "magical" overlap only approximates the optimal solution for the infinite half space. For the infinite cylinder and the finite sphere, optimal solutions can be quite different from the "magical" overlap.

Decoupling D 3d symmetry for asymmetric (C 1) reconstruction

By adjusting the volume threshold of core reconstruction in Chimera, we discovered a cylinder "inner core", within the layers that embed twelve TECs, with a 3-fold axis of icosahedron symmetry along the centers of the cylinder bases, i.e. our core reconstruction contains D 3d symmetry. Our next objective was to decouple D 3d symmetry of the core and generate an asymmetric reconstruction to further examine the TECs at all vertices.

In order to decouple D 3d symmetry of the ISVP core, we followed the work flow as described below. First, we generated a new STAR file (saved as rotated_core.star) that contains the rotated orientation parameters of the core particles so that the 3-fold axis is on the Z -axis. To accomplish this, we used relion_rotate_particles.py script from Localized Reconstructionusing the vector along the 3-fold axis (75.87, −211.3, 26.89) and data STAR file of the D 3d core reconstruction (using the command line "python localrec-master/scripts/relion_rotate_particles.py -vector 75.87, −211.3, 26.89 -output rotated_core.star data.star"). Second, we generated a new rotated core map using rotated_core.star as the input of relion_reconstruct command (using the command line " relion_reconstruct -i rotated_core.star -o rotated_core.mrc -ctf"). The rotated_core.star was D 3d symmetry expanded using relion_particle_symmetry_expand command. The symmetry-expanded output STAR file was then subjected to 3D classification without any symmetry (C 1), with the reference map (rotated_core.mrc) and a solvent mask. EMAN2_data python script was used to create the mask, such that the region excluding the core layer embedding twelve TECs was set to zero. This 3D classification step generated fifteen class averages, of which six classes showed reasonable and D 3d symmetry-related core structures. The core structure had two vacant vertices, exhibiting pseudo- D 3d symmetry among the remaining ten TECs. Subsequent 3D auto-refinement of one of six classes obtained a better resolution.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^b59b3ad6]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Simulations: validation of modeling

We designed three sets of simulations to validate our theory. We investigated (a) the influence of the size and shape of the mesoscopic Lorentz cavitywhen calculating the mesoscopic averaged Larmor frequency, Equation (8) through Equations (12) and (13), for different microstructural configurations and (b) the accuracy of calculating the MRI Larmor frequency using Equation (21) in a sample with slowly varying magnetic microstructure and run using different inclusion sizes compared with. Finally, we investigated (c) the validity of the proposed mesoscopic kernel, Equation (43), for a distribution of cylinders. All simulations were done in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

3.1.1 Random packing of cylinders or spheres

Non‐overlapping cylinders or spheres were packed in a sample represented by a cubic volume of side length, with radiidrawn from a gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (SD). The positions(parameterized as in Appendix B.1 for cylinders) were randomly generated from a uniform distribution, and the packing was stopped once the inclusions occupied a chosen volume fraction in the sample. For cylinders, various levels of orientation dispersion were achieved by only generating cylinders within an allowed polar‐angle range, set by a given cut‐offThis generated a uniform distribution of orientations up toThe sample was subsequently discretized on a 3D grid, with a resolution set by the number of grid points. The indicator functionon the discretized grid was then Fourier transformed to yield the indicator functionin k ‐space, which in turn was used to compute the correlation function, Equation (19). We computed the local Larmor frequency, Equation (1), by multiplyingby the dicretized dipole kernel, Equation (3), and Fourier transforming back to image space. The mesoscopic dipole tensor, Equation (18), was computed by integrating the product of the dipole kernel and the correlation function, and dividing the result by the volume fractionof the discretized grid. The external field is normalized so, and chosen to be alongto maximize effect size.

### Renal artery embolization combined with radiofrequency ablation in a porcine kidney model: effect of small and narrowly calibrated microparticles as embolization material on coagulation diameter, volume, and shape [^b9ebf549]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of renal artery embolization with small and narrowly calibrated microparticles on the coagulation diameter, volume, and shape of radiofrequency ablations (RFAs) in porcine kidneys. Forty-eight RFAs were performed in 24 kidneys of 12 pigs. In 6 animals, bilateral renal artery embolization was performed with small and narrowly calibrated microparticles. Upper and lower kidney poles were ablated with identical system parameters. Applying three-dimensional segmentation software, RFAs were segmented on registered 2 mm-thin macroscopic slices. Length, depth, width, volume_segmented, and volume_calculated were determined to describe the size of the RFAs. To evaluate the shape of the RFAs, depth-to-width ratio (perfect symmetry-to-lesion length was indicated by a ratio of 1), sphericity ratio (perfect sphere was indicated by a sphericity ratio of 1), eccentricity (perfect sphere was indicated by an eccentricity of 0), and circularity (perfect circle was indicated by a circularity of 1) were determined. Embolized compared with nonembolized RFAs showed significantly greater depth (23.4 ± 3.6 vs. 17.2 ± 1.8 mm; p < 0.001) and width (20.1 ± 2.9 vs. 12.6 ± 3.7 mm; p < 0.001); significantly larger volume_segmented (8.6 ± 3.2 vs. 3.0 ± 0.7 ml; p < 0.001) and volume_calculated (8.4 ± 3.0 mL vs. 3.3 ± 1.1 ml; p < 0.001); significantly lower depth-to-width (1.17 ± 0.10 vs. 1.48 ± 0.44; p < 0.05), sphericity (1.55 ± 0.44 vs. 1.96 ± 0.43; p < 0.01), and eccentricity (0.84 ± 0.61 vs. 1.73 ± 0.91; p < 0.01) ratios; and significantly greater circularity (0.62 ± 0.14 vs. 0.45 ± 0.16; p < 0.01). Renal artery embolization with small and narrowly calibrated microparticles affected the coagulation diameter, volume, and shape of RFAs in porcine kidneys. Embolized RFAs were significantly larger and more spherical compared with nonembolized RFAs.

### Predicting frictional aging from bulk relaxation measurements [^ba3957d9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Frictional aging

We now investigate whether the frictional strength, as a collective macroscopic observable of the evolution of a static interface, also evolves at the same rate as the relaxation of the local microscopic normal stresses. Our apparatus for friction measurements is shown in Fig. 3a. We use a rheometer with a custom-made tool to rotate a cylindrical tube with three polymer spheres glued to its underside, while it is measuring the applied torque. Figure 3b shows typical examples of friction as a function of sliding distance for polypropylene spheres on a glass substrate with different waiting times t w before the measurement. As generally expected, the static or peak friction F s grows with waiting time t w. Figure 3c plots F s normalized by the dynamic or steady-state friction F d as a function of aging time t w for multiple experiments. These data are in close agreement with the stress relaxation rateobtained from squeezing experiments (solid line), indicating that frictional aging is given by stress relaxation.

### Optimization of mammoSite therapy [^710b3c9a]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Radiation source anisotropy causes about 10% of a spherically shaped planning target volume surrounding a MammoSite balloon to receive less than the prescribed dose. The principal dose-limiting factor for MammoSite therapy is the dose to the overlying skin. Additional limiting factors potentially include the dose to portions of the heart and lung. The goal of optimization is to deliver the prescribed dose to as much of the planning target volume as possible while avoiding toxicity to adjacent organs.

Methods and Materials

An experimental CT-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment planning system was used to investigate optimization strategies for MammoSite treatment. This system implements a linear optimization of high-dose-rate dwell times on the basis of constraints assigned to points of interest and a set of potential dwell positions.

Results

The cylindrical symmetry of the MammoSite catheter limits the optimization process to creating spherical, ellipsoidal, or egg-shaped isodose distributions whose major axis is oriented along the catheter axis. If the dose to a limiting structure, such as skin, is not an issue, the use of multiple dwell positions can compensate for source anisotropy and create a more spherical isodose surface enclosing the planning target volume compared with a single dwell position. When skin becomes a dose-limiting factor, the catheter axis orientation, source anisotropy, dwell position, and dwell weighting can be exploited to limit the skin dose while simultaneously preserving the prescribed dose to as much of the target volume as possible.

Conclusion

Optimization of MammoSite therapy using multiple dwell positions within the balloon is both possible and practical.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^90ce5be7]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres < oblate ellipsoids < prolate ellipsoids < dimers < spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

### A gradient-based method for segmenting FDG-PET images: methodology and validation [^a5f6aaea]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

A new gradient-based method for segmenting FDG-PET images is described and validated.

Methods

The proposed method relies on the watershed transform and hierarchical cluster analysis. To allow a better estimation of the gradient intensity, iteratively reconstructed images were first denoised and deblurred with an edge-preserving filter and a constrained iterative deconvolution algorithm. Validation was first performed on computer-generated 3D phantoms containing spheres, then on a real cylindrical Lucite phantom containing spheres of different volumes ranging from 2.1 to 92.9 ml. Moreover, laryngeal tumours from seven patients were segmented on PET images acquired before laryngectomy by the gradient-based method and the thresholding method based on the source-to-background ratio developed by Daisne (Radiother Oncol 2003;69:247–50). For the spheres, the calculated volumes and radii were compared with the known values; for laryngeal tumours, the volumes were compared with the macroscopic specimens. Volume mismatches were also analysed.

Results

On computer-generated phantoms, the deconvolution algorithm decreased the mis-estimate of volumes and radii. For the Lucite phantom, the gradient-based method led to a slight underestimation of sphere volumes (by 10–20%), corresponding to negligible radius differences (0.5–1.1 mm); for laryngeal tumours, the segmented volumes by the gradient-based method agreed with those delineated on the macroscopic specimens, whereas the threshold-based method overestimated the true volume by 68% (p = 0.014). Lastly, macroscopic laryngeal specimens were totally encompassed by neither the threshold-based nor the gradient-based volumes.

Conclusion

The gradient-based segmentation method applied on denoised and deblurred images proved to be more accurate than the source-to-background ratio method.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^29f660d7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports ("basins"). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a "Star of David" pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

### Dosimetric performance evaluation of MLC-based and cone-based 3D spatially fractionated LATTICE radiotherapy [^93380cb7]. Radiation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aims to dosimetrically compare multi-leaf collimator (MLC)-based and cone-based 3D LATTICE radiotherapy (LRT) plans. Valley-peak ratios were evaluated using seven different 3D LATTICE designs. Target volumes of 8 cm and 12 cm were defined on the RANDO phantom. Valley-peak dose patterns were obtained by creating high-dose vertices in the target volumes. By changing the vertex diameter, vertices separation, and volume ratio, seven different LATTICE designs were generated. Treatment plans were implemented using CyberKnife and Varian RapidArc. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD), EBT3 films, and electronic portal-imaging device (EPID) were employed for dosimetric treatment verification, and measured doses were compared to calculated doses. By changing the vertex diameter and vertices separation, the valley-peak ratio was exhibited little difference between the two systems. By changing the vertex diameter and volume ratio, the valley-peak ratio was observed nearly the same for the two systems. The film, TLD, and EPID dosimetry showed good agreement between the calculated and measured doses. Based on the results, we concluded that although smaller valley-peak ratios were obtained with cone-based plans, the dose-volume histograms were comparable in both systems. Also, when we evaluated the treatment duration, the MLC-based plans were more appropriate to apply the treatment in a single fraction.

### Emergent geometry and duality in the carbon nucleus [^86507865]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Nuclear density distributions for several 12 C states using the SU(4) interaction.

a – f Results for the density distribution of the two inner angles of the triangle formed by the three alpha clusters for the, states respectively. The two axes are for the two inner angles θ 1 and θ 2 measured in degrees. g – l Results for the two-dimensional projection of the nuclear density for the, states respectively. In each case the orientation of the shortest root-mean-square direction is aligned with the x axis.

We now define a model-independent two-dimensional projection of the nuclear density for the states of 12 C. In order to construct this projection, we first identify the x axis as the direction with the smallest RMS deviation of the nucleon positions relative to the center of mass. For the nuclear states that we have already identified as having an equilateral triangular shape, we rotate the density configurations along the x axis so that one of the three clusters is pointing along the positive z direction. We then symmetrize with respect to 0°, 120° and 240° rotations about the x axis. For nuclear states that we have already identified as having an obtuse isosceles shape, we identify the z axis as the direction with the longest RMS deviation of the nucleon positions relative to the CM. We then rotate the density configurations along the z axis so that the alpha cluster closest to the CM lies on the positive y axis.

In the right panel of Fig. 2, we show the density distribution of selected states of 12 C for the SU(4) interaction. The density distributions obtained using the N2LO chiral interaction are presented in Fig. 3 and the Supplementary Information and are in excellent agreement with the SU(4) interaction results. The, andstates (see Supplementary Information for the last two) have similar intrinsic equilateral triangular shapes, consistent with an interpretation as members of a rotational band built on top of thestate. The, states (see Supplementary Information for the last one) have similar intrinsic obtuse isosceles triangle shapes and are consistent with belonging to a rotational band built on top of thestate. These findings are consistent with previous studies in the literature based on group theoretical considerations. We note that models where the Hoyle state has an equilateral triangle symmetry predict an additional 3 − and 4 − state in the Hoyle state rotational band.

### Variable microtubule architecture in the malaria parasite [^d24e9ddc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Sporozoite and ookinete SPMTs

Having determined the relative polarity, the necessary step for combining is finding the relative φ rotation (rotation around the symmetry axis) between individual microtubules. This could be done by aligning each individual particle to a common reference, but would result in a large number of errors due to the low signal to noise ratio. We developed a method analogous to that of Zabeo et al.where the microtubule average volumes are aligned together in order to find their relative φ rotation (Fig. S9 step 4). These φ rotations were then applied to their respective particles and aligned to a common reference. SVA was subsequently performed with volumes binned 4 and 2 times. Only sporozoite data were aligned with unbinned volumes; the final step was to replace volumes reconstructed with the whole sets of tilts by volumes reconstructed with tilts between ± 24°. No rotation search was performed with the restricted tilt range. The resulting C1 EM map was anisotropic around the pseudosymmetry axis due to an uneven distribution of microtubule rotational orientations. To address this, particles were separated into classes by orientation and particles with the lowest cross correlation coefficients in the most abundant classes were removed. This reduced the number of particles from 24028 to 13263 in sporozoite and 8377 to 1851 in ookinete datasets.

Other microtubules

Gametocyte and merozoite singlet microtubules

Approximately 200 microtubules from 25 tomograms were processed individually, with random initial φ rotations. Data were then manually classified by protofilament number, rotated to the same polarity and aligned with volumes binned 4 and 2 times. Helical parameters were measured directly using class averages with the exception of 13- and 15-protofilament classes where tubulin subunits were not resolved and published parameters were used (Table S2). Helical symmetry was applied, followed by SVA alignment.

Gametocyte doublet microtubules

SPMT doublets were processed in a manner analogous to ookinete and sporozoite data, where average volumes were used to determine relative φ rotations. SPMTs with different numbers of protofilaments in A and B tubules were combined together, resulting in an ensemble average volume.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^317deddb]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Simulation (a). The size of

The purpose of this simulation was to examine the accuracy of the mesoscopic Lorentz cavity approximation, Equation (8) through Equations (12) and (13), as a function of the size ofcompared with the size of the magnetic inclusions. Figure 4 gives an overview of the simulation. The coarse‐grained Larmor frequencywas averaged around the center pointof a population of (a1) randomly placed parallel rectangular rods, (a2) randomly placed dots, (a3) long randomly oriented rods and (a4) random sheets arranged in parallel along thedirection. The rods (a1) were made by generating a2D grid with a weighted random number of zeros and ones to vary the volume fraction as. The 2D grid was then repeated along the third dimension to yield agrid with purely 2D Poissonian structural correlations. The random dots (a2) were generated as (a1) but placed randomly on a 3Dgrid with similar volume fractions. Each rod/dot thus had a widthof one grid unit and the rods a length of 400 grid units. The long randomly oriented rods (a3) were made by randomly placing rods with a width of three grid units and length of 800 grid units in a3D grid. The rods were allowed to overlap, and we used periodic boundaries to contain the whole rod. The volume fraction was varied as. The sheets (a4) were made by placing rods of similar dimensions in a2D grid and repeating it along the third dimension to yield agrid with similar volume fractions. These scenarios correspond to systems with long‐range 3D and 2D structural correlations, respectively. 100 different configurations were generated for (a1)–(a4) for each volume fraction. When calculating, the microstructurewas only considered within the mesoscopic region(Figure 4A). The exterior region was instead averaged according to Equation (10). We investigated the dependence of the size and shape ofwhen calculatingin comparison with the true Larmor frequencycalculated with Equation (8) using the magnetic microstructure for the entire region and averaged within the same mesoscopic sphereas(Figure 4B). In addition, we investigated the influence of various shapes for, i.e. a cube, sphere and cylinder, for decomposing the sample into mesoscopic and macroscopic regions in the calculation of. The side lengthofwas varied from four times the width of the rods to half the size of the sample. We also computed the field at the center point, where the microstructure was removed within(Figure 4C). The mean relative error(for (a1)) was then calculated by averaging over the different realizations for each configuration. We also computed the mean squared differenceand compared it with(for (a1)–(a4)).

### ABC / 2 for rapid clinical estimate of infarct, perfusion, and mismatch volumes [^457eedf3]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid and easy clinical assessments for volumes of infarction and perfusion mismatch are needed. We tested whether simple geometric models generated accurate estimates of these volumes.

Methods

Acute diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and perfusion (mean transit time [MTT]) in 63 strokes and established infarct volumes in 50 subacute strokes were measured by computerized planimetry. Mismatch was defined as MTT/DWI ≥ 1.2. Observers, blinded to planimetric values, measured lesions in three perpendicular axes A, B, and C. Geometric estimates of sphere, ellipsoid, bicone, and cylinder were compared to planimetric volume by least-squares linear regression.

Results

The ABC/2 formula (ellipsoid) was superior to other geometries for estimating volume of DWI (slope 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.38; R(2) = 0.91, p = 0.001) and MTT (slope 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; R(2) = 0.89, p = 0.001). The intrarater and interrater reliability for ABC/2 was high for both DWI (0.992 and 0.965) and MTT (0.881 and 0.712). For subacute infarct, the ABC/2 formula also best estimated planimetric volume (slope 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; R(2) = 0.74, p = 0.001). In general, sphere and cylinder geometries overestimated all volumes and bicone underestimated all volumes. The positive predictive value for mismatch was 92% and negative predictive value was 33%.

Conclusions

Of the models tested, ABC/2 is reproducible, is accurate, and provides the best simple geometric estimate of infarction and mean transit time volumes. ABC/2 has a high positive predictive value for identifying mismatch greater than 20% and might be a useful tool for rapid determination of acute stroke treatment.

### Dynamics of polarization-tuned mirror symmetry breaking in a rotationally symmetric system [^53736093]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To understand intuitively the extraordinary MSB mechanism and LOF, we consider a specific system with SO (2) continuous rotational symmetry that could be easily implemented by experiment. The system is schematically shown in Fig. 2a. Here, an isotropic dielectric spherical particle with the highest symmetry is semi-floating at the interface of two mediums, half part of the particle in medium 1 (air, refractive index n 1) and the other half in medium 2 (water, refractive index n 2). An LP plane wave (λ = 532 nm) with a polarization angle α illuminates obliquely on the particle from the air at an incident angle θ. Such a strategy of utilizing the buoyancy at the interface is widely used in applications such as chiral enantiomeric sorting, medical diagnostics and analytical chemistry.

### Structural conservation in a membrane-enveloped filamentous virus infecting a hyperthermophilic acidophile [^68703336]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The determination of the helical symmetry was by trial and error, searching for a symmetry which yielded recognizable secondary structure. Both SPIDERand Relionwere used to generate independent reconstructions, which were very similar.

The IHRSR algorithmwas used for the SPIDER reconstructions, starting from a solid cylinder as an initial model. Once the correct symmetry was determined (an axial rise of 2.76 Å and a rotation of 21.0° per subunit), the segments were processed by the IHRSR method to produce the reconstructions. Finally, the variability in the structure was further overcome by only symmetrizing the central sixth 32 px of the 384 px long asymmetric reconstruction. Since the images had been multiplied by the CTF twice (once by the microscope and once by us in phase correction), the amplitudes of the final volume were divided by the sum of the squared CTFs. The reconstructed volume (which has a very high SNR from the extensive averaging) is corrected only in Fourier amplitudes by dividing by the sum of the squared CTFs. This is a Wiener filter in the limit of a very high SNR. The map was further sharpened using a negative B-factor of 190.

To further improve the resolution, micrographs with 24 fractions and boxing coordinates were imported into Relion. A similar reconstruction to the one from SPIDER was generated in Relion using the same helical symmetry, starting with the SPIDER volume filtered to 10 Å. The resolution was then further boosted from 4.0 to 3.7 Å in Relion by movie-refinement, dose weighting and particle polishing.

Right ventricle (RV) three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography — technique context and evolution: The RV has an asymmetrical, pyramidal shape that does not conform to simple geometric assumptions; most applied 3D techniques have used rotational or freehand scanning methods and these series demonstrated improved accuracy of RV function assessment; however, reconstruction from serial 2D images with the need for offline postprocessing has limited widespread clinical application; recent availability of real-time 3D (RT3D) echocardiography has the potential to further improve assessment of RV chamber size, volume, and function.

### Pseudometrically constrained centroidal voronoi tessellations: generating uniform antipodally symmetric points on the unit sphere with a novel acceleration strategy and its applications to diffusion and three-dimensional radial MRI [^6a19285a]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this work is to investigate the hypothesis that uniform sampling measurements that are endowed with antipodal symmetry play an important role in image quality when the raw data and image data are related through the Fourier relationship. Currently, it is extremely challenging to generate large and uniform antipodally symmetric point sets suitable for three-dimensional radial MRI. A novel approach is proposed to solve this long-standing problem in a unique and optimal way.

Methods

The proposed method is based on constrained centroidal Voronoi tessellations of the upper hemisphere with a novel pseudometric.

Results

The time complexity of the proposed tessellations was shown to be effectively linear, i.e., on the order of the number of sampling measurements. For small sample size, the proposed method was comparable with the state-of-the-art method (a direct iterative minimization of the electrostatic potential energy of a collection of electrons antipodal-symmetrically distributed on the unit sphere) in terms of the sampling uniformity. For large sample size, in which the state-of-the-art method is infeasible, the reconstructed images from the proposed method has less streak and ringing artifacts, when compared with those of the commonly used methods.

Conclusion

This work proposed a unique and optimal approach to solving a long-standing problem in generating uniform sampling points for three-dimensional radial MRI.

### A refined hemispheric model of normal human aortic valve and root geometry [^dfd67878]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Better understanding of aortic root geometry could improve diagnosis and reconstruction of pathologic aortic valves. In this study, a previous model of hemispheric aortic valve leaflets nested within a cylindrical aorta was refined in humans with normal aortic valves.

Methods

Using 1-mm axial slices, high-resolution computed tomographic angiograms from 10 normal aortic roots were used to generate high-density X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of valve structures using Mathematica software. Three-dimensional least squares regression analyses of leaflet and sinus coordinates were employed to compare multiple geometric models of aortic valve and root geometry. Shapes and dimensions of all root structures were evaluated and compared.

Results

Aortic valve geometry was roughly hemispherical, but the valve base was elliptical (minor-major diameter ratio = .66). Dimensional fits of the leaflet-sinus complexes also were better using ellipsoidal geometry, with taller leaflets than predicted by hemispheres. The commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps was located uniformly at the posterior junction of the base minor diameter and circumference, with the center of the right coronary cusp opposite. The subcommissural post areas flared outward by 5° to 10°, and the volume of the right coronary leaflet-sinus complex was 12.4% and 10.7% larger than the noncoronary cusps and left cusps, respectively.

Conclusions

The normal human aortic valve is an elliptical structure, and ellipsoidal refinements improve representation of leaflet geometry. The left and noncoronary cusps commissure is located posteriorly; the right coronary cusp is located anteriorly. This model could be useful in quantifying pathologic geometry and in engineering devices for aortic valve reconstruction.

Unbiased stereological sampling — principles and methods note that "Unbiased sampling designs guarantee statistically representative samples and generally must be spatially randomized", and for anisotropic structures some parameters "require spatial orientation randomization". Named approaches include "systematic uniform random sampling", "isotropic uniform random sampling", "stratified sampling", "fractionator sampling", and "proportionator sampling". Importantly, "Voxel-by-voxel automated image analysis ensures neither accuracy nor precision of the results, nor does it obviate the need to strictly follow stereological sampling principles".

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### An alternative isovelocity surface model for quantitation of effective regurgitant orifice area in mitral regurgitation with an elongated orifice application to functional mitral regurgitation [^efc118a8]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to develop and test a simple, clinically practical alternative isovelocity surface (ISVS) model for calculating effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) in mitral regurgitation (MR) when the regurgitant orifice is elongated, such as in functional MR.

Background

Clinical experience and 3-dimensional imaging suggest that the traditional hemispheric ISVS model used in the conventional proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) calculation is invalid in certain MR cases and can cause erroneous EROA values.

Methods

Our ISVS model consisted of 3 sections of equal radius (R): a cylindrical midsection of length (L) positioned between 2 hemispheroidal end sections. Total ISVS area (T(S)) is equal to 2πR(2) + πLR and EROA is equal to (V(N/)V(CW))T(S), where V(N) is the flow velocity crossing perpendicular to the ISVS, and V(CW) is the peak MR jet velocity by continuous-wave Doppler. This EROA was corrected for any obtuse angle, θ formed by tented leaflets, by multiplying T(S) by a planar factor, (θ/180) or a combination of this planar factor for the cylindrical midsection and the solid-angle factor, 1-cos(θ/2), for the 2 spheroidal end sections. In 24 cases of severe or 3+ functional MR, we calculated EROA using 3 traditional hemispheric surfaces and 3 alternative ISVS models that differed in the leaflet angle correction applied. Results were compared with continuity-based EROA using the standard mitral valve - aortic valve stroke volume method and with predictions based upon theoretical geometric considerations.

Results

The mean differences between continuity EROA and ISVS area-based EROA for no angle correction, planar correction, or combined angle correction were, respectively, 0.38, 0.32, and 0.28 cm(2) for the 3 spherical surface models and 0.17, 0.018, and -0.012 cm(2) for the 3 alternative 3-section ISVS models. The empiric EROA results with both the traditional spherical and alternative ISVS models agreed well with theoretical geometric predictions.

Conclusions

The traditional spherical PISA model underestimates EROA in functional MR. For elongated MR orifices, an ISVS model that mirrors orifice shape yields more accurate EROA values. Correction to the ISVS area for obtuse leaflet angulation improves accuracy of EROA estimation.

### Recommendations for quantification methods during the performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the pediatric measurements writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography pediatric and congenital heart disease council [^75701799]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Pediatric quantification protocols — pulmonary veins, systemic veins, and atria — advise that the pulmonary veins are usually best evaluated in a high left parasternal or suprasternal short‑axis view ("crab" view) and that the left atrial (LA) appendage should not be mistakenly identified as the left upper pulmonary vein and the right middle pulmonary vein should not be mistakenly identified as the right upper pulmonary vein; subxiphoid short‑axis or right parasternal views are usually better at displaying the right upper pulmonary vein. The superior vena cava is not routinely measured in clinical practice, and normative data have not been established, whereas inferior vena cava (IVC) size can be measured above its junction with the hepatic veins just below the diaphragm in subxiphoid short‑axis views (displaying the IVC long axis), and this may help assess hydration status. The IVC diameter varies with respiration, and the collapsibility index (the percentage decrease in IVC diameter with inspiration) appears to correlate with right atrial (RA) pressures in adults, but neither the IVC diameter nor the collapsibility index appears to correlate with age or BSA in adult patients, and the utility of the collapsibility index in children has not been evaluated. Left atrial size can be assessed by M‑mode and 2D measurements of the distance from the posterior aortic wall to the posterior LA wall, though this anteroposterior distance correlates poorly with angiographically derived LA volumes; recent recommendations involve calculation of LA volumes from apical views at end‑systole just before the MV opens using major‑axis and minor‑axis dimensions and planimetered areas in orthogonal views. Among LA volume calculations, the biplane area‑length and the biplane Simpson (summation of disks) methods using apical 4‑chamber and 2‑chamber views appear to provide the most consistent results with published reference values for normal adults; the biplane area‑length method has also been used in children, and LA volumes indexed to BSA appear to correlate with diastolic function and mitral regurgitation grade. Real‑time three‑dimensional echocardiography with a rotation/polyhedral‑based algorithm has correlated well with LA volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and right atrial size is usually assessed in an apical 4‑chamber view at end‑systole just before the TV opens.

### Pseudostenosis in vessels adjacent to intracranial aneurysms on volume-rendered 3D angiograms: a phantom study [^00e9aa42]. Academic Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objective

Among artifacts on three-dimensional (3D) angiograms, pseudostenosis in vessels adjacent to intracranial aneurysms has not been described. By using a phantom, artifacts seen in vessels adjacent to intracranial aneurysms on volume-rendered 3D angiograms were assessed.

Materials and Methods

Using a 3D angiography system and a C-arm sweep, digital images were obtained with a 512 x 512 matrix. Rotation was 30 degrees /second, and frame rate was 30 frames/second. Phantom aneurysms were designed to simulate intracranial saccular aneurysms and their parent arteries. Phantoms, consisting of a cylinder (inner diameter, 2 or 4 mm) and spheres, 10, 7, 5, 3, or 2 mm in diameter, were placed at 0 degrees and 45 degrees to the axis of rotation. Two radiologists consensually recorded their findings regarding the presence and location of stenosis and its relationship to the angle of rotation. The maximum percentage of stenosis in the pseudostenosis area was measured on multiplanar reconstruction images by using a workstation computer.

Results

Pseudostenosis was observed in the cylinder adjacent to the sphere at both 0 degrees and 45 degrees angles; it was on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Pseudostenosis was most obvious with 10-mm spheres; it was not seen when spheres were 3 mm or less in diameter. The maximum percentage of stenosis of the pseudostenosis increased with sphere size.

Conclusion

On volume-rendered 3D angiograms, pseudostenosis was seen in the cylinder adjacent to the sphere. The artifact lay on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and sphere size affected the artifact.

### The need for rotational margins in intensity-modulated radiotherapy and a new method for planning target volume design [^04e89487]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effect of rotational errors on the coverage of clinical target volumes (CTVs) is examined. A new planning target volume (PTV) construction that considers the individual paths traced by movements of the target boundary points is developed.

Methods and Materials

A standard uniform margin expansion was compared with a PTV constructed from the space swept out by a concave moving target. A new method formed the PTV by aggregating the separate convex hulls taken of the positions of the individual target boundary points in a sampling of CTV displacements.

Results

A 0.5-cm uniform margin adequate for translations was inadequate given CTV rotation about a fixed off-center axis. A PTV formed of the target's swept-out area was 22% smaller than needed for coverage by a uniform margin, but computationally is not readily extended to translations combined with rotations about a shifting axis. Forming instead the union of convex hulls of the boundary points in a sampling of CTV displacements represented these movements in the PTV design and retained the target's concave shape.

Conclusions

Planning target volumes should accommodate target rotation. The union of convex hulls of the boundary point positions in a sampling of displacements can effectively represent multiple sources of deviations while preserving target concavities.

### Gradient and curl optical torques [^6a8f8207]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

LOT on anisotropic particles

The above sphere-based LOT will not depend on the particle orientation because of isotropy. Realistic particles cannot be perfect spheres and rod-like geometries (e.g. dimers and cylinders) thus being of interest in experiments. For anisotropic particles, the torque should be sensitive to the orientation and torsional balance (or restoring effect) might occur.

To simulate realistic spherical particles, we consider spheres of varying roughness (see particles i-iv in Fig. 3 a), with the illumination of traveling wave (λ = 0.58 μ m) as an example. The optical torque is computed based on the Maxwell stress tensor method, in which the electromagnetic field is obtained by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Figure 3 b shows the calculated LOT on the particles with varying orientation angle α at y = 0 and x = 0.35 μ m, where the momentum curl of illumination is maximized. The α -independent torque on the isotropic particle i is approximately −1.0 pN ⋅ μ m, in good agreement with our analytical theory (cf. red line in Fig. 2 d). Now, due to the anisotropy, the torque magnitude varies with α on the rough spheres ii-iv, and larger roughness yields more significant variation. However, the torque maintains its negative sign, irrespective to the orientation. This indicates that the rough spheres will exhibit the running state to rotate clockwise and continuously, consistent with the perfect sphere, as shown by the angular potential (Fig. 3 c), which is calculated by the opposite angular integral of the torque. It also suggests that the restoring contribution of the torque is overwhelmed by that responsible for continuous rotation. Therefore, our theory can well predict and explain the dynamic behaviors of these sphere-like structures.

### Residual astigmatism produced by toric intraocular lens rotation [^0ec86701]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze changes in the eye's refractive properties when a toric intraocular lens (IOL) rotates.

Setting

Fundación Oftalmológica del Mediterráneo, Valencia, Spain.

Design

Experimental study.

Methods

The matrix definition of astigmatism was used in this theoretical study and compared with another vector representation. Two methods were compared: (1) The cylinder, C, resulting from the addition of 2 cylinders C(1) and C(2) whose axes form an angle a, is obtained by the addition of 2 vectors of values C(1) and C(2) forming an angle 2a; (2) the power matrix, F, of a thin astigmatic dioptric system that decomposes naturally into 3 orthogonal components: the purely spherical part F(nes,) the ortho-astigmatism F(or), and oblique astigmatism F(ob).

Results

The residual cylinder was one third of the corneal astigmatism when a toric IOL rotated ± 10 degrees when the cylinder values for the cornea (C(1)) and IOL (C(2)) were equal. Nevertheless, in most cases C(1) is greater than C(2); therefore, the residual astigmatism did not change noticeably with small rotations. The angle of rotation, b, which annuls the astigmatism correction, could be obtained from the following: cos(π + 2b) = -r/2, with r being the ratio between the IOL and cornea cylinders.

Conclusions

The 2 methods gave equivalent results. When the IOL cylinder had a value different from that of the corneal astigmatism, a better choice would be a lower, rather than higher, cylinder value to reduce residual astigmatism. In general, toric IOL rotations less than 10 degrees changed the eye's refraction less than 0.50 diopter. Thus, small axis rotations are not an obstacle for satisfactory astigmatism correction with toric IOLs.

### Using symmetry to elucidate the importance of stoichiometry in colloidal crystal assembly [^dff8d404]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We demonstrate a method based on symmetry to predict the structure of self-assembling, multicomponent colloidal mixtures. This method allows us to feasibly enumerate candidate structures from all symmetry groups and is many orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than combinatorial enumeration of these candidates. In turn, this permits us to compute ground-state phase diagrams for multicomponent systems. While tuning the interparticle potentials to produce potentially complex interactions represents the conventional route to designing exotic lattices, we use this scheme to demonstrate that simple potentials can also give rise to such structures which are thermodynamically stable at moderate to low temperatures. Furthermore, for a model two-dimensional colloidal system, we illustrate that lattices forming a complete set of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries can be rationally designed from certain systems by tuning the mixture composition alone, demonstrating that stoichiometric control can be a tool as powerful as directly tuning the interparticle potentials themselves.

### MRI-based axis-referenced morphometric model corresponding to lamellar organization for assessing hippocampal atrophy in dementia [^125ad3e2]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 The axis‐referenced coordinate system of the hippocampus

The skeleton is a kind of geometric symmetry used to simplify a complex shape. Mathematically, the symmetry axis of the hippocampus can be represented as an internal medial surface by the medial axis geometry (Pizer et al; Siddiqi & Pizer). We have made some modifications to the medial axis for application in this study, and the details are described in the Supporting Information. One important modification involves smoothly extending the medial surface outward until it reaches the object's boundary surface. These results in an inscribed medial surface (IMS) used to represent the symmetry of the object. Here, we generate the IMS of the template hippocampus in three steps. First, we calculate the Voronoi diagram according to the boundary surface of the hippocampus. The diagram consists of Voronoi regions, which are sets of points located closer to a particular generating point than to any other generating point. The points on a Voronoi diagram from a 3D object's boundary agree with the medial surface (Siddiqi & Pizer). Second, we create a Non‐Uniform Rational B‐Splines (NURBS) surface that best fits the Voronoi points inside the hippocampus. The NURBS, a flexible and powerful geometric fitting method widely used in 3D modeling, creates a smooth surface approximate to the medial surface of the hippocampal shape. Finally, we smoothly extend the medial surface to meet the boundary surface of the hippocampus, as shown in Figure 2b.

A rectangular mesh on a two‐dimensional plane is conformally mapped to the IMS, where the centermost longitudinal line is manually adjusted to best approximate the intersection between the IMS and the CA‐DG border (the CA region includes subfield CA 1, 2, 3 and the DG includes the SRLM). The conformal mapping is performed by methods described in (Meng et al.), with four manually defined landmark vertices on the border of the IMS corresponding to the four corners of the planar rectangle. A reparameterized IMS is illustrated in Figure 2c. Due to the conformal mapping, the transversal (medial‐lateral) axes are ensured to be nearly vertical to the longitudinal axes on the IMS. These orthogonal curvilinear coordinate lines serve as a reference to reshape the hippocampal boundary surface.

### Presentation of 3D isotropic imaging data for optimal viewing [^1988f5b0]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Three-dimensional (3D) isotropically sampled data facilitates retrospective viewing of arbitrarily aligned image planes and simplifies automated computer analysis of 3D structures. However, compared to acquisitions that employ thick slices, MRI acquisitions with isotropic sampling have a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A rater study was performed to examine viewer preference for the trade-off between SNR and the partial-volume effect of through-plane averaging. A robust preference for a 5:1 ratio in through-plane to in-plane was found for a typical SNR of 11.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^a3f7a37b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Flow convergence method (PISA) for quantitation of valvular regurgitation — measurement, interpretation, and pitfalls are outlined as follows: The color frame for PISA measurement should be timed to the instant "corresponding to the maximal jet velocity by CWD". When reporting effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), "it is best to use the "mean" EROA…; preferably, the RVol should be retained as the most appropriate index". The regurgitant orifice may be nonplanar; it "may be conical rather than flat or planar (180°)… the flow convergence covers more than a hemisphere". If hemispheric geometry is limited by constraint, the operator should attempt to relieve it "by increasing the Va", and "if the constraint persists… the echocardiographer should decide whether a simple correction for the truncation of the flow convergence is possible, and if not, the method should not be reported". Elliptical orifices cause bias: "Application of the standard PISA formula to such an elliptical orifice will lead predictably to flow underestimation", quantified as "For a 3: 1 ellipse… 8% underestimation… a 5: 1 ratio… 17% underestimation, and a 10: 1 ratio… 35% underestimation". Jet direction affects feasibility: "Central jets allow an easy alignment", whereas "eccentric jets may present a challenge". Advanced imaging can help; "Three-dimensional color flow would provide a better assessment… although with additional limitations of lower spatial and temporal resolution". With multiple jets, "the PISA method can be applied to each orifice, with flows and EROA added together; if one lesion is very mild, it can be neglected", and overall, PISA "is the most used method for quantitation of valvular regurgitation in routine clinical practice".

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^b2d1eb3b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is notable that a Delaunay tetrahedron generates a point in the PD 2 plot only when its circumcentre lies inside its four triangular faces. Such a tetrahedron is called 'well-centred'. The birth value is the largest circumradius of the four faces and the death value is the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Circumradii of the triangular faces, ρ i, and of the tetrahedron, R, are related by ρ i = R sin(γ i) where γ i is the angle between the outward-pointing normal to face i and a radial line drawn from the tetrahedron circumcentre to one of the vertices on face i. The angles γ i can take any value in (0, π) so ρ i ∈(0, R), with ρ i = R when γ i = π /2 (and so have birth = death in PD 2). For a tetrahedron to be well-centred, however, we must have γ i < π /2 for all four faces. But the largest angle in any given tetrahedron must be greater than that for a regular tetrahedron, so. This means the circumradii of the faces of a well-centred tetrahedron satisfy ρ i ∈(R sin(γ max), R sin(π /2)), that is, ρ i / R ∈(/3, 1). This is quite a narrow strip in the persistence diagram PD 2 (/3 = 0.9428), and implies that any point (b, d) in PD 2 with d > 3 b /must be due to a 'pore' built from two or more Delaunay tetrahedra (that is, five or more beads in the bead-pack data).

Our bead packs are weakly polydisperse, and the variation in bead radii is compensated for by using the weighted DT (also known as a regular triangulation) based on the power distance to a ball B (z, r): d B (x) = d (x, z) 2 − r 2. The definition of alpha shapes carries over naturally to this setting.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^52f732dd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 4 presents an example of reconfigurable structures assembled with varying geometry and topology of modules for a target DOF. Applying the geometric modification in Eqs. (3)–(6) and topological reconstruction in Eqs. (7)–(10) to 28 unit cells within a volumetric mapping size of 40, we obtain sphere reconfigurable structures for various target DOFs. Our algorithm provides multiple solutions, e.g. multiple combinations of geometry and topology for a target. For example, unit cell #1 with a mapping size ofand unit cell #22 with a mapping size ofprovide several topological options with varyingfor target mobility, as shown in Fig. 4.

We plot the DOFs with varying connecting topology while demonstrating various deformation modes, including uniaxial extension and volumetric shrinkage, as shown in Fig. 4 d, e (see the transformation in Supplementary Movie 5). The mobility can also be validated using a linear eigenmode analysis.

The same unit cell, e.g. a cubic unit cell, provides different reconfigurability depending on the variation of the topological connections, which is controlled by the mapping size. Small-sized polyhedrons with amapping can provide a vaster design space in mobility than large-sized polyhedrons with amapping because of the greater chance of available topology, as illustrated in Fig. 4. A unit cell consisting of two tetrahedrons and one octahedron with amapping produces a maximum of 40 connections, resulting in zero mobility, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Even releasing the connection only produces a narrow range of design space in mobility because of the extruded tubular shapes of the tetrahedron and octahedron being a triangular lattice prism with kinematic mobility of zero.

### Visualizing molecular interactions that determine assembly of a bullet-shaped vesicular stomatitis virus particle [^9a551445]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Symmetry and geometry analysis

To determine the apparent rotational symmetry from top views of partially assembled or disrupted nucleocapsids (Supplementary Fig. 1b, left), we calculated for each image the rotational self-correlation within a radius of 153–255 Å with "OR MAP" from SPIDER(Supplementary Fig. 1b, middle, blue curve). We numerically fit CC of Eq. (1) to the observed self-correlation within 5–60° of the self-rotation angle ϕ using SciPy(Supplementary Fig. 1b, right, red curve).

A third degree polynomial fpln was first obtained from an initial fit (Supplementary Fig. 1b, middle, green curve), and the number of submits per turn N, or apparent rotational symmetry, is given by Eq. (2).

To measure the width and the length of VSV bullet particles, we extracted 2-times binned images (1400 × 1400 pixels) centered at the middle of each manually picked trunk. We used relion_autopick as a bilayer-enhancement algorithm by calculating a figure-of-merit image for each VSV bullet image based on a membrane reference image as input. For each particle that was fully within the extracted box, we manually measured its length, with e2helixboxer.py, by defining points centered on the membrane at the apex and bottom, respectively. To measure its width, we first projected density of the membrane-enhanced images along the particle axis, and then used Python to locate the two membrane peaks within the 1D-density distribution.

### Self-assembly and electrostriction of arrays and chains of hopfion particles in chiral liquid crystals [^4696ea24]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The so-called 'double-twist cylinder' or 'double-twist tube', in which n (r) is parallel to the cylinder axis at its centre and exhibits a 2D radial twist to form a barber pole-like pattern on the cylinder surface (Fig. 1a), is the basis of a 2D skyrmion that can be obtained as an isolated topological object in a confinement-unwound CNLC, and is also a building block of the cholesteric blue phases with 3D crystalline arrays of such tubes. The director n (r) coils around the tube with periodicity defined by the distance along the tube axis over which n (r) winds around it once (Fig. 1a). When a fragment of such a tube of length corresponding to a single winding of n (r) is looped on itself, the director field lines of the ensuing 3D skyrmion in the form of a double-twist torus become closed circles linked with each other (Fig. 1a, top right), with single windings around the circle in the interior of the torus (P = 1) and also around its axis of rotational symmetry (Q = 1) (Fig. 1b). The linking of circles of n (r)-loops in this 3D skyrmionic structure resembles that of 'fibres' in the famous mathematical Hopf fibration. Similar construction through looping different 2D skyrmions results in double-twist tori with multiple windings around the two axes and the mutually interlinked (P, Q) torus knots in n (r), resembling a more general class of mathematical Seifert fibrations, which include the Hopf fibration in a limited case of P = Q = 1. An example of a 3D skyrmion formed by a double-twist torus with linked (P, Q) = (2,3) trefoil knots is shown in the bottom-right of Fig. 1a, with two representative mutually linked knots of n (r)-loops shown in red and green colours. The 3D skyrmions with such (P, Q) knots are characterized by a non-zero Hopf charge C H = PQ and are commonly called 'hopfions'. They are theoretically predicted to exist in many fields of science, but convincing experimental demonstrations of their stability and direct detailed explorations of their structure remain elusive. Since the nematic ground-state manifold R P 2 is a sphere with antipodal points identified, these 3D skyrmions in CNLCs are labelled by elements of the third homotopy group, π 3 (R P 2) = Z. It is remarkable that CNLCs can host such skyrmions both as separate field configurations and when accompanied by various other defects and colloids. For example, these skyrmions form the basis of toronsin which the double-twist tori hosting (P, Q) knots of n (r) are accompanied by two self-compensating point or ring-shaped defects (Fig. 1c, d), often appearing to reduce the elastic and surface-anchoring free energies associated with matching the n (r) of such solitonic structures with the far-field director and weak or strong boundary conditions on confining surfaces of CNLC cells. The continuous knotted n (r) of the 3D skyrmions cannot be unknotted without energetically prohibitive 'cutting' of the n (r)-director field lines, giving rise to particle-like properties.

### 3D echocardiography: a review of the current status and future directions [^308a9fc0]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) size and function assessment with 3D echocardiography — scope and comparative considerations include that various 3D echocardiographic techniques have been used to evaluate RV and LV size and function in patients with congenital heart disease, the approach to the LV permits quantification of dimension, volume, mass, and ejection fraction, owing to the ellipsoidal shape of the LV the advantages of 3D over 2D techniques are limited whereas the RV's asymmetrical shape invalidates the simple geometric assumptions used for LV volume calculations, in this case the ability to record and analyze the entire chamber rather than relying on simplifying assumptions has been found to be superior, and in congenital heart disease that involve RV pathology, 3D echocardiography correlates well with MRI for the measurement of RV volume.

### Beaded metamaterials [^08055ef2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Next, we investigate the force to deform these beaded rings. In contrast to the previous experiment that examined thread friction through a fixed loop of beads, here the beads are free to slide as the planar ring is dilated by a spherical volume (shown in gray in the inset of Fig. 3 c). In Fig. 3 c, we report the force to press through a ring of n = 3, 4, and 5 beads under constant tension. After an initial, steep increase in force when making contact (point 1 in the figure), F gradually decreases to zero as the indenter aligns with the bead ring (point 2). Rescaling F by T 0, the data collapses into a single curve per thread type. We note that n does not affect F beyond geometric constraints (indenter-ring contact points are shown as dashed lines, see the "Methods" section). We use geometry to predict the response by performing a force balance across the indenter and a sample bead in the ring. We assume zero friction, constant tension throughout the network, and symmetric deformation as the ring is dilated. Despite these coarse assumptions, we find fair agreement with experimental results, where the prediction is slightly lower than the experimental data (white line in Fig. 3 c versus blue and green points). We correct this error by incorporating friction through Eq. (1) and the experimentally derived μ eff and find excellent agreement with experiments (blue and green lines for nitinol and nylon, respectively). Thus, we understand the deformation of a bead assembly near a free end: rigidity depends on the ability to prevent thread elongation by sliding, where deformation is mediated by the geometry of the network and the efficiency of load transfer across rigid contacts. Sliding also comes at the cost of capstan friction. To validate these claims, we can make a quantitative prediction of the maximum load supported by the shell initially introduced in Fig. 2. Here, we apply the geometric projection of Fig. 2 h such that θ 2 = 60° and α = 0 (see the "Methods" subsection "Dodecahedral shell ") and average capstan friction such that π < θ < 7 π /5 and 0.11 < μ < 0.26. We recover an equivalent scaling of the maximum load supported by the shell with no superjamming, i.e. ~10–20 times T 0, depending on the choice of thread.

### Measuring PET spatial resolution using a cylinder phantom positioned at an oblique angle [^ae7d9b95]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A cylinder phantom positioned at a slightly oblique angle with respect to the z -axis of a PET scanner allows for fine sampling of the edge-spread function. We show how this technique can be used to measure the spatial resolution that can be expected with clinical PET protocols, potentially providing more relevant estimates than are typically obtained with established experimental procedures. Methods: A 20-cm-diameter water-filled cylinder phantom containing a uniform 18 F solution was centrally positioned at a small angle with respect to the z -axis of a clinical PET/CT system. The oblique angle ensures that the phantom edge intersects the image matrix differently in different slices. Combining line profiles from multiple slices results in a composite profile with fine sampling. Spatial resolution was measured as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) by fitting a model to the finely sampled edge-spread functions in both radial and axial directions. The technique was validated by controlled modulation of image reconstruction parameters and by comparison with extended phantoms with fillable inserts. Separate experiments with uniform cylinders containing 18 F, 11 C, 13 N, 68 Ga, and 124 I were used to further assess the proposed method. Results: Controlled adjustment of a gaussian postreconstruction filter was accurately reflected in the measured FWHM values. Recovery coefficients derived using the cylinder FWHM values agreed closely with recovery coefficients derived from physical phantoms over a range of insert-to-background ratios, phantom geometries, and reconstruction protocols. The effect of increasing positron energy was clearly reflected in the FWHM values measured with different isotopes. Conclusion: A method has been developed for measuring the spatial resolution that is achieved with clinical PET protocols, providing more relevant estimates than are typically obtained with established procedures. The proposed method requires no special equipment and is versatile, being capable of measuring resolution for different isotopes as well as for different reconstruction protocols. The new technique promises to aid standardization of PET data acquisition by allowing a more informed selection of reconstruction parameters.

### The use of plots in orthopaedic literature [^95fed5f5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Plots are an elegant and effective way to represent data. At their best they encourage the reader and promote comprehension. A graphical representation can give a far more intuitive feel to the pattern of results in the study than a list of numerical data, or the result of a statistical calculation. The temptation to exaggerate differences or relationships between variables by using broken axes, overlaid axes, or inconsistent scaling between plots should be avoided. A plot should be self-explanatory and not complicated. It should make good use of the available space. The axes should be scaled appropriately and labelled with an appropriate dimension. Plots are recognised statistical methods of presenting data and usually require specialised statistical software to create them. The statistical analysis and methods to generate the plots are as important as the methodology of the study itself. The software, including dates and version numbers, as well as statistical tests should be appropriately referenced. Following some of the guidance provided in this article will enhance a manuscript.

### Brain midline approximation to improve symmetry analysis of brain CT scans [^d3638f9d]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of the symmetry of the brain hemispheres at the level of individual structures and dominant tissue features has been the subject of research for many years in the context of improving the effectiveness of imaging methods for the diagnosis of brain tumor, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease, among others. One useful approach is to reliably determine the midline of the brain, which allows comparative analysis of the hemispheres and uncovers information on symmetry/asymmetry in the relevant planes of, for example, CT scans. Therefore, an effective method that is robust to various geometric deformations, artifacts, varying noise characteristics, and natural anatomical variability is sought. This paper presents a novel method of estimating the midline of the brain. It is based on a comprehensive analysis of brain volume in two main steps. First, the images are reoriented. Using the matched ellipse, a head mask model is determined, the parameters of which are used to estimate the shape of the skull. Based on this, a precisely localized center line of the brain is created using 2D cross-correlation calculated on the edge images of successive scans. The algorithm developed has been validated, and the results obtained are competitive with the best reported achievements. The main advantages of the described method are high resistance to head tilt, simplicity of implementation, and high efficiency. The method can be used in a wide range of applications to support medical imaging diagnostics. The results obtained showed a 92.9% success rate and a mean error equal to 1.2 mm.

### 3D echocardiography: a review of the current status and future directions [^aa87994f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Three-dimensional echocardiography reconstruction — practical limitations of locator-based freehand acquisition and a mechanized alternative are outlined. The locator-based approach is described as having several practical limitations, including bulky acoustic spatial locators that make transducer manipulation difficult and the need for a clear, direct path to the transmitter; for electromagnetic systems, interference can occur from nearby ferromagnetic material. As an alternative to freehand scanning, a mechanized transducer can obtain serial images at set intervals in parallel or by pivoting around a fixed axis in a rotational, fanlike manner; because the intervals and angles between the 2D images are defined, a 3D coordinate system can be derived and the volume is more uniformly sampled than with freehand scanning. Figures illustrate left ventricular volume reconstructed from rotational images along a fixed apical axis and a matrix phased-array transducer with multiple elements arranged in a grid-like fashion.

Fig. 9
Projection direction correction workflow.

Procedure to cancel excessive displacements associated with the projection direction in a deformation field defined by the coefficients. a Representation of a deformation field with over-deformation along the X direction (projection direction). b The over-deformed volume and the associated deformation coefficients are rotated so that the projection direction matches the Z axis. At this point, it is possible to completely cancel the Z component on the rotated coefficients, as they only contribute to the over-deformation of the deformed map. This leads to the set of coefficients. c The modified coefficients are rotated back to the original position defined by the map's grid. In this way, a new set of coefficients(r) are obtained, defining a deformation field consistent along the projection direction (X axis).

Note that we also use a global regularization term in our optimization approach, as previously indicated, but it is global and does not differentiate among projection directions. In our experience, the previously stated "consistency principle" introduced by mathematically clear handling of the lack of information along individual projection directions is quite important factor in our quest for estimating deformation fields, and it represents a clear advantage of the Zernike3D approach.

### Large-volume multi-tined expandable RF ablation in pig livers: comparison of 2D and volumetric measurements of the ablation zone [^7aec4c20]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) measurements of ablation zones (AZs) related to the shaft of two different large-volume monopolar multi-tined expandable electrodes.

Methods

Percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation was performed in 12 pigs (81.6 ± 7.8 kg) using two electrodes (LeVeen 5 cm, Rita XL 5 cm; n = 6 in each group). Contrast-enhanced CT with the electrode shaft in place evaluated the AZ. The largest sphere centred on the electrode shaft within the AZ was calculated (1) based on the 2D axial CT image in the plane of the shaft assuming rotational symmetry of the AZ and (2) using prototype software and the 3D volume data of the AZ measured with CT.

Results

The mean largest diameter of a sphere centred on the electrode shaft was always smaller using the 3D data of the AZ than using 2D CT measurements assuming rotational symmetry of the AZ (3D vs 2D): LeVeen 18.2 ± 4.8 mm; 24.5 ± 3.1 mm; p = 0.001; Rita XL 20.0 ± 3.7 mm; 28.8 ± 4.9 mm; p = 0.0002. All AZ showed indentations around the tines.

Conclusions

Two-dimensional CT measurements assuming rotational symmetry of the AZ overestimate the largest ablated sphere centred on the electrode shaft compared with 3D CT measurements.

### Estimating conformational landscapes from cryo-EM particles by 3D zernike polynomials [^f79609e1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Ideally, the best solution to the previous problem would be to drive the optima search so that all particles are not deformed along their respective projection direction. For this reason, a sensible choice would be to completely restrict the deformation along the projection direction.

One possible way to achieve this is to include different regularization terms restricting excessive deformations. Nevertheless, it would be challenging to find the weights needed for each regularization term, especially along the projection direction, a situation that introduces a new parameter quite difficult to estimate in the process.

The Zernike3D method overcomes that obstacle by taking advantage of the properties of the basis to altogether remove any deformation along the projection direction defined by a particle, either during the optimization or after it. As we showed in ref. the Zernike3D basis is closed under rotations. Thus, it is possible to rotate the Zernike3D coefficients towards a different reference frame as follows:

being a rotation matrix. Therefore, it is possible to rotate the Zernike3D coefficients according to the angular information of the particle. For example, we can rotate the coefficients so that the Z direction of the new frame is effectively aligned with the projection direction of a particle. Then, we can cancel the rotated coefficients associated with the Z-axis in this new frame, as those only contribute to the deformation field along the projection direction.

However, it is essential to note that the previous property only holds in a continuous space. Hence, the basis is not closed under rotations due to the discretization and sampling of the space into voxels. Thus, the rotated coefficients cannot be applied to the volume, as the reference frames are entirely different. Instead, we can unrotate the modified Zernike3D coefficients, so their reference frame matches again with the reference map. Thus, it is possible to fully remove the deformation along the projection direction by combing all the previous steps, making all the deformation fields consistent, and avoiding solutions with unrealistic deformations. The whole procedure is summarized in Fig. 9.

FDG PET/CT modality overview — tracer properties, CT role, and clinical applications are summarized: The most commonly used tracer at present is the 18F-labelled glucose analogue FDG, and FDG accumulation in tissue is proportional to the amount of glucose utilisation, with increased consumption of glucose characteristic of most cancers and related to overexpression of GLUT transporters and increased hexokinase activity. CT uses a combined X-ray transmission source and detector system rotating around the subject to generate tomographic images and allows not only attenuation correction but also the visualisation of morphological and anatomical structures with high spatial resolution. FDG PET has been proven to be a sensitive imaging modality for detection, staging and therapy response assessment in oncology, and FDG PET/CT provides essential information for radiation treatment planning, helping with critical decisions when delineating tumour volumes.

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This "stack of disks" approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies — key disease and protein terms are defined as follows: Monoclonal gammopathy is "a condition in which monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins circulate in the blood", and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is "the most common category of monoclonal gammopathy, which is asymptomatic and requires no intervention in the vast majority of cases". Monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (M‑protein) are "immunoglobulin proteins produced by monoclonal plasma cells", and the M spike or M‑spike "refers to the narrow, isosceles triangle appearance of the monoclonal immunoglobulin protein seen on protein electrophoresis". Multiple myeloma is described as "a cancer of plasma cells" in which "multiple myeloma caused the plasma cells to accumulate in the bone marrow and crowd out the healthy blood cells". The free kappa/free lambda ratio is "the ratio of two types of immunoglobulin light chains (kappa and lambda) when not bound to immunoglobulin heavy chains" and "is used to assess risk of harboring a monoclonal protein and its likelihood for progression". Cross‑references indicate "M-component — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", "Monoclonal Protein — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", and "Paraproteins — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein". POEMS is a "rare multisystem disorder characterized by (P) polyneuropathy, (O) organomegaly, (E) endocrinopathy, (M) monoclonal gammopathy, and (S) skin abnormalities".

### Emergent tetratic order in crowded systems of rotationally asymmetric hard kite particles [^4fa695af]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

LPC-NPPs for understanding the emergent tetratic order

The kites of α = 90°, 99°, 103.5°, and 108° have no rotational symmetry but can form tetratic-ordered structures. Apparently, there is no direct correspondence between the symmetry of particle shape and the rotational symmetry of their assembled thermodynamic structures. What else would be critical properties of particles having different shapes in governing the rotational symmetry of structures that they thermodynamically assemble? In Penrose-kite systems (α = 144°), it has been shown that the local polymorphism of particles play a very important role in determining the structures of the condensed phase. So in order to address the above question, here we have generalized this local polymorphism method and examined the local polymorphic configurations of neighboring particle pairs (LPC-NPPs) for kites having more general α.

We first classify the possible LPC-NPPs of a kite shape into six types. As shown in Fig. 4 a, in type 1 and type 4, the contacting edges are the edges with α -dependent lengths, whereas in type 2 and type 5, the contacting edges are the edges with fixed length L. In type 3 and type 6, one of the contacting edges has length L, and the other has an α -dependent length. Since the contacting edges in this case are not matched for kites of α ≠ 72°, one particle can slide relative to the other along the contacting edges while keeping the contacting part maximized. For example, type 3–1 and type 3–2 are two configurations when one particle slides relative to the other so that the 72° vertex and the α vertex of one particle coincides with one of the non-72° and non- α vertices of the other particle, respectively. Similar for type 6–1 and type 6–2. Figure 4 b shows the calculated center–center distance l cc of each type of LPC-NPPs from Fig. 4 a.

### Summary: SNMMI / ACNM procedure standard for posttreatment imaging ofLu-based radiopharmaceuticals [^86fb957f]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Posttreatment 177Lu imaging — quantification, acquisition options, and clinical utility — is described as follows: SPECT/CT is strongly preferred over whole-body planar imaging. A dual-photopeak approach using both the 208- and 113-keV photopeaks is noted to allow reduced scan time, improved patient comfort, and potentially enhanced image quality, and MIRD Pamphlet No. 26 acknowledges this strategy if the number of counts collected in the 208-keV window is considered insufficient. For image filtering, light filtering (e.g., 3- to 4-mm gaussian) is often used to suppress noise without substantially affecting resolution, whereas stronger filtering (e.g., 6- to 8-mm gaussian) is commonly used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the chance of false-positives. To accurately convert SPECT-derived counts into activity, activity concentration, or SUVs (standardized uptake values), the system's sensitivity must first be measured, with widely accepted calibration methods including the planar point source method, the SPECT cylinder method, and the use of a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable source; calibrated images facilitate absorbed-dose assessments and the generation of SUV images for longitudinal assessments of tissue uptake, though partial-volume effects may significantly impact quantitative accuracy, particularly in small lesions. Clinically, in a retrospective analysis of 100 patients, 24-h posttreatment SPECT/CT changed patient management in 27% of patients receiving PRRT (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy), and posttreatment SPECT/CT after the first cycle of PRRT can serve as a new baseline tumor burden assessment when there is a long window from baseline SSTR PET/CT or in more aggressive tumors.

### Localized reconstruction of subunits from electron cryomicroscopy images of macromolecular complexes [^ad76789f]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

φ6 Polymerase complex data acquisition and processing

Processing was carried out essentially as described above for COPII and rotavirus triple-layered particles. Movies were aligned to account for specimen drift. Movie refinement in addition to particle-based motion correction and radiation damage weighting ('particle polishing') were performed in Relion following standard protocols. Polished particles were used for calculating the final icosahedrally averaged reconstruction.

All non-P2 components in the particle images were subtracted essentially as for rotavirus triple-layered particles (Fig. 3). First, a spherical mask (diameter 80 Å) defining roughly one incorrectly averaged P2 density under a threefold axis of symmetry in the icosahedrally averaged 3D reconstruction was defined and icosahedral symmetry was applied on the mask. Densities not within the mask were subtracted from the particle images using relion_project.

Twenty locations of sub-particles, each centred on a threefold axis of symmetry at a radius of 100 Å, were calculated for each particle. For each sub-particle, one of the three degenerate rotations around the symmetry axis was randomly chosen, so as to not bias the further processing. Sub-particles were classified in five classes using Relion. First, a localized reconstruction of the P2 sub-particle, where no symmetry was applied, was calculated and this was used as an initial template in the 3D classification. As above, a resolution limit of 12 Å was imposed during classification. No alignment was performed and no symmetry was applied. The sub-particles in three of the five classes revealing clear P2 density were combined in one reconstruction (after applying a rotation of 120° or 240° around the symmetry axis as necessary). To assess the resolution and B-factor of P2 in the final reconstruction, a mask defining P2 density was first created in UCSF Chimera by volume segmentation. Finally, the atomic structure of P2 (PDB:1HHS) was fitted into the P2 density in UCSF Chimera by volumetric cross correlation between the P2 density and a map simulated from the atomic structure at 7.9-Å resolution.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^ce0dffda]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Shown in Fig. 5a–f are eigenvectors (represented as deviations from the average 6 neighbour shape, located in the upper left corner) and their corresponding loading maps. The scree plot is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. The first eigenvector is the average, and the loading map shows the residual intensity of all six components. To visualize the higher eigenmodes, we plot them as deformation of the average, represented as vectors of deformation from the ideal lattice positions of the neighbours. We further note that these statistical normal modes do not have well defined physical meaning. Practically, they reveal spatial frequencies present in the image from which symmetry can be inferred, allowing the interpreter to ascribe a likely physical interpretation to some earlier PCA components. For example, the second eigenmode corresponds to the uniform shift of the coordinate sphere along one of the principal directions of the primitive hexagonal cell. In this case, the displacement of the entire nearest neighbour sphere is clearly equivalent to the displacement of the central atom in the opposite direction, a polar distortion. In a more general case, the vector sum of the shifts of the nearest neighbour atoms will determine whether the collective distortion being considered is polar or non-polar in nature (non-zero vector sum versus zero vector sum, respectively). The loading map reflects the previously reported antipolar structure characteristic of the M2 phase; interestingly, the antiphase boundary is not apparent on the loading map, suggesting that the antipolar structure is not altered by the presence of the boundary. The third eigenvector corresponds to a symmetric deformation of the neighbourhood similar to a shear mode. The corresponding map is almost uniform, but close examination shows that the contrast of the map exhibits the shift associated with the antiphase boundary, even though no contrast alteration is associated with the boundary itself. The fourth, fifth and sixth components are more difficult to interpret, as the distortions appear to be very complex. The fifth component is somewhat reminiscent of the rotational transformation of the third. Interestingly, the loading maps associated with the third and forth components show very clear contrast at the antiphase boundary, suggesting that these distortions might be characteristic of the frustrated environment of that defect. In contrast, the loading map for the fifth component, similarly to the second, shows no contrast shift at the antiphase boundary. Information of this type could be tremendously useful when determining polar character of different extended defects.

### Quantitative mappings between symmetry and topology in solids [^ce1ff365]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The study of spatial symmetries was accomplished during the last century and had greatly improved our understanding of the properties of solids. Nowadays, the symmetry data of any crystal can be readily extracted from standard first-principles calculation. On the other hand, the topological data (topological invariants), the defining quantities of nontrivial topological states, are in general considerably difficult to obtain, and this difficulty has critically slowed down the search for topological materials. Here we provide explicit and exhaustive mappings from symmetry data to topological data for arbitrary gapped band structure in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and any one of the 230 space groups. The mappings are completed using the theoretical tools of layer construction and symmetry-based indicators. With these results, finding topological invariants in any given gapped band structure reduces to a simple search in the mapping tables provided.

### Numerical simulation of double-wave vector experiments investigating diffusion in randomly oriented ellipsoidal pores [^3b8419dd]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Double-wave vector diffusion weighting is expected to represent a possibility to acquire information on cell size and shape. In numerical simulations, a theoretical description of the double wave vector-weighted signal is tested in a situation where the approximating assumptions (infinitely short gradient pulses, infinitely long diffusion time, infinitely long or zero delay between diffusion weightings, small gradient moment) are not strictly met. It is shown how the dependence of the signal on the angle between the diffusion gradient directions changes upon varying the delay between the second and the third gradient pulse, and how the measures of pore geometry derived from signal differences between two angles depend on the duration, temporal separation, and amplitude of the gradient pulses. The results indicate that a violation of the approximation conditions due to finite gradient pulse duration and separation generally leads to an underestimation of pore size and pore eccentricity. It is also concluded from the simulations that for pore sizes on the order of 10 microm the investigated effects are in a range that is observable even with whole-body gradient systems.

### Shifting beams at normal incidence via controlling momentum-space geometric phases [^c6fe26a3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Simulation results and discussion

To experimentally demonstrate the above approach of realizing lateral shifts, we scaled our design of the freestanding PhC slab to work in the near-infrared spectrum. The thickness t of the slab is chosen to be 100 nm, while the period of the etched array is a = 660 nm. The height h and baseline length w of the etched isosceles triangles are equal (h = w = 550 nm). All the parameters are freely chosen here only considering the ease of fabrication and changes will not affect the occurrence of the beam shifts. Fig. 2 a shows the calculated TE-like band of the structure along Γ-X and Γ-X′ directions (k y = 0 and k x = 0 respectively), where "TE" stands for transverse electric. The far-field polarization eigenstates of the radiative modes on the second TE-like band (TE 2) are shown in the form of polarization ellipses in Fig. 2 b. The red (blue) ellipses correspond to right-handed (left-handed) polarization states, and we marked out the circularly polarized points respectively with corresponding colored dots. It could be seen that the polarization structure and the normalized third Stokes parameters (S 3 / S 0) are mirror antisymmetric, and the major axes of the polarization ellipses are mostly horizonal. In other words, the normalized third Stokes parameter of the polarization eigenstates would change from negative to positive in the k x direction passing through a linearly polarized line (S 3 / S 0 = 0), while the normalized second Stokes parameter (S 2 / S 0) is kept near zero, as we expected. This polarization distribution is what we need to induce the momentum-space geometric phase gradients to the beam.

### Accuracy of left ventricular cavity volume and ejection fraction for conventional estimation methods and 3D surface fitting [^941b6109]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart Contour Segmentation and Surface Sampling

Error in contour segmentation and the errors in the subsequent volume estimation are dominated by inadequate contrast‐to‐noise ratio of the contour edges, partial volume effects, and inadequate sampling of a convoluted surface. When the slice thickness is large relative to the through‐plane radius of curvature, partial volume effects with black‐blood images will shift the apparent contour location inwardly relative to the true location in the center of the slice. This may partially explain the mismatch between the contours at the intersection of short‐axis and long‐axis slices, as evidenced in Figure 6, and may contribute to the consistent underestimation of LVV when using the Bloomgarden method on long‐axis slices. The magnitude of the mismatch between the short‐axis and long‐axis segmentation results and inherent noise can be quantified via the RMS error of 3D surface fitting where the RMS error converged to ≈3 mm at the highest‐order fits (Figure 8 A). LVV and LVEF errors in the clinic are expected to be higher than reported here for multiple reasons. First, an intracavity balloon with deuterated water gave high contrast between the cavity and myocardial tissue. Second, the 5‐mm slice‐thickness reduced partial volume effects relative to the 8‐ to 10‐mm thickness often used clinically with MRI. Third, the experimental setup eliminated motion artifacts caused by breathing and variations in beat‐to‐beat interval that can lead to image blurring and artifact. When extrapolating these results to other imaging modalities, particularly 2‐dimensional and 3D echocardiography, the errors inherent in the geometric assumptions are compounded by larger errors relative to MRI in delineation of the endocardial border and accounting for the full extent of the LV cavity. The effects of these border sampling errors contribute to the observed discrepancies on the order of 4% in estimates of LVEF, and 30% in end‐diastolic LV volume between MRI and 3D echocardiography acquired in the same hearts. 6, 12

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

### Quantification of shape variation of prostate and seminal vesicles during external beam radiotherapy [^7dccf3dd]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prostate is known to translate and rotate under influence of rectal filling changes and many studies have addressed the magnitude of these motions. However, prostate shape variations also have been reported. For image-guided radiotherapy, it is essential to know the relative magnitude of translations, rotations, and shape variation so that the most appropriate correction strategy can be chosen. However, no quantitative analysis of shape variation has been performed. It is, therefore, the purpose of this article to develop a method to determine shape variation of complex organs and apply it to determine shape variation during external beam radiotherapy of a GTV (gross tumor volume) consisting of prostate and seminal vesicles.

Methods and Materials

For this study, the data of 19 patients with prostate cancer were used. Each patient received a planning computed tomography (CT) scan and 8–12 (11 on average) repeat CT scans that were made during the course of conformal radiotherapy. One observer delineated the GTV in all scans, and volume variations were measured. After matching the GTVs for each patient for translation and rotation, a coverage probability matrix was constructed and the 50% isosurface was taken to determine the average GTV surface. Perpendicular distances between the average GTV and the individual GTVs were calculated for each point of the average GTV, and their variation was expressed in terms of local standard deviation (SD). The local SDs of the shape variation of all 19 patients were mapped onto a reference case by matching and morphing of the individual average GTVs. Repeated delineation of the GTV was done for 6 patients to determine intraobserver variation. Finally, the measured shape variation was corrected for intraobserver variation to estimate the "real" shape variation.

Results

No significant variations in GTV volume were observed. The measured shape variation (including delineation variation) was largest at the tip of the vesicles (SD = 2.0 mm), smallest at the left and right side of the prostate (SD = 1.0 mm), and average elsewhere (SD = 1.5 mm). At the left, right, and cranial sides of the prostate, the intraobserver variation was of the same order of magnitude as the measured shape variation; elsewhere it was smaller. However, the accuracy of the estimated SD for intraobserver variation was about half of the accuracy of the estimated SD for the measured shape variation, giving an overall uncertainty of maximum 0.6 mm SD in the estimate of the "real" shape variation. The "real" shape variation was small at the left, right, and cranial side of the prostate (SD < 0.5 mm) and between 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm elsewhere.

Conclusions

We developed a method to quantify shape variation of organs with a complex shape and applied it to a GTV consisting of prostate and seminal vesicles. Deformation of prostate and seminal vesicles during the course of radiotherapy is small (relative to organ motion). Therefore, it is a valid approximation in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer, in first order, to correct only for setup errors and organ motion. Prostate and seminal vesicles deformation can be considered as a second-order effect.

From the preprocessing, two files of interest were output from which all motion descriptors were derived (Figure 1). The first is eddy_movement_rms in which as described in the FSL documentation is "a summary of the 'total movement' in each volume is created by calculating the displacement of each voxel and then averaging the squares of those displacements across all intracerebral voxels. The file has two columns where the first contains the RMS movement relative to the first volume and the second column the RMS relative to the previous volume". Second is the eddy_parameters file, which is described as "… a text file with one row for each volume in [the image] and one column for each parameter. The first six columns correspond to subject movement starting with three translations followed by three rotations… " From these two files, derived measures included relative mean displacement (mm), translation in Left/Right, Posterior/Anterior, Interior/Superior directions (mm), and rotation around L/R, P/A, I/S axis (radians). All measures were derived per imaging volume, and were also normalized to scan duration (i.e. mean displacement per minute) (See Figure 1 for plots and exemplar derivations).

FIGURE 1
Derivation of head motion descriptors. All motion parameters were derived from output of FSL software's eddy algorithm: Eddy_movement_rms (top) and eddy_parameters (bottom) files. From eddy_movement_rms, the "mean relative movement per imaging volume" (units of mm/volume) was calculated as the mean of the relative RMS displacement. This measure can be normalized by total scan time to the "mean relative movement per minute" (units of mm/min). From eddy_parameters, measures of absolute translation and rotation are given with respect to the first imaging volume. To calculate the "mean translation per volume", we take the mean of the absolute values of differences from volume to volume (units of mm/vol). This is repeated for translation along x, y, and z axes, as well as rotation around L/R, P/A, and I/S axis (units of degrees/vol).
