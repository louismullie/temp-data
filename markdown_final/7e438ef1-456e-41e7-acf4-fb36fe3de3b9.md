## Question

What's the difference between morbid ideation and passive suicidal ideation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between morbid ideation and passive suicidal ideation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how authoritative sources define passive suicidal ideation. Then, I should verify how morbid ideation is used in the literature and whether it is treated as synonymous with passive ideation or as a broader umbrella. Next, I will compare their scope, phenomenology, and clinical implications. Finally, I will synthesize a clear distinction and note any exceptions or overlaps, especially in older adults and measurement contexts [^117KaAev] [^11653XKj].

> Let me first confirm the definition of passive suicidal ideation. The FDA's C-SSRS framework explicitly categorizes passive suicidal ideation as thoughts of death or a wish to be dead without any intent to act, distinguishing it from active ideation that involves method, intent, or planning, which anchors the standard clinical taxonomy used in trials and practice [^114zQhHK]. The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide and contemporary reviews similarly define passive ideation as a desire to die without suicidal intent, contrasting it with active ideation that includes thoughts of killing oneself, aligning with the C-SSRS schema [^113BRHeP]. Wait, let me verify the prevalence signal to ensure this is the construct clinicians actually encounter; meta-analytic data show passive ideation is common in the general population, reinforcing its clinical relevance even in the absence of intent [^113pTwTp].

> Now, I need to check how morbid ideation is used in the literature. Hold on, I should verify whether authors treat morbid ideation as synonymous with passive ideation or as a broader term. Several geriatric and clinical studies explicitly equate passive suicidal ideation with death ideation or morbid ideation, using phrases like "wishing to be dead", "life is not worth living", or "go to sleep and never wake up", which functionally overlap with passive ideation constructs in those samples [^117KaAev]. But wait, what if morbid ideation is broader than passive ideation in other contexts? Some epidemiologic and clinical studies use morbid ideation to encompass passive thoughts of death as well as related existential or nihilistic cognitions that may not always meet strict passive ideation thresholds, suggesting morbid ideation can be a wider umbrella that includes but is not limited to passive ideation [^notfound]. I should double-check that this broader usage is consistent with how instruments like the PHQ-9 item 9 and BDI-II item 9 capture "thoughts of death" or "life not worth living", which are often coded as passive ideation in practice even though they can reflect overlapping existential distress [^11653XKj] [^117KxErW].

> Let me consider the scope and phenomenology next. Passive suicidal ideation, as standardized by C-SSRS, is defined by the absence of intent or planning; it is a wish for death without actionable steps, which is why it sits at the milder end of the ideation spectrum in that framework [^114zQhHK]. Morbid ideation, in contrast, can denote a broader set of death-related thoughts that may include passive wishes but also existential dread, nihilism, or preoccupation with mortality, and in some studies it is used synonymously with passive ideation, particularly in late-life cohorts where "death ideation" is common [^117KaAev]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm that this synonymy is context-dependent and not universal across all populations or instruments, which the epidemiologic literature supports [^111NRa8p].

> I will now examine clinical implications and risk gradients. Passive ideation is associated with psychiatric comorbidity and suicide attempts, and its correlates often mirror those of active ideation, underscoring that it is not risk-free even without intent [^113pTwTp]. But wait, I should verify whether passive ideation alone carries the same near-term risk as active ideation; evidence suggests passive ideation is a marker of risk and can precede attempts, yet active ideation with method and intent confers higher imminent risk and is more tightly linked to the transition to action in ideation-to-action frameworks [^113BRHeP]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied passive ideation is benign; that would be misleading, as passive ideation clusters with burdensomeness, hopelessness, and loneliness and can signal elevated risk, especially when persistent or comorbid, even if it lacks intent at a given moment [^113pTwTp] [^115Eh5mL].

> Next, I should review measurement nuances that blur the boundary. The PHQ-9 item 9 and BDI-II item 9 capture "thoughts of death" or "life not worth living", which clinicians often interpret as passive ideation, yet their alignment with interview-based classifications is imperfect, reflecting heterogeneity in how "morbid" thoughts are endorsed and coded across self-report versus clinician-rated measures [^11653XKj] [^111NRa8p]. Hold on, I should verify whether this affects prevalence estimates; indeed, passive ideation prevalence varies by instrument and population, reinforcing that morbid/death ideation and passive ideation are overlapping but not identical constructs in practice [^113pTwTp].

> Let me synthesize the distinction, but I need to ensure I preserve the overlap. Passive suicidal ideation is a specific, C-SSRS-defined subtype of death-related thinking characterized by a wish to be dead without any intent or plan to act, whereas morbid ideation is a broader umbrella that includes passive ideation but may also encompass existential dread, nihilistic thoughts, and preoccupation with mortality that do not necessarily meet the strict "wish to be dead" phrasing or may lack the temporal stability implied by passive ideation in some frameworks [^114zQhHK]. In geriatric and some clinical contexts, authors often use morbid ideation and passive ideation interchangeably, but in general psychiatric usage, morbid ideation can be wider than passive ideation, so the relationship is asymmetric: all passive ideation is a form of morbid ideation, but not all morbid ideation qualifies as passive suicidal ideation [^117KaAev].

> I should confirm practical clinical implications. Because passive ideation lacks intent, assessment must explicitly probe for method, intent, and planning to avoid underestimating risk, and clinicians should remember that passive ideation can evolve toward active ideation, particularly under stressors like sleep disruption or heightened burdensomeness and hopelessness, so monitoring and safety planning remain indicated even when intent is absent at baseline [^114zQhHK] [^115dfhEw] [^115Eh5mL]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines support structured risk assessment rather than reliance on passive ideation alone; VA/DoD guidance emphasizes comprehensive, domain-based risk assessment and cautions against overreliance on any single tool or item, which fits with the need to distinguish passive from active ideation and contextual risk factors [^117WHxVc] [^116vm8La].

> Final check and conclusion: The most accurate way to frame this is that passive suicidal ideation is a specific, intent-absent wish for death construct embedded within the broader category of morbid ideation; in many studies — especially in older adults — the terms are used synonymously, but morbid ideation can also denote a wider set of death-related cognitions beyond passive wishes, so the relationship is inclusion rather than equivalence, and clinicians should clarify intent and planning during assessment to avoid misclassification [^114zQhHK] [^117KaAev].

Morbid ideation refers to **preoccupation with death or dying** without suicidal intent, whereas passive suicidal ideation involves a **desire to be dead or not wake up** without specific plans or intent to act [^114zQhHK]. Morbid ideation is **broader and less specific** than passive suicidal ideation, which is a **distinct subset** of suicidal thoughts that signals higher risk and warrants closer clinical attention [^113pTwTp] [^113BRHeP].

---

## Definitions and core distinctions

| **Attribute** | **Morbid ideation** | **Passive suicidal ideation** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Preoccupation with death, dying, or mortality without suicidal intent [^notfound] | Desire to be dead or not wake up without specific plans or intent to act [^114s2r2Q] |
| Intent | Absent | Absent |
| Specificity | General and nonspecific | Specific to death wish without action |
| Clinical risk | Lower than passive ideation | Higher than morbid ideation |

---

## Clinical examples

Morbid ideation includes thoughts such as "I wonder what it's like to be dead", "Life is meaningless", or "Everyone dies eventually", reflecting a general preoccupation with death without a wish to die. Passive suicidal ideation includes thoughts such as "I wish I were dead", "I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up", or "Life is not worth living", indicating a specific desire to be dead without intent or planning [^113BRHeP].

---

## Clinical implications and risk assessment

Morbid ideation is associated with lower risk than passive ideation and may reflect existential concerns, depression, or anxiety; it still warrants clinical attention, particularly if persistent or distressing. Passive suicidal ideation signals **higher risk** and is associated with increased suicide risk, psychiatric comorbidity, and functional impairment; it requires careful assessment, monitoring, and intervention [^113pTwTp] [^114s2r2Q].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and assessment tools

Morbid ideation is not a formal diagnostic category; clinicians assess it through clinical interviews and exploration of thoughts about death and mortality. Passive suicidal ideation is assessed with **validated tools** such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) [^114zQhHK] and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS), which distinguish passive from active ideation and guide risk stratification [^114YSbap].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Morbid ideation is managed with supportive psychotherapy, existential therapy, and treatment of underlying psychiatric conditions; regular monitoring is advised if ideation persists. Passive suicidal ideation is managed with **structured risk assessment**, safety planning, close monitoring, and targeted interventions — such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and pharmacotherapy — to address underlying psychiatric disorders and reduce risk [^111n9RDt] [^112r5FvX].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **Morbid ideation** | **Passive suicidal ideation** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | General preoccupation with death | Specific desire to be dead without intent |
| Intent | Absent | Absent |
| Specificity | Low | High |
| Clinical risk | Lower | Higher |
| Examples | - "Life is meaningless" <br/> - "Everyone dies" | - "I wish I were dead" <br/> - "I wish I wouldn't wake up" |
| Management | Supportive therapy and monitoring | Structured assessment and targeted interventions |

---

Morbid ideation reflects a general preoccupation with death without suicidal intent, whereas passive suicidal ideation denotes a specific desire to be dead without plans or intent; **passive ideation carries higher risk** and necessitates more intensive clinical attention and intervention [^112Vk3pB].

### Characterizing the phenomenology of passive suicidal ideation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of its prevalence, psychiatric comorbidity, correlates, and comparisons with active suicidal ideation [^113pTwTp]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Compared to active ideation, passive ideation remains relatively understudied and its clinical importance poorly defined. The weight that should be accorded passive ideation in clinical risk assessment is therefore unclear.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of passive ideation, its psychiatric comorbidity, associated sociodemographic characteristics, as well as psychological and environmental correlates. For reference, pooled effects were also calculated for direct comparisons of passive and active ideation with respect to potential correlates. Relevant articles published since inception to 9 September 2019 were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE and PsycINFO.

Results

A total of 86 studies were included in this review. The prevalence of passive ideation was high across sample types, ranging from 5.8% for 1-year prevalence to 10.6% for lifetime prevalence in the general population. Passive ideation was strongly associated with sexual minority status, psychiatric comorbidity, psychological characteristics implicated in risk, and suicide attempts. Preliminary evidence exists for a large association with suicide deaths. The effect sizes for individual correlates of passive and active ideation were largely equivalent and mostly non-significant in head-to-head comparisons.

Conclusions

Passive ideation is a prevalent clinical phenomenon associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity. Current evidence also suggests notable similarities exist between passive and active ideation in terms of psychiatric comorbidity and psychological and other characteristics traditionally associated with risk.

### Estimating risk for suicide attempt: are we asking the right questions? Passive suicidal ideation as a marker for suicidal behavior [^112Vk3pB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Desire for death is not generally considered a harbinger of more severe suicidal behavior and is not routinely included in suicide research and assessment interviews. We aimed to compare desire for death and suicidal ideation as clinical markers for suicide attempts.

Methods

Using data from two nationally representative surveys (n = 42,862 and n = 43,093 respectively), we examined whether desire for death predicts suicide attempts. We compared the odds ratio (OR) and "Number Needed to be Exposed for one additional person to be Harmed" [NNEH] for lifetime suicide attempts among those with desire for death but no suicidal ideation; those with suicidal ideation but no desire for death, and those with both desire for death and suicidal ideation, compared to those with neither desire for death nor suicidal ideation.

Results

The risk for lifetime suicide attempt was similar among those with lifetime desire for death with no suicidal ideation and those with lifetime suicidal ideation with no desire for death. Respondents with both lifetime desire for death and suicidal ideation had the highest risk for lifetime suicide attempts.

Limitations

Cross-sectional design and self-reported suicidal ideation/attempts are viewed as limitations of this study.

Conclusions

Querying individuals on desire for death has the same value as assessing suicidal ideation to examine risk for suicide attempt. A combination of desire for death and suicidal ideation is the best predictor for suicide attempts. This is of high clinical relevance since we suggest that desire for death should be included as a potential clinical marker of suicidality in clinical assessments.

### Why do adolescents attempt suicide? Insights from leading ideation-to-action suicide theories: a systematic review [^113BRHeP]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Terminology

Throughout the review, we use the term, psychiatric controls, to characterize individuals with psychiatric disorders but no lifetime history of suicidal ideation or attempts, ideators to describe individuals with current suicidal ideation and no history of attempts, and attempters to reflect individuals with a history of suicide attempt(s). Although not reflecting the heterogeneity of experience, these terms help improve readability and best reflect the typical groups examined in analyses. Additionally, to describe article sampling strategies, the term, community is used to describe participants sampled from the community, clinical, to describe participants recruited from inpatient and/or outpatient centers, and at-risk to characterize participants who met a current or lifetime threshold for suicidal ideation or other psychiatric illness or participants from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Several terms have been used differently across theories. When possible, use of the terms was consistent with each theory. For example, IPTS distinguishes passive suicidal ideation (e.g. I wish I was dead) from active suicidal ideation (e.g. I want to kill myself) and intent (e.g. suicidal plans, preparatory behaviors), whereas lethal and non-lethal attempts are considered suicidal behaviors. The IMV framework does not distinguish passive from active ideation; however, suicide intent is characterized by a motivation to carry out a suicidal behavior. Suicidal behavior includes suicide attempts and deaths. Similar to IPTS, the 3ST characterizes the severity of suicidal ideation, where moderate ideation is similar to passive suicidal ideation (e.g. I might be better off dead) and strong ideation is akin to active suicidal ideation (e.g. I would kill myself if I had the chance). Additionally, the 3ST defines action as suicide attempts but does not differentiate across the lethality of these attempts.

### A systematic review on passive sensing for the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^1117yWYY]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 700,000 people worldwide die by suicide every year. In the US, the number of suicide attempts is approximately 25 times higher than the number of deaths by suicide. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among young peopleand worryingly, rates are rising in this age group, with deaths by suicide increasing by over 45% among adolescents over the last 10 years in the US. The majority of transitions from suicidal ideation to behaviors occur within 12 months from onset.

Research efforts have been extensive in identifying risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, the prediction of STB remains a major challenge. There are several reasons for this. First, the base rate of STB, particularly suicide attempts and deaths, is low, making large sample sizes necessary for developing risk prediction models. Second, research has repeatedly focused on distal risk factors that have little predictive value for the timing of a suicide attempt. Third, the remarkable fluctuations in suicidal ideation, as observed in several studies based on ecological momentary assessment (EMA), exacerbate the problems around the prediction of STB. While initial suicidal thoughts often occur years before an attempt, the final steps towards attempts, including the final decision, are taken within days to minutes. Fourth, STB result from a complex interaction of various risk factors that is insufficiently understood –. These challenges are mirrored by the finding that clinicians' risk assessments cannot categorize their patients' risk states in clinically meaningful ways. In order to navigate these complexities, it has been suggested that research should focus on short-term risk prediction for STB instead of distal factors.

New and promising approaches have emerged for studying and potentially identifying shifts in risk states for STB in real-time, such as EMA using smartphone-based surveys and passive sensing. EMA requires active participation, which can potentially be burdensome for participants, especially during longer assessment periods. In contrast, passive sensing passively collects digital markers (e.g. geolocation, sleep parameter) via smartphones or wearable devices. A range of sensors can be used to capture a variety of data points, depending on the characteristics of a device. Predominantly, physiological (e.g. electrodermal activity), social (e.g. call logs, apps used), and behavioral (e.g. sleep duration) signals can be captured via sensors. Compared to questionnaires only capturing a certain moment in time, passive sensing allows an objective and continuous flow of data.

### Passive and active suicidal ideation in Swedish 85-year-olds: time trends 1986–2015 [^116791Kf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults have high suicide rates. We investigated potential time trends in the prevalence of passive and active suicidal ideation in 85-year-olds. Further, we examined factors associated with such ideation in this age group.

Methods

Population-based samples of 85-year-olds were interviewed in 1986 (N = 347), 2008 (N = 426) and 2015 (N = 320). Past-month passive/active suicidal ideation was evaluated with the Paykel questions.

Results

Reporting any type of passive or active suicidal ideation was less common in 2008 (7.3%, p < 0.001) and 2015 (7.2%, p < 0.001) compared to 1986 (16.4%). The change was driven by decreases in passive ideation. Passive/active suicidal ideation was associated with higher MADRS score (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.2, p < 0.001), institution residence (OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.7–8.9, p = 0.001) and feelings of loneliness (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4–5.2, p = 0.003). When stratified by sex, it was associated with institution residence (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.4–9.9, p = 0.008) and feelings of loneliness (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.4–6.3, p = 0.005) in women. In men, we observed a tenfold higher risk in those without partners (OR: 9.8, 95% CI: 2.9–33.5, p < 0.001).

Limitations

While differential three-year mortality was not observed in 1986, mortality was higher among non-participants in 2008 and 2015. This might have inflated cohort differences in passive/active suicidal ideation.

Conclusion

An initial decrease in the prevalence of passive/active suicidal ideation in 85-year-olds was observed but this positive trend did not persist. Results underline that preventive strategies targeting loneliness and focusing on institutional settings are needed, as are interventions for men without partners.

### Passive suicide ideation: an indicator of risk among older adults seeking aging services? [^117KaAev]. The Gerontologist (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study examines patterns of endorsements of active suicide ideation (SI), passive SI (synonymous with death ideation), and psychological distress (i.e., depressive and anxious symptomatology) in a sample of vulnerable older adults.

Methods

Data were collected via in-home interviews with aging services care management clients aged 60 years and older (n = 377). The Paykel scale for suicide measured the most severe level of suicidality over the past year, and the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) measured current passive/active SI. The remaining items from the PHQ (i.e. PHQ-8) and the Goldberg Anxiety scale measured distress.

Results

Latent class analysis revealed a four-class model: a group with mild distress and no active SI, a group with high distress and no ideation, a group with mild distress and both passive and active SI, and a group with high distress and both passive and active SI.

Discussion

Results indicate that passive SI rarely presents in vulnerable older adults in the absence of significant risk factors for suicide (i.e., psychological distress or active SI). Thus, the desire for death and the belief that life is not worth living do not appear to be normative in late life.

### Ecological momentary assessments and passive sensing in the prediction of short-term suicidal ideation in young adults [^111PSE4f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this prognostic study seeking to identify proximal predictors of suicidal thoughts following ED discharge, predictors derived from EMAs yielded the highest predictive accuracy, whereas passive predictors, alone or in combination with EMAs, had negligible predictive accuracy. Strongest predictors of next-day suicidal thoughts were related to prior suicidal ideation and encompassed different timescales. The fact that wearable devices did not outperform self-reporting in this and prior studies points to greater utility of EMAs in predicting short-term suicidal ideation, warranting additional examination in different samples. Additionally, these results have implications for developing decision rules, based on prediction algorithms, that guide the delivery of support in real time to prevent or ameliorate proximal risk for suicidal thoughts.

### Assessing suicidal ideation using a brief self-report measure [^111NRa8p]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Accurate assessment of suicidal thoughts is a challenge for researchers and clinicians. There is evidence that self-report and clinical interview assessment methods can result in different endorsement numbers when used to assess suicidal ideation. This study investigates endorsement rates and psychometric properties of a two-item self-report measure of suicidal ideation that distinguishes active from passive suicidal ideation, when compared with a clinical interview. Individuals presenting at an outpatient psychiatry clinic completed a measure of depression severity containing two items assessing passive and active suicidal ideation before undergoing a structured clinical interview. Self-report and clinical interview items demonstrated a low level of agreement. Self-report items were more strongly correlated with same-domain clinical interviewer ratings than different-domain ratings. These items demonstrated high negative predictive value and moderate-to-low positive predictive value for interviewer ratings. A two-item measure of suicidal ideation did not highly align with corresponding interviewer ratings, though such a measure may be useful in determining the absence of suicidal ideation, as well as distinguishing between passive and active suicidal ideation.

### The association of baseline suicidality with treatment outcome in psychotic depression [^116wDa1h]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between baseline suicidality and outcome of major depression in a randomized controlled trial of the pharmacotherapy of psychotic depression and to explore the interaction of suicidality, randomized treatment assignment, and depression outcome.

Methods

This study was a secondary analysis of data from 258 persons aged 18 years or older with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder with psychotic features who participated in a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing olanzapine plus sertraline with olanzapine plus placebo (the Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression [STOP-PD], which ran from 2002 to 2007). The independent variable was baseline suicidality, defined by 4 groups (suicide attempt in the current episode, active suicidal ideation, passive suicidal ideation, and no suicidality). The outcome variables were change in 16-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS₁₆) total score (excluding the suicide item) over time and remission of psychotic depression over time.

Results

Suicidality groups did not significantly differ on baseline HDRS₁₆ total score. Baseline suicidality group was significantly associated with change in HDRS₁₆ score over time in the sample as a whole (F₃,₁₃₉₄ = 8.17; P < .0001), but was not significantly associated with probability of remission over time. Among participants assigned to olanzapine and placebo, persons with no suicidality had a significantly greater reduction in HDRS₁₆ total score compared to those with passive suicidal ideation (7.5-point difference in change scores between the 2 groups; 95% CI, 4.3–10.7 t₁₃₉₄ = 4.61, P < .0001), active suicidal ideation (4.4 points; 95% CI, 1.4–7.4; t₁₃₉₄ = 2.85, P = .0176), or suicide attempts (6.1 points; 95% CI, 2.8–9.4; t₁₃₉₄ = 3.66, P = .0015). The 12-week change from baseline in HDRS₁₆ score for patients with no suicidality was not significantly different between the 2 treatment arms. However, the 12-week HDRS₁₆ improvement was significantly greater in the olanzapine plus sertraline arm, compared with the olanzapine plus placebo arm, for patients with suicide attempts (8.7-point difference in change scores between the 2 groups; 95% CI, 5.1–12.4; t₁₃₉₄ = 4.75, P < .0001), active suicidal ideation (8.1 points; 95% CI, 4.5–11.7; t₁₃₉₄ = 4.38, P < .0001), or passive suicidal ideation (5.7 points; 95% CI, 2.2–9.2; t₁₃₉₄ = 3.23, P = .0012), respectively.

Conclusions

Baseline suicidality predicted worse acute treatment outcome of psychotic depression. However, participants with suicidality had a better outcome when treated with the combination of olanzapine and sertraline than when treated with olanzapine plus placebo.

### Suicidal ideation and risk levels among primary care patients with uncomplicated depression [^112GQq35]. Annals of Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the prevalence, severity, and course of passive and active suicidal ideation occurring in primary care patients with an uncomplicated depressive disorder.

Methods

We studied suicidal ideation experienced by patients recruited in 60 primary care practices participating in a randomized controlled trial of depression management. Risk levels associated with suicidal ideation and plans were determined by a 2-stage procedure using pertinent items of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-20, and the Cornell structured assessment interview and management algorithm.

Results

Of the 761 patients whom physicians judged in need of treatment for a clinical depression, 405 (53%) were experiencing uncomplicated dysthymia, major depression, or both. Among these depressed patients, about 90% had no risk or a low risk of self-harm based on the presence and nature of suicidal ideation; the rest had an intermediate risk. Almost all patients who were initially classified at the no or low risk levels remained at these levels during the subsequent 6 months. The incidence of suicidal ideation at a risk level requiring the physician's immediate attention in this no- or low-risk subgroup was 1.1% at 3 months and 2.6% at 6 months.

Conclusions

Almost all patients with uncomplicated dysthymia, major depression, or both acknowledging suicidal ideation of the minimal risk type when initially assessed maintained this minimal risk status during the subsequent 6 months.

### Passive vs active nighttime smartphone use as markers of next-day suicide risk [^113FUbn5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the timing and type (passive vs active) of nighttime smartphone use associated with next-day suicidal ideation and suicide planning in high-risk adults?

Findings

In this study combining surveys and passive data collection in 79 adults with recent suicidal thoughts, late-night phone use (11:00to 1:00) was associated with higher next-day suicide risk, while keyboard-based activity during middle-night hours (1:00 to 5:00) was associated with lower risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that specific usage patterns of nighttime smartphone use may be a more important focus for future suicide prevention interventions than total screen time.

### Passive suicide ideation in major depressive disorder: prognostic role and effect of antidepressant treatment [^114s2r2Q]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Passive suicidal ideation (PSI)-defined as the desire to die without any intent to act-is a relatively understudied phenomenon. This study investigated its prognostic role in major depressive disorder (MDD) and its evolution during antidepressant treatment.

Methods

A total of 482 outpatients (30% male; mean age = 43.14 ± 12.46 years) from the CO-MED trial were included. Clinical evaluations were conducted at baseline and again after 6 weeks, assessing depressive and hypomanic symptoms, comorbid anxiety, and childhood trauma. PSI was measured using four targeted items from the Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report scale (CHRT_PSI; score range 0–16). To distinguish PSI from related depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, a conservative threshold (CHRT_PSI ≥ 5) was used when analyzing clinical features and treatment response. A broader, more sensitive threshold (CHRT_PSI ≥ 4) was applied when evaluating PSI's predictive accuracy for suicidal behavior.

Results

Compared to patients without PSI, those in the PSI group (n = 283; 59%) exhibited more severe depressive symptoms, higher rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, and more childhood traumas, including both physical and emotional abuse. While PSI showed modest overall accuracy (37%-46%) in predicting suicidal behavior, its sensitivity (66%-85%) and negative predictive value (78%-89%) were good. PSI was also a significant predictor of response to antidepressants, an effect that remained robust even after adjusting for age, sex, depression severity, and history of childhood maltreatment. Among the 270 PSI patients who completed 6 weeks of treatment, 96 achieved remission from PSI. Insomnia and anhedonia were associated with poorer outcomes, while talkativeness was linked to a higher likelihood of remission.

Conclusion

PSI is common in individuals with MDD and is associated with a worse prognosis. Insomnia may act as a barrier to PSI remission during treatment.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^115okeUq]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Passive ideation was prospectively predicted by increased hopelessness and acquired capability. Using EMA data, only one previous study has highlighted hopelessness as a prospective predictor of ideation: among psychiatric inpatients, hopelessness predicted both passive and active ideation within-day (Hallensleben et al.). Meanwhile, others did not establish hopelessness as a prospective (short-term) predictor of ideation (Czyz et al; Kleiman et al.). However, of note is that both studies examined active ideation only. Our findings therefore add to this literature by demonstrating that hopelessness may be uniquely associated with passive suicidal ideation. We propose that the different operationalization of suicidal ideation in prior studies may partly explain the contradictory findings.

Acquired capability also prospectively predicted increased passive ideation, which in turn predicted active ideation. It may be expected that a passive lack of will to live or a wish to die will over time develop into more concrete thoughts about death and/or suicide (Van Orden et al.). Our findings illustrate that this transition may occur relatively quickly (in approx. 4 h), although it is important to note that our sample was composed of individuals with a long-term (months, years) history of suicidal ideation. Hence, it is unlikely that someone experiencing first-time passive ideation would progress to active ideation so rapidly, but rather our data reflects moment-to-moment changes in individuals who are already familiar with suicidal states.

### A systematic review on passive sensing for the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^111BWmQA]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, it is crucial to prioritize the valid and reliable assessment of STB. Single-item measures, as frequently used in the reviewed studies, may not have sufficient psychometric properties. In addition, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors should be differentiated (e.g. the subscales of the CSSR-S) instead of using a composite score including both of them, as they are likely to have different risk trajectories. Furthermore, most studies have assessed STB at single time points. Given the high fluctuations in STB, it might be fruitful to additionally investigate the short-term prediction by assessing these outcomes using EMA.

Third, research on passive sensing in the context of STB should consider different application settings and target groups. Target groups identified in this review included acutely suicidal patients, patients with a history of STB, groups at risk of developing STB (i.e. people in mental health treatment, or medical interns,), as well as the general population. Each application area presents unique challenges. The short-term prediction of STB within individuals with acute STB seems promising both clinically and methodologically. Clinically, intensive monitoring is desirable in this vulnerable target group, while methodologically, a high frequency of time points with STB is necessary for developing predictive algorithms. Developing algorithms for predicting suicide attempts might however prove challenging because of the low rates of occurrence of this outcome and the low signal-to-noise ratio of passive sensing data. Transfer-learning on models initially developed for a different but closely related source domainmight be one of the possible workarounds to this methodological hurdle. Another application area of passive sensing could be universal screening for STB; again, studies should address sample imbalance in samples from the general population. Another aspect to consider in the application setting is the use of passive sensing variables as the sole predictors versus combining them with EMA data for predicting STB. Passive data alone might be especially useful for longer monitoring periods due to the low participant effort, but it remains unclear whether passive data alone has sufficient predictive value. Combining EMA and passive sensing holds promise for the longitudinal prediction of STB, making use of the advantages of both assessment strategies, including additional data such as nonresponseor response latency to questionnaire items. Regarding the choice of devices for assessing predictors, it is important to consider their real-world applicability in different settings. Participants from the general population seem more willing to share actively assessed data compared to passive smartphone usage data; however, this might not generalize to indicated or selective prevention, such as risk monitoring in individuals with acute suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt. Furthermore, the applicability of passive monitoring may be influenced by the availability of devices (i.e. higher availability of smartphones compared with wearables), requiring a balance between data quality and scalability. It is crucial to further consider the applicability of passive monitoring for STB beyond research settings, particularly with regards to how an individual's awareness of STB monitoring via passive devices could influence behaviors in ways that would affect the reliability of risk detection in real-world settings.

### Genetic and other risk factors for suicidal ideation and the relationship with depression [^113u7NEz]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Data are presented for 5922 participants. Reported lifetime ever suicidal ideation was 13.0% (11.7–14.3) for men and 21.8% (20.3–23.2) for women. Overall 6.2% (CI 5.6–6.9) had experienced active ideation, and 11.5% (CI 10.7–12.4) reported passive ideation only (Table 1). Adjusting only for age, owing to the difference in mean age between twins and non-twins in the study, there was no significant difference in prevalence of any suicidal ideation (twins 16.9%, CI 15.6–18.2, non-twins 19.4%, CI 17.7–21.1, p = 0.51).

Table 1.
Socio-demographic factors associated with suicidal ideation

Socio-demographic factors

Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with female sex, being widowed, separated or divorced and low educational attainment (Table 1). Active ideation was most common amongst 30–44 year olds, whereas passive ideation became more prevalent with increasing age. Ethnicity was not associated with 'any suicidal ideation', but being Muslim was a protective factor with regard to active ideation. Urban living was associated with passive ideation.

Social circumstances

Parental loss as a child, one or more life events, under-employment (working 2–10 months in the previous 12 months) and having a low standard of living were uniformly associated with all types of suicidal ideation (Table 2).

Table 2.
Environmental exposures, psychiatric symptoms and behaviours associated with suicidal ideation

Psychiatric symptoms and behaviours

There were robust associations between all types of suicidal ideation and depression, abnormal fatigue and alcohol abuse (Table 2). Depression was more strongly associated with active than passive ideation.

Alcohol use (excluding alcohol abuse) was not associated with suicidal ideation; whereas alcohol abuse was associated with all types of suicidal ideation. Tobacco use was associated with active but not passive suicidal ideation. Alcohol abuse was identified solely in males: 9.2% of men abused alcohol. A very low proportion (3.7%) of women used alcohol compared with 63.1% of men, and only 2.0% of women used tobacco compared with 38.4% of men.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^113z48wb]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We observed differential associations of risk factors with passive and active suicidal ideation and acquired capability. Hopelessness, loneliness, and burdensomeness were uniquely associated with passive but not active suicidal ideation, and shame with active suicidal ideation and acquired capability. Overall, our findings illustrate how ecological momentary assessment and network analysis may be used to better understand and visualize the cognitive-affective landscape from which suicidal ideation may emerge in real time. Future research using real-time assessments should aim to further distinguish the various risk and protective factors that may differentially characterize passive, active ideation, and acquired capability outcomes. A clinical implication of our findings is that targeting shame may be especially relevant for suicide prevention, considering its unique contribution to explaining not only short-term increases in active suicidal ideation but also the preparedness for suicidal acts.

### A longitudinal test of the predictions of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behaviour for passive and active suicidal ideation in a large community-based cohort [^113YY2Ui]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) aims to elucidate the key antecedents of suicide deaths. Limited research has tested the IPTS in a community setting, and very little longitudinal research has been conducted. The current study longitudinally tested the predictions of the IPTS for suicidal ideation in a large population-based sample.

Methods

The PATH through Life study assesses three age cohorts (20's, 40's, 60's) every four years. Two interpersonal factors were estimated at the third wave of assessment: thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB). The roles of these factors in suicide ideation (active and passive) four years later were estimated using logistic regression models (n = 4545).

Results

A one SD increase in TB was associated with increased odds of 37% for passive ideation and 24% for active ideation. For PB, odds were increased 2.5-fold for passive ideation and 2.4-fold for active ideation. A significant negative PB × TB interaction was found for passive but not active ideation. Effects were not consistent by age group or gender.

Limitations

Proxy measures were used to assess the constructs. The extended timeframe and low prevalence of suicidal ideation limited power to find effects within subgroups.

Conclusions

Although TB and PB were individually associated with suicidal thoughts, little evidence was found for the key predictions of the IPTS longitudinally. Further investigation of the dynamic interplay between interpersonal factors over time is needed.

### Bimekizumab (Bimzelx) [^1115aa8B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: The study populations of Trial Ps-1, Trial Ps-2, Trial Ps-3 and Trial Ps-4 excluded subjects with active suicidal ideation, suicidal ideation within the month prior to screening, a history of suicide attempt within the past 5 years prior to screening, or moderately severe to severe major depression (i.e., score of ≥ 15 on the screening Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)).

Analysis of pooled C-SSRS data from the first 16 weeks of placebo-controlled clinical trials indicated that 12/670 (1.8%) BIMZELX-treated subjects and 1/169 (0.6%) subjects receiving placebo reported passive suicidal ideation with an estimated relative risk of 3.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 22.74). Subjects without a prior history of SI/B treated with BIMZELX also reported a higher rate of new onset suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS than subjects receiving placebo (1.3% vs 0.6%).

During the course of the clinical trials for plaque psoriasis, there was 1 completed suicide in the open label extension trial after 718 days of treatment (1/2,480; 0.01/100 patient-years). The completed suicide was reported in a subject without a past reported psychiatric history. There were also 3 suicide attempts (3/2,480; 0.04/100 patient-years); 2 of these subjects had a history of prior suicide attempts.

### Genetic and other risk factors for suicidal ideation and the relationship with depression [^116mKeCk]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Measures

Assessment of lifetime-ever suicidal ideation included two items indexing passive ideation ('have you felt there is no point in living anymore'; 'have you felt that dying is better than living') and one indexing active ideation ('have you thought of committing suicide'). From these items, binary variables were created indicating a positive response to 'active ideation', 'passive ideation' (without active ideation), or 'any suicidal ideation'.

We used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (Robins et al.), because it is a diagnostic interview for use by lay-interviewers. Our definition of lifetime-ever depression was slightly less stringent than conventional DSM-IV criteria for a depressive episode (APA,): we ignored the bereavement criterion and the opt-out due to mixed states. We also disregarded the requirement for functional impairment, because it is considered less valid in this population, and the characteristics of the phenotype were very similar with or without this requirement (Ball et al.). The CIDI was also used to index tobacco and alcohol use and abuse. Lifetime ever tobacco use was measured as daily use for 1 month or more of cigarettes, cigars, a pipe, snuff or chewed tobacco. Lifetime consumption of at least 12 alcoholic drinks was considered alcohol use. Alcohol abuse was defined as a maladaptive pattern of drinking leading to clinically significant impairment, manifested by one or more of the following: failure to fulfil major role obligations at work/school/home; use when a physical hazard; use-related legal problems; use despite social/interpersonal problems due to alcohol.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^113CRijN]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Passive suicidal ideation

Momentary passive suicidal ideation correlated with sadness, hopelessness, loneliness, and burdensomeness, in line with prior literature (Armey et al; Czyz et al; Hallensleben et al; Husky et al; Kleiman et al.). It has previously been shown that perceived burdensomeness associated only with passive and not active suicidal ideation (Hallensleben et al.). Here, we found all three constructs of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS; Van Orden et al.) (i.e. hopelessness, loneliness, and burdensomeness) to associate only with passive, but not active, ideation. Passive suicidal ideation was also associated with reduced happiness, calmness, and optimism, in line with prior reports of decreased positive affect (and happiness specifically) relating to momentary suicidal ideation (Husky et al; Rath et al.). Our findings add to this literature by demonstrating concurrent, negative associations with another facet of positive affect: calmness. Indeed, retrospective reports by clinicians and family members have long described that individuals often appear agitated in the days preceding suicide (Sani et al.). In line with our findings on momentary optimism, another study previously found positive thinking-based coping to decrease suicidal ideation in daily life (Stanley et al.).

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^111yTHyL]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Active suicidal ideation

Active ideation was concurrently associated only with sadness and shame (excluding the triadic associations between passive and active ideation, and acquired capability). Shame is specifically associated with the lethality of suicide attempts (Van Orden et al.), which may explain its unique association with active suicide ideation. Further, shame is closely related to other forms of (non-suicidal) self-harm (Sheehy et al.). This is proposed to result from the strong overlap between shame, self-hatred and the need to punish oneself (Sheehy et al.) – or perhaps in the case of suicidal behavior, to completely eliminate oneself.

Somewhat paradoxically, active ideation also prospectively predicted increased happiness and optimism. This is in contrast to our findings on passive ideation and acquired capability, which were followed by negative mood consequences. We speculate that this pattern simply reflects the passing of a suicidal crisis leading to feelings of relief. However, others reporting similar findings propose that some people engage in suicidal thinking as a way of regulating their affect, and hence experience suicidal thoughts as comforting (Kleiman et al.). While a subset of patients does report comfort from ideation (Crane et al.), most people describe their suicidal thoughts as distressing, as also demonstrated by a previous EMA study which found increased negative affect following instances of suicidal thinking (Al-Dajani & Uliaszek). However, in case suicidal thinking does serve this relief function, it appears that it is active, rather than passive suicidal ideation that produces this effect. This finding also fits within the framework of suicide representing an escape from psychological pain (Baumeister).

### Passive vs active nighttime smartphone use as markers of next-day suicide risk [^115UWEQw]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Nighttime represents a high-risk period for suicidal thoughts, yet current understanding of how digital technology use during these hours influences suicide risk remains limited. Distinguishing between passive consumption and active engagement may inform the future development of targeted suicide intervention efforts.

Objective

To examine whether the timing and type (passive vs active) of nighttime smartphone use are associated with next-day suicidal ideation and suicide planning in adults at a high risk of suicide.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This survey and passive data sensing study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and smartphone screenshots collected every 5 seconds during active phone use over 28 days per participant. Data were collected from August 24, 2022, to January 9, 2024. The community-based sample included adults aged 18 years or older with past-month suicidal thoughts or behaviors from South Bend, Indiana, and the surrounding area. Inclusion criteria were smartphone ownership and variability in key variables across the 28-day period.

Exposure

Timing and type of nighttime smartphone use were assessed in 3 ways: (1) maximum phone-free interval (8:00 pm to 10:00 am), (2) use during self-reported sleep windows, and (3) hourly use (11:00 pm to 8:00 am). Keyboard presence, detected via a deep learning model trained on 1000 manually annotated screenshots, served as a proxy for active engagement.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were next-day passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, and suicide planning assessed via EMA (6 prompts daily). Bayesian multilevel models tested within-person and between-person associations.

Results

The study enrolled 79 participants (mean [SD] age,35.2 [11.1] years; 54 female [68.3%]). The overall EMA compliance rate was 68.8%, and participants generated 7.5 million screenshots (of which 1.05 million [14.0%] showed keyboard presence). Late-night (11:00 pm to 1:00 am) phone use was consistently associated with higher next-day passive or active suicidal ideation and suicide planning. Participants with 7- to 9-hour phone-free gaps showed the lowest suicidal ideation compared with those with 4- to 7-hour phone gaps (B = 0.35; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.14–0.55). Keyboard activity was associated with lower suicidal ideation when occurring during middle-night hours (1:00 to 5:00 am) (simple slope,-0.10; 95% CrI,-0.13 to -0.07), self-reported sleep windows for both passive (B = -0.14; 95% CrI,-0.24 to -0.02) and active (B = -0.13; 95% CrI, -0.24 to -0.02) suicidal ideation, and nonsleep periods for both passive (B = -0.16; 95% CrI,-0.29 to -0.03) and active (B = -0.12; 95% CrI = -0.24 to -0.001) suicidal ideation. These timing-dependent, within-person associations were independent of total usage.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found temporally specific associations between nighttime smartphone use and next-day suicidal ideation and suicide planning. Late-night use signaled vulnerability, while middle-night active engagement seemed protective. These findings differentiate harmful passive consumption from potentially adaptive digital coping, potentially serving to advance precision approaches to suicide prevention.

### Daily sleepiness magnifies the relation between same-day passive and active suicide ideation [^115dfhEw]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Disrupted sleep has been linked to suicidal thoughts and behavior. Less is known, however, about the underlying mechanisms of this relationship. A more nuanced understanding of the link between sleep and suicide may help inform treatment decisions and the development of prevention and intervention strategies. The present study examined daily average sleepiness as a moderator to the relation between same-day passive and active suicide ideation (SI). Fifty-nine young adults (mean age = 21.04; SD = 2.22) endorsing SI at least twice in the two weeks prior to baseline completed 3–5 daily surveys of sleepiness and SI over 2 weeks as part of a broader study. Across several indicators of sleepiness (desire to stay awake, desire to fall asleep), passive SI (desire to die, desire to live), and active SI (occurrence, intensity, duration, and controllability), the overall findings demonstrated that daily average sleepiness magnified the relation between same-day passive SI and active SI severity. These findings indicate that being sleepier than usual may increase the likelihood that passive SI transitions to active SI. Future research is needed to test the causal influence of sleepiness on this transition.

### Psychosocial dynamics of suicidality and nonsuicidal self-injury: a digital linguistic perspective [^111WTebW]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

To conceptualise our work, NSSI is defined broadly as an intentional act of causing oneself physical harm without suicidal intent; this can include direct NSSI behaviours (i.e. deliberate acts that cause physical damage to body tissue), such as cutting, burning, and hitting oneself, as well as indirect NSSI (i.e. behaviors that damage the body but do not involve the direct and deliberate destruction of body tissue), such as substance abuse and otherwise risky behaviours (e.g. dangerous driving; unsafe sex). By contrast, suicidality reflects a spectrum of suicide-relevant psychosocial processes — both active and passive in nature — including cognitive processes like suicidal ideation (i.e. thoughts about suicide), affective dynamics related to suicide (e.g. feelings of not wanting to be alive), and suicidal behaviours, such as preparing and attempting suicide. Due to the far-reaching, naturalistic, person-centred approach to our work, and given that our goal is to better understand self-harm in the broadest sense, the adoption of flexible self-harm terminology — for example, "direct" and "indirect" NSSI as well as "active" and "passive" suicidality — is warranted. The use of flexible and inclusive definitions of self-harm permits the individuals covered by our study to define self-harm, and their experiences with it, in their own words, allowing us to investigate these phenomena in a more ecologically valid, individualised way. Vitally, our use of flexible, person-centred definitions of self-harm ensures that our analyses do not place artificial boundaries on what qualifies as self-harm.

### Suicidal depressed patients respond less well to antidepressants in the short term [^114QXCDw]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Suicidal thoughts and behaviors could be associated to a poor response to antidepressant treatment, but the exclusion of suicidal patients from randomized clinical trials restricts the available knowledge. In this study, we aimed at defining more precisely the response to antidepressants among suicidal patients and the threshold of suicidality that best predicts a poor response.

Method

We investigated the short-term response to a new antidepressant treatment of 4,041 depressed outpatients depending on their suicidal status (passive or active suicidal ideation (SI), history of suicide attempts [SAs]), either self-rated or clinician-rated. Depression outcomes, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and remission rates were compared depending on suicidal status at baseline using logistic regression models.

Results

Using either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to measure SI, we found that suicidal patients were less likely to improve or attain remission, but not more likely to worsen, than nonsuicidal patients. In the multivariate analyses, SI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18–1.65) and a history of SA (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.16–1.66) were the best predictors of nonremission, independently of the class of antidepressant treatment.

Conclusion

Antidepressant treatment seems to be less effective among those patients that need it most. Clinical trials including suicidal patients are needed to investigate specific treatment options.

### Genetic and other risk factors for suicidal ideation and the relationship with depression [^114rJhp4]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Table 3.
Genetic model fit statistics for 'any suicidal ideation'

Table 4.
Percentage of variance in 'any suicidal ideation' explained by ACDE

The tetrachoric correlation for DZ opposite sex pairs was 0.31. This is mid-way between the figure for all-male and all-female DZ pairs, suggesting that sex differences are quantitative rather than qualitative (i.e. the same individual aetiological factors affect men and women, but to different degrees). We were able to calculate the tetrachoric correlations separately for active and passive ideation among women. These correlations (active ideation MZ 0.52, DZ 0.39; passive ideation MZ 0.46, DZ 0.34) were similar to those for 'any suicidal ideation'.

The heritability of suicidal ideation that is independent of depression

Model 1 (Table 5) shows significant association between ideation in the proband (twin 1) with the co-twin (twin 2), showing that familial factors (i.e.g.enetic, A, or shared-family environmental factors, C), contribute to suicidal ideation. Model 2 shows that there is still a familial contribution to suicidal ideation after controlling for the familial effect of depression. The effect of zygosity is significant in Model 2, showing there is a genetic contribution to suicidal ideation that is independent of the heritability of depression. However, when analysed separately by gender, this was statistically significant in men only. This suggests that amongst women, the genetic component of suicidal ideation (Table 4) is largely mediated through depression.

Table 5.
Cross-twin logistic regression to examine the heritability of ideation independent of the heritability of depression

Models 3 and 4 of Table 5 show that, in men, the heritable contribution to suicidal ideation is independent from any heritable contribution to alcohol abuse, as well as being independent from any heritable contribution to depression.

### A systematic review on passive sensing for the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^113noVT1]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Several viewpoint articles have delineated promises and challenges associated with the application of passive sensing within the field of suicide prevention. Nonetheless, a systematic review of the current state of research remains absent. Against this backdrop, we aimed to systematically synthesize the current evidence on passive sensing for the prediction of STB. This review encompassed the exploration of three core facets: (1) the potential of passive sensing data to enhance STB prediction, (2) the discriminative efficacy of various sensor types, and (3) an examination of the statistical analysis methodologies documented in the literature. Additionally, we synthesized findings pertaining to the feasibility of employing passive sensing for the assessment of STB.

### Genetic and other risk factors for suicidal ideation and the relationship with depression [^1144NVot]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The moderate degree of heritability of suicidal ideation in this twin study in Sri Lanka was similar to estimates made for any suicidal behaviour (ideation or attempts) or completed suicides from other population-based epidemiological twin studies conducted in different parts of the world. Twin/non-twin status was associated with neither passive nor active suicidal ideation, supporting generalizability of the findings to the general population. In addition to deepening the understanding of heritable components to suicidal ideation, what is apparent is that social adversity (life events, marital breakup and socio-economic disadvantage) are important environmental risk factors. which act independently from genetic risk.

### Health conditions and passive suicidal ideation in the survey of health, ageing, and retirement in Europe [^115AWQQ7]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the associations between health conditions and passive suicidal ideation in middle-aged and older adults.

Method

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on data from 35,664 middle-aged and older adults from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe. Mediation analyses were also conducted to test the roles of disability and depression in risk of ideation.

Results

After including demographic variables, disability, depression, and other health conditions as covariates, heart attack, diabetes/high blood sugar, chronic lung disease, arthritis, ulcer, and hip/femoral fractures were associated with increased odds of passive suicidal ideation. When grouped by organ systems, conditions affecting the endocrine, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems were associated with increased odds of passive suicidal ideation, as was the total number of conditions. Individuals with greater numbers of health conditions exhibited greater levels of disability and depression, which partially explained the increased risk of passive suicidal ideation among those with more health conditions.

Discussion

Certain specific health conditions, as well as total number of conditions, are associated with passive suicidal ideation in middle age and older adulthood. Health is a critical risk factor for suicidal ideation in late life and should be further studied in this particularly at-risk population.

Scored on a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Error bars indicate SEs.

Higher between-person subjective sleep quality was significantly associated with lower passive suicidal ideation and active suicidal ideation. For passive suicidal ideation, compared with the reference category of 7- to 9-hour gaps, participants with 4- to 7-hour gaps showed significantly higher levels of passive suicidal ideation (B = 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.55), while gaps of less than 4 hours and at least 9 hours showed no significant differences in passive suicidal ideation from the 7- to 9-hour reference category. For active suicidal ideation, participants with 4- to 7-hour gaps also showed significantly higher levels of active suicidal ideation compared with the 7- to 9-hour reference (B = 0.29; 95% CrI, 0.10–0.49), while other gap categories showed no significant differences. No associations were found for previous-day row count variables for either passive or active suicidal ideation (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1). For suicide planning, only between-person subjective sleep quality had a significant association (B = −0.57; 95% CrI, −1.13 to −0.03) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).

### Passive vs active nighttime smartphone use as markers of next-day suicide risk [^112kjWC1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study combining surveys and passive data collection found that the timing and type of nighttime smartphone use are meaningfully associated with next-day suicidal ideation and suicide planning. With the use of a high-frequency digital phenotyping approach and EMA across 28 days, we identified temporally and behaviorally specific markers of suicidal ideation and suicide planning. Our analyses showed that using coarse indicators alone (eg, total phone use) did not fully capture these dynamics, as what mattered was when and how smartphones are used during the night.

The study consistently found that late-night phone use (11:00to 1:00) was associated with higher next-day suicide risk. In study 3, greater phone use during this window, particularly compared with middle-night (1:00 to 5:00) or early-morning (5:00 to 8:00) use, was associated with significantly elevated passive and active suicidal ideation and suicide planning. These findings align with growing concerns that the late-night period (eg, the hours prior to bedtime) represents a critical risk window, potentially due to reduced social support, increased cognitive rumination, or exposure to distressing content. Phone use during these hours may also impact sleep onset or quality due to blue light exposure. Future work needs to replicate these findings and could benefit from further exploration of the potentially protective effects of middle-night active engagement, including which applications and application content may be influential.

Complementing these findings, study 1 showed that the duration of nighttime phone inactivity, a potential proxy for uninterrupted rest, was also associated with suicidal ideation. Specifically, 7- to 9-hour phone-free intervals were associated with the lowest levels of next-day ideation, while gaps of 4 to 7 hours were associated with a significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation. These results identified 4- to 7-hour phone-free intervals as a specific risk window, with only this range showing significantly elevated suicidal ideation compared with the 7- to 9-hour reference group, while both shorter (< 4 hours) and longer (≥ 9 hours) gaps showed no significant differences. These findings suggest that disrupted, but not entirely absent sleep may be particularly problematic but need replication in a larger sample.

### Risk of repetition and subsequent self-harm following presentation to hospital with suicidal ideation: a longitudinal registry study [^117MGkGz]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study is the use of consecutive presentations to hospital in a large region of the United Kingdom, over a period of eight years. We used an inception cohort method to maximise the number of true first presentations to hospital, to ensure that the patterns of repeat presentation were accurate. Nevertheless, our study had some limitations. We did not have information on referrals made to out-patient or community mental health services following discharge from hospital, which may have also contributed to the risk of repetition. Similarly, we didn't have information on active mental health care or psychiatric treatments received, particularly during the period following presentation to hospital. We were also only able examine hospital-presenting episodes and so presentations to primary care or other mental health settings have not been captured. Such treatments or health care contacts may have contributed to the patterns of repetition presented in this study, and future research should examine the impact of longer-term management of suicidal ideation in primary and secondary care. The definition of ideation used by the Registry is broad, and we were not able to sub-classify the ideation presentations with regards to degree of suicidal intent or according to active or passive ideation. Finally, we were only able to look at hospital-presenting ideation and self-harm, and so further ideation or self-harm where the individual did not present to hospital has not been captured.

This study has built on recent work describing the profile of hospital-presenting ideation, which concluded that although those who present to hospital with ideation were a distinct population from those presenting with self-harm, a proportion will engage in self-harm. This research has highlighted important patterns in the trajectory of suicidal behaviour, particularly in relation to the transition from ideation to self-harm in young people. The findings underline the need for those who present to hospital with ideation to be recognized as an important clinical group at risk of self-harm, and clinical guidance and policy should reflect this.

### Mental health problems and risk of suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents [^111HG9yR]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Obtaining recent estimates of the prevalence of suicide-related outcomes across adolescence and its associated mental health problems (MHPs) is important for clinical practice. We estimated the prevalence of suicide-related outcomes at ages 13, 15, 17, and 20 years (2011–2018) in a contemporary population-based cohort and documented associations with MHPs throughout adolescence.

Methods

Data came from 1618 participants in the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Internalizing (depression and anxiety) and externalizing (oppositional/defiance, conduct issues, and attention deficit and/or hyperactivity) MHPs were assessed with validated questionnaires. Outcomes were self-reported past-year passive and serious suicidal ideation and suicide attempt.

Results

Lifetime prevalence of passive suicidal ideation (13–17 years old), serious suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt (13–20 years old) were 22.2%, 9.8%, and 6.7%, respectively. Prevalence was twice as high for females as for males. Overall, rates of passive (15–17 years old; 11.8%-18.4%) and serious ideation (13–20 years old; 3.3%-9.5%) increased over time but were stable for attempt (13–20 years old; 3.5%-3.8%). In univariable analyses, all MHPs were associated with suicide-related outcomes at all ages (risk rate ratio range: 2.57–3.10 [passive ideation] and 2.10–4.36 [suicide attempt]), and associations were similar for male and female participants (sex interaction P > .05). Magnitude of associations were generally stronger for more severe suicide-related outcomes (passive ideation < serious ideation < attempt). In multivariable analyses, internalizing problems were associated with suicidal ideation, whereas both depressive and conduct symptoms were associated with attempt.

Conclusions

Suicidal ideation and attempt were common, especially for females and youth presenting with depressive and conduct problem symptoms. Clinicians should systematically assess suicidal risk in teenagers, especially in those presenting with MHPs.

### A systematic review on passive sensing for the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^114TSimZ]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, preliminary feasibility studies suggest that passive sensing for STB is feasible in high-risk populations. Patients with STB and/or mental disorders reported moderate to high levels of comfort while wearing wrist devices, and using a sensing app, with sufficient adherence to these devices, including a smart ring. However, participants from the general population seem to be more willing to share active data compared to passive data. Potentially, individuals might be reluctant to share passive data under some circumstances such as a non-clinical setting or the possibility to opt out of specific passive data.

The findings of this review hold important implications for future research. First and foremost, studies should address general methodological limitations by adhering to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklistand by avoiding potential sources of bias according to the PROBAST tool. Studies should rigorously report the following aspects both in pre-registrations and research reports: eligibility criteria and reasons for exclusion from analyses, missing data handling, details regarding the selection of predictors and feature extraction algorithms, pre-processing steps of passive sensing data, a detailed list of sensors, the sampling rate and method for each sensor, as well as the model performance. Concerning the sampling strategy, studies should select participants with the aim of achieving a balanced sample containing a substantial proportion of participants or time points with and without the outcome of STB, which is necessary for model development and comparison to a control/naive predictor. Authors should report how they dealt with potential class imbalance in classification tasks. In addition, studies should avoid choosing arbitrary cut-offs for differentiating participants into high- and low-risk. Finally, it is crucial to evaluate models using external data.

### Bimekizumab (Bimzelx) [^113encJX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior

An increased incidence of new onset or worsening suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in subjects treated with BIMZELX. A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been definitively established.

Suicidal ideation and behavior were prospectively monitored using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) in clinical trials. The C-SSRS is an interview-based instrument used to monitor for the presence and severity of suicidal ideation (ranging from "none" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent") and behaviors (rating the injury and potential lethality of self-injury, if present).

Plaque Psoriasis

During the two 16-week, placebo-controlled periods of Trials Ps-1 and Ps-2, higher rates of suicidal ideation as assessed by C-SSRS were reported in BIMZELX-treated subjects than in subjects receiving placebo. Pooled analysis of C-SSRS data indicated that 12/670 (1.8%) BIMZELX-treated subjects and 1/169 (0.6%) subjects receiving placebo reported passive suicidal ideation with an estimated relative risk of 3.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 22.74). Subjects without a prior history of SI/B treated with BIMZELX also reported a higher rate of new onset suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS than subjects receiving placebo (1.3% vs 0.6%). During the open-label extension trial, one completed suicide was reported in a BIMZELX-treated subject [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Psoriatic Arthritis

Pooled analysis of C-SSRS data from the two 16-week, placebo-controlled periods of Trials PsA-1 and PsA-2 indicated that 2/698 (0.3%) BIMZELX-treated subjects and 3/413 (0.7%) subjects receiving placebo reported passive suicidal ideation with an estimated relative risk of 0.35 (95% confidence interval: 0.05, 2.29) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis

Analysis of C-SSRS data from a 16-week, placebo-controlled period of Trial nr-axSpA-1 indicated that no subjects, being treated either with BIMZELX or placebo, reported suicidal ideation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### A systematic review on passive sensing for the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^115JzbdA]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of feasibility studies

In total, ten studies investigated the feasibility of passive sensing in the context of STB. A summary of all relevant study characteristics is displayed in Table 3. Nine studies examined behavioral signals. six studied social signals, and three investigated physiological signals. Data collection lasted between one retrospective session, and a mean of 229.4 days (SD = 168), varying across participants. Sample size varied from 50 subjectsto 1709 subjects, with five studies investigating fewer than 100 subjects. Samples consisted of adults in eight studies. and adolescents in two studies. Six studies examined clinical samples –, three investigated general samples, and one study included students and a sample of patients with and without STB. The definition of feasibility varied across trials; studies focused on user experience, adherence to passive sensing technology (i.e. wearing the device or keeping a sensing app on a smartphone), and the willingness to share data.

Study 2: Self-Reported Sleep Windows

Seventy-five participants (96.2%) provided at least 2 valid entries, with a mean [SD] of 14.3 [7.3] reports per participant, yielding 3012 rows for data analysis. Results indicated that higher between-person subjective sleep quality was significantly associated with lower passive suicidal ideation (B = −0.96; 95% CrI, −1.57 to −0.34) and lower active suicidal ideation (B = −1.02; 95% CrI, −1.59 to −0.44). For passive suicidal ideation, higher within-person sleep phone minutes were significantly associated with higher levels of passive suicidal ideation (B = 0.15; 95% CrI, 0.04–0.26), while higher within-person sleep keyboard minutes (B = −0.14; 95% CrI, −0.24 to −0.04) and higher within-person nonsleep keyboard minutes (B = −0.16; 95% CrI, −0.29 to −0.03) were significantly associated with lower levels of passive suicidal ideation. For active suicidal ideation, higher within-person sleep keyboard minutes were significantly associated with lower levels of active suicidal ideation (B = −0.13; 95% CrI, −0.24 to −0.02), while higher within-person nonsleep keyboard minutes showed a significant association with lower levels active suicidal ideation (B = −0.12; 95% CrI = −0.24 to −0.001). No associations were found for any between-person components of phone or keyboard minutes during or outside of self-reported sleep windows for either passive suicidal ideation (eTable 4 in Supplement 1) or active suicidal ideation (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). For suicide planning, no associations were found outside a negative association with between-person subjective sleep quality (B = −0.73; 95% CrI, −1.42 to −0.05) (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).

### Assessment of latent subgroups with suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior among gun owners and non-gun owners in the US [^116uJmCM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this survey study may reveal new clues for understanding heterogeneity in suicide risk within and between populations of gun owners and non–gun owners. Our results suggest that configurations of suicidal ideation and behaviors are similar between gun owners and non–gun owners when the probability of suicide attempt is low, but when the probability of suicide attempt increases, gun owners may be less likely than non–gun owners to endorse survey items about passive and active suicidal ideation. The findings suggest that assessing a broader range of suicide risk indicators, especially thoughts about specific ways or methods to attempt suicide and preparation for a suicide attempt, may improve risk detection in subgroups at high risk of suicide attempt.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for suicidal ideation, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (depression), APA 2010 guidelines recommend to obtain a careful and ongoing evaluation of suicide risk in all patients with major depressive disorder, including:

- specific inquiry about suicidal thoughts, intent, plans, means, and behaviors

- identification of specific psychiatric symptoms (such as psychosis, severe anxiety, substance use) or general medical conditions likely to increase the likelihood of acting on suicidal ideas

- assessment of past and, particularly, recent suicidal behavior

- delineation of current stressors and potential protective factors (such as positive reasons for living, strong social support)

- identification of any family history of suicide or mental illness.

### Assessment of latent subgroups with suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior among gun owners and non-gun owners in the US [^112vBoKL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

This finding has important implications for suicide risk screening methods, which typically include questions about thoughts of death (ie, passive ideation) and/or suicide (ie, active suicidal ideation). In subgroups with higher probabilities of suicide attempts, gun owners were less likely than non–gun owners to endorse passive and active suicidal ideation but were more likely to endorse thinking about specific ways or methods to attempt suicide and engaging in preparatory behaviors. This finding suggests that elevated risk states may be experienced by gun owners and non–gun owners in unique ways that differ sufficiently such that they cannot be meaningfully compared.

Of clinical importance, our results suggest that suicide risk screening and assessment methods that focus on self-disclosure of thoughts about death and suicide may be well suited for identifying high risk states among non–gun owners but that these screening items are less likely to be endorsed by gun owners with the highest probability of suicide attempt. Evidence has shown that suicidal ideation has only modest sensitivity as an indicator of suicidal behavior, even when someone is screened within a few weeks of their suicide attempt. The present study's results suggest that the modest sensitivity of suicidal ideation as an indicator of suicidal behavior may be explained in part by heterogeneous associations among various indicators of suicide risk. The findings suggest that supplementing passive and active suicidal ideation items with items assessing thoughts about specific ways or methods of attempting suicide and/or taking steps to prepare for a suicide attempt may improve detection of subgroups at high risk of suicide attempt.

### Passive vs active nighttime smartphone use as markers of next-day suicide risk [^114di2cD]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Descriptive data (Figure 1) further revealed distinct nighttime usage phenotypes across participants, including concentrated late-night usage, diffuse nocturnal usage, and minimal nighttime usage. These preliminary phenotypes highlight the potential heterogeneity in nighttime behaviors, reinforcing the value of high-resolution data in identifying personalized risk patterns.

Beyond timing, our findings provide initial support for the importance of engagement type. In both studies 2 and 3, keyboard presence, as a proxy for active use (eg, messaging, typing), was associated with lower suicidal ideation, particularly during the middle of the night. Keyboard activity during self-reported sleep windows was significantly associated with lower passive and active suicidal ideation at the within-person level. In study 3, significant time-by-use interactions showed that the positive association between phone use and suicide risk during late-night hours (11:00to 1:00) was significantly attenuated or reversed during the middle-night (1:00 to 5:00) and early-morning periods.

These findings are congruent with growing evidence that active engagement may serve a regulatory or social function, offering distraction, connection, or emotional processing during periods of distress. In contrast, passive use, such as prolonged scrolling, may increase the risk of suicidal ideation through mechanisms such as social comparison, emotional disengagement, or disrupted sleep. The nuanced behavioral profiles identified here offer an early indication that not all phone use is harmful; some patterns may actually serve as coping strategies.

### Adult associations of childhood suicidal thoughts and behaviors: a prospective, longitudinal analysis [^1138JFxd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Suicidal thoughts and behavior (STBs) have their peak period of onset in adolescence, but little is known about how such behavior is associated with later functioning. The aim of this study is to test whether childhood STBs are related to adult psychiatric, suicidal, and functional outcomes.

Method

This is a prospective, population-based community study of 1,420 participants assessed with structured interviews up to 7 times in childhood/adolescence (ages 9–16 years; 6,674 observations) for STBs including passive and active ideation, plans, and attempts. Participants were then assessed 4 times in young adulthood (ages 19, 21, 24, and 30 years; 4,556 observations of 1,273 participants) for psychiatric diagnoses, STBs, and functional outcomes.

Results

By age 16 years, 7.0% of participants had reported some type of STBs, with 3.9% reporting an attempt. Both ideation only and suicide attempts were associated with higher levels of anxiety disorders and STBs in adulthood, as well as poor functioning across financial, health, risky/illegal, and social domains. These observed effects generally were attenuated after adjusting for other psychiatric and psychosocial factors that predict childhood STBs (particularly maltreatment, depression, and disruptive behavior disorders). The exception was adult suicidal behavior, which was predicted by both childhood ideation and attempts, even in the fully adjusted model. Children and adolescents with STBs were more likely to have had a disrupted transition to adulthood.

Conclusion

Childhood STBs are a marker for a multitude of poor psychiatric and functional outcomes in adulthood, but these effects are largely accounted for by other factors. In contrast, childhood STBs are a robust risk factor for adult suicidal thoughts and behavior.

### Examining sleep disturbance components as near-term predictors of suicide ideation in daily life [^112vJVzR]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Suicide ideation emerges and fluctuates over short timeframes (minutes, hours, days); however, near-term predictors of such fluctuations have not been well-elucidated. Sleep disturbance is a distal suicide risk factor, but less work has examined whether daily sleep disturbance predicts near-term changes in suicide ideation. We examined subjective sleep disturbance components as predictors of passive and active suicide ideation at the within-person (i.e., day-to-day changes within individuals relative to their own mean) and between-persons (individual differences relative to the sample mean) levels. A transdiagnostic sample of 102 at-risk young adults ages 18–35 completed a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol, during which they reported on sleep and passive and active suicide ideation. At the within-persons level, nightmares, sleep quality, and wake after sleep onset predicted passive suicide ideation, and sleep quality and wake after sleep onset predicted active suicide ideation. At the between-persons level, nightmares, sleep onset latency, and sleep quality were associated with passive suicide ideation, and sleep onset latency was associated with active suicide ideation. In contrast, suicide ideation did not predict subsequent sleep at the within-person level. Specific sleep disturbance components are near-term predictors of intraindividual increases in suicide ideation and may hold promise for suicide prevention and intervention.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^114c9eo2]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present study was to further investigate the temporal dynamics of different components of suicidal ideation. We applied network analysis to EMA data to examine how cognitive-affective risk and protective factors (incl. positive and negative affect, anxiety, hopelessness, loneliness, burdensomeness, and optimism) are interconnected, and how they interact in the prediction of suicidal ideation (passive ideation, active ideation, and acquired capability) in the short-term. While the potential range of risk and protective factors impacting suicidal ideation is vast (de Beurs et al; Franklin et al; Goldston et al.), past EMA studies have demonstrated that maladaptive cognitions (hopelessness, loneliness, burdensomeness) and affect variables specifically appear to form the most robust associations with real-time suicidal ideation (Kivelä et al.). According to the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) (Van Orden et al.), hopelessness, loneliness and burdensomeness are crucial for the development of suicidal ideation, and are also interconnected with other established risk factors (Kleiman, Law, & Anestis). For example, a negative cognitive style (e.g. hopelessness-proneness), may be associated both with specific negative attributions ('I am alone', 'I am a burden'), as well as other negative affective sequale (feelings of shame, anger, sadness, etc.). Cognition and affect interact; affect can influence cognition and similarly, cognitions may trigger affective responses (Duncan & Barrett,), resulting in bidirectional associations with suicidal ideation. Considering that no previous study has examined the combined real-time associations between these variables in relation to different components of suicidal ideation, we adopted an explorative framework and did not specify a priori predictions of differential associations with passive and active suicidal ideation, and acquired capability.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^112mMmhi]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Further, only a limited number of EMA studies have clearly distinguished between different components of suicidal ideation. These include passive and active suicidal ideation (Wastler et al.), as well as acquired capability, referring to increased internal preparedness for suicidal behavior, encompassing decreased fearlessness about death and increased pain tolerance (Van Orden et al.). The identification of predictors of active suicidal ideation and acquired capability may be especially important, as these constructs are more closely related to the transition from ideation to action (Díaz-Oliván, Porras-Segovia, Barrigón, Jiménez-Muñoz, & Baca-García; Van Orden et al.). From the few studies that have aimed to disentangle these components, differential findings have emerged. Perceived burdensomeness was found to concurrently associated with passive, but not active, suicidal ideation, while hopelessness, depressed mood, and thwarted belongingness were related to both active and passive ideation (Hallensleben et al.). Finally, higher daily levels of active ideation predicted higher acquired capability ratings at the end of the day (Spangenberg, Glaesmer, Hallensleben, Rath, & Forkmann). These findings illustrate the importance of separating different components of suicidal ideation.

An emerging modeling technique, namely network analysis, allows for the synthesis of this information in a manner that enables researchers to model the complexity of systems with multiple outcomes and multiple interacting risk and protective factors over time (Borsboom et al; Bringmann et al; de Beurs; Fried & Cramer). As such, network modeling can address both of the current challenges in EMA suicide research: account for the complexity in both predictors and outcomes, and help explore short-term, temporal associations. Network models in time-series data can estimate potentially bidirectional associations not only between suicidal ideation and its risk factors but between different suicidal ideation outcomes as well, in order to observe the full extent of both direct and indirect influences on suicidal ideation. Further, in network models, risk factors such as loneliness or hopelessness reflect pieces in the greater network of the symptomatology of suicidal ideation rather than simply being potential causes of suicidal ideation. In other words, suicidal ideation can both be influenced by, and further influence, these risk factors, and network modeling may be used to visualize these complex, bidirectional temporal relationships.

### To be or not to be: a cross-sectional study on suicidal ideation, intensity of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among medical students in kerala, India [^117LnYys]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence of suicidal ideation

We estimated the lifetime and recent (in the last 1 month) prevalence of suicidal ideation with the following questions, 'Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?' or 'Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?'.

Active suicidal ideation

This refers to having a specific plan or intention to take one's own life. It goes beyond mere passive thoughts and indicates that the individual may actively plan for self-harm, whether or not there is a clear intention to carry it out.

Intensity of ideation

The score on the intensity of ideation subscale was calculated by adding the highest scores endorsed on the 5-intensity items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents and reasons for ideation). The intensity of suicidal ideation is classified and interpreted as follows: Moderate intensity (score of 6–10) has 11 times the risk of suicide when compared with those who scored 0–5. Moderately severe intensity (score of 11–15) has 13 times the risk of suicide, severe intensity of ideation (score of 16–20) has 19 times the risk of suicide and very severe intensity of suicidal ideation (score of 21–25) has 34 times the risk of suicide when compared with those who scored 0–5. The C-SSRS identified a significant risk for suicide attempts, showing an OR of 4.8 (95% CI 2.23 to 10.32, p < 0.001) in adolescents and young adults who scored above 6 after an emergency psychiatric evaluation, compared with those scoring 6 or lower. These scores are best used to help inform clinical judgement when there is uncertainty about disposition and to assess change over time.

Suicidal behaviour

Includes completed suicide, attempted suicide (with at least some intent to die) and suicide gestures (interrupted attempts, aborted attempts and preparatory behaviours).

Suicide behaviour subscale

Four types of suicidal behaviours were assessed as Yes/No to identify the occurrence of actual, interrupted, aborted attempts and preparatory behaviours. It also distinguishes suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour.

Contemporaneous associations with passive and active suicidal ideation and acquired capability

In the contemporaneous model (Fig. 1, left), passive suicidal ideation was positively associated with sadness (r = 0.07, p < 0.001), hopelessness (r = 0.16, p < 0.001), loneliness (r = 0.11, p < 0.001), and burdensomeness (r = 0.09, p < 0.001), and negatively associated with happiness (r = –0.18, p < 0.001), calmness (r = –0.05, p = 0.017), and optimism (r = –0.20, p < 0.001). Active suicidal ideation was positively associated with passive suicidal ideation (r = 0.20, p < 0.001), sadness (r = 0.05, p = 0.004) and shame (r = 0.05, p = 0.028). Acquired capability was positively associated with passive suicidal ideation (r = 0.10, p < 0.001) and active suicidal ideation (r = 0.69, p < 0.001).

### Smartphone-based text obtained via passive sensing as it relates to direct suicide risk assessment [^1173FHqi]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This model took the general form:where for each dictionary (dict), both the within- and between-person variables are specified for both parts of the outcome (Count:; 0/1).

To clarify the interpretation of model outputs, we provide a hypothetical example using the hopeless dictionary and the outcome of passive suicidal ideation. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models consist of two components: the zero-inflation component and the count component. Each helps us understand different aspects of the relationship between predictors and outcomes. The zero-inflation component addresses the likelihood of excess zeros. In our context, an estimate from this portion represents the relationship between dictionary use and the probability that a participant reports no passive suicidal ideation. For example, a negative coefficient for the within-person hopeless dictionary variable in the zero-inflation component would indicate that on days when an individual uses more hopeless language than their personal average, they are less likely to report zero passive suicidal ideation — in other words, they have a higher probability of experiencing at least some passive suicidal ideation. It's important to note that unlike common practice in logistic regression, the reference case here is 'zero' (absence of the outcome), so coefficient interpretations may appear counterintuitive. Conversely, the count component models the intensity of the outcome when it is present. An estimate from this portion reflects the relationship between dictionary use and the severity of passive suicidal ideation on days when such ideation occurs. For instance, a positive coefficient for the between-person hopeless dictionary variable in the count component would suggest that individuals who generally exhibit more hopeless language throughout the study period tend to report higher levels of passive suicidal ideation when experiencing any such ideation. This dual-component approach allows us to distinguish between: (1) factors influencing whether any suicide risk is present, and (2) factors affecting the severity of that risk when it occurs – providing a more nuanced understanding of suicide risk factors than traditional regression approaches.

### Assessment of latent subgroups with suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior among gun owners and non-gun owners in the US [^112iQ9si]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Although the gun owners in this study were generally more likely than non–gun owners to endorse passive and active suicidal ideation (a pattern consistent with previous research), this specific configuration was revealed only in the subgroups with lower probabilities of suicidal behavior (especially suicide attempts), including class 1, which was characterized by low endorsement probabilities of all items; class 2, which was characterized by low probability of suicidal behavior combined with moderate probability of passive suicidal ideation; and class 3, which was characterized by low probability of suicidal behavior combined with no clear pattern of passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, and suicidal planning. In subgroups with higher probabilities of suicidal behavior, however, item response patterns differed between gun owners and non–gun owners. Among gun owners, the highest probability of suicidal behavior occurred in the subgroup that was well characterized by thinking of specific ways or methods to attempt suicide and by preparatory behaviors but not by passive suicidal ideation or active suicidal ideation (class 4). Among non–gun owners the highest probability of suicidal behavior occurred in the subgroup that was well characterized by passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, and suicidal planning but not by preparatory behavior (class 5). Passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, and suicidal planning may therefore function similarly for gun owners and non–gun owners who have lower probabilities of suicidal behavior but may not be comparable when the probability of suicidal behavior is higher.

### Passive vs active nighttime smartphone use as markers of next-day suicide risk [^112LEfnQ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Compounding this gap is that not all smartphone use is the same. A growing body of evidence distinguishes between passive use (eg, scrolling) and active use (eg, messaging, posting), with the former associated with negative affect and social disconnection and the latter more often with positive emotional outcomes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that these distinctions may matter for suicide risk. For example, Dissing et alfound that certain patterns of active use at night are associated with lower emotional distress. However, few studies have incorporated these behavioral distinctions, and none have done so using high-frequency, passively collected data.

In this study, we use Screenomics, a digital phenotyping approach that captures smartphone screenshots every 5 seconds during phone use, alongside ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine whether nighttime smartphone use is associated with next-day suicidal ideation and suicide planning in a high-risk adult sample. We operationalized nighttime phone use across multiple levels of specificity to test whether the timing and type of use (ie, active vs passive engagement) are differentially associated with next-day suicide risk. This approach addresses major limitations of prior research, including reliance on self-report, low temporal resolution, and failure to differentiate meaningful behavioral subtypes. Our study aims to inform the identification of high-risk periods and guide the development of just-in-time digital interventions for suicide prevention.

### Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adults with hoarding disorder [^115R6xn3]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1. Sociodemographic data

From this sample with 99 HD participants, 51 participants endorsed SI, suicidal behaviors, or both, as assessed by the C-SSRS. Demographic data of those who endorsed SI, suicidal behavior, or both showed that the majority were female (82%), white (71%), and non-Hispanic (94%), with a college education (98%). For more details on the demographic data, see Table 2.

3.2. C-SSRS results

Table 3 shows our findings on STB in the sample. Of those who reported active SI in which they thought about a method of suicide (n = 26), 11 participants reported they thought about an overdose during their most severe active SI. Table 4 details the intensity of suicidal ideation.

3.3. Relationship between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and HDRS-17 total scores

Table 5 includes HDRS-17 scores and severity for participants who reported lifetime history of SI and/or suicidal behavior.

To explore associations between lifetime SI in HD and current depressive symptoms, we conducted independent samples t –tests. To conduct our analyses, we categorized the SI variable on groups of Yes SI and No SI. Our dependent variable was the total HDRS score. For passive SI, the independent samples t -test showed a significant difference between lifetime passive SI and total HDRS score (t (86) = −4.226, p < .001). We obtained significant differences between active SI and total HDRS score as well (t (86) = − 4.573, p < .001), such that participants with HD who also reported lifetime passive and active SI had higher HDRS scores than those without both types of SI.

### Psychotic experiences and schizotypy in early adolescence predict subsequent suicidal ideation trajectories and suicide attempt outcomes from age 18 to 38 years [^11142JjA]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical risk markers for schizophrenia predict suicidality, but little is known about the nature of the relationship. Suicidal ideation is often considered homogenous, but distinguishing passive from active ideation (ie, thoughts of death vs thoughts of killing oneself) and different temporal patterns may further the understanding of risk factors. We tested whether schizotypy and psychotic experiences (PEs) in early adolescence predict subsequent growth trajectories of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt outcomes. Participants were 1037 members of the population-representative Dunedin Study cohort. PE was measured at 11 years and schizotypy at 13 and 15 years. Outcomes were passive and active suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt, measured at 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years. Passive ideation was best represented by 2 trajectories, including persistent and transient ideation classes. Schizotypy predicted membership in the smaller persistent class (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, P = .041), whereas PE was not associated with class membership. The probability of suicide attempts was 13.8% in the persistent ideation class, compared with 1.8% in the transient class. Active ideation was best represented by a 1-class model, the intercept of which was predicted by schizotypy (OR = 1.23, P = .015). Suicide attempts were predicted by schizotypy (OR = 1.53, P = .040) and PE (OR = 3.42, P = .046), and this was partially mediated by indirect effects via the active ideation trajectory. Findings indicate that adolescent schizotypy and PE are related to subsequent suicidal ideation and attempts. Suicidal ideation is heterogeneous, and schizotypy is specifically related to a persistent passive ideation subgroup.

### Thinking about suicidal thinking [^116t2qHN]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Suicide has emerged as a major cause of death from non-communicable disease worldwide, leading to a burgeoning interest in its prevention. Naturally, in this context one of the focuses of research and clinical interest is the presence of suicidal thinking-a potentially identifiable and reversible precursor of suicide-with much interest lately being in the relation between suicidal thinking and suicidal behaviour. In this Personal View we argue that, notwithstanding important and nuanced research into the nature of these phenomena, the field currently suffers from approaches to the terminology and reporting of suicidal thinking that pay insufficient regard to key features of its definition, and that these have clinical and research implications.

### Comorbid alcohol-related problems and suicidality disproportionately impact men and emerging adults among individuals with depressive symptoms [^111HwdzZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Depressive disorders are common among adults with alcohol use disorder and with suicidality; however, demographic differences in comorbid alcohol use disorder, binge drinking, and suicidality are understudied. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which comorbid suicidality and alcohol use disorders and comorbid suicidality and binge drinking differ by age and gender among adults with depressive symptoms.

Method

The sample included adults (unweighted N = 29,460) in the United States who completed the 2015–2018 National Survey of Drug Use and Heath and screened positively for depression. Gender and age groups odds of alcohol use disorder only, suicidality only, and alcohol use disorder+suicidality were compared to neither problem. Similar analyses were conducted for binge drinking.

Results

Men showed disproportional odds of alcohol use disorder only, all suicidality and alcohol use disorder comorbidities, and binge drinking+active suicidal ideation than women. Emerging adults showed higher odds of: passive and active suicidal ideation only and suicidality+alcohol use disorder than adults 35 and older; binge drinking only, binge drinking+passive suicidal ideation, and binge drinking+active suicidal ideation than all older adults; binge drinking+suicide planning and binge drinking+attempts than adults 50 and older.

Limitations

Because participants all reported depression symptoms either at the subclinical or clinical level, demographic differences in suicidality, alcohol use disorder, and binge drinking found in this study cannot be generalized to non-depressed samples.

Conclusions

Treatment providers should be aware of disproportionately higher odds of comorbid suicidality and alcohol use disorder, and suicidality and binge drinking among men and emerging adults.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^115Eh5mL]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Suicidal ideation arises from a complex interplay of multiple interacting risk factors over time. Recently, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has increased our understanding of factors associated with real-time suicidal ideation, as well as those predicting ideation at the level of hours and days. Here we used statistical network methods to investigate which cognitive-affective risk and protective factors are associated with the temporal dynamics of suicidal ideation.

Methods

The SAFE study is a longitudinal cohort study of 82 participants with current suicidal ideation who completed 4×/day EMA over 21 days. We modeled contemporaneous (t) and temporal (t + 1) associations of three suicidal ideation components (passive ideation, active ideation, and acquired capability) and their predictors (positive and negative affect, anxiety, hopelessness, loneliness, burdensomeness, and optimism) using multilevel vector auto-regression models.

Results

Contemporaneously, passive suicidal ideation was positively associated with sadness, hopelessness, loneliness, and burdensomeness, and negatively with happiness, calmness, and optimism; active suicidal ideation was positively associated with passive suicidal ideation, sadness, and shame; and acquired capability only with passive and active suicidal ideation. Acquired capability and hopelessness positively predicted passive ideation at t + 1, which in turn predicted active ideation; acquired capability was positively predicted at t + 1 by shame, and negatively by burdensomeness.

Conclusions

Our findings show that systematic real-time associations exist between suicidal ideation and its predictors, and that different factors may uniquely influence distinct components of ideation. These factors may represent important targets for safety planning and risk detection.

### Differentiating suicide attempts and suicidal ideation using neural markers of emotion regulation [^111FUiaY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Theories of suicide posit distinct etiological pathways for suicide attempts (SA) and suicidal ideation (SI) that are marked, in part, by disruptions in the ability to regulate reactions to threat/mutilation and interpersonally-relevant emotional stimuli. However, little research has specifically tested these associations. To address this gap, the present study extracted the Late Positive Potential (LPP) during an emotion regulation task to evaluate the independent associations that SA history and SI share with initial responsivity to, and regulation of, these distinct emotional contents.

Methods

A clinical sample (N = 257) were recruited based on elevations in suicide risk factors. Participants completed a picture viewing and regulation task that included threat/mutilation, reward, and neutral images from the International Affective Picture System. Immediately prior to picture onset, participants were instructed to passively view the image, increase their emotional reaction to the image, or decrease their emotional reaction to the image.

Results

Differential patterns of LPP amplitudes only emerged in the context of attempts to regulate emotional responses such that SA history predicted a superior ability to volitionally mitigate responses to threat/mutilation while SI was related to a worse ability to increase responses to reward. Effect sizes were in the small and small-to-medium range.

Limitations

The present data were cross-sectional and included low trial counts.

Conclusions

Taken together, these findings support existing theories of suicide suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Future research should seek to determine if these mechanisms may serve as a viable intervention targets.

### Risk of repetition and subsequent self-harm following presentation to hospital with suicidal ideation: a longitudinal registry study [^114EdRAV]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Data source

Data from the Northern Ireland Registry of Self-harm was used for this study. The Registry records information on presentations to hospital emergency departments following self-harm and following suicidal ideation. Since 2012, the Registry has had coverage of the emergency departments at all twelve general hospitals in the region, representing a population of 1.9 million. Presentations are identified and recorded by independently-trained data registration officers.

Presentations involving suicidal ideation (hereafter referred to as ideation) are recorded according to the definition: 'passive thoughts about wanting to be dead or active thoughts about killing oneself, not accompanied by preparatory behaviour'. This relates to presentations by persons who have experienced thoughts of self-harm and/ or suicide, where no physical act has taken place.

The definition of self-harm used by the Registry is 'an act with non-fatal outcome in which an individual deliberately initiates a non-habitual behaviour, that without intervention from others will cause self-harm, or deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the prescribed or generally recognised therapeutic dosage, and which is aimed at realising changes that the person desires via the actual or expected physical consequences'. This is an internationally-recognised definition of self-harm, which is consistent with that used by similar systems in Irelandand England.

2.2 Data items

The Registry records information on both demographic and clinical variables relating to the presentation, including gender, age, date and hour of presentation to hospital, mode of arrival to hospital and recommended next care. The involvement of alcohol is ascertained through hospital case notes — if it was recorded on registration or by the attending clinician, or if present on toxicology reports. The Registry records if a mental health assessment was conducted in the emergency department at the time of attendance to hospital. It is also recorded if a patient was referred for an assessment at a later time in the general hospital/ offsite if an assessment at the time of attendance was not possible or not immediately required.

2.3 Ethical approval

Ethical approval for the Northern Ireland Registry of Self-harm has been granted by the Office for Research Ethics in Northern Ireland (ORECNI).

### Suicidal intent in patients with chronic pain [^113YWPgF]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Suicidal ideation among individuals suffering from chronically painful conditions has not been widely studied, although rates of completed suicide are believed to be elevated in this population relative to the general population. The psychiatric literature on suicide documents the importance of controlling for the severity of depression when studying factors associated with suicidal ideation, attempts, or completion. The present study examined the relationships between suicidal ideation and the experience of pain, pain-related disability, and pain coping efforts among a sample of individuals experiencing chronically painful conditions. Of 200 patients evaluated on an inpatient rehabilitation unit in a psychiatric service, 13 individuals (6.5%) reported suicidal intent on a commonly used self-report measure of symptoms of depression, the Beck Depression Inventory. This group was compared to a matched (age, sex, pain duration) group of similarly depressed individuals (N = 13) and a matched group of non-depressed individuals (N = 13) on measures of pain, disability, pain beliefs, and pain coping strategies. A history of a suicide attempt was associated with suicidal intent. Family history of substance abuse was significantly more prevalent among the depressed groups, regardless of suicidal thinking. The depressed/suicidal group and depressed/non-suicidal groups reported higher levels of pain, higher levels of pain-related disability, lower use of active coping, and higher use of passive coping compared to the non-depressed group. The depressed groups did not differ from one another on any of the measures of pain experience. Depression, not suicidal status, consistently predicted level of functioning. The prevalence of suicidal intent was comparable to rates observed in other studies and relatively low. When individuals with chronic pain report suicidal intent, it is imperative that measures preventing self-harm be implemented immediately and the patient's depression be treated aggressively.

### A systematic review on passive sensing for the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^112F7z6v]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias in prediction studies

Risk of bias in prediction model studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool. The ratings per domain are displayed in Table 2 (see Supplementary Table 2 for detailed ratings). Most studies (7/11) had a high risk of bias in the domain of participants, mostly because the eligibility criteria and reasons for exclusion were unclear. Across all studies, the bias potential was low in the domain of predictors. Furthermore, the bias potential regarding the outcome was high in most trials (9/11). STB were often assessed using single items, drastically limiting the reliability and validity of the assessment. An additional potential for bias was introduced by choosing arbitrary cut-offs to determine high or low suicide risk, or insufficient information on how this was calculated. One study assessed change by 25% in C-SSRS scores, which does not account for measurement error like in the Reliable Change Index. Risk of bias was mostly high in the domain of analysis (8/11 studies). Most studies were either not pre-registered or had vague pre-registration, failing to provide clear information on how predictors were assessed in a time-resolved manner, selected, and analyzed. Studies rarely reported on how they dealt with missing data. There was often imbalance in the sample regarding the proportion of participants with the outcome; frequently, it was unclear how imbalance was managed. Another critical issue in the analysis domain was the insufficient validation of prediction models. Only three studies used a train-test split approach or cross validation of the model. This failure to test on out-of-sample observations exposes to the risk of over-fitting and does not allow conclusions to be drawn on the generalizability of the prediction results.

### The PHQ-9 item 9 based screening for suicide risk: a validation study of the patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-9 item 9 with the columbia suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) [^11653XKj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) evaluates passive thoughts of death or self-injury within the last two weeks, and is often used to screen depressed patients for suicide risk. We aimed to validate the PHQ-9 item 9 with a brief electronic version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS).

Methods

We analyzed data from 841 patients enrolled in the National Network of Depression Centers Clinical Care Registry. We performed a validation analysis of PHQ-9 item 9 for suicide risk and ideation, using the eC-SSRS as a gold standard (defined as positive response to suicidal ideation with intent to act or recent suicidal behavior).

Results

Of the 841 patients, 13.4% and 41.1% were assessed as being positive for suicide risk by the eC-SSRS and PHQ-9 item 9, respectively. For the overall cohort, sensitivity was 87.6% (95%CI 80.2–92.5%), specificity was 66.1% (95%CI 62.6–69.4%), PPV was 28.6% (95%CI 24.1–33.6%), and NPV was 97.2% (95%CI 95.3–98.3%) for the PHQ-9 suicide item. These performance measures varied within subgroups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics. In addition, the validity of PHQ-9 item 9 (cutoff score of 1) with eC-SSRS-defined suicide ideation showed overall poor results.

Limitations

The gold standard used in our study was a surrogate measure of suicidality based on eC-SSRS scores.

Conclusions

The results of our study suggest that item 9 of the PHQ-9 is an insufficient assessment tool for suicide risk and suicide ideation, with limited utility in certain demographic and clinical subgroups that requires further investigation.

### Association of real-time assessed mood, affect and suicidal ideation in psychiatric inpatients with unipolar depression [^1155VA3H]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous research provided preliminary support of a potential reinforcing effect of suicidal ideation demonstrating reduced negative affect and increased positive affect after thinking about suicide. The present study therefore sought to investigate the role of mood and affect as a proximal risk factor of suicidal ideation in a high-risk sample. Seventy-four psychiatric inpatients (72% female) with unipolar depression and current and/or lifetime suicidal ideation aged 18 to 85 years (M = 37.6, SD = 14.3) took part in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) over 6days. Multilevel analyses were calculated. Analyses revealed negative valence of mood and low positive affect to be predictors of subsequent intensity of suicidal ideation (active, passive) as well as predictors of change in suicidal ideation (active, passive) since the last measurement. High negative affect only predicted intensity of passive suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation (active, passive) was prospectively associated with subsequent negative valence of mood and lower positive affect as well as with higher intensity of negative affect. Suicidal ideation (active, passive) also predicted the change in valence of mood, positive affect and negative affect since the last measurement. Mood and affect should be taken into account as important proximal risk factors of active and passive suicidal ideation. The results do not support the idea of a reinforcing effect of suicidal ideation. In fact, they show a pattern of reduced subsequent positive affect, negative valence of mood and increased negative affect. Replication studies with larger samples and longer EMA follow-ups are needed.

### Associations of racial / ethnic identities and religious affiliation with suicidal ideation among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning individuals [^115myjk9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to examine the associations of racial/ethnic identity and religious affiliation with suicidal ideation among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) and heterosexual college students. An additional aim was to determine the prevalence of passive suicidal ideation (i.e., death ideation) and active suicidal ideation among culturally diverse LGBQ individuals.

Methods

Data from the National Research Consortium probability-based sample of college students from 70 postsecondary institutions (n = 24,626) were used to examine active and passive suicidal ideation in the past 12-months and lifetime active suicidal ideation among students by sexual orientation, racial/ethnic identity, and religious affiliation.

Results

Across most racial/ethnic groups and religious affiliations, LGBQ students were more likely to report active suicidal ideation than non-LGBQ individuals. Among LGBQ students, Latino individuals had lower odds of reporting both past 12-month passive and active suicidal ideation than their non-Hispanic white LGBQ counterparts. Compared to Christian LGBQ students, Agnostic/Atheist LGBQ individuals had greater odds of reporting past 12-month passive suicidal ideation, and Jewish LGBQ students were less likely to endorse past 12-month passive and active suicidal ideation.

Limitations

Cross-sectional design and self-reported data.

Conclusions

Results corroborate previous research showing elevated prevalence of suicidal ideation among LGBQ individuals in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts. These findings are among the first to document prevalence differences within the LGBQ population based on intersectional identities (race/ethnicity and religious affiliation). Providers should recognize that LGBQ individuals might need support in negotiating the complex relationship between multiple identities, especially due to their elevated prevalence of suicidal ideation.

### Examining the relations between hopelessness, thwarted interpersonal needs, and passive suicide ideation among older adults: does meaning in life matter? [^116cb4Lq]. Aging & Mental Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Older adults are at an elevated risk for passive suicide ideation. The interpersonal theory of suicide and the 3-step theory may provide a framework to better understand factors that contribute to passive suicide ideation among older adults. Specifically, this study aimed to test components of prominent suicide theories and examine the role of meaning in life in the associations between hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness and passive suicide ideation among older adults. Participants were 243 adults aged 60 and older recruited from primary care settings in the southwest United States. We hypothesized that high meaning in life would weaken the associations between hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness and passive suicide ideation. Results from moderation analyses indicate that meaning in life was a significant moderator of the associations between hopelessness and passive suicide ideation, thwarted belongingness and passive suicide ideation, and perceived burdensomeness and passive suicide ideation. These findings suggest that when meaning in life is low there are significant negative associations between hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness and passive suicide ideation among older adults. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

### Prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in preadolescent children: a US population-based study [^111hSsy6]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Method

Sample

The ABCD Study is a longitudinal, multimethod, multi-informant study following children in the US over 10 years to examine mental health trajectories from childhood through adulthood. The present study used the National Data Archive ABCD 2.01 baseline dataset, which was collected between 2016 and 2018. The ABCD Study surveyed 11,875 preadolescent children currently residing in the US, all of whom were 9 or 10 years of age at enrollment. Participants were recruited based on age, sex, race, socioeconomic status (SES), and urbanicity for the purpose of matching SES variation in the US. Participants were enrolled at 22 research sites. For each child, one parent or guardian provided informed consent and information about themselves and their child. The design, procedure, and weighting procedures of this study have been reported elsewhere. All study procedures were approved by The University of California, San Diego institutional review board (IRB), which serves as the central IRB for the study. Children in the weighted sample reflect the larger population of U.S. 9- and 10-year-olds in terms of sociodemographic and geographic factors.

Measures

Suicidal ideation and behavior

Child and parent self-reports of current and past suicidal ideation and behavior were obtained using the computerized version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Present and Lifetime Version for DSM-5 (K-SADS-PL DSM-5). Items included those assessing passive and active suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. In line with standard clinical practice, the child was coded as having lifetime suicidal ideation or having made a lifetime suicide attempt if either the parent or the child endorsed any of the relevant items either currently (i.e. in the past 2 weeks) or in the past 1. Variables were then computed to (1) compare children who had only suicidal ideation versus children who reported neither suicidal ideation nor suicide attempts and (2) to compare children who had and had not experienced a suicide attempt among those children with suicidal ideation.

### The associations between suicidality and mental health factors and pain interference in veterans being referred to primary care mental health integration [^1152x1zK]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

In veterans being referred to a primary care-mental health integration (PCMHI) program, the Behavioral Health Laboratory, we sought to identify correlates of suicidal ideation severity and suicide attempts using the ideation-to-action framework among pain interference, psychiatric disorders, and treatment factors. Veterans (n = 17,176) referred to the Behavioral Health Laboratory received a structured assessment that included past-year suicidal thoughts and behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, substance use, psychotropic medication use, and mental health treatment utilization. Nearly 50% of participants reported at least passive suicidal ideation. While psychiatric symptoms differentiated passive ideators, active ideators, and suicide attempters from non-suicide ideators, there were no significant differences among active ideators and attempters. Additionally, attempters differed from passive ideators in terms of drug use, mental health treatment, psychotropic medication use, mania, and psychosis. Pain interference was significantly associated with suicidal ideation severity in bivariate analyses, but not for the adjusted analyses. PCMHI is a setting seeing a high rate of suicidal ideation and may serve as a critical setting to implement suicide prevention efforts.

### What is a mental disorder? An exemplar-focused approach [^114W5yC9]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In particular, in some cases of putative mental disorder, even though there are symptoms, as well as associated distress and impairment, there are still reasons to doubt the presence of underlying psychobiological dysfunction. First, the symptoms may simply reflect apparently normal processes, such as memory loss with age, or bereavement symptoms after a loss. Second, the symptoms may represent an understandable response to particular circumstances, other than those in Table 3, criterion C. Suicidal ideation, for example, may be reasonable under certain circumstances. Thus, judgments about dysfunction, again, require careful practical judgment, weighing up a range of relevant considerations.

While the concept of 'dysfunction' is a useful one for conceptualizing mental disorders, when new entities are proposed in the future, it would be ideal to have more sharply defined indicators of dysfunction. Symptom severity, excessiveness, and duration may be helpful in indexing dysfunction (e.g. pointing to hypersexuality, or obsessional jealousy), but they are rough indicators that run the risk of relying on a statistical definition of dysfunction. At the same time, it is notable how rarely molecular evidence, per se, is able to index dysfunction; crucially, biological difference does not point to dysfunction.

Table 3.
Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview–Revised Item Response Probabilities Across 5 Latent Classes by Gun Ownership Status

Among non–gun owners, class 1 was well characterized by the absence of passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, suicidal behavior, and NSSI. Class 2 was well characterized by an absence of active suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicidal behavior and modestly characterized by the wish to disappear or not exist and to go to sleep and never wake up. Class 3 was not well characterized by any item or construct. Class 4 was well characterized by passive suicidal ideation, active thoughts of killing oneself, and the absence of suicidal behaviors. Class 4 was also modestly characterized by ambivalent suicidal ideation and thoughts about specific ways or methods of attempting suicide. Class 5 was well characterized by passive suicidal ideation (84.0%-100%), active suicidal ideation (86.7%-95.0%), and thoughts about specific ways or methods to attempt suicide (97.4%) and a specific place (92.1%) to attempt suicide. Among non–gun owners, class 5 also had the greatest probability of endorsing a recent suicide attempt, ranging from 14.9% for reaching out for help to 29.7% for starting an attempt, then changing one's mind.

### Predictors of suicidal ideation among depressed veterans and the interpersonal theory of suicide [^112itpm6]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We assessed whether key constructs of the interpersonal theory of suicide were associated with suicidal ideation in depressed US Veterans.

Methods

443 patients of the Veterans Health Administration diagnosed with a depressive disorder completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and Beck Hopelessness Scale, from which we derived measures of burdensomeness, belongingness, and hopelessness consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide. Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia).

Results

Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up.

Limitations

The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide.

Conclusion

We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Hopelessness appears to be an important determinant of passive suicidal ideation, while somatic-affective depression symptoms may be a key contributor to active suicidal ideation.

### Effect of intravenous ketamine on suicidality in adults with treatment-resistant depression: a real world effectiveness study [^115QPvAu]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Suicidal ideation is a significant symptom associated with mood disorders. Ketamine is an emerging treatment with rapid and robust antidepressant and antisuicidal effects observed in clinical trial populations. Herein we assessed the real-world effectiveness of ketamine in ameliorating suicidality. A retroactive chart analysis of 96 adult TRD patients that received treatment in a private community clinic in Toronto, Ontario was conducted. Suicidality and depressive symptom outcomes were assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (self-report version) and the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR16) respectively. The effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation was modelled using generalized estimating equations adjusting for demographic predictors and depressive symptom severity. A mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate the contribution of the antidepressant effects of ketamine on its antisuicidal properties. Mean C-SSRS score significantly decreased following a single ketamine infusion and was indicative of a reduction in suicidality from active to passive suicidal ideation on a group level. Results of the mediation analysis indicated that the antisuicidal effects of ketamine are partially independent of its antidepressant effects. Our study supports the use of ketamine in treating suicidal ideation in a real-world setting with benefits comparable to clinical trials.

### Assessment of latent subgroups with suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior among gun owners and non-gun owners in the US [^112EwuLs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of the present study include the large sample size and use of quota sampling, which allowed us to enroll enough participants with suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicidal behavior to examine various combinations of these variables at the participant level. Although quota sampling does not necessarily produce samples that are representative of the population, the sample recruited in this study was within 10% of the US Census general population percentagesfor all demographic variables, and the estimated rate of firearm ownership in our study is very similar to the rate reported in a previous study using probability sampling.

This study also has limitations. The cross-sectional design restricted our ability to examine directional associations among suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicidal behaviors. For example, gun owners and non–gun owners may differ with respect to specific temporal patterns of emergence, such that passive suicidal ideation may have emerged before active suicidal ideation for some participants whereas active suicidal ideation may have emerged before passive suicidal ideation for others. We also were unable to make conclusions about causal relationships. Second, our survey assessed firearm ownership rather than firearm availability. Firearm ownership as a concept and term may be subject to a broader range of definitions and interpretations than firearm availability, which refers to physical proximity and/or access to a firearm. For example, a participant may live in a residence with someone who keeps a firearm, but the participant may not identify as a gun owner because they define gun owner as someone who acquires and then maintains personal responsibility for a firearm. A different participant with those same circumstances may instead identify as a gun owner because they define gun owner as someone who lives in a residence where a firearm is present. Further research is warranted to investigate whether the observed pattern of results is maintained when groupings are based on firearm availability or firearm ownership. Third, we were unable to ascertain whether firearms were obtained before or after the emergence of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Fourth, because we did not ask participants to report the specific ways or methods of suicide they were considering, we were unable to determine whether specific ways or methods of suicide that were considered at higher rates among gun owners in some classes involved firearms or other possible suicide attempt methods.

### Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adults with hoarding disorder [^114JTZqN]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4. Relationship between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and mood disorder diagnosis (SCID-5-RV)

The Pearson Chi-square showed a significant difference when examining passive SI and lifetime diagnosis of MDD (X2 (1, N = 68) = 10.813, p = .001), indicating that individuals with HD with a lifetime diagnosis of a mood disorder exhibited higher levels of lifetime passive SI than those without such diagnosis. Similarly, the analysis revealed a significant difference concerning active SI and lifetime diagnosis of MDD (X2 (1, N = 58) = 4.175, p = .041), suggesting that individuals with HD with a lifetime diagnosis of a mood disorder also demonstrated higher levels of lifetime active SI compared to those without such a diagnosis.

Lifetime passive SI was associated with mood disorder diagnosis (X2 (1, N = 68) = 10.161, p = .001) such that those with lifetime diagnosis of a mood disorder had higher levels of passive SI than those without a diagnosis. We did not see a significant association between active SI and lifetime diagnosis of a mood disorder (X2 (1, N = 58) = 2.534, p = .111). A greater proportion of individuals with lifetime diagnosis of mood disorder reported lifetime active SI than those without; however, this association did not meet the threshold for statistical significance.

### The association of trait impulsivity and suicidal ideation and its fluctuation in the context of the interpersonal theory of suicide [^111X6nx3]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the relationship of trait impulsivity and suicidal behavior is well established, its relationship with suicidal ideation and its fluctuation still remains unclear. Our aim is to examine (1) the relationship of trait impulsivity and suicidal ideation and behavior in the context of the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) and (2) the association of trait impulsivity with the fluctuation of suicidal ideation in an inpatient sample with unipolar depression.

Method

Eighty-four inpatients with unipolar depression and current and/or lifetime suicidal ideation were assessed with a baseline assessment including trait impulsivity, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior and the constructs of the IPTS. Seventy-four of these patients underwent a 6-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with 10 assessments per day across six days assessing passive and active suicidal ideation. Mean squared successive differences (MSSD) across EMA assessments of suicidal ideation were calculated to test fluctuation as an indicator of temporal variability. Correlation analyses were conducted to test the associations.

Results

There were no associations of trait impulsivity with suicidal ideation, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, except the rather low but significant association between thwarted belongingness and the attention subdomain of trait impulsivity (r = 0.23*, p ≤ 0.05). Moreover, trait impulsivity showed a significant positive correlation with capability for suicide but not with the two subdomains of capability for suicide. The only significant but rather low correlation was identified between the motor aspect of trait impulsivity and fearlessness about death (r = 0.26, p ≤ 0.01). Suicidal behavior showed a positive correlation with trait impulsivity, but not with the different subdomains of trait impulsivity. Trait impulsivity showed a significant correlation with the MSSD of passive suicidal ideation (r = 0.26, p ≤ 0.05), but not with active suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the motor aspect of trait impulsivity (BIS motor) showed a significant correlation (r = 0.32, p ≤ 0.01) with the MSSD of passive suicidal ideation, but not with active suicidal ideation or the MSSD total score.

Conclusion

Overall the findings are in line with our assumptions and the IPTS and underline that trait impulsivity is related to suicidal behavior and the fluctuation of suicidal ideation, but not to suicidal ideation itself. Thus, trait impulsivity seems to act as a distal risk factor via capability for suicide and it seems to play a role for the dynamics of suicidal ideation. The results have to be investigated in larger samples, with a higher risk of suicide and in prospective studies. Moreover, the role of the fluctuation of suicidal ideation for the prediction of suicide risk should be investigated in future studies.

### Prevalence and family-related factors associated with suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and self-injury in children aged 9 to 10 years [^112YjeHq]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Although suicide is a leading cause of death for children in the United States, and the rate of suicide in childhood has steadily increased, little is known about suicidal ideation and behaviors in children.

Objective

To assess the overall prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury, as well as family-related factors associated with suicidality and self-injury among preadolescent children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study using retrospective analysis of the baseline sample from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. This multicenter investigation used an epidemiologically informed school-based recruitment strategy, with consideration of the demographic composition of the 21 ABCD sites and the United States as a whole. The sample included children aged 9 to 10 years and their caregivers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Lifetime suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury as reported by children and their caregivers in a computerized version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia.

Results

A total of 11 814 children aged 9 to 10 years (47.8% girls; 52.0% white) and their caregivers were included. After poststratification sociodemographic weighting, the approximate prevalence rates were 6.4% (95% CI, 5.7%-7.3%) for lifetime history of passive suicidal ideation; 4.4% (95% CI, 3.9%-5.0%) for nonspecific active suicidal ideation; 2.4% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.7%) for active ideation with method, intent, or plan; 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%) for suicide attempts; and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.1–10.3) for nonsuicidal self-injury. After covarying by sex, family history, internalizing and externalizing problems, and relevant psychosocial variables, high family conflict was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07–1.16) and nonsuicidal self-injury (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05–1.14), and low parental monitoring was significantly associated with ideation (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95–0.98), attempts (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86–0.97), and nonsuicidal self-injury (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.98); these findings were consistent after internal replication. Most of children's reports of suicidality and self-injury were either unknown or not reported by their caregivers.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study demonstrates the association of family factors, including high family conflict and low parental monitoring, with suicidality and self-injury in children. Future research and ongoing prevention and intervention efforts may benefit from the examination of family factors.

Measures

Outcome

SI was assessed according to the individual answer at the item 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)in its Italian validation. Item 9 is scored as follows: 0 ("I don't have any thoughts of harming myself"), which indicates the absence of SI; 1 ("I have thoughts of harming myself, but I would not carry them out"), which indicate passive SI; 2 ("I would like to kill myself"); or 3 ("I would kill myself if I had the chance"), which indicate active SI. Item responses were dichotomized into: (i) presence of SI (assigned category of 1) in which we merged participants who scored 1, 2 and 3, and (ii) absence of SI (assigned category of 0) for those who reported a score of 0. This method is widely used in research to assess the presence of SI, and has shown to have predictive validity for death by suicide and suicide attempts.

Suicidal ideation and behavior

Daily suicidal ideation and behavior were recorded over the past 4 months at each study visit using a timeline followback interview, which was administered after the LSI to avoid the influence of suicide-related events on reporting of LSI events. Information regarding the occurrence and type of any suicidal ideation or behavior during the timeframe was first obtained using the full C-SSRS interview, with a calendar to specify dates of occurrence. Once it was established that a participant experienced any suicidal ideation or behavior during a specified 4-month timeframe with the C-SSRS, the calendar was used to identify the dates on which suicidal ideation and/or behaviors occurred. Participants reported any daily suicidal ideation (0 = no, 1 = yes), including either active or passive ideation (e.g. wishing to be dead or not wake up). Although information on specific types of suicidal behaviors (i.e. preparatory behaviors and aborted, interrupted, and actual attempts) was collected as part of the C-SSRS and TLFB procedures (see Table 2), base rates of each individual type of suicidal behavior were too infrequent to analyze separately. Therefore, in the analyses, daily suicidal behavior was operationalized as a binary outcome indicating the occurrence of any type of suicidal behavior that day (0 = no, 1 = yes). Daily number of standard alcoholic drinks and presence of non-suicidal self-injury and psychoactive druguse were alsorecorded. There were 64,731 days of timeline followback data, with an average of 422.66 (SD = 112.75) days per person. Suicidal ideation was reported during the timeline followback timeframe by all 143 (100%) participants and on 13,899 occasions, and suicidal behavior was reported by 45 (31.5%) participants and on 104 occasions. ICCs were.49 for suicidal ideation and.45 for suicidal behavior, indicating that a sizable proportion of variability was within persons.

31 into a particular trial is a separate matter that is determined largely by the questions that the trial 32 is intended to address. 33 34 The principles discussed in this guidance for the prospective assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior involve actively querying patients about the occurrence of suicidal thinking and 36 behavior, rather than relying on patients to report such occurrences spontaneously, followed by. 129 this distinction helps ensure that what is labeled as a suicide attempt does in fact meet criteria for 130 such a designation.

### Gun violence exposure and suicide among black adults… [^115GDY36]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

We measured suicidal ideation using 8 items from the self-report version of the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview. 29 Respondents were asked, "Have you ever had any of the following thoughts for more than a few minutes. Choose all that apply. " The items included the following: "I wish I could disappear or not exist, " "I wish I was never born, " "My life is not worth living, " "I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up, " "I wish I were dead, " "Maybe I should kill myself, " "I should kill myself, " and "I'm going to kill myself". We used logistic regression models to examine the association between individual types of GVE and suicidal ideation. We analyzed associations between individual GVEs and suicidal behaviors in a subsample of respondents who indicated having ever experienced suicidal thoughts.

The subsample analysis aligned with ideation-to-action theories of suicide to ensure that we captured the association between exposures and specific suicidal behaviors, rather than simply proxying actual behaviors for suicidal ideation in the full sample. 30, 31 We repeated these steps to analyze associations between cumulative GVE and all outcomes. Past research suggests an association between GVE and risk for suicidal ideation, although these studies did not focus on Black individuals in the US, were limited to specific populations, 27 and used measures that captured limited GVEs. 16 We found that specific forms of GVE and cumulative GVE were associated with lifetime suicidal thoughts among Black US adults.

Importantly, the Three Step Theory of Suicide notes that capacity to transition from suicidal ideation to action can be influenced by repeated exposure to painful and provocative events. 31 Within this context, our findings suggest that GVE is associated with specific suicidal behaviors, underscoring that GVE may act not only as a facilitator of suicidal thought but also as a factor associated with decisions to act on such thoughts. It is also necessary to assess how GVE conceptualized as a traumatic experience corresponds with greater risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors compared with other forms of trauma, such as experiencing a severe automotive crash or other types of assault. 36, 37 A clearer understanding of these distinctions is critical to properly inform policy and clinical prescriptions for addressing gun violence as a distinct form of traumatic exposure.
