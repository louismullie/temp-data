## Question

What conditions (that are not causing any symptoms except maybe myalgias) can cause the following lab results: AST 50, ALT 92, Alkaline Phosphatase 62, Total bilirubin 0.5, and a normal BMP and CBC?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which conditions could explain an asymptomatic patient (maybe with myalgias) with AST 50, ALT 92, ALP 62, and total bilirubin 0.5, and how to interpret and work this up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and classifying the pattern of liver injury. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies given the hepatocellular pattern and the absence of symptoms. Next, I will outline the initial diagnostic workup, including medication review, viral hepatitis, metabolic and autoimmune screening, and imaging. After that, I need to consider less common causes and extrahepatic sources of AST/ALT. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential, propose a management plan, and define thresholds for escalation and biopsy, ensuring I double-check each step against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and classify the injury pattern. ALT 92 is about 2–3× ULN and AST 50 is about 1–2× ULN, with ALP 62 and bilirubin 0.5 both normal, which fits a mild hepatocellular pattern rather than cholestatic or mixed injury; I should calculate the R ratio to be precise, and ALT/ALP here is roughly 92/62 ≈ 1.5, which is less than 2, but wait, let me verify the R ratio formula because I initially thought this might be mixed; the R ratio is (ALT/ULN) ÷ (ALP/ULN), so if ULN for ALT is ~40 and ALP ~100, then R ≈ (92/40) ÷ (62/100) ≈ 2.3 ÷ 0.62 ≈ 3.7, which actually places this in the mixed range by definition, even though the bilirubin is normal and the clinical picture is mild, so I should keep that in mind while still prioritizing hepatocellular causes given ALT predominance and the magnitude of elevation [^116MrpTo] [^114zraiE].

> Next, I should review the most common causes of mild, asymptomatic aminotransferase elevation. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the leading cause in the general population and often presents with ALT > AST and mild elevations; given the absence of symptoms, this remains high on the list, but I need to check for metabolic risk factors and imaging evidence of steatosis to support it [^113Yditq] [^116mi66H]. Alcohol-related liver disease is less likely here because ALT exceeds AST and bilirubin is normal, but I should confirm alcohol intake carefully before excluding it, since AST:ALT > 1.5 with bilirubin > 3 mg/dL would be more typical of alcoholic hepatitis [^113Yditq] [^111vj9Yq]. Drug-induced liver injury is common and requires a meticulous medication and supplement history, including OTC and herbal agents, with attention to agents like acetaminophen, statins, fibrates, and others that can cause mild, transient elevations [^112eit57].

> I will now examine the initial workup. I need to ensure I obtain a comprehensive medication and supplement inventory with start/stop dates, quantify alcohol use, and screen for metabolic syndrome with BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose or A1c, and a lipid panel; I should also order hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody with reflex RNA if positive, and consider iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation to screen for hemochromatosis, while remembering that up to 20% of the general population can have mildly increased liver enzymes from NAFLD, alcohol, or other common conditions, so I should avoid overcalling DILI prematurely [^1127L5Xo] [^112mcruX]. If initial serologies are unrevealing and enzymes persist, I should add autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, AMA) and consider Wilson disease testing with ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper when age and context fit, and I should obtain a right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess for steatosis, biliary dilation, masses, or other structural disease [^1127L5Xo].

> Hold on, I should verify extrahepatic and less common contributors before concluding. Muscle disorders can elevate AST more than ALT; if myalgias are present or AST is disproportionate, I should check CK, LDH, and aldolase to assess for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, and remember that statins can cause myalgias and rare myopathy while usually not causing clinically significant hepatotoxicity, so I need to correlate symptoms and muscle markers before attributing liver injury to statins alone [^111AXKbt] [^114qoNNp] [^115pTTu2]. Thyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, can alter liver enzymes, so TSH with selective free T4 is reasonable if clinical clues exist or if the evaluation is otherwise unrevealing [^111AXKbt]. Celiac disease can be associated with mild transaminase elevations, so tissue transglutaminase IgA with total IgA is a reasonable screen in the right clinical context or if enzymes persist without another cause [^111AXKbt].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis explicitly and prioritize. Most likely is NAFLD given prevalence and the ALT-predominant, mild elevation with normal bilirubin and ALP; next is medication or supplement-induced liver injury, particularly with new agents in the prior 6 months; alcoholic liver disease is possible but less likely given ALT > AST and normal bilirubin; chronic viral hepatitis remains in the differential until screened; autoimmune hepatitis and hemochromatosis are less likely but should be excluded if enzymes persist; less common entities like Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and celiac disease can be considered selectively based on age, risk, and persistence; extrahepatic sources such as muscle injury or thyroid disease should be kept in mind, especially if AST predominates or symptoms suggest myopathy or endocrine dysfunction [^113Yditq] [^116mi66H] [^1127L5Xo].

> I should double-check thresholds for urgency and when to escalate. Clinically significant DILI is typically defined by AST or ALT > 5× ULN, ALP > 2× ULN, bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL with enzyme elevation, or INR > 1.5 with enzyme elevation; this patient does not meet those thresholds, so immediate drug withdrawal is not mandated solely by numbers, though any nonessential hepatotoxins should still be stopped pragmatically while the workup proceeds [^113s1NHW] [^114zraiE]. If enzymes persist beyond 3–6 months or rise above 5× ULN, I should broaden serologic testing, repeat imaging, and consider liver biopsy to clarify etiology and stage disease, particularly if autoimmune disease is suspected or if noninvasive tests suggest advanced fibrosis [^1127L5Xo] [^112o4UP2].

> Now, I will outline management contingent on likely etiologies. If NAFLD is suspected, I should emphasize weight loss, dietary modification, and exercise, treat metabolic risk factors, and monitor for progression; if a medication is implicated, I should discontinue it when feasible and recheck enzymes in 4–8 weeks; if viral hepatitis is identified, I should treat according to current guidance; if autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed, I should initiate immunosuppression and refer to hepatology; if no cause is found and enzymes remain mildly elevated, observation with periodic reassessment is acceptable, recognizing that up to 10% of adults can have persistent mild transaminase elevations without identifiable liver disease on thorough evaluation [^113nLMvo] [^1127L5Xo].

> But wait, what if the enzymes rise or new features appear? I need to ensure a safety net: if AST or ALT increase to > 5× ULN, if bilirubin rises to > 2.5 mg/dL with enzyme elevation, or if INR becomes > 1.5 with enzyme elevation, I should urgently reassess for acute liver injury, discontinue potential hepatotoxins, and consider inpatient observation or hepatology referral; if cholestatic features emerge with disproportionate ALP elevation, I should confirm hepatic origin with GGT and obtain cholangiographic imaging to evaluate for obstruction or cholangiopathies [^114zraiE] [^114Kk3U6] [^114k6r3r].

> In summary, the most parsimonious explanation for AST 50, ALT 92, ALP 62, and bilirubin 0.5 in an asymptomatic patient is a mild hepatocellular injury pattern most consistent with NAFLD, with drug-induced liver injury as a close alternative pending medication review; alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis remain important exclusions, and autoimmune, genetic, and extrahepatic causes should be considered if initial evaluation is unrevealing or if abnormalities persist or progress; I should confirm the pattern, execute a guideline-based workup, and tailor management to the identified etiology while maintaining vigilance for red flags that would prompt escalation [^1127L5Xo] [^113Yditq] [^113s1NHW].

The most likely causes of **mild, asymptomatic AST/ALT elevation** with normal ALP and bilirubin are **NAFLD** [^113nLMvo], **medication-induced liver injury** (statins, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, SSRIs, antibiotics) [^113s1NHW], **alcohol use** [^116ncq3D], and **chronic viral hepatitis** (HBV, HCV) [^1155asMt]. Less common causes include **autoimmune hepatitis** [^1127L5Xo], **Wilson disease** [^114i1ouT], **celiac disease** [^111AXKbt], and **thyroid dysfunction** [^113Yditq]. Evaluate with a focused history, medication review, alcohol assessment, metabolic risk factors, and serologies for hepatitis B/C, autoimmune markers, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, and TSH; obtain an abdominal ultrasound if enzymes remain elevated or if NAFLD is suspected [^1127L5Xo] [^1155asMt].

---

## Common causes

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

- **Prevalence**: Very common; affects ~25% of adults globally [^113Yditq].
- **Labs**: Mild AST/ALT elevation (usually ALT > AST), normal ALP/bilirubin [^116mi66H].
- **Risk factors**: Obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome [^116mi66H].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound shows hepatic steatosis [^notfound].

---

### Medication-induced liver injury (DILI)

- **Common agents**: Statins, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, SSRIs, antibiotics, herbal supplements [^notfound].
- **Pattern**: Hepatocellular injury with mild AST/ALT elevation, normal ALP/bilirubin [^notfound].
- **Course**: Often transient and resolves after stopping the drug [^117G2zgw].

---

### Alcohol-related liver disease

Alcohol-related liver disease presents with **mild AST/ALT elevation** (AST > ALT in a 2:1 ratio), normal ALP/bilirubin, and a history of regular or heavy alcohol use [^116ncq3D]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by history and exclusion of other causes [^114mwBou].

---

### Chronic viral hepatitis

Chronic viral hepatitis (**HBV, HCV**) causes persistent mild AST/ALT elevation with normal ALP/bilirubin. Serologies for HBsAg and anti-HCV confirm the diagnosis [^1127L5Xo].

---

## Less common causes

| **Condition** | **Key features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|
| Autoimmune hepatitis | - Mild AST/ALT elevation <br/> - Female predominance <br/> - Other autoimmune diseases | - ANA <br/> - ASMA <br/> - IgG [^1127L5Xo] |
| Wilson disease | - Young patients <br/> - Neurologic symptoms <br/> - Low ALP | - Ceruloplasmin <br/> - 24-hour urinary copper [^115DXKXP] |
| Celiac disease | - GI symptoms <br/> - Nutrient deficiencies | - Tissue transglutaminase IgA <br/> - Total IgA [^111AXKbt] |
| Thyroid dysfunction | - Hypo/hyperthyroid symptoms | - TSH <br/> - Free T4 [^111AXKbt] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Confirm abnormality**: Repeat AST/ALT, ALP, bilirubin [^115PkWRv].
- **History**: Medications, alcohol, metabolic risk factors, symptoms [^115PkWRv].
- **Serologies**: Hepatitis B/C, autoimmune markers, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, TSH [^1127L5Xo].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound if persistent elevation or NAFLD suspected [^112yo3Df].

---

## Clinical significance

Mild, persistent AST/ALT elevation is associated with increased risk of **progressive liver disease** and metabolic complications; therefore, identify and manage underlying causes to reduce long-term morbidity [^111TQ656] [^113nLMvo].

---

The most likely causes of mild, asymptomatic AST/ALT elevation with normal ALP and bilirubin are **NAFLD**, **medications**, **alcohol**, and **chronic viral hepatitis**; a structured evaluation with history, serologies, and imaging guides diagnosis and management [^113Yditq].

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Safety and tolerability of dalcetrapib (RO4607381 / JTT-705): results from a 48-week trial [^112YCkKZ]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests

Four percent of participants in each treatment group experienced elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). In the dalcetrapib group, CPK elevations > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 2% (2/89) of participants and CPK elevations > 5 × ULN in 1% (1/89) of participants; also with elevated levels at baseline (> 1 but < 3 × ULN). In the placebo group, 2% (1/45) of participants experienced CPK elevations > 3 × ULN. Additionally, 1% (1/89) of participants administered dalcetrapib experienced ALT elevations > 3 × ULN, and 2% (1/45) of participants administered placebo experienced elevations in both ALT (> 5 × ULN) and AST (> 5 × ULN). Aspartate aminotransferase elevations > 3 × ULN were not observed with dalcetrapib. No participants with CPK elevations experienced myalgia, and no participant permanently discontinued treatment due to liver enzyme elevations. Treatment was interrupted for one dalcetrapib participant due to increased (> 3 × ULN) levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ALT, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) on Day 19. This participant also had elevated ALP and GGT levels on Days 22, 28, 37, 55, 70, and 118, which progressively returned to normal. Elevation in ALP > 3 × ULN on Days 19 and 22 was not considered clinically significant (the definition being ALP and AST > 3 × ULN on two occasions ≥ 4 days apart). The AE was considered mild and possibly related to treatment by the investigator and resolved without sequelae.

### Fenofibric acid [^113XVwDp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including liver transplantation and death, has been reported with postmarketing use of fenofibrates, including fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. DILI has been reported within the first few weeks of treatment or after several months of therapy and in some cases has reversed with discontinuation of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules treatment. Patients with DILI have experienced signs and symptoms including dark urine, abnormal stool, jaundice, malaise, abdominal pain, myalgia, weight loss, pruritus, and nausea. Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis.

In clinical trials, an intermediate daily dosage or the maximum recommended daily dosage of fenofibrate have been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases may be dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, including those with unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities. Monitor patient's liver function, including serum ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, at baseline and periodically for the duration of therapy with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. Discontinue fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist (ALT or AST > 3 times the upper limit of normal, or if accompanied by elevation of bilirubin). Do not restart fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Causes and evaluation of mildly elevated liver transaminase levels [^113Yditq]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase are commonly discovered in asymptomatic patients in primary care. Evidence to guide the diagnostic workup is limited. If the history and physical examination do not suggest a cause, a stepwise evaluation should be initiated based on the prevalence of diseases that cause mild elevations in transaminase levels. The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can affect up to 30 percent of the population. Other common causes include alcoholic liver disease, medication-associated liver injury, viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), and hemochromatosis. Less common causes include α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic conditions (e.g., thyroid disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, muscle disorders) can also cause elevated liver transaminase levels. Initial testing should include a fasting lipid profile; measurement of glucose, serum iron, and ferritin; total iron-binding capacity; and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody testing. If test results are normal, a trial of lifestyle modification with observation or further testing for less common causes is appropriate. Additional testing may include ultrasonography; measurement of α(1)-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin; serum protein electrophoresis; and antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 testing. Referral for further evaluation and possible liver biopsy is recommended if transaminase levels remain elevated for six months or more.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114bdCmA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — actions by aminotransferase severity specify etiologic evaluation thresholds and urgent referral criteria. For ALT and/or AST levels > 5X ULN, evaluate for viral hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and NAFLD, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and consider drugs/supplement‑related, ischemic, and DILI causes. For 5–15X ULN, also assess for acute hepatitis A, B, and C in addition to etiologies for AST/ALT elevation less than 5× ULN. For > 15X ULN, or massive ALT > 10,000 IU/L, also assess for acetaminophen toxicity and ischemic hepatopathy (shock liver). A patient with acute hepatitis plus elevated prothrombin time and/or encephalopathy requires immediate referral to a liver specialist. All are Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^1157p9A9]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including liver transplantation and death, have been reported postmarketing with fenofibric acid. DILI has been reported within the first few weeks of treatment or after several months of therapy and in some cases has reversed with discontinuation of fenofibric acid treatment. Patients with DILI have experienced signs and symptoms including dark urine, abnormal stool, jaundice, malaise, abdominal pain, myalgia, weight loss, pruritus, and nausea. Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis.

In clinical trials, fenofibric acid at a dose of 135 mg daily has been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy may be dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Fenofibric acid is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities [see Contraindications (4)]. Monitor patient's liver function, including serum ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, at baseline and periodically for the duration of therapy with fenofibric acid. Discontinue fenofibric acid if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist (ALT or AST > 3 times the upper limit of normal, or if accompanied by elevation of bilirubin). Do not restart fenofibric acid in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Febuxostat [^111ozpeq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatic Effects

Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found.

Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring.

5.4 Serious Skin Reactions

Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115LHnCm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity — drug-induced liver injury (DILI) following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is more common in HCV/HIV coinfection than in HIV mono-infection, and individuals with HCV/HIV coinfection who have advanced liver disease are at greatest risk; eradicating HCV infection with treatment may decrease the likelihood of ARV-associated DILI. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of ART and at least every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and more often if clinically indicated. Mild to moderate fluctuations in ALT and/or AST levels (< 5 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) are typical in individuals with chronic HCV infection and, in the absence of signs or symptoms of liver disease or increases in bilirubin, do not warrant interruption of ART but warrant monitoring to ensure a return to baseline. Patients with significant elevations in ALT or AST levels (> 5 times ULN), concomitant increase in total bilirubin, or concomitant symptoms (weakness, nausea, vomiting) should be evaluated for liver insufficiency and alternative causes of liver injury, and if these signs and symptoms do not resolve, ART should be discontinued.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.

Hepatic causes where ALT > AST include NAFLD, steatosis, NASH, chronic viral hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis, medications and drug-induced liver injury with prescription medications, herbal products and supplements, and over-the-counter agents; additional hepatic causes listed include toxic hepatitis (amatoxin exposure), hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, celiac disease, acute bile duct obstruction, liver trauma, post-liver surgery, veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, diffuse infiltration of the liver with cancer, HELLP syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, sepsis, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Non-hepatic causes listed include skeletal muscle damage/rhabdomyolysis, cardiac muscle damage, thyroid disease, Macro-AST, strenuous exercise, heat stroke, hemolysis, and adrenal insufficiency.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): a review of pathophysiology, clinical management and effects of weight loss [^114BZQzk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Symptoms and signs

The majority of the patients with NAFLD do not experience any symptoms, however some of them may complain of fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, hepatomegaly, acanthosis nigricans, and lipomatosis. A significant amount of patients with cirrhosis can be present themselves with end-stage liver disease. In approximately 48–100% NASH can be asymptomatic and very often it is discovered during medical evaluations for other reasons. Although clinical stigmata of chronic liver failure are rarely seen in this population, one study showed that at the time of diagnosis splenomegaly was present in 25% of the patients.

Very often a diagnosis like NASH or NAFLD is discovered due to abnormal liver function tests such as aminotransferases (ALT and AST) or incidental finding of hepatic steatosis on radiologic abdominal finding. Hepatomegaly can present during physical examination and this is caused by the liver's fatty infiltration.

Laboratory findings

When performing laboratory tests, serum markers like aminotransferases (AST, ALT), are mild to moderately elevated. However, the AST and ALT levels can be aspecific in patients with NAFLD or related conditions. In other words, AST and ALT levels can either be elevated or normal, but both do exclude the presence of NAFLD. In patients with NAFLD, ALT elevations are more common than elevations of AST. The ALT levels tend to be higher in NASH than in simple steatosis. Elevated serum ferritin levels are commonly elevated in patients with NAFLD, and increased transferrin saturation is found in 6–11% of patients.

Other markers of interest are alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and clotting factors. In patients with NAFLD ALP can be abnormal and even be elevated 2–3 times the upper limit of its normal value.

In addition, other laboratory values can be helpful in diagnosing NAFLD. Both albumin and bilirubin levels may be high in patients who have developed chronic progressive disease. In cirrhotic patients laboratory measurements of clotting times can be abnormal. Most of the time patients who have developed cirrhosis have a prolonged prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia, and a concomitant neutropenia.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^11154Hag]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — diagnostic entry criteria and initial steps for suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include biochemical evidence of liver injury meeting one of these criteria: 1) AST or ALT > 5x ULN, or ALP > 2x ULN (or pretreatment baseline if abnormal) on 2 separate occasions, 2) Total serum bilirubin > 2.5mg/dL with elevated AST, ALT or ALP level, or 3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT or ALP. DILI suspected based on clinical history, symptoms, and/or physical exam: 1) Assess exposure to all prescription and over the counter medications, HDS products, and toxins, including start and stop dates, especially within the preceding 6 months; 2) Discontinue any non-essential medications and supplements. Determine R ratio R = ALT/ULN ALP/ULN and classify as R ≥ 5: Hepatocellular, R value 2–5: Mixed, or R ≤ 2: Cholestatic.

### Liver biochemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113pbPRG]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to elevated liver biochemistries in approximately half of patients on presentation. To date, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19.

Approach and Results

A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. The mean age was 57 years, 65% were male, and 28% were Hispanic. At the study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 were discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for a median of 12 days. Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission. Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, whereas alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak. Statin use was common before (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and nonusers. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05), peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003), and peak ALT (220 vs. 52; P = 0.002) were higher in intubated patients.

Conclusions

AST-dominant aminotransferase elevation is common in COVID-19, mirrors disease severity, and appears to reflect true hepatic injury.

### Fezolinetant (Veozah) [^111RYoWN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

In three clinical trials, elevations in serum transaminase [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] levels > 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 2.3% [exposure adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of 2.7 per 100 person-years] of women receiving VEOZAH and 0.9% (EAIR of 1.5 per 100 person-years) of women receiving placebo. No elevations in serum total bilirubin (> 2 x ULN) occurred. Women with ALT or AST elevations were generally asymptomatic. Transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels (or close to these) without sequelae with dose continuation, and upon dose interruption, or discontinuation. Women with cirrhosis were not studied [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the postmarketing setting, cases of drug-induced liver injury with elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin occurred within 40 days of starting VEOZAH. Patients reported a general sense of feeling unwell and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, and dark urine. The patients' signs and symptoms gradually resolved after discontinuation of VEOZAH [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Perform baseline hepatic laboratory tests to evaluate for hepatic function and injury [including serum ALT, serum AST, serum ALP, and serum bilirubin (total and direct)] prior to VEOZAH initiation. Do not start VEOZAH if ALT or AST is ≥ 2 x ULN or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory.

Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory tests monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months after initiation of therapy.

Advise patients to discontinue VEOZAH immediately and seek medical attention including hepatic laboratory tests if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury:

new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain.

Discontinue VEOZAH if:

transaminase elevations are > 5 x ULN.
transaminase elevations are > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin is > 2 x ULN.

If transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution.

Exclude alternative causes of hepatic laboratory test elevations.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Rare cause of abdominal pain and fever in a pregnant woman [^113YkAZh]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

A pregnant woman (third trimester) presented with intense abdominal pain, nausea and myalgia. The patient was obese (body mass index 38) and was being treated for high blood pressure, hyperuricemia and hypothyroidism. She had chronic renal deficiency related to focal segmental glomerular sclerosis requiring dialysis. The physical examination at admission revealed a fever of 39°C and an acute abdomen with abdominal guarding in the right upper quadrant without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. There were no clinical signs of pre-eclampsia. Fetal ultrasound and a Doppler of the umbilical vessels were normal. Laboratory tests showed normal liver and liver function (total protein 95%, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin normal). The white cell count was 10×10⁹/l (90% neutrophils), with a normal platelet count. Blood, urine and vaginal cultures were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed isolated thickening of the gallbladder wall without cholelithiasis. Empirical antibiotic treatment was begun with intravenous amoxicillin. Six days later, the patient's condition had worsened with increased abdominal pain, persistent fever and liver test abnormalities (AST-ALT 6N). However, bilirubin, hepatic synthesis tests, as well as leucocyte and platelet counts were still normal. A caesarean section followed by coelioscopy was decided. Coelioscopy revealed a liver with numerous necrotic spots (see figure 1).gutjnl;66/11/1911/GUTJNL2016313097F1F1GUTJNL2016313097F1Figure 1Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a liver surface covered with numerous white necrotic spots.

### Lomitapide mesylate (Juxtapid) [^116fHboP]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases. In the JUXTAPID clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated with JUXTAPID had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3× upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

JUXTAPID also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST are ≥ 3× ULN. Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^115deK9W]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

In this review, we have summarized the recent reports of COVID-19-related liver injury, data that are obviously changing rapidly day by day. Although the pathophysiology behind liver injury in COVID-19 remains unresolved, several theories have been proposed, but a multifactorial mechanism seems most likely. Undoubtedly, the available clinical data so far show that the incidence of liver impairment in COVID-19 ranged from 6–61%, mainly indicated by abnormal ALT/AST levels (Table 1). However, most of the cases experienced a mild AST/ALT elevation (usually < 3× ULN), accompanied by slightly elevated bilirubin levels. Since ACE2 receptors are expressed especially in the bile ducts, one may suppose that patients should have some degree of cholestasis or jaundice. However, this seems not to be the case in everyday practice and, remarkably, even ICU patients did not present with elevated ALP/GGT.

### Taletrectinib (Ibtrozi) [^113JyNPB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

IBTROZI can cause hepatotoxicity, including drug-induced liver injury and fatal adverse reactions.

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], based on laboratory values, 88% of patients treated with IBTROZI experienced increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), including 10% Grade 3 or 4. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 85% of patients treated with IBTROZI, including 13% Grade 3 or 4. The median time to first onset of AST or ALT elevation was 15 days (range: 3 days to 20.8 months).

Increased AST or ALT each led to dose interruption in 7% of patients. Increased AST and ALT leading to dose reduction occurred in 5% and 9% of patients, respectively. Increased AST and ALT each led to permanent discontinuation of IBTROZI in 0.3% of patients. Other liver-related adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of IBTROZI were hepatotoxicity (0.6% of patients) and increased bilirubin (0.3% of patients).

Concurrent elevations in AST or ALT ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in 2 (0.6%) patients treated with IBTROZI. Fatal liver events occurred in 2 (0.6%) patients.

Monitor liver function tests (AST, ALT, and bilirubin) prior to administration of IBTROZI, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, and then monthly thereafter as clinically indicated with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Withhold, then resume at reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue IBTROZI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^112QSXWb]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contra- indications to statin use. Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, rou- tine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112eit57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Drug and supplement-induced liver injury — medications and supplements are emphasized as common sources: "Prescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well as non-prescribed complementary alternative medicines or dietary supplements, represent a common source for acute and chronic liver injury". Workup demands thorough review, since "Identification of an offending agent is challenging and requires a comprehensive query of the patient, his or her family, and careful review of available medical and pharmacy records and laboratory data (22)". Many drugs can raise enzymes: "Many medications are associated with at least a small risk of elevation of ALT/AST/alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin with or without hepatotoxicity", and for statins "there is an extensive literature on the safety in those with chronic liver disease with only rare cases of hepatotoxicity reported (60,61)". In suspected acetaminophen exposure, clarify use when enzymes are markedly elevated: "In those with high ALT levels (> 1,000IU/l) an accurate history of acetaminophen use either as a single medicine or in combination with analgesic-narcotic combinations is essential". Management often involves withdrawal and monitoring: "Attributing liver injury to a specific agent frequently requires empiric trials of drug discontinuation to observe full recovery of liver chemistries", with substitution or surveillance as needed. Clinicians should ask about supplements — "Specific query for non-prescribed supplements is essential to discovery of associated liver injury" — and be aware that "Common herbal supplements associated with hepatotoxicity include chaparral, ephedra, ji bu huan, germander, green tea extract, and shark cartilage (8,62)". A practical reference is provided: "A helpful resource that is available to clinicians trying to ascertain whether a drug or supplement may be hepatotoxic is the website livertox.nih.gov".

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^114HkZXD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated Liver Enzymes

Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarized in Table 1. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tocilizumab-IV, or reduction in tocilizumab-IV dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

In the all-exposure population, the elevations in ALT and AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials.

In Study WA25204, of the 1538 patients with moderate to severe RA [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and treated with tocilizumab, elevations in ALT or AST > 3 x ULN occurred in 5.3% and 2.2% patients, respectively. One serious event of drug induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia was reported in association with tocilizumab.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".

It is not unusual to encounter abnormal liver enzyme levels on routine blood tests. When the abnormal elevation in aminotransferases persist, they require prompt and appropriate investigations as liver diseases in children are often insidious in onset and clinically silent. This article aims to provide (1) an explanation to the aetiologies of elevated aminotransferases; (2) an investigational approach to these children and (3) an insight into further investigations performed at a liver centre.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

5.3	Hepatic Effects

Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking ULORIC have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in ULORIC and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating ULORIC.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt ULORIC treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue ULORIC if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found.

Permanently discontinue ULORIC in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with ULORIC can be used with close monitoring.

5.4	Serious Skin Reactions

Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking ULORIC. Discontinue ULORIC if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. ULORIC should be used with close monitoring in these patients.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 X ULN is unknown.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### I can feel it in my bones – a case of deranged' liver' function? [^116jVVbP]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35–129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had put down to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11–50) making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including x-ray, CT and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^117G2zgw]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hundreds of drugs are associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), which has a wide spectrum of clinical and biochemical manifestations, ranging from transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases (TAEAT) to acute liver failure. Most cases (> 90%) of DILI resolve fully within several weeks after drug discontinuation, although some cases can persist as chronic low-level enzyme elevations for 6 to 12 months despite the drug cessation. Drug adaptation may also occur, defined as the phenomenon whereby an agent fails to cause progressive worsening of DILI beyond what are generally transient, low-level, asymptomatic reversible alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations despite the drug continuation.

Although international working groups have defined threshold levels of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to distinguish acute DILI from mild elevations, the clinical significance of higher level (ie, grade 3 [G3] and grade 4 [G4]) asymptomatic transient elevations has not been extensively studied, especially in oncology. In addition, there are gaps in the understanding of mechanisms leading to significantly elevated aminotransferase levels, specifically in cases of asymptomatic and transient presentations without clinical signs of hepatocyte damage.

Herein, TAEAT is used to indicate the occurrence of transient asymptomatic G3 and G4 elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) without associated elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase or corresponding histologic liver abnormalities. A review of TAEAT in oncology clinical trials and clinical practice is provided. In addition, the gaps in our current understanding of the phenomenon are identified, including those areas where consensus guidelines and practical suggestions for clinicians involved in managing oncology patients with elevated aminotransferases may offer value.

ALT/AST Elevation

A treatment‐emergent AE of ALT/AST elevation occurred in 149 patients (41.4%; Table 3; see also change from baseline data in Table 5) 26. ALT/AST elevations occurred early, within the first few weeks of rucaparib treatment, and were mostly asymptomatic, transient, and self‐limiting 26. Importantly, these elevations were rarely associated with bilirubin increases; none of the cases of ALT/AST elevation met Hy's Law criteria for drug‐induced liver injury (i.e. ALT/AST > 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN], with concomitant bilirubin > 2 × ULN without substantial alkaline phosphatase elevations [i.e. < 2 × ULN] or another clear reason for elevation) 26, 44, 45. In the early stages of ARIEL2 and Study 10, investigators were cautious about these AEs: 33 patients (8.8%) had a treatment interruption, 19 (5.0%) had a dose reduction, and 1 (0.3%) discontinued treatment because of increased ALT/AST (data on file). The mechanism of action or etiology of the ALT/AST elevations with rucaparib is currently unknown; however, ALT/AST elevations have also been observed with the PARP inhibitor niraparib 8, 9.

Recommendations: for patients taking rucaparib, we recommend that liver function be monitored monthly, including evaluation of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and ALT/AST levels. For patients with elevations in ALT/AST, other causes of liver dysfunction should be ruled out first. In our experience following the final safety assessments, no intervention was required to mitigate mild to moderate (e.g. grade 1–3) ALT/AST elevations provided all other causes were excluded (Table 6). Patients with grade 3 elevations should be monitored closely, and treatment should be interrupted if levels continue to rise or do not decline to grade ≤ 2 within 2 weeks 7. Upon resolution to grade ≤ 2, rucaparib can be resumed at the same or a reduced dosage. Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations require treatment interruption and dose reduction 7.

In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3–4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 x ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with ABIRTEGA, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced ABIRTEGA dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt ABIRTEGA treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with ABIRTEGA at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue ABIRTEGA for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 x ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 x ULN is unknown.

### Medical management of severe alcoholic hepatitis: expert Review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^113AEufE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis diagnostic definition and classification — A consensus working definition includes onset of jaundice within 60 days of heavy alcohol consumption (> 50 g/day) of alcohol for a minimum of 6 months, serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (50–400 U/L), AST:ALT ratio > 1.5, and no other obvious cause for hepatitis; the consensus proposed classifying patients as definite when a liver biopsy was used to establish the diagnosis, probable when clinical and laboratory features were present without potential confounding problems, and possible when confounding problems were present, and prior studies indicated that 10%–15% of subjects diagnosed with acute AH on clinical criteria alone did not have characteristic histologic features on a liver biopsy specimen.

Diagnostic approach to DILI

DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, relying on a detailed medical history including medication exposure, the pattern and course of liver biochemistry tests before and after drug discontinuation, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. The initial laboratory testing for DILI includes serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and total and direct bilirubin levels, whereas serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) levels are a marker of severity (Figure 1). Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI may present with lower levels of laboratory abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries because of NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Marked elevation in serum transaminases: an atypical presentation of choledocholithiasis [^1177apKg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis causes elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1,000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The charts of 18 patients who presented between 1971 and 2002 with documented choledocholithiasis and AST or ALT levels greater than 1,000 IU/L were retrospectively reviewed. An extensive work-up for coexisting disease processes to account for the abnormal AST and ALT levels was negative.

Results

Eighteen patients (16 women, 16 Hispanics, age 38 ± 3 yr) presented with symptoms of choledocholithiasis and marked transaminase elevation. Peak levels of AST and ALT were 1,062 ± 129 and 1,119 ± 90, respectively. Following successful management of gallstone disease, AST and ALT levels fell rapidly to 129 ± 22 and 268 ± 61, respectively, within 3–14 days. There was also a concomitant improvement in the levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusions

In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 1,000 IU/L. These levels fall markedly once the gallstone disease is appropriately managed.

Monitoring for statin-associated side effects — CK and liver enzymes: "it is recommended that CK be measured in the case of severe SAMS and in the presence of objective muscle weakness", and "the FDA recommends measuring transaminases… if there are signs or symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity". An "asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect" that often resolves with dose adjustment, while "Severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases", and evaluation for nonstatin causes "is warranted" if elevations persist. "Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

5.2 Acute Serious Liver Injury

Acute serious liver injury has been observed with ELEVIDYS. Administration of ELEVIDYS may result in elevations of liver enzymes (e.g. GGT, ALT) and total bilirubin, typically seen within 8 weeks.

Patients with preexisting liver impairment, chronic hepatic condition or acute liver disease (e.g., acute hepatic viral infection) may be at higher risk of acute serious liver injury. Postpone ELEVIDYS administration in patients with acute liver disease until resolved or controlled. Patients with hepatic impairment, acute liver disease, chronic hepatic condition or elevated GGT have not been studied in clinical trials with ELEVIDYS [see Specific Populations (8.6)].

In clinical studies, liver function test increased (including increases in GGT, GLDH, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) was commonly reported typically within 8 weeks following ELEVIDYS infusion, with the majority of cases being asymptomatic [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases resolved spontaneously or with systemic corticosteroids and resolved without clinical sequelae within 2 months. No cases of liver failure were reported.

Prior to ELEVIDYS administration, perform liver enzyme test [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor liver function (clinical exam, GGT, and total bilirubin) weekly for the first 3 months following ELEVIDYS infusion. Continue monitoring if clinically indicated, until results are unremarkable (normal clinical exam, GGT and total bilirubin levels return to near baseline levels) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Systemic corticosteroid treatment is recommended for patients before and after ELEVIDYS infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Adjust corticosteroid regimen when indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. If acute serious liver injury is suspected, a consultation with a specialist is recommended.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

Other Abnormal Laboratory Findings

Decreased Absolute Neutrophil Count

Three (6%) patients in ISTURISA arm had at least one measured absolute neutrophil count below the normal limit and one (2%) of these was classified as Grade 3 by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEs) grading. No patients in placebo arm had absolute neutrophil count below normal limit.

Elevated Liver Function Tests

Liver enzyme elevations in patients treated with ISTURISA were infrequent, typically mild and reversed spontaneously. No patient had concurrent increases in AST, ALT and total bilirubin and/or ALP. No patient met the criteria for Hy's Law. Two (4%) patients in ISTURISA arm versus none in placebo arm had ALT or AST > 3 × ULN.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISTURISA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### Allopurinol [^11417bTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^111Yh8sk]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Monitoring liver enzyme elevation

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, routine periodic monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, however, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels > 3× ULN (or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

Take home messages

Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease.
Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins.
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

For children with additional risk factors (such as concomitant antiretroviral therapy [ART]), routine monitoring of liver enzymes should be performed before initiation and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after starting TB treatment (expert opinion). Beyond 2 months, routine testing every 2 to 3 months is advisable for all children receiving ART, or more frequently if clinically indicated (expert opinion). Mild elevations in serum transaminase concentration (i.e., less than 5 times the upper limit of normal) do not require drug discontinuation in children who are asymptomatic and in whom other findings (including bilirubin) are normal (expert opinion).

5.1	Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure

Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients treated with ALYFTREK [Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases of serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury and liver failure have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease who were taking a fixed-dose combination drug containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA), which contains the same or similar active ingredients as ALYFTREK. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating ALYFTREK. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing ELX, TEZ and/or IVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt ALYFTREK in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include:

Significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g. ALT or AST > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST > 3× ULN with bilirubin > 2× ULN)
Clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites)

Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume ALYFTREK treatment with close monitoring.

ALYFTREK should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). ALYFTREK is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
