## Question

Hypopitutarism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to recognize, confirm, and work up hypopituitarism across common and emerging scenarios, with transparent self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect hypopituitarism in practice. Then, I should define the core diagnostic labs and how to interpret them. Next, I will review when dynamic stimulation tests are needed. After that, I will decide who needs pituitary imaging and why. Finally, I will consider key etiologies including pituitary tumors and their treatment, traumatic brain injury, postpartum Sheehan's syndrome, immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy, and special contexts such as incidentalomas, obesity, and "idiopathic" cases where hemochromatosis must be excluded.

> Let me first anchor clinical suspicion because presentations are often nonspecific; fatigue, malaise, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, cognitive decline, or even confusion and coma should prompt consideration, especially in patients with a history of pituitary adenoma surgery or radiotherapy, moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury, postpartum hemorrhage with lactation failure, exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors, prior head or neck radiotherapy, or an incidental sellar lesion identified on imaging, and I need to remind myself this disorder is more common than often assumed and can be insidious, so I should not prematurely dismiss subtle constellations of symptoms [^113dFcuz] [^111m8pY7] [^112TpNVr] [^11148p9p] [^116CVUpZ].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline hormonal panel that efficiently screens key axes; an early morning cortisol with ACTH for the adrenal axis, free T4 with TSH for the thyroid axis (and I need to remember TSH can be misleadingly normal or low-normal in central hypothyroidism), IGF-1 for a first-pass assessment of GH deficiency, LH and FSH with sex steroids when indicated, plus prolactin to detect either hypoprolactinemia from extensive damage or hyperprolactinemia from stalk effect, with the same panel universally recommended in pituitary incidentalomas, while also remembering that in obesity I should not routinely order IGF-1 or GH unless there is substantive suspicion of hypopituitarism [^114vceZP] [^115VSxDG] [^115D3Sp4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from basal labs alone; I should confirm which axes demand dynamic testing, as ACTH deficiency often requires stimulation testing when morning cortisol is indeterminate, GH deficiency typically needs provocation testing when IGF-1 is low or clinical suspicion is high, and arginine vasopressin deficiency is established with specialized tests such as water deprivation or hypertonic saline when diabetes insipidus is suspected, whereas gonadotropin, TSH in the context of free T4, and prolactin abnormalities are usually confirmed with baseline measures and clinical correlation [^114vceZP].

> Next, I should review imaging indications; if hypopituitarism is confirmed, pituitary MRI is generally indicated to localize the cause, and in men with secondary hypogonadism I should ensure MRI if there is hyperprolactinemia, mass-effect symptoms, other pituitary deficiencies, or severe secondary hypogonadism defined by total testosterone less than 6 nmol/L, since missing a sellar or parasellar process would have management implications [^113gxwWX] [^115Nrmsu].

> I will now examine etiologies systematically; the most common driver in adults is a pituitary adenoma or its treatment by surgery or radiotherapy, but I should also scrutinize for traumatic brain injury across severities, autoimmune or inflammatory hypophysitis, postpartum pituitary infarction, infiltrative disease, and drug-induced hypopituitarism including somatostatin analogs like pasireotide and, critically, immune checkpoint inhibitors that can preferentially injure corticotrophs, maintaining a low threshold for testing when symptom patterns shift or new therapies are introduced [^113jEgoQ] [^113dFcuz] [^1174YkQM] [^111iJ9xU].

> But wait, what if the patient is on immunotherapy; I should confirm whether the regimen includes agents with documented hypophysitis risk such as nivolumab, ipilimumab, avelumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab, or toripalimab, because labels consistently warn about hypophysitis and secondary adrenal insufficiency, and they direct prompt hormone replacement and temporary holding or discontinuation based on severity, so a high index of suspicion for new headaches, photophobia, visual field defects, fatigue, hypotension, or hyponatremia is essential to avert adrenal crisis [^114JKLhW] [^112tznGG] [^114oWk9q] [^111DMbDu] [^116vC6SX] [^114mXC59] [^112FYasv] [^111TfBSm].

> Let me consider radiotherapy-related hypopituitarism; survivors of primary non-pituitary brain tumors have a substantial pooled prevalence of new pituitary deficits that accumulates with time, with GH deficiency generally emerging earliest and most commonly, and risk rises with higher pituitary or hypothalamic doses and larger target volumes, while even extracranial head and neck irradiation can deliver bystander exposure to the hypothalamic–pituitary region and lead to late deficits, so long-term endocrine surveillance is warranted, especially beyond five years [^111VLwjD] [^115ZxeMf] [^1126QcfM] [^11148p9p].

> Hold on, I should verify postpartum contexts; Sheehan's syndrome remains a critical, sometimes delayed, diagnosis when there is a history of severe postpartum hemorrhage followed by agalactia, amenorrhea, hyponatremia, or adrenal crisis, and because presentations may surface years later, I need to directly ask about lactation failure and peripartum events rather than relying on spontaneous disclosure, to prevent prolonged untreated hypopituitarism and its complications [^113dFcuz] [^112TpNVr] [^1173vxj1].

> I need to ensure I do not label cases as "idiopathic" prematurely; if imaging is unrevealing, I should screen for iron overload with iron studies and consider HFE genotyping because hemochromatosis can produce reversible hypopituitarism if identified and treated early, which has direct implications for systemic morbidity as well as pituitary function [^116DE64a].

> Next, I should review the approach to pituitary incidentalomas since they are common; at baseline I will screen all patients with sellar lesions for hypopituitarism using the standard panel, add dynamic testing of the HPA axis when morning cortisol suggests insufficiency, avoid unnecessary gonadal testing in premenopausal women with regular menses, and then schedule periodic endocrine reassessment because new hypopituitarism can develop even without radiographic growth, with many authorities recommending repeat pituitary function testing at 1 to 2 years and sooner if new symptoms arise [^114vceZP] [^113jEgoQ] [^1126WmaK].

> Let me first confirm nuances of central hypothyroidism; I must not anchor on TSH alone because central disease often shows low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4, and in patients with diabetes insipidus or suggestive hypothyroid features I should actively consider central hypothyroidism and follow FT4 to guide levothyroxine dosing rather than normalizing TSH, which is unreliable in this setting [^115D3Sp4] [^112Rs1KH].

> I should double-check TBI as a trigger to test; moderate-to-severe injuries, prolonged ICU stays, intracranial hypertension, and lower admission GCS predict higher risk, and pooled data suggest clinically meaningful rates across multiple axes with GH deficiency being most common, so a structured screening plan during subacute and chronic phases is prudent to catch evolving deficits that may impact recovery and quality of life [^111m8pY7] [^111pcthF] [^116CVUpZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure acute safety in suspected panhypopituitarism or hypophysitis; if there is any concern for adrenal crisis or significant ACTH deficiency, I should treat cortisol first before thyroid hormone, then complete the diagnostic evaluation and tailor long-term replacement across axes in accordance with Endocrine Society guidance, adjusting plans during transitions or pregnancy and re-evaluating periodically as pituitary function can evolve over time [^113jEgoQ] [^114W5zKf].

Hypopituitarism is a **deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones** [^113jEgoQ], most often due to pituitary adenomas or their treatment [^113dFcuz], with other causes including trauma, radiation, infiltrative, autoimmune, genetic, and drug-induced etiologies [^1174YkQM]. Diagnosis requires basal hormone testing and **dynamic stimulation tests** for ACTH and GH [^114W5zKf], plus **MRI** to identify structural causes. Management is **lifelong hormone replacement** (glucocorticoids, levothyroxine, sex steroids, GH, desmopressin) [^114W5zKf] with careful monitoring and dose adjustments during stress, illness, surgery, and pregnancy [^113jEgoQ]. Untreated or undertreated hypopituitarism increases morbidity and mortality [^113jEgoQ], especially from adrenal insufficiency and cardiovascular disease, so regular endocrine follow-up is essential [^117BdH5o].

---

## Etiology

Hypopituitarism has diverse causes [^113dFcuz]; **pituitary adenomas and their treatment are the most common in adults** [^113jEgoQ]. Other **causes** include:

- **Trauma**: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) [^113jEgoQ], subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and pituitary apoplexy [^113dFcuz].
- **Radiation**: Cranial or pituitary radiation therapy [^113dFcuz] [^111VLwjD].
- **Infiltrative diseases**: Sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^113dFcuz] [^1174YkQM].
- **Autoimmune**: Lymphocytic hypophysitis [^113dFcuz], immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypophysitis [^112tznGG].
- **Genetic**: Mutations in pituitary transcription factors (e.g. PROP1, POU1F1, HESX1) [^113dFcuz] [^115SLr7m].
- **Drugs**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. ipilimumab, nivolumab) [^113dFcuz] [^114JKLhW].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinical manifestations vary depending on which hormones are **deficient** [^113jEgoQ], the **rapidity of onset**, and the **underlying cause**. Common **symptoms** include [^114W5zKf]:

| **Hormone deficiency** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| ACTH deficiency | Fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyponatremia, adrenal crisis |
| TSH deficiency | Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, bradycardia, constipation |
| Gonadotropin deficiency | Amenorrhea, infertility, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction |
| GH deficiency | Reduced muscle mass, increased fat mass, decreased quality of life |
| Prolactin deficiency | Failure of lactation postpartum |
| ADH deficiency | Polyuria, polydipsia, hypernatremia (diabetes insipidus) |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis involves a combination of **clinical assessment, biochemical testing, and imaging**:

- **Basal hormone testing**: Morning cortisol, ACTH, TSH, free T4, LH, FSH, prolactin, IGF-1, testosterone/estradiol [^114W5zKf].
- **Dynamic testing**: Insulin tolerance test (ITT) or ACTH stimulation test for ACTH deficiency; ITT or glucagon stimulation test for GH deficiency [^114vceZP].
- **Imaging**: MRI of the pituitary gland to identify structural lesions.

---

## Management

Management involves **lifelong hormone replacement therapy** tailored to the specific deficiencies [^114W5zKf], and **regular monitoring and dose adjustments are essential**, particularly during stress, illness, surgery, and pregnancy [^113jEgoQ], including:

- **Glucocorticoids**: Hydrocortisone or prednisone for ACTH deficiency [^114mzRCL].
- **Levothyroxine**: For TSH deficiency [^112Rs1KH].
- **Sex steroids**: Testosterone in men, estrogen/progestin in women for gonadotropin deficiency.
- **Growth hormone**: Recombinant GH for GH deficiency [^114W5zKf].
- **Desmopressin**: For ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) [^113jEgoQ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Hypopituitarism is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality** [^113jEgoQ], particularly due to adrenal insufficiency and cardiovascular disease. Regular endocrine follow-up and appropriate hormone replacement therapy are **critical for improving outcomes** [^112mjdCZ].

---

Hypopituitarism is a deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, most often due to pituitary adenomas or their treatment, with other causes including trauma, radiation, infiltrative, autoimmune, genetic, and drug-induced etiologies [^1174YkQM]. Diagnosis requires basal hormone testing and dynamic stimulation tests for ACTH and GH [^113jEgoQ], plus MRI to identify structural causes [^114vceZP]. Management is lifelong hormone replacement (glucocorticoids, levothyroxine, sex steroids, GH, desmopressin) [^114W5zKf] with careful monitoring and dose adjustments during stress, illness, surgery, and pregnancy [^113jEgoQ]. Untreated or undertreated hypopituitarism increases morbidity and mortality, especially from adrenal insufficiency and cardiovascular disease, so **regular endocrine follow-up is essential** [^117BdH5o] [^112mjdCZ].

## References

### Hypopituitarism [^113jEgoQ]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism refers to a deficiency of one or more hormones produced by the anterior pituitary or released from the posterior pituitary. It is associated with excess mortality, with cortisol deficiency due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency being a key risk factor. Onset can be acute or insidious; the most common cause in adulthood is a pituitary adenoma, or treatment with pituitary surgery or radiotherapy. Diagnosis is based on baseline blood sampling for thyroid stimulating hormone, gonadotropin, and prolactin deficiencies, while dynamic stimulation tests are usually required for ACTH, growth hormone, and antidiuretic hormone deficiencies. Repeated pituitary function assessment at regular intervals is necessary for diagnosing the predictable but slowly evolving forms of hypopituitarism.

Replacement treatment includes thyroxine, hydrocortisone, sex steroids, growth hormone, and desmopressin. If onset is acute, cortisol deficiency should be replaced first. Modifications in replacement treatment are needed during the transition from pediatric to adult endocrine care and during pregnancy.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114W5zKf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

To formulate clinical practice guidelines for hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults, an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force, comprising six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, was involved. The American Association for Clinical Chemistry, the Pituitary Society, and the European Society of Endocrinology co-sponsored this guideline.

The Task Force developed this evidence-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. They commissioned two systematic reviews and utilized the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Through one group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications, consensus was reached. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, the Pituitary Society, and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

Using an evidence-based approach, this guideline addresses crucial clinical issues regarding the evaluation and management of hypopituitarism in adults, including appropriate biochemical assessments and specific therapeutic decisions. The aim is to decrease the risk of co-morbidities due to hormonal over-replacement or under-replacement and manage hypopituitarism during pregnancy, pituitary surgery, and other types of surgeries.

### Insights into non-classic and emerging causes of hypopituitarism [^113dFcuz]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism is defined as one or more partial or complete pituitary hormone deficiencies, related to the anterior and/or posterior gland and with onset in childhood or adulthood. The most common etiology is a sellar or suprasellar lesion, often an adenoma, which causes hypopituitarism due to tumor mass effects or the consequences of surgery and/or radiation therapy.

However, other clinical conditions, such as traumatic brain injury, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, can result in hypopituitarism, and there are also genetic causes. Furthermore, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer is increasing the risk of hypopituitarism, with a pattern of hormone defects that differs from the classic patterns and depends on mechanisms specific to each drug. Moreover, autoantibody production against the pituitary and hypothalamus has been demonstrated in studies investigating the development or worsening of some cases of hypopituitarism.

Finally, evidence suggests that posterior pituitary damage can affect oxytocin secretion. The aim of this review is to summarize knowledge on non-classic and emerging causes of hypopituitarism, to help clinicians improve early identification, avoid life-threatening events, and enhance the clinical care and quality of life of patients at risk of hypopituitarism.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^114vceZP]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically in the context of endocrine evaluation, the PS 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining baseline screening for hypopituitarism in all patients with sellar lesions by measuring levels of fT4, TSH, morning cortisol, ACTH, LH, FSH, and IGF-1. Measure testosterone in men and estradiol in women as necessary. Conduct dynamic testing of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis if morning cortisol levels suggest hypocortisolism. Consider dynamic testing for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in selected patients after correcting other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Avoid obtaining gonadal hormonal testing in premenopausal women with regular menses.

### Practice of symptomatic treatment in the era of evidence-based medicine: Report of 2 cases of diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome delayed till eighth decade [^112TpNVr]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Sheehan's syndrome, first described in 1937, is characterized by postpartum hemorrhage, pituitary necrosis, lactational failure, and hypopituitarism. The presentation is variable, and late presentations are not unusual due to partial ischemic injury of the pituitary and gradual loss of endocrine function. A history of postpartum hemorrhage is usual, but in some cases, it is not elicited. Presentations such as malaise, fatigue, hypoglycemia, decline in cognition, hyponatremia, pancytopenia, osteoporosis, secondary infertility, confusion, and coma have all been reported.

Two interesting cases of Sheehan's syndrome are presented that were diagnosed in the eighth decade: one due to atypical presentation of recurrent hyponatremia and confusion, and another from hypoglycemic coma and symptoms of malaise and lethargy.

### Hypopituitarism after radiotherapy for extracranial head and neck cancers [^11148p9p]. Head & Neck (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of radiotherapy-induced primary and secondary hypopituitarism.

- **Methods**: Three hundred twelve patients treated with radiotherapy for extracranial head and neck tumors between 1964 and 2000 were evaluated. Radiotherapy doses to the hypothalamus and pituitary were estimated by reconstructing treatment plans.

- **Results**: Clinical hypopituitarism was observed in 44 (14.1%) patients following a median interval of 5.6 years. Hypothalamic dysfunction was reported in 14 patients following a median interval of 4.4 years. Neither fractionation nor adjuvant chemotherapy significantly impacted clinical hypopituitarism on multivariate analysis, but total dose to the pituitary was significant (p = .0228). Twenty-three of 68 (33.8%) patients tested for hypopituitarism demonstrated subclinical hypopituitarism. The 5- and 10-year rates of freedom from clinical hypopituitarism were 93% and 72%. The 5- and 10-year rates of freedom from subclinical hypopituitarism were 85% and 65%.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical and subclinical manifestations of late radiation toxicity were observed in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

### Hypopituitarism with secondary adrenocortical insufficiency and arginine vasopressin deficiency due to hypophysitis after COVID-19 vaccination: a case report [^111jRtpv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Herein, we presented a rare case of hypopituitarism due to hypophysitis after COVID-19 vaccination, which was followed by partial improvement of hypopituitarism. In cases of impaired consciousness after COVID-19 vaccination, it may be important to consider hypophysitis in the differential diagnosis. However, as COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of disease severity and cases of hypopituitarism as a side effect are rare, the benefits outweigh the risks. Hence, the possibility of hypopituitarism as an adverse reaction to vaccination should not influence vaccination decisions. Even high-risk individuals should be appropriately vaccinated.

### Hypereosinophilia is a predictive biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypopituitarism in patients with renal cell carcinoma [^114Z3SzD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), its ligand (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), is the new standard treatment for cancers such as lung cancer, malignant melanoma, gastric cancer, lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). ICIs can affect the activated immune system and improve the prognosis of patients with cancers; however, such treatment can cause side effects, referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs), in several organs.

The major irAEs include immune-related endocrinopathies, such as hypopituitarism, thyroiditis (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), and autoimmune diabetes. Hypothyroidism can likely occur in patients receiving anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies, while hypopituitarism and secondary adrenal insufficiency are more common in patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Anti-CTLA-4 therapy combined with anti-PD-1 therapy is the first-line treatment for advanced RCC. Compared with sunitinib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combination therapy with ICIs is associated with better overall survival (OS) of intermediate- and high-risk patients (based on the prognostic risk score) with advanced RCC. Additionally, hypopituitarism is more common in patients receiving ICI combination therapy than in those receiving ICIs alone. Hypopituitarism causes secondary adrenal insufficiency, and a delayed diagnosis leads to an adrenal crisis. Generally, adrenal insufficiency has specific symptoms.

### Hormonal replacement in patients with brain injury-induced hypopituitarism: who, when and how to treat [^1174jTq5]. Pituitary (2005). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury is one of the main causes of death, as well as physical and cognitive disabilities, in young adults. Recent studies have demonstrated head injury (TBI and SAH) as a frequent cause of hypopituitarism. Since hormonal deficits may contribute to the outcome of the patient, it is important to establish guidelines of who, when, and how to treat. The probability of developing hypopituitarism has been based on the severity of the TBI, yet discrepancies in recent studies display that minimal TBI can also result in hypopituitarism. Thus, patients with moderate to severe TBI must be screened, and those with minimal TBI should be monitored for hypopituitarism. The temporal relationship between TBI and occurrence of hypopituitarism is observed in three phases: acute, recovery, and chronic. Clear hormonal deficits should be treated, but the question arises concerning subtle abnormalities and their role in the outcome of TBI patients.

### Bavencio [^114oWk9q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Bavencio can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement, as clinically indicated. Withhold Bavencio depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.6% (11/1854) of patients receiving Bavencio, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of Bavencio in 0.1% and withholding of Bavencio in 0.1% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in all (11/11) patients with adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 18% (2/11) of patients. Of the 2 patients in whom Bavencio was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, none reinitiated treatment with Bavencio.

- **Hypophysitis**: Bavencio can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. It can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement, as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue Bavencio depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Immune-mediated pituitary disorders occurred in 0.1% (1/1854) of patients receiving Bavencio, which was a Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reaction. Hypopituitarism did not lead to withholding of Bavencio in this patient. Systemic corticosteroids were not required in this patient.

### Diagnosis of endocrine disease: Expanding the cause of hypopituitarism [^1174YkQM]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2017). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, hypopituitarism can occur due to:

- **Infections and hemorrhages**: ACTH deficiency, tuberculous meningitis, acute viral meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage
- **Genetic and hereditary conditions**: Hereditary hemochromatosis, X-linked recessive panhypopituitarism, endocrine-cerebroosteodysplasia, Camurati-Engelmann disease, combined pituitary hormone deficiency 5 (HESX1 gene), holoprosencephaly
- **Physical trauma and tumors**: Head injury, histiocytosis X, craniopharyngioma, pituitary tumor
- **Inflammatory and postpartum conditions**: Lymphocytic hypophysitis, Sheehan's syndrome

Additionally, hypopituitarism may be induced by medications such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and pasireotide.

### Dermatologic manifestations of hypopituitarism [^114at9n1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is characterized by diminished or absent secretion of one or more pituitary hormones. The clinical features of hypopituitarism vary depending on age, rapidity of onset, hormones involved, and degree of deficiency. Dermatologic signs of hypopituitarism may involve alterations in pigmentation, the epidermal and dermal skin structures, and the pilosebaceous unit. We describe the causes and presentation of hypopituitarism with an emphasis on its dermatologic manifestations.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^112mjdCZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

As survival rates for brain tumors arising in adulthood continue to improve, increasing numbers of patients experience late effects from radiotherapy. Radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism is one of the most common late effects in brain tumor survivors. This condition is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of one or more anterior pituitary hormones in the years following treatment. While it is hypothesized that radiation induces cell damage and vasculopathy resulting in hypopituitarism, the exact pathophysiology remains undetermined.

The development of early-onset hypopituitarism, particularly growth hormone (GH) deficiency, has been attributed to hypothalamic damage. Pituitary atrophy due to absent hypothalamic stimulation is thought to contribute to the later onset of hypopituitarism. Furthermore, early direct pituitary damage can occur at radiation doses exceeding 60 Gray (Gy). Radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism can exacerbate symptoms commonly experienced by brain tumor survivors, including lethargy, sexual dysfunction, and impaired well-being. It also confers additional morbidity, including subfertility, metabolic dysfunction, and cerebrovascular disease. Patients with hypopituitarism have an increased mortality risk. A meta-analysis comprising over 23,000 patients with hypopituitarism reported a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.55, with a higher rate in women (SMR 2.29) compared to men (SMR 1.50).

### Loqtorzi [^114mXC59]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Loqtorzi can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, presenting with acute symptoms associated with mass effects such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. It can also lead to hypopituitarism, requiring the initiation of hormone replacement as indicated. Depending on severity, it is advisable to withhold or permanently discontinue Loqtorzi [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Loqtorzi as a single-agent**: Hypophysitis occurred in 0.4% (3/851) of patients receiving Loqtorzi, with Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. All affected patients received systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to the permanent discontinuation of Loqtorzi in 0.1% (1/851) of patients and withholding in another 0.1% (1/851). The patient for whom Loqtorzi was withheld eventually reinitiated the treatment.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^117W7TQ9]. Clinical endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. The review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 27 August 2023 and published online (CRD 42023451385).

- **Primary and secondary outcomes**: The primary outcome of the review was to determine the pooled prevalence of radiotherapy‐induced hypopituitarism in survivors of primary non‐pituitary brain tumours arising in adulthood. Secondary outcomes included identification of (i) risk factors associated with the development of hypopituitarism and (ii) radiotherapy dose thresholds below which hypopituitarism did not occur.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: The review included original, peer‐reviewed studies that reported the prevalence of radiotherapy‐induced hypopituitarism in survivors (aged > 16 years at the time of treatment) of primary non‐pituitary brain tumours arising in adulthood. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials, observational studies, patient registry data, and case series (minimum of 10 participants). Conversely, case reports, conference abstracts, trial protocols, and narrative and systematic reviews were excluded. There was no restriction on publication date; however, only English language articles were considered for inclusion. In studies with serial assessments of pituitary function, data from the middle time point was included in the analysis. If articles reported findings from overlapping patient cohorts, adjustments were made to avoid duplication.

### Hypophysitis [^113Fx9Ks]. Pituitary (2006). Low credibility.

Hypophysitis is an uncommon inflammatory condition that may affect the pituitary gland and stalk. Patients often present with varying degrees of hypopituitarism. The diagnosis is often made presumptively based on clinical history and biochemical data but may also be supported by magnetic resonance imaging. Therapy is generally supportive in nature, but may require surgery for pathological diagnosis and treatment of mass effect.

### Risk factors for anterior hypopituitarism in patients with traumatic brain injury [^111m8pY7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a common but potentially undiagnosed complication in patients who suffer traumatic brain injury (TBI). The identification of risk factors of hypopituitarism after TBI is vital to establish a rational testing approach for these patients.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively reviewed the case records of patients with TBI who underwent pituitary function evaluation in our department between January 2014 and December 2016.

- **Results**: In all, 193 patients (66.3% male) hospitalized with TBI were included in this study. Anterior hypopituitarism was observed in 33 (17.1%) patients, with 4.7% of the patients having multiple pituitary axes dysfunction. Patients with hypopituitarism had a longer length of ICU stay (8.7 ± 5.5 versus 3.3 ± 4.6, P < 0.001), longer length of total hospital stay (28.7 ± 20.1 versus 21.0 ± 15.8, P = 0.011), and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission (9.1 ± 3.5 versus 11.8 ± 3.6, P < 0.001) than those without the condition. Length of ICU stay (P = 0.004, OR = 1.253) and intracranial hypertension (P = 0.027, OR = 3.206) were independent risk factors for posttraumatic hypopituitarism.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of anterior hypopituitarism was estimated to be 17.1%. Patients with intracranial hypertension and longer length of ICU stay are at risk of hypopituitarism. Routine pituitary function evaluation is indicated for this group of patients.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^111dNatK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

**Results**: The systematic literature search identified 2852 articles. After removing duplicates, 1767 underwent title and abstract screening. Fifty articles proceeded to full-text screening, of which 14 were included in the review. The reasons for excluding studies based on their full-text screening were documented in the PRISMA diagram (Figure 1).

### Clinical presentation of congenital hypopituitarism: Lessons from a large academic centre [^115SLr7m]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Our study supports the variability in the presentation of congenital hypopituitarism, both in terms of symptomatology and reason for endocrine consultation, as well as the timing of presentation. Individuals with a single hormone deficiency presented at an older age compared to those with two or more deficiencies at presentation. Importantly, we showed that the majority of individuals who present with an isolated pituitary hormone deficiency, and those initially presenting with two hormone deficiencies, will progress to manifest additional deficiencies by three years of age. It is therefore imperative that clinicians closely monitor these individuals to allow for the timely detection and management of hormonal deficiencies. Further multicenter studies are needed to better characterize the precise sequence of evolution of hormone deficiencies in congenital hypopituitarism, which could have implications for clinical screening and follow-up.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114HFHVD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **2.1 Evidence**: The options for treatment of patients with asymptomatic, clinically nonfunctioning pituitary incidentalomas are conservative follow-up without surgery (see Fig. 1) or immediate surgery, despite the lack of indications for this. Conservative follow-up was recommended with the recognition that the proper algorithm for its appropriateness and safety has not been tested prospectively. Few data are available for, or against a nonsurgical approach to the management of asymptomatic pituitary incidentalomas; hence, evidence in support of these guidelines also relied on the clinical experiences of the Task Force members.

The proper algorithm for endocrine testing during this follow-up has not been tested as prospective endocrine testing of patients with pituitary incidentalomas who were followed without surgery has only been reported in 49 patients. Follow-up endocrine testing is recommended for patients with macroincidentalomas because they are at risk of developing hypopituitarism. Of the macroincidentalomas followed prospectively, worsening hypopituitarism developed in one of seven and three of 28 patients, all of whom had enlargement of their tumors. Hypopituitarism also developed in four of 37 and one of 248 patients who developed apoplexy on follow-up. Follow-up endocrine testing was recommended despite the paucity of data because of the potential high risk to the patient of untreated hypopituitarism.

In a meta-analysis of incidentaloma studies, new endocrine dysfunction developed overall in 2.4% of patients per year. It is unclear how often new cases arise in such circumstances.

### European Society of Endocrinology clinical practice guideline: Endocrine work-up in obesity [^115VSxDG]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, specifically concerning the assessment of secondary causes, such as hypopituitarism, the ESE 2020 guidelines recommend not obtaining IGF-1/GH measurements routinely in patients with obesity. It is advised to consider obtaining IGF-1/GH testing, with a dynamic test as a minimum, only in patients with suspected hypopituitarism.

### Yervoy [^112tznGG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Yervoy 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg nivolumab can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect, such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts, and can result in hypopituitarism. Hormone replacement should be initiated as clinically indicated. Yervoy should be withheld or permanently discontinued depending on the severity of the condition [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Hypophysitis occurred in 4.4% (29/666) of patients who received Yervoy 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (0.9%). This condition led to the permanent discontinuation of Yervoy and nivolumab in 1.2% of cases and to withholding the medication in 2.1% of cases. Approximately 72% of patients with hypophysitis received hormone replacement therapy. Additionally, systemic corticosteroids were required in 72% (21/29) of patients with immune-mediated hypophysitis. The condition resolved in 59% of the 29 patients. Of the 14 patients for whom Yervoy or nivolumab was withheld due to hypophysitis, 11 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; among these, 2 experienced a recurrence of hypophysitis.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^113gxwWX]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning pituitary imaging, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a pituitary MRI in patients with secondary hypogonadism who have elevated prolactin levels or specific symptoms of a pituitary mass, and/or the presence of other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies.

### All patients with 'idiopathic' hypopituitarism should be screened for hemochromatosis [^116DE64a]. Pituitary (2009).

Hypopituitarism typically arises due to a pituitary tumor or as a result of its treatment. However, if pituitary imaging is negative, an alternative diagnosis ought to be considered. Patients are frequently diagnosed with idiopathic hypopituitarism when imaging is normal. Our objective is to emphasize the importance of screening for hemochromatosis in individuals with presumed 'idiopathic' hypopituitarism.

Our patients initially presented with biochemical hypopituitarism and were labeled as having idiopathic disease after initial investigations and normal imaging. They later developed iron overload in cardiac and hepatic tissues, requiring regular venesection to deplete body stores. Genetic analysis revealed homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in our first patient, explaining his more severe iron overload. In contrast, our second case was a heterozygote for the same mutation, with iron overload confirmed on liver biopsy.

We recommend performing iron studies in all patients presenting with hypopituitarism and normal pituitary imaging. This approach may lead to a reversal of hypopituitarism and help prevent any systemic consequences of hemochromatosis.

### Radiation-induced hypopituitarism [^1126QcfM]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The hypothalamic-pituitary unit is a particularly radiosensitive region in the central nervous system. As a consequence, hypopituitarism commonly develops after radiation treatments for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumors, head and neck tumors, and following whole-body irradiation for systemic malignancies. Increasing tumor-related survival rates provide an expanding population at risk of developing hypopituitarism. In this population, long-term monitoring tailored to the individual risk profile is required to avoid the sequelae of untreated pituitary hormonal deficiencies and resultant decrease in quality of life.

This review analyzes the pathogenesis, prevalence, and consequences of radiation-induced hypopituitarism (RIH) in diverse subgroups at risk. Also discussed is the impact of modern radiotherapy techniques on the prevalence of RIH, the spectrum of endocrine disorders, and radiation-induced brain conditions that also occur in patients with RIH.

### The history of pituitary dysfunction after traumatic brain injury [^115GfFwh]. Pituitary (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the total number of articles on traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related hypopituitarism and to assess the prevalence of this disorder in patients, including children and adolescents, that have been published up to now, with particular focus on the period after the author's review published in April 2000.

- **Methods**: A review of the literature retrievable on PubMed was conducted.

- **Results**: TBI-related hypopituitarism accounts for 7.2% of the entire literature on hypopituitarism published during the 18 and a half years between May 2000 and October 2018. Consequently, the total number of patients with TBI-related hypopituitarism now approximates 2200. A number of cases, involving both adults and children, continue to be published as case reports. Articles, including reviews and guidelines, have been published in national languages to maximize the dissemination of information on TBI-related hypopituitarism locally. This condition has also been studied in animals such as rodents, cats, and dogs.

- **Conclusions**: Interest in the damage incurred by the anterior pituitary as a result of TBI continues to remain high in both adults and children.

### Libtayo [^111DMbDu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Libtayo can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. This condition can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect, such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects, and may lead to hypopituitarism. It is crucial to initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue Libtayo depending on the severity of the condition [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Hypophysitis occurred in 0.5% (7/1281) of patients receiving Libtayo, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. The condition led to permanent discontinuation of Libtayo in 1 (< 0.1%) patient and withholding of the drug in 2 (0.2%) patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 86% (6/7) of the patients with hypophysitis; however, it resolved in only 14% of these patients. Among the 2 patients in whom Libtayo was withheld due to hypophysitis, none reinitiated the drug.

Libtayo can also cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. These disorders may present with or without endocrinopathy, and hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Hormone replacement or medical management of hyperthyroidism should be initiated as clinically indicated. Again, withhold or permanently discontinue Libtayo depending on the severity of the thyroid disorder [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Thyroiditis**: Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (8/1281) of patients receiving Libtayo, including Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. No patients discontinued Libtayo due to thyroiditis, although the condition led to withholding of the drug in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. Systemic corticosteroids were not required for any patients with thyroiditis, and the condition resolved in 13%.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^114FypRt]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Considerable research has been undertaken in childhood brain tumour survivors relative to adults. This effort reflects the heightened radiosensitivity of the hypothalamic‐pituitary axis (HPA), the pressing need to optimise linear growth by assessing and treating GH deficiency (GHD), and improved survival in childhood brain tumour survivors compared to adults. This research has facilitated the development of evidence-based guidelines, providing recommendations on radiation dose thresholds necessitating endocrine surveillance and the frequency and duration of testing required in childhood cancer survivors.

In contrast, there are no equivalent guidelines for survivors of brain tumours arising in adulthood. Delayed or missed diagnoses of hypopituitarism and its associated complications may result from inadequate endocrine surveillance. A 2011 systematic review reported the pooled prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with either a brain tumour or nasopharyngeal cancer was 66%. One weakness of this review was its generalisability to patients currently receiving treatment with more modern radiotherapy techniques. Another weakness was the combined analysis of patients with brain tumours and nasopharyngeal cancer. A separate analysis is warranted given these diseases' distinct anatomical locations, radiation doses, and treatment fields.

Numerous studies have been published in recent years, enabling a more targeted analysis without nasopharyngeal cancer survivors. The primary aim of the systematic review is to assess the pooled prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary brain tumours.

### Long-term safety of gamma knife radiosurgery (SRS) for acromegaly [^116meLyy]. Pituitary (2021). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a recognized side effect of radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of acromegaly. Using fractionated radiotherapy, progressive hypopituitarism develops, with 50–80% affected at a 10-year mean follow-up. Hypopituitarism of any type before treatment appears to increase the risk of subsequent hypopituitarism after fractionated radiotherapy. An increased dose received by the pituitary stalk, cavernous sinus invasion, marginal (50%) dose (> 25 Gy), and tumor volume (> 2.5 ml) are associated with higher rates of hypopituitarism.

Our data found that the total number of interventions of any type was also associated with the degree of hypopituitarism (p < 0.01; Supplementary Table I). Overall, it appears that hypopituitarism levels are lower with SRS, where rates of 10–50% at 5 years have been described. However, the reported mean follow-up for those undergoing SRS is shorter than the follow-up period documented for fractionated radiation.

The Virginia group published their SRS follow-up data (median 160 months; range 60–278 months) and demonstrated increased hypopituitarism with time. In their cohort of 60 patients (24 with acromegaly and 36 with Cushing's Disease), the 10-year incidence of new hypopituitarism was 53.3%. In our series, 36% of our pre-SRS eupituitary cohort (n = 60) developed new hypopituitarism at a median follow-up of 114 months (mean 143). Our data suggest that SRS causes less hypopituitarism than fractionated radiation. However, previous studies may have underreported the incidence of hypopituitarism as it increases with the length of follow-up. These data emphasize the need to l…

### Hypothyroidism: Etiology, diagnosis, and management [^117Vkavm]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2012). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism can result from various causes, including:

- **Glandular conditions**: Hypopituitarism, radioactive iodine ablation, thyroidectomy
- **Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders**: Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis
- **Nutritional and congenital factors**: Iodine deficiency, congenital hypothyroidism
- **Systemic diseases**: Cystinosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, central hypothyroidism

Additionally, certain medications are associated with the onset of hypothyroidism. These medications include:

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**: Nivolumab, avelumab, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab
- **Cancer treatments**: Tivozanib, sorafenib, bexarotene, axitinib, lenvatinib, pazopanib, ponatinib, imatinib, regorafenib, bosutinib, everolimus
- **Thyroid-related treatments**: Propylthiouracil, methimazole, amiodarone, potassium iodide
- **Psychiatric medications**: Lithium carbonate, quetiapine, clomipramine, citalopram, paroxetine hydrochloride, sertraline, imipramine
- **Other medications**: Ethionamide, dopamine, pamidronate, venlafaxine, carmustine, dexlansoprazole DR, vandetanib, divalproex DR, rifampin, lamotrigine, glatiramer, divalproex ER, dronedarone, lanreotide, cosibelimab, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, lamotrigine XR

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1126WmaK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically with respect to watchful waiting, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining clinical and biochemical evaluations for hypopituitarism six months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma. This is because hypopituitarism typically develops with the finding of an increase in the size of the incidentaloma. It is advised to avoid testing for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas if the clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time.

### Brain injury and hypopituitarism: The historical background [^1124ULye]. Pituitary (2005). Low credibility.

In the year 2000, the latest review on post-head trauma hypopituitarism (PHTH) collected 367 cases of isolated or multiple deficiency of anterior pituitary hormones subsequent to traumatic brain injury. The first patient had been published in 1918, and the latest 15 were my personal observations reported in the said review. In the previous review on PHTH, which was published in 1986, a total of only 53 cases had been collected. The interest triggered by the latest review, which concluded that PHTH was indeed less rare than commonly believed, was such that a total of 192 cases have been reported from year 2000 through April 2005.

### Impaired neuropsychological functioning in patients with hypopituitarism [^116EcBqv]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Some of the long-term effects of hypopituitarism on cognitive functioning are known across different aetiologies of the condition, as described by previous studies. Most research in this field has focused on a restricted range of cognitive domains within specific subgroups of hypopituitarism. However, in clinical practice, endocrinologists encounter patients with various aetiologies of hypopituitarism.

The aim of the study was to assess a spectrum of cognitive functions in a heterogeneous group of patients with hypopituitarism using both subjective and objective measures, at least six months after adequate replacement therapy. These insights are important as they can provide essential information for clinical practice regarding the course of hypopituitarism and the expected long-term cognitive difficulties that patients may experience. Additionally, no previous studies have been conducted on both subjective and objective cognitive functions within this patient group. This study might offer more insight into the specific subdomains where patients treated for hypopituitarism could underperform. It was anticipated that these patients would show impaired scores on neuropsychological tasks.

### Impaired neuropsychological functioning in patients with hypopituitarism [^115ztCU1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a rare condition characterized by a deficit of one or more pituitary hormones. Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism vary widely since it represents a diverse group of conditions, including differences in aetiology, pathology, and hormonal deficiencies. Treatment of hypopituitarism consists of hormone substitution therapy. Unfortunately, substitution methods do not completely mimic the endocrine homeostasis, as they are titrated based on plasma variables and not on action at the tissue level. Therefore, subtle derangements in hormonal status may appear in patients treated with substitution therapy, which in turn can lead to vague complaints and a decreased quality of life. Ehrnborg et al. found that patients with hypopituitarism, compared to the general population, incurred more health‐related costs, took more sick leave days, and were more likely to claim a disability pension. Studies also found a decreased mood state in patients treated for hypopituitarism. Altogether, patients with hypopituitarism still experience problems and effects of their illness, even after treatment of their hormonal disturbances.

### Approach to the patient: Management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^116Vh3zj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

**Learning objectives**: Describe the causes and understand the dynamic nature of hypopituitarism. Explain the range of possible outcomes after transition and reflect on the management strategies in childhood and adolescence to prevent the onset of clustering comorbidities in adulthood. Discuss the optimal timing of transition and possible causes of delay. Appreciate the importance of psychological and behavioral aspects and the need to develop a holistic approach to the management of hypopituitarism.

### Acute and chronic hypopituitarism following traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pcthF]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

Notably, specific axes affection showed distinct prevalence rates, with GH deficiency being the most prevalent at 18% (95% CI [14%; 21%]). This finding is consistent with prior research highlighting GH deficiency as a common consequence of TBI-induced hypopituitarism. Studies emphasized the clinical significance of GH deficiency in TBI patients, underscoring the importance of targeted screening and management strategies.

Similarly, the prevalence of ACTH deficiency (10%; 95% CI [8%; 13%]), pituitary–gonadal axis hormones deficiency (16%; 95% CI [12%; 19%]), and TSH deficiency (6%; 95% CI [5%; 7%]) provides valuable insights into the spectrum of pituitary axis involvement post-TBI. These findings resonate with previous literature elucidating the multifaceted endocrine disturbances following TBI.

- **Clinical implications of pituitary hormone deficiencies**: The clinical manifestation of the deficiencies is presented in Table 4.

- **Gaps and limitations**: The study has several limitations. First, potential risk factors related to TBI, particularly those involving clinical manifestations in the acute phase and conditions that mimic hypopituitarism, remain unclear and require further investigation. Second, there is a possibility of publication bias, as studies with positive findings are more likely to be published, which may have distorted the results. Third, by restricting the search to English-language studies, significant research published in other languages may have been excluded, which could impact the generalizability of the findings.

Additionally, further exploration is needed to address these gaps and limitations.

### Long-term outcomes after CyberKnife radiosurgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas [^116CCicX]. Neurosurgery (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 160 patients received clinical follow-up for at least one year. Outcomes regarding new-onset hypopituitarism are reported in Supplemental Digital Content 5. New-onset hypopituitarism was diagnosed in 27 (16.9%) patients at a median interval from SRS to hypopituitarism of 28.3 months (range, 2.8–101.7 months). With a median clinical follow-up duration of 71.2 months (range, 11.5–175.4 months), the cumulative incidence of new-onset hypopituitarism at 3, 5, and 10 years was 8.47%, 12.43%, and 15.25%, respectively.

- **Kaplan–Meier plot**: Figure 2 demonstrates the overall cumulative incidence of new-onset hypopituitarism.
- **Risk factors analysis**: In the univariate analysis (Supplemental Digital Content 6 and Supplemental Digital Content 7), BED > 140 Gy and SFED > 16.0 Gy were significant risk factors for new-onset hypopituitarism (log-rank, P = 0.046, hazard ratio [95% CI] = 2.13 [1.00–4.56], Figure 3).

	- **Kaplan–Meier survival curves**: Figure 3 illustrates the effect of BED and SFED on new-onset hypopituitarism. Patients treated with a BED of > 140 Gy and a SFED of > 16.0 Gy were more likely to develop new-onset hypopituitarism (log-rank, P = 0.046, hazard ratio [95% CI] = 2.13 [1.00–4.56]). BED refers to the biological effective dose, and SFED refers to the single fraction equivalent dose.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^113mgwa2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Two studies in this review demonstrated that the pituitary radiation dose was an independent predictor of hypopituitarism. The extent and speed of onset of hypopituitarism are also dose-dependent. Isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD) commonly occurs in adults treated with low-moderate doses of radiotherapy (60 Gy), which are largely reserved for skull base and nasopharyngeal tumours. These doses frequently result in the rapid onset of multiple hormone deficiencies.

No studies included in this review reported absolute dose thresholds for developing pituitary hormone deficiencies. However, a study by Kyriakakis et al. (ineligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis as it was a subgroup analysis of an accepted study) reported that GH, gonadotropin, ACTH, and TSH deficiencies did not occur below hypothalamic-pituitary doses of 10, 30, 32, and 40.8 Gy, respectively, after 8 years of follow-up.

Modern radiotherapy techniques allow for the calculation of both pituitary and hypothalamic doses separately and combined. Future studies should report both the hypothalamic and pituitary radiation doses to determine which is most important for developing early and late onset hypopituitarism and to define radiation dose thresholds above which hypopituitarism occurs.

### Novel OTX2 loss of function variant associated with congenital hypopituitarism without eye abnormalities [^115k3U13]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The normal development of the pituitary gland requires multiple induction signals and transcription factors encoded by more than 30 genes, including OTX2. OTX2 mutations have been described with eye abnormalities and variable congenital hypopituitarism but rarely with hypopituitarism without ocular manifestations.

- **Case presentation**: We report a girl with hypopituitarism associated with pituitary hypoplasia and pituitary stalk atrophy, without ocular manifestations. NGS revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in OTX2 c.426dupC:p.(Ser143Leufs*2).

- **Conclusions**: Mutations in the transcription factor OTX2 have been associated with ocular, craniofacial, and pituitary development anomalies. Here we describe a novel mutation in OTX2 associated with hypopituitarism without an ocular phenotype.

### A case of acute Sheehan's syndrome and literature review: A rare but life-threatening complication of postpartum hemorrhage [^117FRbGS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

A study of a large number of pregnancies in hypopituitarism has not been reported. The largest number of cases was reported by Kübler et al, who reviewed pregnancy management in women with hypopituitarism. Based on the analysis of 31 pregnancies in 27 women, they concluded that women with hypopituitarism were at an increased risk of obstetrical complications. Postpartum hemorrhage occurred in 8.7% of cases, transverse lie occurred in 16%, and 42.4% of the newborns were small for gestational age. Fortunately, our patient had no obstetrical complications other than the postdate delivery.

The postdate delivery was probably not due to the loss of general pituitary function, as a review reported no increase in the rate of postdate deliveries in women with hypopituitarism. In addition, animal data have shown that delivery proceeds normally in oxytocin-deficient mice. However, because there have been few reported cases of pregnancy with generalized hypopituitarism, many such cases will need to be studied to obtain more human data.

### Sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism: A case-controlled observational study [^112rQpFX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Of the 104 women with hypopituitarism included in the study, 75 were not receiving ERT (Fig. 1) and were primarily studied. Eugonadal women with hypopituitarism and controls were categorized as premenopausal and postmenopausal, while women with HH were categorized as younger (≤ 52 years) or older (> 52 years). Comparisons between women with hypopituitarism and controls were performed separately for premenopausal/younger women (PRE-Y) and postmenopausal/older women (POST-O, Fig. 1). The women with HH were further subcategorized by absence/presence of ACTH deficiency. Only 5 eugonadal women with hypopituitarism had ACTH deficiency, which was determined to be too few for a separate analysis.

- **Characteristics of the study participants without ERT**: The characteristics of the study participants who were not taking ERT at the time of the blood sampling, and divided into PRE-Y and POST-O groups, are shown in Table 1. The median age of PRE-Y and POST-O women was comparable between the controls and women with HH but lower in the eugonadal women with hypopituitarism. Body mass index was higher in the HH women compared to controls. As expected, gonadotropin levels differed across the groups and were lowest in HH women, particularly in those with ACTH deficiency.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^111VLwjD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

- **Primary outcome**: Hypopituitarism was reported in 11 studies, ranging from 33% to 70% prevalence. The pooled prevalence of any degree of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in survivors of primary non-pituitary brain tumours arising in adulthood was 48.0% (95% CI 36.7−59.4; I² = 81%) (Figure 2A).

There was significant heterogeneity between studies, which was further examined in a meta-regression. The univariable meta-regression identified a significant association between the year of study publication, recruitment source, and time interval following radiotherapy with the prevalence of hypopituitarism. Studies that were published earlier, had longer follow-up intervals, and recruited selected cohorts, showed a higher prevalence of hypopituitarism. In the multivariable meta-regression, longer time intervals and recruitment of selected cohorts were independently associated with a higher prevalence of hypopituitarism.

- **Table information removed**: The number of patients assessed and prevalence data for each hormone axis and individual pituitary hormone deficits were included in Tables 2 and 3 in the original document.

### Imfinzi [^116vC6SX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Imfinzi as a single agent

Grade 3 hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in less than 0.1% (1/1889) of patients who received Imfinzi. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids was administered in this patient. The event did not lead to permanent discontinuation of Imfinzi.

- **Imfinzi with tremelimumab-actl**: Immune-mediated hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in 1% (4/388) of patients receiving Imfinzi in combination with tremelimumab-actl. Events resolved in 2 of the 4 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 3 patients, and of these, 1 patient received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Two patients also required endocrine therapy.

- **Imfinzi with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy**: Immune-mediated hypophysitis occurred in 1.3% (8/596) of patients receiving Imfinzi in combination with tremelimumab-actl, including Grade 3 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Events resulted in permanent discontinuation in 1 patient. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 6 patients with immune-mediated hypophysitis; of these, 2 of the 8 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Four patients also required endocrine therapy.

### Hypopituitarism [^116CVUpZ]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Incidence and prevalence of hypopituitarism are estimated to be 4.2 per 100,000 per year and 45.5 per 100,000, respectively. Although the clinical symptoms of this disorder are usually unspecific, it can cause life-threatening events and lead to increased mortality. Research has refined the diagnosis of hypopituitarism. Identification of growth hormone and corticotropin deficiency generally requires a stimulation test, whereas other deficiencies can be detected by basal hormones in combination with clinical judgment. Newly developed formulations of replacement hormones are convenient and physiological. Work has shown that many patients with brain damage — such as traumatic brain injury or aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage — are at high risk of (sometimes unrecognised) hypopituitarism. Thus, a much increased true prevalence of this disorder needs to be assumed. As a result, hypopituitarism is not a rare disease and should be recognised by the general practitioner.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113vXPu1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of pituitary incidentalomas has been estimated from data on pituitary adenomas found at autopsy and from imaging in patients who underwent a CT or MRI of the head for reasons other than pituitary disease. Because most pituitary incidentalomas are adenomas, autopsy data on adenomas may provide information relevant to incidentaloma detected during life. In combined autopsy data, the average frequency of a pituitary adenoma was 10.6%. The tumors were distributed equally across genders and the adult age range, and nearly all of these incidentalomas were microadenomas.

In adults who underwent cranial imaging studies for reasons other than pituitary disease, microincidentalomas were seen on CT in 4–20% or on MRI in 10–38% of patients. Macroincidentalomas were found in 0.2% of patients who underwent CT scans for central nervous system symptoms and by MRI in 0.16% of a population study cohort. In pooled data from 10 series of pituitary incidentalomas, 160 of 353 (45%) were macroincidentalomas, a larger percentage than has been found on autopsy studies and the other screening studies. This suggests that these patients may in fact have had some symptom that was not readily apparent or reported but that led to the imaging study or that microincidentalomas were not referred to these centers for evaluation.

Data are not available on pituitary incidentalomas in the pediatric population; these guidelines are limited to adults.

### Hypothyroidism in context: Where we've been and where we're going [^111BpPi1]. Advances in Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a disease that can be associated with a wide variety of symptoms and conditions. These include:

- **Hormonal and reproductive issues**: increased serum free testosterone, amenorrhea, anovulation, heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular periods, low sex drive, recurrent abortion
- **Muscular and neurological symptoms**: muscle weakness, paresthesia, ataxia, progressive ataxia, muscle cramps, carpal tunnel syndrome, bradycardia, fatigue, asthenia
- **Hematologic conditions**: decreased platelet count, pancytopenia, decreased reticulocyte count, anemia
- **Glandular and metabolic changes**: increased serum prolactin, increased serum CK, decreased serum sodium
- **Gastrointestinal and abdominal issues**: constipation, ascites, poorly localized abdominal pain
- **Dermatological effects**: skin dryness, hair abnormalities, thinned or partly missing eyebrows
- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: bradycardia, angioedema, puffy-looking face
- **Psychiatric and cognitive effects**: depression
- **Other associated conditions and factors**: genetic abnormalities, diffuse aches, weight gain, radiation therapy, Hashimoto's disease

By understanding these associations, medical professionals can better diagnose and manage hypothyroidism in patients.

### Tevimbra [^111TfBSm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, presenting with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. It may lead to hypopituitarism, necessitating hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Treatment should be withheld or permanently discontinued depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in 0.3% (6/2390) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA; all cases were Grade 2 (0.3%). This condition did not lead to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA. The medication was withheld in 1 patient (0.04%). Five (83.3%) of the 6 patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 1 (17%) of the patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Resolution of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism was observed in 17% of these patients. In the patient where TEVIMBRA was withheld, no recurrence of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism was noted.

TEVIMBRA can also cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy, and hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or medical management of hyperthyroidism should be initiated as clinically indicated. Treatment should be withheld or permanently discontinued depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Immune-mediated thyroiditis occurred in 1% (25/2390) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Thyroiditis did not lead to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA. The medication was withheld in 5 patients.

Hypophysitis: Jemperli can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue Jemperli depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Jemperli in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel**: Hypophysitis (Grade 3) occurred in 0.4% (1/241) of patients receiving Jemperli in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Systemic corticosteroids were required, and the event resolved. Jemperli was withheld and the patient reinitiated treatment.

- **Jemperli as a single agent**: Hypophysitis (Grade 2) occurred in 0.2% (1/605) of patients receiving Jemperli as a single agent. Systemic corticosteroids were required, and the event did not resolve. Jemperli was withheld and the patient reinitiated treatment.

Thyroid disorders: Jemperli can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate thyroid hormone replacement or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue Jemperli depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypopituitarism: an update [^1115beEy]. Pituitary (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients with hypopituitarism require careful clinical evaluation and individual optimization. Symptoms of hypopituitarism are variable and often insidious in onset, depending on the degree of hormone deficiency. Diagnosis can be straightforward through the measurement of reduced basal hormone levels. Frequently, dynamic stimulation tests are indicated in cases of equivocal basal hormone levels or to diagnose partial hormone deficiencies. Knowledge of the use and limitations of these dynamic tests is essential for proper interpretation. Hormone replacement therapy should be individualized, considering possible interactions. Persisting symptoms and reduced quality of life are frequently reported, explained, at least in part, by intrinsic imperfections of hormone replacement strategies in mimicking normal hormone secretion. This overview discusses the principles of diagnosis and treatment of hypopituitarism.

### Congenital hypopituitarism: Clinical, molecular and neuroradiological correlates [^111ougRL]. Clinical endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have suggested that mutations in genes encoding several hypothalamo-pituitary (H-P) transcription factors result in hypopituitarism, including isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) and combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). These conditions may be related to the neuroanatomy revealed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Although studies have focused on patients with either optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) or isolated hypopituitarism with normal optic nerves, few studies have compared the two groups. Our objective was to relate the clinical phenotype of a large cohort of 170 children with congenital hypopituitarism, including septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), attending a single centre to their neuroradiological and genetic findings.

Clinical, biochemical, MR imaging, and molecular data were retrospectively analyzed in 170 patients with or at risk of hypopituitarism (with ONH) to determine predictors of hypopituitarism. The presence of ONH was significantly associated with an absent septum pellucidum (odds ratio [OR] 31.5; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 7.3–136.6, P < 0.001), an abnormal corpus callosum (OR 10.5; 95% CI 3.8–28.6, P < 0.001), and stalk abnormalities (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2–4.2, P = 0.009). The risk of hypopituitarism was 27.2 times greater in patients with an undescended posterior pituitary (95% CI 3.6–205.1, P < 0.001). Anterior pituitary hypoplasia (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.3–7.0, P = 0.006) and an absent pituitary stalk (P < 0.001) were also significantly associated with hypopituitarism.

### Clinical review: Central hypothyroidism: pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges [^115D3Sp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Central hypothyroidism can be associated with several conditions and symptoms, including diabetes insipidus, sweating, pituitary apoplexy, and adrenal insufficiency. Patients often present with decreased serum free T4, weight gain, and traumatic brain injuries that can lead to hypothyroidism. Additional related conditions and symptoms may include decreased thyrotropin-releasing hormone, muscle cramps, hemochromatosis, stroke, and exposure to radiation therapy to the head area.

Other associations include hypopituitarism, headache, Sheehan's syndrome, pituitary tumors, decreased serum TSH levels, hypogonadism, fatigue, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), acromegaly, cold intolerance, decreased serum free T3, and pituitary masses.

### Sheehan syndrome: A current approach to a dormant disease [^113awTm1]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Sheehan syndrome (SS) is usually delayed due to subtle manifestations of hypopituitarism, which can range from a single hormone deficiency to panhypopituitarism. The suggested diagnostic criteria for SS are outlined, though not displayed, in the referred tables. Postpartum failure of lactation is often attributed to other causes, and patients with agalactia are not investigated for prolactin (PRL) insufficiency. A low PRL level in the postpartum period could indicate SS, with PRL measurement being a crucial first step in further investigations. Additionally, agalactia following pregnancy loss can also lead to SS, complicating its recognition. The diagnostic criteria initially proposed by Kelestimur in 2003 were modified in 2016, categorizing certain criteria as suggestive rather than essential.

- **Clinical manifestations**: Acute clinical presentation of SS in the postpartum period may include headache, loss of consciousness, lactation failure, and symptoms associated with acute adrenal failure such as hypotension, hypoglycemia, nausea, vomiting, and hyponatremia. Symptoms like postpartum headache, hypotension, and hypoglycemia should raise suspicion of pituitary failure in women. Unfortunately, most patients present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to diagnostic delays of approximately 7–19 years. Deterioration of pituitary function over time contributes to these delays. The case series detailing SS are summarized, though not visible, in the referred tables.

### Sheehan syndrome: A current approach to a dormant disease [^1173vxj1]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

Sheehan syndrome (SS) is postpartum pituitary necrosis, leading to severe hypopituitarism. Severe bleeding during delivery and the postpartum period results in ischemic necrosis of the enlarged pituitary gland during pregnancy. Improved obstetrical care has significantly decreased the incidence of SS; however, it should always be considered in the etiologies of hypopituitarism in women. It can be easily recognized by the patient's medical history. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism often result in significant delays in diagnosis and treatment. Such diagnostic delays expose patients to hypopituitarism without essential replacement therapies, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Physician awareness of SS is critical for diagnosis. In this review, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of SS are discussed in the light of recent studies.

### Hypereosinophilia is a predictive biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypopituitarism in patients with renal cell carcinoma [^115KQWcm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate whether hypereosinophilia is a clinical biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypopituitarism in patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center between January 2018 and December 2020. In total, 12 patients with renal cell carcinoma who presented with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypopituitarism were enrolled in this study. The clinical parameters and symptoms at baseline, last visit, and onset of hypopituitarism were analyzed.

- **Results**: The median period from the initial treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors to the onset of hypopituitarism was 82.5 (range: 56–196) days. Most patients developed hypopituitarism within 6 months. One patient presented with hypophysitis, and 11 patients presented with isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency. The major symptoms noted at onset were fatigue (66.7%) and loss of appetite (41.7%). None of the patients had symptoms during the last visit. However, four developed hypereosinophilia. Eosinophil fraction (%) and eosinophil count (/µL) increased during the last visit and at the onset of hypopituitarism, respectively. The serum sodium and plasma glucose levels were similar.

- **Conclusions**: The eosinophil count increased before the onset of hypopituitarism. Thus, hypereosinophilia can be an early predictor of hypopituitarism.

### Approach to the patient: A case with an unusual cause of hypopituitarism [^115cwMjY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism, which refers to insufficiency of one or more hormones of the pituitary, can be due to myriad causes. The clinical and radiological spectrum of the condition is heterogeneous, based on the patient's age, gender, clinical setting, or other past medical history. Hypopituitarism includes central hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. Both hypo- and hyperprolactinemia can be associated with hypopituitarism, with low prolactin signifying more extensive pituitary damage. Posterior pituitary insufficiency (arginine vasopressin deficiency) occurs either in isolation or with anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. Clinical symptomatology of hypopituitarism is usually nonspecific and insidious in onset and progression.

Overall, the most common cause of hypopituitarism is a pituitary adenoma and its management (surgery, radiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of these). However, it is this subset of patients which is more likely to be identified and managed in a timely manner, possibly alleviating the premature mortality associated with hypopituitarism. More challenging is the recognition of hypopituitarism in less common settings, which may be either due to direct involvement of the pituitary (infection, traumatic brain injury, or infiltrative causes) or indirectly as a consequence of the primary process (thalassemia, vasculotoxic snakebite, subarachnoid hemorrhage). These entities are often under-recognized, and increased awareness can help in greater recognition of the burden.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^115ZxeMf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

- **Risk factors for the development of radiotherapy‐induced hypopituitarism**: Radiation dose to the pituitary and time interval following radiotherapy were reported as independent predictors of hypopituitarism in two studies. In another study of patients with skull‐based meningiomas, the risk of hypopituitarism increased nearly threefold with tumors exceeding four centimeters and 3.6-fold when pituitary radiation doses exceeded 50 Gy. Finally, the planning target volume (PTV) was an independent risk factor for hypopituitarism in a separate study of patients with skull‐based meningiomas. Sex and age at radiotherapy (in adults) were not identified as significant risk factors for predicting hypopituitarism.

- **Dose thresholds for the development of radiotherapy‐induced hypopituitarism**: No studies in the review reported an absolute radiotherapy dose threshold below which hypopituitarism did not occur. Although a clear threshold was not identified, Partoune et al. reported the risk of hypopituitarism was low in patients who received a pituitary radiation dose of less than 45 Gy. In a subgroup of 20 patients, the prevalence of GH and TSH deficiency was 5% and 7% respectively, with no cases of ACTH or gonadotropin deficiency following a median follow-up period of 7.5 years.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: Ten studies were appraised to be of high methodological quality, while four studies were deemed to be of moderate quality. Recruitment of consecutive patients was a key distinguishing feature between high and moderate-quality studies.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism in adults with primary non-pituitary brain tumours [^114xsUS4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review demonstrates a high prevalence of radiotherapy-induced hypopituitarism, affecting almost half of brain tumor survivors who received various modalities of radiotherapy. The likelihood of developing hypopituitarism was independently associated with the recruitment of selected cohorts (i.e. patients in endocrinology clinics) and longer time intervals following radiotherapy, as hormone deficits progressively emerged in the years following treatment.

The prevalence of individual pituitary hormone deficiencies varied markedly. GH was the most commonly affected pituitary hormone axis, with 35.2% of survivors diagnosed with GHD. By comparison, the prevalence of gonadotropin, ACTH, and TSH deficiency were 20.9%, 15.6%, and 18.2%, respectively. These findings underscore the heightened radiosensitivity of the somatotroph axis relative to other hormone axes.

The review identified an unexpectedly high prevalence of TSH deficiency, as the thyroid axis is usually considered to be the most radioresistant. One potential explanation for this may be the inclusion of studies utilizing the dynamic TRH test, which is rarely used in clinical practice to diagnose secondary hypothyroidism. This test can detect subtle pituitary dysfunction in euthyroid patients (i.e. normal circulating free T4 levels). This increases the prevalence of TSH deficiency; however, it is of uncertain clinical significance.

### Central hypoadrenalism [^114mzRCL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Central hypoadrenalism is a frequent complication of pituitary and hypothalamic pathology and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Optimal exogenous glucocorticoid use depends on the employment of appropriate diagnostic tests and careful assessment of the clinical response to glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A PubMed search for the terms central hypoadrenalism, ACTH deficiency, glucocorticoid suppression, and glucocorticoid replacement was conducted; the papers identified and the references listed were used to build a reference list.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The published literature was assessed to present a summary of the available evidence regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypoadrenalism.

- **Conclusions**: A functional hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is essential for normal health and life expectancy; its complexity presents challenges to clinicians in identifying patients and maintaining them in a glucocorticoid-sufficient state. The most common cause of central hypoadrenalism remains exogenous glucocorticoid use. Further research in this field should be directed toward disease prevention by minimizing glucocorticoid exposure and toward identifying a biomarker for glucocorticoid sufficiency that will aid clinicians in optimizing treatment.

### Medical management of hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary adenomas [^11397ATK]. Pituitary (2002). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a disease complex with variable clinical manifestations. Recent studies have improved our understanding of its pathophysiology, particularly in patients with pituitary adenomas. In that setting, hypopituitarism was previously considered a permanent and irreversible process, requiring life-long hormone replacement therapy. While this could be true in some instances, recent data demonstrated recovery of pituitary function in a large number of patients with hypopituitarism following surgical decompression.

Mechanical compression of portal vessels and the pituitary stalk, by the expanding adenoma, was postulated to be the predominant mechanism causing hypopituitarism in this setting. Since portal vessels also provide blood supply to the anterior lobe, ischemic necrosis of portions of the pituitary can occur as a result of increased and prolonged compression by the expanding adenoma.

Recent data demonstrated increases in intrasellar pressure (ISP) in patients with pituitary macroadenomas, particularly those with hypopituitarism. The data showed that ISP measurements correlated positively with the serum prolactin levels but not with tumor sizes. It is postulated that increased ISP has a predominant role in the pathogenesis of hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary adenomas. The increase in ISP results in decreased blood flow through the portal vessels and the pituitary stalk, leading to diminished delivery of hypothalamic hormones to the anterior pituitary and potentially causing ischemia and/or necrosis in some portions of the normal gland.

### Hypophysitis, the growing spectrum of a rare pituitary disease [^111iJ9xU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Classically, hypophysitis presents with symptoms related to pituitary deficiencies with or without headaches and vision changes related to the mass effect of an enlarged pituitary gland and infundibulum. Approximately half of patients with primary hypophysitis present with headaches, while 10% to 30% present with visual disturbances related to mass effect.

Symptoms related to the loss of anterior and/or posterior pituitary hormones depend on the etiology and extent of pituitary damage. Generally, the presence of both anterior pituitary dysfunction and diabetes insipidus (DI) is a clue to an inflammatory/infiltrative process, craniopharyngiomas, or metastasis, and is highly unlikely in pituitary adenomas. In lymphocytic hypophysitis (LHy) and immunotherapy-induced hypophysitis, the inflammatory process predominantly affects corticotrophs, followed by gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs. Importantly, this pattern is distinct from that of pituitary adenomas, where corticotrophs are usually affected last.

All patients require initial pituitary function testing: cortisol (and/or adrenocorticotropin [ACTH] stimulation test); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); free thyroxine; prolactin; luteinizing hormone (LH); follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with estradiol in premenopausal women or testosterone in men; insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); and serum sodium, plasma, and urine osmolarity if DI is suspected. Hyponatremia may be observed in adrenal insufficiency (AI), severe hypothyroidism, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

### Opdivo [^114JKLhW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opdivo can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, presenting with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can lead to hypopituitarism, and initiating hormone replacement is recommended as clinically indicated. Depending on severity, withholding or permanently discontinuing Opdivo may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Opdivo as a single agent**: Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients receiving Opdivo as a single agent, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. It led to permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in less than 0.1% and withholding in 0.2% of patients.

- **Hormone replacement therapy**: Approximately 67% (8/12) of patients with hypophysitis received hormone replacement therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis resolved in 42% of the 12 patients.

Of the three patients for whom Opdivo was withheld due to hypophysitis, two reinitiated Opdivo after symptom improvement. Of these, none experienced recurrence of hypophysitis.
