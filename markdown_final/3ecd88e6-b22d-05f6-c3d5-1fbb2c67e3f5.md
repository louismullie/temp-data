## Question

Nose bleed treatement for peds patient 9 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of a nosebleed in a 9-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and whether this is an emergency. Then, I should verify the likely etiology and anatomy in this age group. Next, I will outline first-line home and clinic measures, followed by escalation if bleeding persists. After that, I need to consider special populations and when to investigate for bleeding disorders. Finally, I will integrate prevention, follow-up, and a concise algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the emergency assessment, because I need to ensure we do not miss hemodynamic instability or a posterior bleed. Severe features include bleeding > 30 minutes, hemodynamic instability, bilateral bleeding or blood in the mouth suggesting posterior involvement, or a history of hospitalization or transfusion for epistaxis; these warrant prompt management and consideration of ED evaluation, whereas most children have anterior bleeds that are self-limited and manageable with first-line measures [^fb84088c] [^99a3dfea].

> I will now examine the likely etiology in a 9-year-old, and I should double-check that anterior septal bleeding predominates. Most pediatric epistaxis is anterior and idiopathic, often from Kiesselbach's plexus, with contributing factors such as digital trauma, dryness, allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory infections, and rarely foreign body; posterior bleeds are uncommon in children and should raise suspicion for underlying pathology if recurrent or severe [^74adb4e8] [^71a4bec5] [^5230069f].

> Next, I should review first-line home management and make sure the technique is precise. The child should sit upright, lean forward to avoid swallowing blood, and apply firm bidigital compression to the soft lower third of the nose for at least 5 minutes, ideally 10–15 minutes if needed; breathing through the mouth and spitting out blood reduces aspiration and gastric irritation, and this approach alone controls most bleeds, including many seen in emergency settings [^9d1911e8] [^c2aebfcb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vasoconstrictors; I need to check age-appropriate options and dosing. If compression alone is insufficient, oxymetazoline 0.05% (Afrin) can be used in children aged 6 years and older as 2 sprays into the bleeding nostril followed by another 5 minutes of pressure; phenylephrine 0.125% is an alternative for children aged 2 years and older, and these should be used cautiously in children with cardiac disease or hypertension, with careful attention to systemic absorption and duration of use [^d09d37f3] [^c2aebfcb].

> Let me consider adjuncts and clarify what to avoid. Ice to the bridge of the nose may help with comfort but is not a substitute for compression; topical lidocaine can be combined with vasoconstrictor to improve tolerance if cautery is planned, but routine lidocaine spray is not necessary for simple compression; importantly, avoid placing tissues or cotton deep in the nostril, which can traumatize mucosa and worsen bleeding [^d09d37f3] [^c2aebfcb].

> If bleeding persists despite 10–15 minutes of compression with or without vasoconstrictor, I should confirm the next step. In clinic, anterior rhinoscopy with removal of clots allows identification of the bleeding site; if a discrete anterior site is seen, chemical cautery with silver nitrate is reasonable, and I should remember that 75% silver nitrate is preferred over 95% because it achieves higher short-term resolution with less pain, though both are effective and pain can be mitigated with topical anesthesia [^62b139f2] [^674817f6].

> Wait, let me verify the role of packing in children. Packing is reserved for active bleeding that obscures visualization or fails compression and cautery; absorbable materials are preferred in children, especially if there is any concern for bleeding disorder or anticoagulation, because they avoid the trauma of removal; nonabsorbable packing is acceptable when absorbable materials are unavailable, but it requires planned removal and close follow-up [^078dce1d] [^db688629].

> I should confirm when to escalate beyond local measures. Persistent or recurrent bleeding despite appropriate local therapy, suspected posterior bleeding, or concern for underlying pathology should prompt ENT involvement and consideration of nasal endoscopy, which localizes bleeding in 87–93% of cases and guides targeted therapy; in rare refractory cases, surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization may be indicated, though these are uncommon in children [^9be4dfe8] [^f36ebc54] [^381131ab].

> But wait, what if the child has recurrent or unusual features; I need to check for red flags that warrant further workup. Recurrent unilateral bleeding, bleeding from both nares with oral blood, or a family history of bleeding should prompt evaluation for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and recurrent or severe epistaxis should trigger a basic bleeding history and, when indicated, screening labs such as CBC, PT/INR, and aPTT; in children with suspected bleeding disorders, tranexamic acid may be considered as an adjunct under specialist guidance [^c76e0948] [^7aac94de] [^87a4c677].

> Next, I should review prevention and home care, and I need to ensure the plan is practical. Key measures include avoiding digital trauma and vigorous nose blowing, maintaining nasal hydration with saline sprays or gels, using a bedside humidifier in dry environments, and applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the anterior septum twice daily during dry months; although a pediatric RCT did not show benefit for petroleum jelly in reducing recurrence, clinical experience and guideline consensus still support moisturization as part of a multimodal prevention strategy, and education reduces anxiety and recurrence [^162eee18] [^c2aebfcb].

> I should double-check follow-up needs and documentation. After any packing or cautery, arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to assess healing and reinforce prevention; document the bleeding site, interventions, and counseling provided, and ensure caregivers know warning signs that require urgent reassessment, such as recurrent heavy bleeding, pallor, dizziness, or bleeding that persists beyond 20–30 minutes despite correct compression [^03178369] [^11ccfc3d].

> Let me synthesize a concise, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Start with compression for 5–15 minutes, escalate to oxymetazoline spray if needed, proceed to anterior rhinoscopy and cautery if bleeding persists, consider absorbable packing for ongoing bleeding or high-risk features, involve ENT for recurrent or posterior disease, and evaluate for bleeding disorders or HHT when clinically indicated; throughout, prioritize education on prevention and home management to reduce recurrence and unnecessary utilization [^227f156e] [^4cbc8a31] [^11ccfc3d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the approach remains simple, safe, and evidence-aligned: most 9-year-olds with anterior epistaxis will stop bleeding with correct compression and posture, vasoconstrictors can be added judiciously, cautery is effective when a site is visible, absorbable packing is preferred if needed, and prevention with hydration and trauma avoidance reduces recurrence; reserve advanced interventions and systemic workup for refractory or atypical cases, and always tailor decisions to the child's comorbidities and caregiver capacity [^9d1911e8] [^5b3d7706] [^078dce1d] [^162eee18].

---

For a 9-year-old with a nosebleed, **firm pinching of the soft lower nose for 10–15 minutes** [^9d1911e8] with the head forward is first-line and effective in most cases [^c2aebfcb]. If bleeding persists, **apply oxymetazoline 0.05% spray** [^d09d37f3] and continue pressure; if still active, use **silver nitrate cautery** [^674817f6] or an absorbable anterior pack [^078dce1d]. Educate on hydration, humidification, and avoiding nose picking to prevent recurrence [^162eee18]; refer to ENT for recurrent, posterior, or refractory bleeds, or if a bleeding disorder is suspected [^9be4dfe8] [^7aac94de].

---

## Initial assessment and safety measures

- **Airway and hemodynamic stability**: Assess for airway compromise, hemodynamic instability, or signs of significant blood loss (pallor, tachycardia, hypotension) [^99a3dfea].

- **Positioning**: Have the child sit upright, lean forward to prevent blood from entering the airway or stomach, and breathe through the mouth [^9d1911e8].

- **Reassurance**: Provide reassurance to reduce anxiety, which can exacerbate bleeding [^notfound].

---

## First-line treatment: nasal compression

- **Technique**: Pinch the soft lower third of the nose (alae) firmly for 10–15 minutes without interruption [^c2aebfcb].

- **Head position**: Keep the head forward; avoid tilting backward to prevent blood from entering the airway or stomach [^9d1911e8].

- **Mouth breathing**: Encourage breathing through the mouth during compression [^9d1911e8].

---

## Adjunctive topical therapies

If compression alone fails, **topical vasoconstrictors** can be used:

| **Medication** | **Concentration** | **Age recommendation** | **Application** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oxymetazoline | 0.05% | ≥ 6 years | 2 sprays into bleeding nostril, then compress for 5 minutes; repeat once if needed [^d09d37f3] [^c2aebfcb] |
| Phenylephrine | 0.125% | ≥ 2 years | 2 sprays into bleeding nostril, then compress for 5 minutes; repeat once if needed [^d09d37f3] [^c2aebfcb] |

---

## Second-line interventions

If bleeding persists despite compression and vasoconstrictors, **consider the following**:

- **Silver nitrate cautery**: Effective for identifiable anterior bleeding sites; 75% silver nitrate is preferred over 95% due to less pain and better short-term outcomes [^674817f6].

- **Absorbable packing**: Use resorbable materials (e.g. oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge) for children, especially with suspected bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use [^078dce1d].

- **Non-absorbable packing**: Reserved for refractory cases; requires removal in 2–5 days and carries higher discomfort and complication risks [^b31a8a3b].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Refer to **ENT or a specialist** if any of the following occur:

- **Recurrent epistaxis**: Despite appropriate initial management [^9be4dfe8].

- **Posterior bleeding**: Suspected or confirmed [^9be4dfe8].

- **Refractory bleeding**: Persistent despite packing or cautery [^ee80aa2d].

- **Suspected bleeding disorder**: Personal or family history, or abnormal coagulation studies [^7aac94de].

- **Structural abnormalities**: Septal deviation, vascular malformations, or suspected neoplasm [^c70b01f1].

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

- **Hydration**: Encourage adequate fluid intake to maintain mucosal moisture [^notfound].

- **Humidification**: Use a humidifier in dry environments, especially during winter [^162eee18].

- **Nasal hygiene**: Apply saline sprays or gels regularly to keep nasal mucosa moist [^162eee18].

- **Avoidance**: Discourage nose picking, vigorous nose blowing, and irritants (e.g. smoke, strong odors) [^162eee18].

- **Education**: Teach caregivers and children proper compression techniques and when to seek medical attention [^11ccfc3d].

---

## Special considerations

- **Anticoagulant use**: Initiate first-line treatments before reversing anticoagulation or transfusing, unless life-threatening bleeding is present [^5c63f0a8].

- **Bleeding disorders**: Use resorbable packing and coordinate with hematology for further evaluation and management [^078dce1d].

- **Posterior epistaxis**: Rare in children; consider balloon catheters or specialized packing if anterior measures fail [^14a7669f].

---

## Follow-up and documentation

Follow-up should occur within 1–2 weeks after packing or cautery to assess healing and reinforce prevention [^notfound]. Documentation should include the **bleeding site, interventions, medications, and education provided** [^227f156e].

---

Most pediatric nosebleeds resolve with **compression and basic care**; escalate to vasoconstrictors, cautery, or absorbable packing if needed, and refer for recurrent, posterior, or refractory cases.

Introduction

Up to 9% of children may have recurrent nosebleeds, usually originating from the anterior septum, but many grow out of the problem.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiseptic cream, cautery, petroleum jelly.

Figure 4 — Flowchart to assess and treat epistaxis in patients on anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet medications triages severity by asking: "Do one or more of the following apply to this episode of epistaxis? Posterior nosebleed; Hemodynamic instability due to blood loss; A decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, or required ≥ 2 units of RBCs (or ≥ 15 mL/kg in pediatric patients)". If yes, label "Bleeding is Severe" and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures to control epistaxis, administer appropriate reversal agent to control bleeding and stabilize the patient, and assess for and treat contributory comorbidities. If no, label "Bleeding is Non-Severe" and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures, if hospitalization or transfusion is required and on a VKA consider oral or IV Vitamin K, and do not reverse anticoagulation or transfuse platelets if bleeding can be otherwise controlled. At discharge, discuss with the patient's primary team regarding continuing or discontinuing anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^6f110e1d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) scope and target population define the target patient as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care, including bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. The primary purpose is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice, with goals to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice, and the target audience is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed, including primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, as well as specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The guideline applies to any site of care including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine, and outcomes include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures.

Pediatric epistaxis, posterior epistaxis, and comorbidities: In childhood, 3 out of 4 children experience at least 1 episode of epistaxis; across 4-state emergency department databases, children with epistaxis had a mean age of 7.5 years and 57.4% were male, and procedures to control epistaxis were required in 6.9% of these children, with 93.5% coded as simple anterior epistaxis control. About 5% to 10% of nosebleeds are posterior, and one series demonstrated that posterior epistaxis accounted for 5% of all patients with nosebleed treated in the emergency department or admitted to the hospital. Forty-five percent of patients hospitalized for epistaxis has systemic illnesses that likely contributed to the nosebleeds, and in the NEDS study 15% were on long-term anticoagulation, 33% had a history of hypertension, and 0.9% had an underlying coagulation disorder.

Epistaxis — prompt management (Statement 1) directs that at the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not, and this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The quality improvement opportunity is to identify those patients who need immediate diagnosis and treatment, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, a Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, and policy level Recommendation. Benefits include prevention of morbidity and in rare cases mortality, increased likelihood of timely treatment, more efficient allocation of resources to patients in greatest need of treatment, reduction of patient and family stress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients who are not actively bleeding, while risks and harms include delayed treatment of patients who may actually need intervention, overtreatment of patients who are not actively bleeding, and increased patient anxiety; no costs are associated with this recommendation, and the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted in that the actual appropriate timing for "prompt" management is not specified and assessment of bleeding severity may occur during telephone/electronic communications or during face-to-face patient encounter, and the purpose is to assist clinicians in determining the severity of a nosebleed as well as the appropriate clinical setting where the patient should be seen for management.

Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements — implied clinician obligations are specified as follows: For a strong recommendation, "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For a recommendation, "Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For an option, "Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role".

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^227f156e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It focuses on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians via phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients-patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function-are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on their experience and assessment of individual patients.

Action Statements

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include one or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation, about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy, was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

Epistaxis — severity of bleeding can be gauged by duration and episode frequency, noting that a standard definition of severe epistaxis does not exist. Bleeding duration > 30 minutes over a 24-hour period was considered severe, and a history of hospitalization for nosebleed, prior blood transfusion for nosebleeds, or > 3 recent episodes of nasal bleeding may indicate the need for prompt evaluation. When evaluating, evidence of or suspicion for prolonged or large volume bleeding, bleeding from both sides of the nose or from the mouth, or any signs of acute hypovolemia should warrant prompt management.

### Interventions for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children [^dbba3e78]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children is repeated nasal bleeding in patients up to the age of 16 for which no specific cause has been identified. Although nosebleeds are very common in children, and most cases are self-limiting or settle with simple measures (such as pinching the nose), more severe recurrent cases can require treatment from a healthcare professional. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the different clinical interventions currently used in managing this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2003), and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were graded for methodological quality using the Cochrane approach. Data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one reviewer and rechecked by the other, and where necessary investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. A meta-analysis was not undertaken because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Three studies - two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one controlled clinical trial (CCT) - involving 256 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. One RCT compared Naseptin antiseptic cream with no treatment, the second RCT compared Vaseline(R) petroleum jelly with no treatment, and the CCT compared Naseptin antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall, results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown. High quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.

Epistaxis risk factors — conditions and exposures: Risk factors associated with nosebleed include prior nasal or sinus surgery, nasal or facial trauma, nasal cannula oxygen, CPAP use (continuous positive airway pressure), intranasal medication or drug use, use of medications that impair coagulation and/or platelet function, personal or family history of bleeding disorder, and chronic kidney or liver disease. Nosebleed may be the presenting symptom for patients with inherited or acquired bleeding disorders, and in a cohort study of 113 children with von Willebrand disease it was the presenting symptom in 31% and 56% of these patients have had nosebleeds at some point; large claims databases identified nosebleeds as one of the most common bleeding symptoms, with 5% of patients with immune thrombocytopenia having a nosebleed.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^162eee18]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) — patient and caregiver education content and preventive measures: When the prevention of nosebleeds is discussed, it is important to understand that nose picking, trauma, infection, use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications, and hypertension are commonly associated with nosebleeds, and educating caregivers and patients that avoiding digital trauma or nose picking and use of simple nasal hygiene measures are primary strategies to avoid nosebleeds. While most experienced clinicians note that moisturizers and lubricants such as nasal saline, gels, and ointments and use of air humidifiers can help prevent nosebleeds, quality supportive evidence is scarce; in one study of children with recurrent nosebleeds, the nasal application of petroleum jelly twice a day did not reduce the number of nosebleeds. Patients who require nasal oxygen or CPAP should be encouraged to use humidification on their apparatus to decrease chances of drying the fragile mucosa of the nose and contributing to recurrent nosebleeds, and patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications are at an increased risk of recurrent epistaxis; thus, saline lubrication, as well as control of comorbidities, is recommended to prevent additional nosebleeds; preventive measures are also important following "first-line" therapies for management of acute nosebleed to prevent rebleeding and to avoid the need for more invasive interventions, and patients should be encouraged to restart saline and/or lubrication to moisturize the area and allow proper healing.

### Interventions for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children [^674817f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children is repeated nasal bleeding in patients up to the age of 16 for which no specific cause has been identified. Although nosebleeds are very common in children, and most cases are self limiting or settle with simple measures (such as pinching the nose), more severe recurrent cases can require treatment from a healthcare professional. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the different clinical interventions currently used in managing this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 March 2012.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

We graded trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane approach. One author performed data extraction in a standardised manner and this was rechecked by the other author. Where necessary we contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We did not undertake a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Five studies (four RCTs and one quasi-randomised controlled trial) involving 468 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. The identified RCTs compared 0.5% neomycin + 0.1% chlorhexidine (Naseptin®) cream with no treatment, Vaseline® petroleum jelly with no treatment, 75% with 95% silver nitrate nasal cautery, and silver nitrate cautery combined with Naseptin® against Naseptin® alone; the quasi-randomised controlled trial compared Naseptin® antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments upon completion of the trials, however 75% silver nitrate was more effective than 95% silver nitrate at two weeks following application. The group treated with 75% silver nitrate had 88% complete resolution of epistaxis compared to 65% in the group treated with 95% silver nitrate (P = 0.01). No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic). The pain scores were significantly less in those treated with 75% silver nitrate, the mean score being 1 compared to a mean score of 5 in those treated with 95% silver nitrate; this was statistically significant (P = 0.001). We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment of each study according to the Cochrane methodology and judged that two randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, two had an unclear risk of bias and the quasi-randomised controlled trial had a high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown, however if silver nitrate nasal cautery is undertaken 75% is preferable to 95% as it is more effective in the short term and causes less pain. High-quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.

Pediatric nasal foreign body — epistaxis and complications: Nasal foreign bodies are a common issue in children, and delay in diagnosis is not uncommon; in a large case series, epistaxis was the presenting symptom in 7% of patients with a nasal foreign body, and bleeding was associated with the presence of a nasal foreign body or with removal of the foreign body in 30% of the cases. Delay in diagnosis can result in morbidity, including nasal infection, sinusitis, and nasal septal perforations or synechiae, and when the undetected foreign body is a disk battery, septal perforation can occur in as little as 3 hours. Nasal endoscopy may allow rapid and complete nasal examination to exclude foreign body not seen with anterior rhinoscopy.

Interventions for nosebleed — initial measures and packing utilization: The majority of nosebleeds originate from the nasal septum, although the lateral nasal wall has a rich vascular supply as well. Initial ("first-line") treatment can include combinations of direct nasal compression, application of topical agents including vasoconstrictors, cautery of the bleeding site with chemicals or electrocautery, or packing with a variety of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials. In the NEDS review, 19.7% of emergency room visits for epistaxis involved treatment with nasal packing; among those requiring packing, Fifty-two percent also had nasal cautery; 41% had anterior packing alone; and 7% had anterior and posterior nasal packing performed.

Epistaxis with an identified anterior bleeding site — treatment options and evidence include that initial therapy may consist of topical treatments, including application of vasoconstricting agents such as oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, epinephrine, or cocaine and/or use of nasal cautery, with lubricants and moisturizing agents after bleeding ceases. Oxymetazoline and phenylephrine are over-the-counter vasoconstrictors, and 65% to 75% of patients have resolution of nasal bleeding with oxymetazoline, though increased risk of cardiac or other systemic complications is noted. A trial showed no differences in mean arterial pressure with intranasal phenylephrine 0.25%, oxymetazoline 0.05%, or lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine compared with saline. These agents should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, or cerebrovascular conditions; for children, oxymetazoline use in children aged < 6 years is recommended only with advice of a clinician, and more dilute (0.125%) phenylephrine nasal solutions can be used in children aged ≥ 2 years. Topical epinephrine is also effective, but concern about cardiovascular effects from systemic absorption favors the use of oxymetazoline, and while a review supported safety in healthy adults during endoscopic sinus surgery, safety in acute nosebleed has not been studied; cocaine is used infrequently due to possible cardiac side effects and other toxicities. In adults, a randomized controlled study comparing nasal pinching for 10 minutes versus topical vasoconstriction (0.5% oxymetazoline or 1:10,000 epinephrine) applied for 30 minutes followed by silver nitrate cauterization found bleeding control in 86% to 90% with vasoconstrictor pretreatment versus 64% with pinching alone prior to cautery. A Cochrane review of 5 studies found no clear differences among antiseptic cream, petroleum jelly, and/or silver nitrate cautery (with or without antiseptic cream), although a 75% silver nitrate cautery stick was judged more effective and less painful than a 95% stick. A consensus statement from the British Rhinology Society strongly recommended first-line cautery at an identified bleeding site and made a weak recommendation for vasoconstrictor use prior to cautery.

Table 10. Patient FAQs for nosebleeds — self-care, escalation, and precautions are detailed as follows: Prevention measures include eliminating digital trauma and vigorous nose blowing, using proper nasal hygiene, nasal saline gels or sprays, and possibly a bedside humidifier. During an active bleed, leaning forward and pinching the soft part of the nose for at least 5 minutes is advised, and if the nosebleed slows continue holding for a full 15 minutes. Over-the-counter options include nasal saline gel or spray; oxymetazoline or phenylephrine may be used after blowing out clots by spraying 2 sprays in the bleeding nostril and holding pressure for 5 minutes, which may be repeated once. If bleeding does not stop, or is severe or persistent, or if feeling weak or lightheaded, patients should call a medical professional; seek immediate care at an emergency room department or call 911. After cauterization, patients should treat the nose with care and avoid nose blowing, strenuous activity, heavy lifting, and placing cotton or tissues in the nose for at least a week; saline gel or spray may be used 1 to 3 times a day. For those on blood thinners, promptly check with the prescribing clinician, and if the nosebleed is severe, do not take additional doses until evaluated and such evaluation should not be delayed.

Epistaxis epidemiology and emergency department burden — general and older-adult patterns: Nearly 60% of the population experience a nosebleed at least once, and One-tenth of these patients eventually seek medical advice/intervention, with 0.16% needing hospitalization; a survey showed that nearly one-third of households have ≥ 1 household members with minor recurrent nosebleeds. Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) 2009 to 2011 data identified 1.2 million emergency department visits for epistaxis in the United States, representing 0.32% of encounters, with a mean age of 53.4 years and 52.7% male; in a United Kingdom audit, 13.9% presented again within 30 days and a 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 3.4% was found. Age distribution is described as bimodal with peak frequency in children < 10 years and adults 70 to 79 years, and Medicare claims showed patients aged 65 to 75 years 1.36 times more likely, aged 76 to 85 years 2.37 times more likely, and aged > 85 years 3.24 times more likely to present to the emergency room than patients < 65 years old.

Epistaxis — supporting data for advanced interventions: Although many cases of epistaxis will resolve with conservative management, approximately 6% of patients will require management more invasive than cautery or packing for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis. Historically, prolonged posterior nasal packing (2–7 days) had mediocre hemostasis with recurrent bleeding in up to 52% of cases and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant discomfort. Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is now the most commonly employed surgical arterial ligation technique with a reported success rate of up to 98%, and complication rates with TESPAL are relatively low, including postoperative hemorrhage (3.4%), with a similar reported mortality rate as compared with embolization; recent treatment algorithms employ surgical arterial ligation and/or endovascular embolization as second-line therapies for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) interventions for an identified anterior nasal bleeding site include emollient creams or ointments, a medication option such as oxymetazoline (Afrin), cautery, and nonspecific supportive measures. Medications such as oxymetazoline (Afrin) can cause complications in some people with hypertension and glaucoma. Nonspecific supportive measures have no risks aside from delay in more definitive treatment and may allow for healing of the bleeding area and help prevent future nosebleeds.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^2d09e688]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, iron treatments remain essential, but we suggest there is a rationale to consider reduced strength iron tablets, closer to the recommended dietary allowance. More frequent administration of lower individual iron dosages may be helpful for individual HHT patients reporting that their nosebleeds increase after commencing or escalating iron treatments for anemia.

### Does choice of nasal pack matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of merocel and rapid rhino [^402de073]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Protocol and Registration

This systematic review was reported as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42023426752).

2.2 Data Sources and Search Strategy

Studies were searched in Embase, PubMed, and Medline from inception to February 2, 2025. The keywords modified per database search syntax included: humans, tampons, hospital costs, emergency department, nosebleed, hemostatic, nose, packing, RR, Merocel, and epistaxis (see Appendix A: Keywords).

2.3 Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT), cohort studies, case–control studies, cross‐sectional studies, reviews, meta‐analysis, and clinical trials were included. Single case reports, retracted articles, and editorials were excluded. The search strategy was comprehensive but restricted to human subjects and studies published in the English language. There was no time restriction to capture as many studies as possible.

The inclusion criteria involved studies that examined either RR or Merocel nasal packs for nonsurgical epistaxis or post‐surgical packing. Articles were included if they addressed at least one of the primary outcomes: patient comfort with nasal pack, cost of nasal pack, or rebleed rate. To ensure robust review quality, studies with pediatric patients (< 16 years old) were excluded, as were studies with no full text. Papers were also excluded if they were only descriptive in nature, recruited patients solely with clotting disorders (congenital or inherited), and had no distinction between nasal packs.

2.4 Study Selection

Three authors (H.T. D.S. C.D.) independently screened the titles and abstracts retrieved from the databases. A consensus between two researchers was required before continuing to full text screening. Any disagreement was resolved with consensus before full‐text review. The entire texts were then independently evaluated by the same three authors, with consensus required between two authors before the data extraction step. Three authors extracted the data independently, cross‐checking for discrepancies.

Nasal cautery — anesthesia and technique considerations: Anesthesia of the nose is usually accomplished with local anesthetics, commonly topical lidocaine or tetracaine, applied either by aerosolized spray or with cotton or pledgets soaked with the agent; the French guidelines recommend lidocaine (with a topical decongestant), cautioning for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy or those using class III antiarrhythmic agents, and lidocaine can be injected into the nasal septum prior to cautery. General anesthesia can be used in young children, uncooperative patients, or those requiring advanced cauterization techniques such as endoscopic cautery for a posterior bleeding site. Available, albeit limited, evidence suggests that cautery is better tolerated and more effective than packing regardless of method, and one randomized controlled trial showed bipolar cautery to be less painful with faster healing than monopolar cautery. Cautery options include chemical agents such as silver nitrate (25%-75%), chromic acid, or trichloroacetic acid, and energy-based methods such as electrocautery or "hot wire" thermal cautery; application sites range from Kiesselbach's plexus to larger arteries such as the sphenopalatine artery, and a systematic review suggests electrocautery is more effective than chemical cautery and that any method is more effective than nasal packing.

### Emergency department care of childhood epistaxis [^71a4bec5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this review is to determine an efficient and safe primary strategy care for paediatric epistaxis.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for studies referenced with key words 'epistaxis AND childhood'. This search yielded 32 research articles about primary care in childhood epistaxis (from 1989 to 2015). Bibliographic references found in these articles were also examined to identify pertinent literature. We compared our results to the specific management of adult epistaxis classically described in the literature.

Results

Epistaxis is one of the most common reasons for referral of children to a hospital ENT outpatient department. The bleeding usually originates from the anterior septum, as opposed to adults. Crusting, digital trauma, foreign bodies and nasal colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus have been suggested as specific nosebleed factors in children. Rare aetiologies as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma appear later during adolescence. There are different modes of management of mild epistaxis, which begin with clearing out blood clots and bidigital compression. An intranasal topical local anaesthetic and decongestant can be used over 6years of age. In case of active bleeding, chemical cauterisation is preferred to anterior packing and electric cauterisation but is only feasible if the bleeding site is clearly visible. In case of non-active bleeding in children, and in those with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis, antiseptic cream is easy to apply and can avoid 'acrobatic' cauterisation liable to cause further nasal cavity trauma.

Conclusions

Aetiologies and treatment vary with patient age and the existence or not of active bleeding at the time of the examination. Local treatments are usually easy to perform, but physicians have to ponder their indications depending on the possible complications in order to inform parents and to know paediatric epistaxis specificities.

### Pediatric epistaxis-effectiveness of conservative management [^2c219abb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Epistaxis is an emergency medical condition that sometimes requires admission to the emergency department. Pediatric epistaxis differs from epistaxis in the older population in terms of etiology, severity, and management. Our objective was to identify the distinctive features of pediatric epistaxis and determine the appropriate management.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 231 medical records of children (< 18 years old) with epistaxis of a total of 1171 cases in the general population who presented to our medical center's emergency department between 2013 and 2018.

Results

Among 231 admissions, 10 children (4.3%) presented more than once. Male patients accounted for the majority of cases (64.5%), and the average age was 9.4 years. Two children were treated with aspirin because of cardiac valve disease. Anterior bleeding was detected in 101 cases (43.7%), whereas posterior origin was observed in 8 cases (3.5%). In 122 cases (52.8%), there was no active bleeding observed. Nose injury was the cause of epistaxis in 24 cases (10.4%), and 16 admissions (6.9%) followed nasal surgical interventions. Nineteen children (8%) had abnormal coagulation tests, and 7 patients (3%) received blood transfusions. Chemical cauterization was performed in 89 cases (39.3%), and anterior packing was needed in only 9 cases (3.9%). Nine children required hospitalization (3.9%), and 2 needed surgical intervention to control bleeding. Compared with the adult population, there were significantly fewer cases of active bleeding, recurrent epistaxis, anterior packing, or need for hospitalization in the pediatric population.

Conclusions

Epistaxis is significantly less severe in the pediatric population, with only a few cases requiring major intervention. Endoscopic examination of the entire nasal cavity and routine coagulation tests are not mandatory unless there is a history of recurrent epistaxis, known coagulopathy, antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy, or a suspicion of juvenile idiopathic angiofibroma. We suggest using absorbable packs, which offer advantages over cauterization or nonabsorbable packs.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for epistaxis, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AAO-HNS 2020 guidelines recommend to document factors increasing the frequency or severity of bleeding in patients with nosebleeds, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use.

Epistaxis — Nasal compression technique and adjunct vasoconstrictors: Digital compression to the lower third of the nose is depicted, and while performing nasal compression clinicians may concurrently obtain history from the patient or caregiver. Indications for more aggressive management, such as packing or cautery, include a failure to stop or slow bleeding with compression or a nosebleed judged to be life-threatening or unlikely to respond to further compression alone, and continued bleeding out the nose or into the posterior pharynx during compression may indicate a posterior bleeding site. The use of vasoconstrictors around the time of applying compression may be helpful but is based on expert opinion rather than randomized controlled trials; in a retrospective review of 60 patients, epistaxis control — defined as brisk bleeding slowed within 5 minutes and bleeding stopped within 30 minutes — was achieved in 65% by spraying the nose with oxymetazoline. A French guideline recommended vasoconstrictors if bleeding continued after nasal compression, and vasoconstrictors can be applied with nasal sprays or by intranasal insertion of cotton impregnated with these medications.

Epistaxis — clinical setting and procedure for nasal packing specifies that anterior nasal packing can be performed by nonspecialist clinicians in the outpatient office or emergency department with resources to perform anterior rhinoscopy, ideally including illumination and specula, suction to clear blood and clot, and forceps placement with lubrication such as antibiotic ointments; patients with resorbable packing are often managed as outpatients, and uncomplicated anterior epistaxis controlled with packing can usually be managed safely as outpatients even after nonresorbable packing, whereas severe nosebleeds requiring posterior packing are usually managed in an emergency department or hospital and the care of most patients who require posterior packing should involve an otolaryngology consultant, with patients potentially requiring intensive cardiopulmonary monitoring due to reported major cardiopulmonary complications and a debated "nasopulmonary reflex".

Nosebleed (epistaxis) resorbable versus nonresorbable packing — definitions and indications — states that "Nasal packing materials can be divided into 2 types: resorbable and nonresorbable", and "in this guideline we use the term resorbable to refer to packing that does not require removal", whereas "All types of nonresorbable packing must be removed at some point after sustained control of nasal hemorrhage is achieved". "Nonresorbable packing includes a variety of gauze dressings, polymers, and inflatable balloons". In a "prospective randomized controlled trial" comparing polyvinyl acetate sponge and inflatable balloons with hydrocolloid fabric packs, "the latter produced significantly lower scores for subjective patient discomfort during insertion and removal". The text notes that with ongoing bleeding, packing "may slow or stop bleeding" and that "placement of any type of packing may reduce the need for more invasive and more costly therapies", and that "Resorbable nasal packing is usually recommended in cases of bleeding disorders, anticoagulation, or vascular abnormalities such as HHT".

### Tranexamic acid for patients with nasal haemorrhage (epistaxis) [^87a4c677]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis (nosebleed) most commonly affects children and the elderly. The majority of episodes are managed at home with simple measures. In more severe cases medical intervention is required to either cauterise the bleeding vessel, or to pack the nose with various materials. Tranexamic acid is used in a number of clinical settings to stop bleeding by preventing clot breakdown (fibrinolysis). It may have a role in the management of epistaxis as an adjunct to standard treatments, reducing the need for further intervention.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tranexamic acid (oral, intravenous or topical) compared with placebo, no additional intervention or any other haemostatic agent in the management of patients with epistaxis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register (via CRS Web); Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via CRS Web); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared with usual care plus placebo, usual care alone or usual care plus any other haemostatic agent, to control epistaxis in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (as measured by the proportion of patients re-bleeding within a period of up to 10 days) and significant adverse effects (seizures, thromboembolic events). Secondary outcomes were control of epistaxis as measured by the time to stop initial bleeding (the proportion of patients whose bleeding is controlled within a period of up to 30 minutes); severity of re-bleeding (as measured by (a) the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention and (b) the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion); length of hospital stay and other adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (692 participants). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. Two studies assessed oral administration of tranexamic acid, given regularly over several days, and compared it to placebo. In the other four studies, a single application of topical tranexamic acid was compared with placebo (one study) and a combination of epinephrine and lidocaine or phenylephrine (three studies). All participants were adults. Tranexamic acid versus placeboFor our primary outcome, control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (proportion re-bleeding within 10 days), we were able to pool data from three studies. The pooled result demonstrated a benefit of tranexamic acid compared to placebo, the risk of re-bleeding reducing from 67% to 47% (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.90; three studies; 225 participants; moderate-quality evidence). When we compared the effects of oral and topical tranexamic acid separately the risk of re-bleeding with oral tranexamic acid reduced from 69% to 49%, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96; two studies, 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and with topical tranexamic acid it reduced from 66% to 43%, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.05; single study, 68 participants). We rated the quality of evidence provided by the single study as low, therefore it is uncertain whether topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. No study specifically sought to identify and report our primary outcome: significant adverse effects (i.e. seizures, thromboembolic events). The secondary outcome time to stop initial bleeding (proportion with bleeding controlled within 30 minutes) was measured in one study using topical tranexamic acid and there was no evidence of a difference at 30 minutes (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11; 68 participants; low-quality evidence). No studies reported the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention (e.g. repacking, surgery, embolisation). One study of oral tranexamic acid reported the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion and found no difference between groups: 5/45 (11%) versus 6/44 (14%) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.48; 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies reported hospital length of stay. One study reported a significantly shorter stay in the oral tranexamic acid group (mean difference (MD) -1.60 days, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.71; 68 participants). The other study found no evidence of a difference between the groups. Tranexamic acid versus other haemostatic agentsWhen we pooled the data from three studies the proportion of patients whose bleeding stopped within 10 minutes was significantly higher in the topical tranexamic acid group compared to the group receiving another haemostatic agent (70% versus 30%: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.92; 460 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects across all studiesFive studies recorded 'adverse effects' in a general way. None found any difference between the groups in the occurrence of minor adverse effects (e.g. mild nausea and diarrhoea, 'bad taste' of gel). In one study a patient developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of both legs following discharge, however it is not reported in which group this occurred. No "other serious adverse effect" was reported in any study.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that there is probably a reduction in the risk of re-bleeding with the use of either oral or topical tranexamic acid in addition to usual care in adult patients with epistaxis, compared to placebo with usual care. However, the quality of evidence relating solely to topical tranexamic acid was low (one study only), so we are uncertain whether or not topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical tranexamic acid is probably better than other topical agents in stopping bleeding in the first 10 minutes. There have been only three RCTs on this subject since 1995. Since then there have been significant changes in nasal cauterisation and packing techniques (for example, techniques including nasal endoscopy and more invasive approaches such as endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation). New trials would inform us about the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in light of these developments.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^884fd1e7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis management in patients using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications — The statement addresses "patients using anticoagulation medications… and antiplatelet medications" and notes they may "have a large volume of blood loss (> 250 mL)" and "require blood transfusion for treatment". Even for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or heparin users, "the first step… is the use of 'first-line' treatments, including nasal compression, vasoconstrictors, moisturizing or lubricating agents, nasal cautery, and/or nasal packing". Reversal carries risks: "overcorrection of a patient's INR can increase risk of thromboembolic events" and "4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII… may also induce hypercoagulability". For VKAs, "reversal strategy should be driven by the patient's clinical condition and bleeding severity as well as INR", and "Patients with an INR > 4.5 are more likely to require hospital admission and have prolonged hospital stays". For direct oral anticoagulants, "clotting assays such as prothrombin time/INR and partial thromboplastin time do not reliably reflect the degree of anticoagulation". Regarding antiplatelet therapy, the PATCH trial found transfusion recipients were "more likely to have an in-hospital adverse event and a higher 90-day mortality rate", and "Clinicians should balance the chance for benefit against the risk for harm when considering platelet transfusion". Adjunctive agents "do not specifically reverse… but they do improve hemostasis and are effective in treating mucocutaneous bleeding"; in a small randomized trial of antiplatelet users, topical tranexamic acid (TXA) achieved cessation within "10 minutes" with "73% vs 29%, respectively; P < .001" compared with standard anterior nasal packing.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^9d1911e8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for epistaxis — Technique emphasizes sustained pressure and positioning: "The treatment of nosebleeds (epistaxis) involves having the person sit down and continuously hold the lower third or soft portion of the nose pinched closed to help the blood clot". "Leaning forward stops blood from entering the airway (which can cause trouble breathing) or the stomach (which can cause vomiting)". "The bleeding person should be instructed to breathe through their mouth and spit out any blood". Effectiveness and potential complications are noted: "Nasal pressure alone is the only intervention required in the vast majority of cases, including 20% of cases managed in EDs". and "Ongoing epistaxis can lead to anemia and shock due to blood loss". Trauma considerations are highlighted: "Traumatic epistaxis is a form of craniofacial trauma and may be associated with traumatic brain injury and facial bone fractures". and "Signs of traumatic brain injury, including loss of consciousness, altered mental status, repeated vomiting, change in vision, difficulty moving or walking, or severe headache, indicate the potential for a medical emergency requiring activation of the emergency response system". Medication-related risk is described: "Patients taking either anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, are at increased risk of severe epistaxis and hospital admission compared with patients not on these medications, and often have multiple comorbidities". and "Nosebleed in these patients is more likely to require intervention from a health care professional than those not taking anticoagulant medication".

### Hypertension and epistaxis: why is there limited guidance in the nosebleed clinical practice guidelines? [^5a103083]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension has long been thought to influence the risk and severity of epistaxis. However, evaluation of the relevant literature reveals articles with methodologic concerns or limited quality. In many instances, these studies are not adequately controlled, and lack of multivariate analyses calls into question any noted association between epistaxis and hypertension. The goal of this commentary is to explain why there is limited guidance about the management of hypertension and the possible association with nosebleed in the 2020 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guideline for nosebleeds. Background on the literature that describes the association between hypertension and nosebleeds is provided.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^30e575e1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in children: evaluating the importance of diagnosis and follow-up during childhood [^4ae9a643]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of vEDS in children

Following diagnosis of vEDS in childhood by the London EDS service, individuals are primarily referred to the Inherited Cardiovascular Disease Clinic at GOSH where cardiovascular management is discussed, and individuals are followed-up in joint vEDS clinics with the London EDS service team. The proposed treatment and surveillance is mainly a consensus between authors, and is also based on recommendations in the literature. To date, no standardised international guidelines for management and surveillance in children with vEDS have been published, however specialists involved in their clinical care recommend periodic surveillance, by scanning of the aorta and arterial tree, and some form of blood pressure lowering medication.

Management of vEDS also extends beyond cardiovascular care. In this cohort a frequent gastrointestinal symptom in childhood was constipation and subsequent perirectal bleeding. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal events, advice regarding diet and use of laxative medications to prevent constipation often form an essential part of condition management in individuals with these symptoms. Joint hypermobility and joint pain can have significant impact on physical activity, especially in children. This can be addressed by rheumatology assessment, physiotherapy, and orthotics. Furthermore, involvement of haematology teams has proven to be beneficial in children who experience excessive bleeding, recurrent nosebleeds, or menorrhagia, and who can benefit from expert advice which may include access to tranexamic acid when needed.

The impact of early diagnosis and effective management of vEDS in children is felt particularly by parents, who play significant roles in implementing supportive measures for their child such as suggesting appropriate moderate aerobic exercise, being aware of signs and symptoms that require medical attention, and ensuring necessary information is provided to nursery/school. To help alleviate some of the psychological burden diagnosis of vEDS can place on children and their family, additional support is provided by the London EDS service in the form of genetic counselling, information resources for patients/parents to provide health care professionals in both routine and emergency settings, and signposting to patient charities.

### Pediatric first aid knowledge among parents [^9ad6bc4c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published simple guidelines for the first aid management of ill or injured children. We determined knowledge of these first aid practices in parents.

Methods

Design-Descriptive survey.

Participants

A convenience sample of adult parents presenting to the emergency department.

Survey Instrument

Standardized collection of demographics was performed and adults were given a multiple-choice questionnaire concerning the proper management of stings and bites, burns and scalds, eye injuries, fractures and sprains, fever, head injuries, fainting, poisoning, dental emergencies, nosebleeds, seizures, and skin wounds.

Outcomes

Percentage of adults responding to questions appropriately based on AAP guidelines.

Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics and chi2 tests.

Results

Six hundred fifty-four adults were surveyed. Mean age (SD) was 38.5 (13.8), 56% were female, 69% were white, 56% had at least a high school education. None of those surveyed answered all questions correctly with roughly half being familiar with 60% of the questions. Knowledge of specific guidelines ranged from 21% to 92%. Subjects especially lacked knowledge regarding the need to rapidly remove all bee stingers (only 36% aware); keep wounds moist and covered (79% felt that drying wounds was beneficial); the need to cover victims of large burns (only 43% aware); and the need to seek medical attention after tick bites (only 47% aware). Knowledge was unaffected by age, gender, and education.

Conclusions

Many adults are unfamiliar with AAP first aid measures according to the AAP guidelines and most believe that wounds should be allowed to dry. Further education is required to improve knowledge of first aid practices.

### What is in a name: defining pediatric refractory ITP [^c76da68c]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Application of consensus classification of challenging pediatric ITP

A 5-year-old girl with new onset of petechiae, bruising, and epistaxis has a platelet count of 2×10³/μL and is diagnosed with ITP by a pediatric hematologist. Given ongoing epistaxis, she is treated with prednisone, 4 mg/kg per day for 5 days. Her platelet count remains < 10×10³/μL. She is treated with IVIG, 1 g/kg × 1 dose. Four days later, her platelet count remains < 10×10³/μL. Due to ongoing epistaxis, her hemoglobin has dropped to 8 g/dL, and her hematologist feels it is unsafe to give her anti-Rho(D) immunoglobulin.

The platelet count failed to respond to all eligible emergent therapies. This patient has ITP that is refractory to emergent therapy.

A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with ITP after presenting with new bruising and a platelet count of 10×10³/μL. Although his physician and parents opted for a strategy of close observation without intervention initially, his platelet count remained very low, and he was experiencing fatigue and was depressed that he was no longer allowed to play on his competitive hockey team. He was started on eltrombopag at 50 mg daily, which was increased to 75 mg daily after 2 weeks. His platelet count remained unchanged after 4 weeks on the maximum dose, taken appropriately, separated from food. He was then treated with rituximab, 375 mg/m² × 4 doses, and 2 months later still had no change in his platelet count. He remains very fatigued and feels socially isolated and worries that he will not be able to play on the high school hockey team.

This patient continues to have high disease burden with nonresponse to ≥ 2 different classes of disease-modifying therapy. His challenging disease should be recognized as higher risk of ongoing disease burden and poor response to additional therapies. He merits additional investigation to identify alternative etiologies of both immune and non-ITP, and also warrants consideration for clinical trials or novel therapies as appropriate.

### Best practice recommendations for pediatric otolaryngology during the COVID-19 pandemic [^0c8ef318]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pediatric otolaryngology and provide recommendations for the management of children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Sources

Clinical data were derived from peer-reviewed primary literature and published guidelines from national or international medical organizations. Preprint manuscripts and popular media articles provided background information and illustrative examples.

Methods

Included manuscripts were identified via searches using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, while organizational guidelines and popular media articles were identified using Google search queries. Practice guidelines were developed via consensus among all authors based on peer-reviewed manuscripts and national or international health care association guidelines. Strict objective criteria for inclusion were not used due to the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and a paucity of rigorous empirical evidence.

Conclusions

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care must be judiciously allocated to treat the most severe conditions while minimizing the risk of long-term sequelae and ensuring patient, physician, and health care worker safety.

Implications For Practice

The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short- and long-term impact on health care worldwide. Although the full repercussions of this disease have yet to be realized, the outlined recommendations will guide otolaryngologists in the treatment of pediatric patients in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis.

Regarding specific circumstances for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (initial stabilization), BAD 2019 guidelines recommend to assess airways by a pediatric anesthesiologist or pediatric intensivist and consider performing intubation if clinical signs support this, especially if a transfer is planned. Ensure immediate availability of appropriate equipment for difficult intubation.
Consider involving an ear, nose, and throat team for further airway assessment.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^0ac56c3b]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

### Age distribution of epistaxis in outpatient pediatric patients [^29c1f0d2]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives: Little is known about the prevalence of epistaxis in children. Existing reports focus on hospitalized children or those presenting to an emergency department. To better understand pediatric epistaxis in clinical practice, we sought out a searchable, representative outpatient database and examined the incidence of epistaxis in children of different ages. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from the years 2007 to 2011 was performed. The NHAMCS is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-curated national sample of data from visits to non-federally employed office-based physicians and health centers. We queried the NHAMCS to determine the cumulative incidence of epistaxis in children of different age groups. The International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision code 784.7 was chosen to identify epistaxis. Comparisons of rates were performed using the chi-squared test. A P -value of < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In total, 55,435,691 children [27,816,237 (50.2%) males, 55,435,691 (77.2%) white] were included. The overall cumulative incidence rate of epistaxis was 2.4/1000 children. Children in the 3- to 5-year range had the highest cumulative incidence of epistaxis (5.0/1000), followed by those in the 6 to 8 (3.0/1000), 9 to 11 (2.0/1000), 0 to 2 (1.9/1000), 12 to 14 (1.6/1000), and 15 to 17 (0.5/1000) year ranges (P < .001). Conclusion: Pediatric epistaxis is common in the office setting (2.4 per 1000 children)-and well above emergency department estimates (1.7 per 1000 people). Children between the ages of 3 to 5 years have the highest cumulative incidence. Epistaxis is sufficiently unusual in infants and the late teens that alternative causes for nasal bleeding should be included in the differential diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^04d92372]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — Initial antibiotic use for acute bacterial sinusitis in children delineates therapy by presentation: for uncomplicated disease, the table lists Antibiotic therapy for severe and worsening illness and Antibiotic therapy or additional observation for 3 days for persistent illness, and for acute bacterial sinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications it lists Antibiotic therapy. Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### Epistaxis… [^6c57c351]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points Anterior acute bleeding from the nostril or nasal cavity accounts for more than 90% of epistaxis in children. Posterior bleeding is uncommon, more difficult to assess, and likelier to lead to hemodynamic instability. Up to one-third of children with recurrent bleeding have coagulopathy. Direct pressure via pinching the nostrils for at least 5 minutes is the first-line treatment. Silver nitrate cauterization, topical oxymetazoline, anterior packing, and other vasoconstrictive and hemostatic tactics may be used. Posterior and recurrent epistaxis may require referral to an otolaryngologist because they are more difficult to control.

### Azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate (Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate) [^1d2a8489]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6–11 Years of Age: In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily.

In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6–11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients ≥ 6 to < 9 years of age, and 136 patients ≥ 9 to < 12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator's assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients ≥ 6 to < 9 years of age, and 45 patients ≥ 9 to < 12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Nasal disorders [^d693938f]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis are common presenting concerns in primary care clinics. Nasal disorders affect the quality of life for many children and families. Rarely, these complaints may represent a life-threatening condition among infant obligate nasal breathers or cases of unusual pathology. The most common causes of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction vary by age and include physiologic, infectious, allergic, foreign body, irritant, and traumatic causes. Less commonly, children may have congenital malformations, sinonasal masses, or autoimmune disease. The most common causes of epistaxis are inflammatory, environmental, and traumatic causes and medication misuse, but rarely, children may have predisposing anatomic, hematologic, or vascular abnormalities or even sinonasal tumors. In this article, we provide a thorough review of the common nasal disorders treated every day in primary care clinics and mention briefly some of the rare but serious cases that may be overlooked without considering a full differential diagnosis.

### Pediatric epistaxis [^38350fe4]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Otolaryngologists are frequently consulted for the evaluation and treatment of pediatric epistaxis. There is a lack of consensus as to the optimal approach to this problem. This study evaluated an approach used to evaluate and treat patients referred on an outpatient basis.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Methods

Charts from 90 patients referred for the treatment of epistaxis were reviewed.

Results

Anemia was identified in 22% of patients. An abnormal coagulation study was identified in 7.8% of patients. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the sinuses was obtained in nearly 90% of patients and revealed no suspicious masses. Opacification of the sinuses consistent with sinusitis was commonly seen. The majority of cases were resolved by the first follow-up visit with a topical nasal emollient.

Conclusions

The outpatient evaluation of epistaxis should include a screen for anemia and coagulopathy. Routine CT imaging of the sinuses is unhelpful and is not recommended. The majority of cases are easily treated with rehydration of the nasal mucosa. Consideration should be given to rhinosinusitis as a co-existing factor in patients with epistaxis.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^94b55a4f]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Thermal burn triage and immediate actions after cooling — when to seek evaluation, activate EMS, and remove constricting items: A person with a full-thickness burn or with a partial-thickness burn that is larger than the person's palm or involves the person's face, hands, feet, or genitals should promptly seek evaluation by a health care professional. For a person with evidence of smoke inhalation injury such as facial burns, difficulty breathing, singed nasal hairs, or soot around the nose or mouth, EMS should be activated. A person with thermal burns should promptly remove all jewelry, belts, and other tight items from burned areas. Supportive guidance notes that the American Burn Association recommends treatment in a specialized burn center for second- or third-degree burns involving the face, hands, feet, and genitals and those involving > 10% body surface area (5% in children), and expert consensus advocates that jewelry be removed before the onset of swelling; a person with signs of inhalation injury should have EMS activated immediately.
