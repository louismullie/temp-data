## Question

How to bridge heparin with Eliquis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to bridge heparin with Eliquis (apixaban). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether bridging is ever needed when switching from heparin to apixaban. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for or against bridging. Next, I will check authoritative guidelines and labeling for direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) transitions. After that, I should outline practical, procedure-free switching steps, including renal function considerations and perioperative exceptions. Finally, I will consider high-risk scenarios where bridging might be considered despite the general rule, and summarize a safe, reference-aligned approach.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical question: "bridging heparin with Eliquis" could mean either starting apixaban after a heparin course or interrupting apixaban around a procedure. Wait, let me verify which context the user intends. Given the phrasing, the most common interpretation is how to transition from heparin (UFH or LMWH) to apixaban without unnecessary bridging, and how to interrupt and resume apixaban around procedures without adding heparin bridging, which modern guidance generally advises against for DOACs [^116W3hkD] [^112jnRz3] [^116nqRDb].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetic rationale. Apixaban has a short half-life of roughly 8–15 hours and a rapid onset of action, which means that when heparin is stopped, apixaban can be started at the time of the next scheduled dose without a pharmacologic overlap, and conversely, when apixaban is held for procedures, its anticoagulant effect clears quickly, reducing the need for parenteral bridging; hold on, I should verify that this is consistent with labeling and contemporary reviews, which it is [^116W3hkD] [^116nqRDb] [^116Ywy1q].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The FDA label for apixaban provides explicit switching instructions: stop the prior anticoagulant and start apixaban at the time the next dose of the old agent would have been due; no bridging is recommended for transitions to or from apixaban, and bridging is not advised during perioperative interruptions of DOACs either, which aligns with guideline direction to avoid routine heparin bridging in DOAC-treated patients [^116W3hkD] [^112jnRz3] [^112r9fso].

> Let me consider the evidence base for not bridging. The BRIDGE randomized trial in atrial fibrillation patients on warfarin showed no reduction in thromboembolism and more bleeding with LMWH bridging, and meta-analyses similarly associate bridging with higher bleeding without thrombotic benefit. Extrapolation to DOACs is supported by their shorter half-lives and rapid onset, and DOAC-specific perioperative data (e.g. PAUSE) demonstrate low thromboembolic rates without bridging, reinforcing that bridging is unnecessary and potentially harmful in most DOAC users [^114pWCMX] [^117TQSc3] [^1152mQb1].

> I will now examine practical switching from heparin to apixaban. For UFH, stop the infusion and start apixaban at the time the next UFH dose would have been due. For LMWH, omit the next LMWH dose and start apixaban at that same time point, avoiding overlap. Wait, I should double-check that this aligns with labeling language, which it does, and it also mirrors the principle that DOACs do not require parenteral lead-in or overlap in routine transitions [^116W3hkD] [^116Q9aRH].

> But wait, what if the patient is perioperative or needs a procedure? I should confirm interruption intervals. For low bleeding risk procedures, hold apixaban about 24 hours and restart about 24 hours post-procedure; for high bleeding risk procedures, hold about 48 hours and restart 24–48 hours post-procedure once hemostasis is secure; bridging with UFH or LMWH during the interruption window is not recommended for DOACs in the absence of exceptional high-risk features, so I need to ensure we avoid reflex bridging [^116W3hkD] [^116nqRDb] [^112jnRz3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are narrow exceptions. I should review high-risk scenarios where bridging might still be considered despite the general rule: very recent VTE (within ~3 months), severe thrombophilia, active cancer with high thrombotic burden, or mechanical heart valves. Even then, decisions should be individualized and multidisciplinary, and for mechanical valves, contemporary guidance suggests against routine bridging in many cases, so I need to be cautious and document the rationale if bridging is used [^117Eu9yG] [^11629V9n] [^116ufVzy].

> I need to ensure renal function is accounted for. Apixaban is partially renally cleared; in significant renal impairment, the anticoagulant effect may persist longer, so interruption intervals should be extended and, when available, drug-specific assays can help confirm clearance before neuraxial or high-bleeding-risk procedures; let me verify that this is consistent with perioperative DOAC guidance, which it is [^116nqRDb] [^115wYLxS].

> Let me reconsider drug–drug interactions that could alter exposure. Strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole) increase apixaban levels and may necessitate dose reduction or avoidance. Conversely, strong inducers reduce exposure and may require alternative strategies. I should confirm this on the label and adjust the plan accordingly to avoid under- or over-anticoagulation during transitions [^116W3hkD].

> Next, I should review a concise, stepwise approach. For routine transition from heparin to apixaban: stop UFH infusion or omit the next LMWH dose and start apixaban at the time the next dose would have been due. For perioperative management: interrupt apixaban 24 hours before low-risk and 48 hours before high-risk procedures, avoid heparin bridging, and resume 24–48 hours post-procedure once hemostasis is secure. If an exception applies, use UFH or LMWH selectively with multidisciplinary agreement and careful timing of the last pre-procedure dose and earliest post-procedure resumption to mitigate bleeding risk [^116W3hkD] [^112jnRz3] [^116nqRDb].

> Finally, I should double-check that this approach is consistent with major guidelines. ACCP 2022 recommends against perioperative heparin bridging for DOAC interruptions, and ACC/AHA/HRS 2023/2024 AF guidance advises temporary cessation without bridging for most AF patients undergoing procedures, reserving bridging for very select high-risk scenarios. The FDA label operationalizes switching without overlap, which supports the practical steps above [^112jnRz3] [^114yW3p7] [^116W3hkD].

You **do not need to bridge heparin with Eliquis (apixaban)** because apixaban has a rapid onset [^1118PP1p] and predictable pharmacokinetics [^1118PP1p], making bridging unnecessary and potentially harmful due to increased bleeding risk [^112jnRz3] [^117TQSc3]. For transitions, stop heparin and start apixaban at the next scheduled dose [^116W3hkD]; if heparin is needed urgently, wait 2–4 hours after the last apixaban dose before starting heparin to avoid excess anticoagulation [^notfound]. Bridging is only considered in exceptional high-risk scenarios (e.g. mechanical heart valve or recent thromboembolism) [^1144uyDx] and should be individualized [^1126HKPY].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for not bridging

- **Rapid onset**: Apixaban achieves therapeutic anticoagulation within 2–4 hours, so bridging is unnecessary [^117NFVUu].

- **Predictable pharmacokinetics**: Apixaban's stable kinetics enable straightforward transitions without overlap [^116Ywy1q].

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Bridging adds bleeding risk without reducing thromboembolism [^116STUmW] [^117TQSc3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting no bridging

- **AMPLIFY trial**: Apixaban was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin without bridging, with less bleeding [^111BKFsH] [^113Bc9N2].

- **PAUSE study**: Interrupting DOACs without bridging resulted in low thromboembolism and bleeding rates [^1159SFvX].

- **Meta-analyses**: Bridging increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism [^117TQSc3] [^115xsBwQ].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from ACCP (2022) and ACC/AHA/HRS (2023) **recommend against routine bridging** for DOACs, including apixaban, because of increased bleeding and lack of benefit [^112jnRz3] [^114yW3p7]. They advise **individualized decisions** for high-risk patients (e.g. mechanical valves or recent thromboembolism) [^1144uyDx] [^1126HKPY].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Routine transition from heparin to apixaban | Stop heparin; start apixaban at next scheduled dose [^116W3hkD] |
| Urgent need for heparin after apixaban | Wait 2–4 hours after last apixaban dose before starting heparin [^notfound] |
| High thrombotic risk (mechanical valve, recent thromboembolism) | Consider bridging after multidisciplinary review [^11629V9n] [^116ufVzy] |

---

## Risks associated with bridging

Bridging increases **major bleeding** [^117TQSc3] and overall bleeding [^116STUmW] without reducing thromboembolism [^117TQSc3]. It also complicates management and increases costs and resource use.

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **Routine transition**: Stop heparin; start apixaban at the next scheduled dose [^116W3hkD].

- **Urgent heparin after apixaban**: Wait 2–4 hours after the last apixaban dose before starting heparin [^notfound].

- **High-risk patients**: Individualize bridging decisions with multidisciplinary input [^116ufVzy].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Bridging heparin with apixaban is **not recommended** due to increased bleeding without added benefit [^117NFVUu]. Use direct transitions and reserve bridging for exceptional high-risk cases with careful individualized planning [^114yW3p7].

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TQSc3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The risk and benefit of periprocedural heparin bridging is not completely clarified. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Heparin bridging was associated with lower risks of thromboembolism and bleeding compared to non‐bridging. PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library (2000‐2016) were searched for English‐language studies. Studies comparing interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging and continuous oral anticoagulation in patients at moderate‐to‐high thromboembolic risk before invasive procedures were included. Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Mantel‐Haenszel method and random‐effects models were used to analyze the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Eighteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies) were included (N = 23 364). There was no difference in thromboembolic risk between bridged and non‐bridged patients (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.61‐2.58; RCTs: RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23‐2.24; cohorts: RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63‐3.37). However, bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall bleeding (RR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.00‐4.01; RCTs: RR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.99‐5.09; cohorts: RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 2.07‐4.62) and major bleeding (RR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78‐5.06; RCTs: RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.29‐4.76; cohorts: RR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.65‐6.32). Bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non‐bridging. Thromboembolism risk was similar between two strategies. Our results do not support routine use of bridging during anticoagulation interruption.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1147od5Y]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Timing of anticoagulant interruption and restart for surgery is outlined as follows: Recommendations state aspirin is continued for all types of surgeries, and Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) are stopped for 24 h before minor surgery and 48 h before major surgery, while clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) are held for 5–7 days. Table-based examples specify drug-specific withholding and restart intervals: Warfarin (Coumadin) half-life 20–60 h, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin) and 48–72 h after major surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin); Apixaban (Eliquis) half-life 8–15 h, withhold 24 h for minor and 48 h for major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h uses creatinine clearance (CrCl) to guide withholding (CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 24 h for minor, 72 h for major; CrCl < 50 mL: 75 h for minor, 120 h for major) and restart 24 h after minor or 24–48 h after major surgery; Aspirin half-life 7–10 days is "usually continued" and "usually continued" for restart; Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days, withhold 5–7 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery. In case of impaired renal function, withholding intervals for several agents should be prolonged and/or drug levels evaluated.

### Apixaban reduces hospitalizations in patients with venous thromboembolism: an analysis of the apixaban for the initial management of pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis as first-line therapy (AMPLIFY) trial [^113Bc9N2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of the double‐blind AMPLIFY trial demonstrated the benefits of apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin with respect to hospitalizations in patients being treated for VTE. The analysis demonstrated that apixaban significantly reduced both the risk of all‐cause hospitalizations and other healthcare provider visits compared with enoxaparin/warfarin over 6 months. All‐cause hospitalization was also significantly reduced with apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin within the first 30 days after the index event. Additionally, apixaban reduced the length of stay in hospital per patient compared with enoxaparin/warfarin. These results were consistent across key subgroups. The main reasons for hospitalizations were VTE recurrence and bleeding events, both of which were lower in apixaban‐treated than enoxaparin/warfarin‐treated patients.

The reduction in all‐cause hospitalizations by apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin may be explained by the overall trial results that showed apixaban significantly reduced major bleeding compared with enoxaparin/warfarin (relative risk 0.31, 95% CI = 0.17–0.55) and had a numerically lower risk of VTE recurrence or VTE‐related death (relative risk 0.84, 95% CI = 0.60–1.18). 12 Patients randomized to apixaban did not receive bridging therapy with low‐molecular‐weight heparin. However, this did not compromise the rates of VTE recurrence or VTE‐related death, or the rate of all‐cause hospitalizations. This suggests that bridging therapy with low‐molecular‐weight heparin is not necessary with apixaban. Therefore, the increased risk of bleeding associated with switching treatments between parenteral anticoagulants and oral anticoagulants such as warfarin is likely to be reduced.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^112FM2o4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic predicted to increase in the coming decades. Indeed, in 2010, the estimated global prevalence of AF was 33.5 million. 1 Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication. 2

Although direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have been on the market since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione) remain a standard treatment in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding and of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings.

It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. 7 This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom a bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent (low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH] or other pentasaccharide, eg, fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin) to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The recommendation in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 is less clear for those with stable NVAF who do not require rapid anticoagulation. In real‐life conditions, a bridging regimen is commonly used in those with a low stroke risk. 16, 17, 18, 19 This practice is not supported by evidence.

VKA use has declined recently in favor of direct oral anticoagulants; however, the latest available results have shown that they are still more widely used than direct oral anticoagulants. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Since millions of patients worldwide may be at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to bridging therapy, adverse health outcomes associated with management of VKA still warrant investigation.

Therefore, the purpose of this cohort study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a bridging regimen during the initiation of VKA therapy in NVAF patients in outpatient care.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^11628UVE]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — specific reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants describe agents, mechanisms, dosing, and key cautions. For dabigatran (Pradaxa), idarucizumab (PRAXBIND) is a "Monoclonal antibody fragment with high affinity for dabigatran; sequesters dabigatran from binding and inhibiting thrombin", with considerations including "Adverse events in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance" and "Not evaluated in pregnant or breastfeeding patients". For apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), the reversal agent is "Coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo, also known as Andexanet alfa (ANDEXXA)", a "Synthetic variant of factor Xa without anticoagulant activity; binds and sequesters factor Xa inhibitors"; recommended regimens include "Low dose Initial IV bolus: 400 mg at a target rate of 30 mg/min Follow-on IV infusion: 4 mg/min for up to 120 minutes (480 mg)" and "High dose Initial IV bolus: 800 mg at a target rate of 30 mg/min Follow-on IV infusion: 8 mg/min for up to 120 minutes (960 mg)", with cautions to "Monitor for signs and symptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic, ischemic events, and cardiac arrest", "Avoid prior to heparinization due to binding of heparin-antithrombin III complex", "May reverse LMWH", and "Not evaluated in pregnant or breastfeeding patients".

### A systematic update on the state of novel anticoagulants and a primer on reversal and bridging [^11618K95]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes familiar agents that have been in use for many years, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). A number of novel oral anticoagulants are currently developed or are in stages of development to either replace VKAs in concert with initial heparin or LMWH, or to replace both heparin/LMWH and VKAs totally as monotherapy. These agents hold the promise of not requiring monitoring, being safer in terms of bleeding risk than current agents, and being of equal or improved efficacy compared with established anticoagulants.

Methods

In the following report, we systematically review the oral agents currently approved or closest to approval for both VTE and atrial fibrillation treatment, focusing on the treatment of VTE: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

Results

Findings of clinical use and comparisons to standard care of these agents are summarized in depth, by succinctly reviewing all major randomized controlled trials. Mechanistic and functional differences are reviewed, as Dabigatran targets activated factor II (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban target activated factor X (factor Xa). We also discuss the inability at the present time to reliably reverse the anticoagulant effects of these agents, provide a suggested strategy for reversal, and finally discuss an approach to bridging these agents when other procedures are required while currently taking one of these three agents.

Conclusions

These agents, while still with many unanswered questions, demonstrate great promise in the prevention and treatment of VTE.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^115U7dSj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective study based on a cohort of patients treated using DOACs who underwent elective surgery during 2019 and 2020. The data collection was approved by the cantonal research ethics commission (CCER 2021–00639). Study inclusion criteria were being ≥ 18 years old, undergoing anticoagulation therapy with any DOAC (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban or dabigatran) and being scheduled for elective surgery. Exclusion criteria were the absence of information on the date of surgery, flutter ablations, cardioversions and contraindications to surgery detected at the anaesthesia consultation.

We extracted data from patients' electronic medical files, mostly during anaesthesia consultations, including patient characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, CHA 2 DS 2 and/or CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc risk stratification scores for patients with AF), comorbidities (heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, coronary artery disease, lower-limb artery disease, a prosthetic valve, mitral regurgitation, thromboembolic venous disease, active cancer), laboratory values (haemoglobin, platelets, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance), type of DOAC and dosing, surgical bleeding risk as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Guidance Statement (Supplementary Table 2, Additional file 1), type of anaesthesia (general, neuraxial, local or other), and intervention postponements and their causes.

Type of anticoagulation therapy, the risk of the planned surgery and the proposed anticoagulation interruption interval were collected to determine how closely clinicians had adhered to institutional recommendations (our main objective). These recommendations accorded with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), except for its requirement to institute heparin bridging in the event of a recent thromboembolic event (< 3 months prior) (Supplementary Table 3, Additional file 1).

Furthermore, minimal and low-risk procedures were considered together, as the PAUSE protocol suggests, whereas the ACCP guidelines propose continuing DOACs during minimally risky procedures. The secondary objective was to determine the prevalence of procedural postponements due to poor anticoagulation management.

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^1178Szfi]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116STUmW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although thromboembolism may cause severe morbidity and mortality, it should be weighed against the bleeding risk of bridging anticoagulation. 31 Considering the higher risk of bleeding related to bridging anticoagulation, our results suggested non‐bridging management seems to have a favorable risk‐benefit profile in terms of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. There are some explanations for the bleeding risk of bridging anticoagulation. First, residual anti‐Xa effect or heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia may contribute to postoperative bleeding. 32 Second, due to the interindividual variability in the sensitivity of aPTT test (the most common laboratory measurement to monitor UFH), control of aPTT range may not correlate well with the activity of bridging anticoagulation. 33

NOACs have been increasingly used for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with moderate‐to‐high risk. 32 NOACs are non‐inferior for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and associated with less bleeding compared to warfarin. 34 NOACs have advantages of short half‐lives, fast onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetic properties (concentration‐dependent), and few drug‐drug interactions. 35 Although the experience of periprocedural use of NOACs is accumulating, there are limited data available pertaining to the bridging anticoagulation for patients on NOAC therapy in terms of perioperative bleeding risk. 36 The Dresden NOAC registry revealed major bleeding rate of 1.2% and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding rate of 3.4% in patients using NOACs during invasive procedures. 37 A subgroup analysis of the RE‐LY trial showed no significant difference in the risk of periprocedural major bleeding between patients using dabigatran 110 mg (3.8%), dabigatran 150 mg (5.1%), or warfarin (4.6%). 38 However, these studies did not compare the bleeding risk between bridging and non‐bridging therapy. 37, 38 Whether it is better for patients using NOACs to receive bridging anticoagulation is currently unclear. Two specific reversal agents for NOACs have been approved in the United States: idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban reversal. 39, 40 Tailoring periprocedural management of NOACs to the type of invasive procedure may reduce the risk of bleeding.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^116ufVzy]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation bridging — who and how to bridge — should be used selectively for high thrombotic risk. If an individual is particularly high risk (e.g., pulmonary embolus within the last 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or artificial heart valve), bridging anticoagulation in the form of intravenous or low molecular weight heparin can be employed only after multidisciplinary discussion. Bridging is advised when the INR is down to 2, unfractionated heparin should be stopped 6 hours before the procedure and low molecular weight heparin should be held on the morning of the procedure, and both can be restarted 6–12 hours after the procedure unless hemostasis intervention is needed.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112Bhxy7]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on VKAs (elective surgeries/procedures), ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering heparin bridging in patients receiving VKA therapy deemed at high risk for thromboembolism and requiring VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^114R59fQ]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Systemic anticoagulation prior to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — current practices and reversal: Many patients are already anticoagulated, and historically "bridged" strategies with intravenous or low molecular weight heparin were used, but this approach "resulted in a high incidence of bleeding complications", leading to "a new trend towards performing AF ablation procedures in patients who are continuously therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin". In the event of intraprocedural bleeding, "protamine is administered to reverse heparin", and for excessive bleeding on therapeutic warfarin, "Fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC; Factors II, VII, IX, and X), or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) can be used". An "emerging anticoagulation strategy" uses dabigatran or Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban), but "Clinical experience with these new anticoagulation agents in association with an AF ablation procedure at the present time is limited".

### Management and clinical outcomes in patients treated with apixaban vs warfarin undergoing procedures [^111U65VL]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Using data from ARISTOTLE, we describe the periprocedural management of anticoagulation and rates of subsequent clinical outcomes among patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin or apixaban. We recorded whether (and for how long) anticoagulant therapy was interrupted preprocedure, whether bridging therapy was used, and the proportion of patients who experienced important clinical outcomes during the 30 days postprocedure. Of 10674 procedures performed during follow-up in 5924 patients, 9260 were included in this analysis. Anticoagulant treatment was not interrupted preprocedure 37.5% of the time. During the 30 days postprocedure, stroke or systemic embolism occurred after 16/4624 (0.35%) procedures among apixaban-treated patients and 26/4530 (0.57%) procedures among warfarin-treated patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.601; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.322–1.120). Major bleeding occurred in 74/4560 (1.62%) procedures in the apixaban arm and 86/4454 (1.93%) in the warfarin arm (OR 0.846; 95% CI 0.614–1.166). The risk of death was similar with apixaban (54/4624 [1.17%]) and warfarin (49/4530 [1.08%]) (OR 1.082; 95% CI 0.733–1.598). Among patients in ARISTOTLE, the 30-day postprocedure stroke, death, and major bleeding rates were low and similar in apixaban- and warfarin-treated patients, regardless of whether anticoagulation was stopped beforehand. Our findings suggest that many patients on chronic anticoagulation can safely undergo procedures; some will not require a preprocedure interruption of anticoagulation. ARISTOTLE was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00412984.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^1159SFvX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the recent ACCP guidelines, DOACs can be continued in cases of minimal bleeding risk or according to the clinician's judgment. However, only about 6% of the patients had not had their anticoagulant interrupted when a continuation was not recommended, suggesting a minimal influence on the final result.

These results contrasted with the 94% adherence observed in the PAUSE study. However, our study reflected a real-life setting that cannot be compared with the adherence to a study protocol. Premature interruption and heparin bridging (when not recommended) were responsible for more than half of the observed management failures by clinicians. Fear of bleeding or thromboembolic events could have driven this approach by clinicians despite data from the PAUSE study showing low rates of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications associated with this preoperative management of DOACs. It is possible that clinicians still lack knowledge about our institutional recommendations, although they have been widely distributed as a pocket guide since 2015. Our findings could reflect a lack of confidence in these guidelines as some clinicians argue that the PAUSE study did not include enough patients with a high bleeding risk. Indeed, only a third of the patients it included underwent high-bleeding-risk surgery, with most being cardiac surgery. Clinicians could thus be less prone to following the ACCP guidelines when dealing with high-bleeding-risk surgeries; therefore, they increased the delay between the last DOAC dose and the surgery and/or the prescription of heparin bridging. However, the fact that our study's adherence rates were low for all bleeding risk categories argues against this. Local anaesthesia was associated with a 70% reduction in adherence to our institution's recommendations. Although the 2022 ACCP guidelines do not suggest specific strategies for local anaesthesia, this lack of adherence is not surprising because the European Society of Anaesthesia (ESA) guidelines for regional anaesthesia do not propose discontinuation of anticoagulants for superficial nerve blocks, only for deep nerve blocks. Thus, some clinicians probably decided to maintain DOAC therapy during the intervention, as the ESA guidelines recommend. Interestingly, apixaban treatment was also associated with less adherence than rivaroxaban treatment, even after multivariate analysis. Therefore, patient morbidity or procedure risk in patients under apixaban cannot be claimed as causes of poor adherence. Although a complete explanation of this observation remains elusive, we can hypothesise that the twice-daily administration of apixaban may have appeared more confusing for clinicians attempting to manage the preoperative interruption of the drug.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^114aHemU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antithrombotic drugs including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; warfarin and acenocoumarol), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban), antiplatelet drugs such as the P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor), and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are used in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism, and valvular heart disease. These drugs also increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from luminal sources such as ulcers or diverticula and after endoscopic procedures. Standardized, evidence-based protocols are lacking to inform best practices before and after endoscopic procedures in urgent and elective settings. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding best practice recommendations and associated levels of evidence has led to significant variation in adherence to guideline-directed practices.

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) convened an international, multisociety, and multidisciplinary working group to create a focused, pragmatic guideline after distillation of published literature to inform clinical practice in the periendoscopic period. In keeping with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, the most pertinent clinical questions guided the systematic review of the literature, with the resulting rigorous methodological evaluation of the available published data informing recommendations. In this document, we propose an evidence-based approach to periprocedural antithrombotic drug management in common emergent and elective settings addressing clinical questions related to (i) temporary interruption of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs; (ii) reversal of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs; (iii) periprocedural heparin bridging; and (iv) postprocedural resumption of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.

This document does not cover all possible clinical situations where multidisciplinary guidance may be necessary to manage periendoscopic antithrombotic therapy. Nor does it address the rapidly evolving menu of endoscopic approaches developed to minimize intraprocedural and postprocedural bleeding in situations such as removing large colonic polyps. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel could not recommend a best practice for all clinical questions. These clinical situations are identified as priorities for future research.

### Periprocedural antithrombotic management: a review of the literature and practical approach for the hospitalist physician [^111TTkoZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients who are on long-term antithrombotic therapy (e.g. warfarin and/or antiplatelet agents) must be assessed for temporary discontinuation for a procedure or surgery, making this a salient topic for the hospitalist physician. Discontinuation of antithromhotic therapy can place patients at increased risk of thromboembolic complications while continuing antithrombotic therapy can increase procedure-related bleeding risk. Bridging anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparins is often used in the periprocedural period, but a great deal of uncertainty exists about how and when to use bridging anticoagulation. Because there is very little Level 1 evidence to define optimal care, both clinical practice and expert consensus guideline opinions vary. For the hospitalist, it is of critical importance to understand the available data, controversies, and management options in order to approach patient care rationally. This review provides a step-wise literature-based discussion addressing the following four questions: (1) What is the optimal management of antiplatelet therapy in the periprocedural period? (2) Are there very low bleeding risk procedures that do not require interruption of oral anticoagulation? (3) Are there low thromboembolic risk populations who do not require periprocedural bridging? (4) How do you manage patients who must discontinue anti-coagulants but are at an increased thrombotic risk?

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on VKAs (elective surgeries/procedures), ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid administering heparin bridging in patients receiving VKA therapy for VTE as the sole clinical indication requiring VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^116WN6EW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^116GFjDS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, are now first‐line therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Many patients taking chronic anticoagulant therapy will require temporary interruption for a surgical procedure. Management of the anticoagulant in the perioperative period can be complicated because the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent differ, most significantly as compared with warfarin.

Because of its long half‐life, warfarin is often interrupted several days before the procedure. For patients with a high risk of thrombotic complications, "bridging" therapy with low molecular weight heparin or other short‐acting parenteral anticoagulants are frequently used while the anticoagulant activity of warfarin wanes or returns to therapeutic range. This practice, however, is associated with higher risk of bleeding compared with those in whom bridging therapy was not initiated. In contrast to warfarin, DOACs have both a short half‐life and rapid onset of action, which make them ideal for perioperative use and removes the necessity of bridging anticoagulation. Prior studies have compared postoperative outcomes of patients following the perioperative interruption of DOACs vs. warfarin and found no major differences in postoperative rates of major bleeding or thromboembolic events. However, because these were post hoc analyses of clinical trials, the patient samples include a more selective population that is commonly seen in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to compare 30‐day postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic events associated with DOAC versus warfarin management in the perioperative period in a practice‐based cohort of patients.

### Interrupted versus uninterrupted anticoagulation for cardiac rhythm management device insertion [^114sFpkX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-recommended strategies to interrupt chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) during the perioperative period of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) surgery differ worldwide. There is uncertainty concerning the benefits and harms of interrupted and uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing CIED surgery.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interrupted anticoagulation (IAC) with either warfarin or DOAC in the perioperative period of CIED surgery versus uninterrupted anticoagulation (UAC), with or without heparin bridging, during an equivalent time frame, for CIED surgery.

Search Methods

CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and two trials registers were searched on 26 November 2021 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We plan to update this review imminently.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IAC vs. UAC in adults with a diagnosed cardiac rhythm disorder, who underwent elective CIED surgery and received at least one month of warfarin or DOAC anticoagulation. Comparisons of interest were: (1) continued warfarin vs. interrupted warfarin anticoagulation, with or without heparin bridging; and (2) continued DOAC (apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) vs. interrupted DOAC, with or without heparin bridging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were composite thromboembolic events (transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, peripheral embolism, or valve thrombosis) and device-pocket hematoma. Secondary outcomes included individual components of composite thromboembolic events, composite bleeding events, all-cause mortality, adverse events, quality of life and days of hospitalization. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The inverse variance random-effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the DerSimonian and Laird method was used for calculating the between-study variance Tau 2. Dichotomous outcomes were calculated as risk ratios (RRs) and we used mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, with respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

Main Results

We identified 10 eligible studies (2221 participants), of which one is ongoing. Of these 10 studies, six compared IAC vs. UAC with warfarin (1267 participants) and four compared IAC vs. UAC with DOAC (954 participants). Follow-up duration ranged between 0.5 to three months. The mean age of participants ranged from 68 to 76 years. Definitions of thromboembolic events, device-pocket hematoma, and bleeding events varied across studies. IAC vs. UAC with warfarin IAC with warfarin may result in little to no difference in composite thromboembolic events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.11; 5 RCTs, n = 1266; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of IAC on device-pocket hematoma (RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.83 to 4.22; 5 RCTs, n = 1266; very low-certainty evidence), ischemic stroke (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.40; 5 RCTs, n = 1266; very low-certainty evidence) and composite bleeding events (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 4.43; 5 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). IAC with warfarin likely results in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (0 events in both groups; 2 RCTs, n = 782; moderate-certainty evidence). IAC may result in a slight reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.93; 3 RCTs, n = 953; low-certainty evidence). IAC vs. UAC with DOAC IAC with DOAC may result in little to no difference in composite thromboembolic events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.63; 3 RCTs, n = 843; low-certainty evidence) and ischemic stroke (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.63, 2 RCTs, n = 763; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of IAC with DOAC on device-pocket hematoma (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.11; 4 RCTs, n = 954; very low-certainty evidence) and composite bleeding events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.06; 4 RCTs, n = 954; very low-certainty evidence). IAC may result in little to no difference in ischemic stroke (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.63, 2 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). IAC likely results in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (0 events in both groups; 2 RCTs, n = 763; moderate-certainty evidence). IAC may result in a slight reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.39; 2 RCTs, n = 763; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Interrupted anticoagulation in people undergoing elective CIED surgery had similar outcomes to uninterrupted anticoagulation with either warfarin or DOAC medications. Certainty of evidence was judged to be low to very low for most of the assessed outcomes. Further RCTs are particularly needed to help identify whether IAC significantly impacts the risks of thromboembolic events and device-pocket hematoma.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1122fZyw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Postprocedural anticoagulation management in patients on oral anticoagulants specifies that once adequate postprocedural hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation should likely be restarted expeditiously. For procedures with low postprocedural bleeding risk, anticoagulation can likely be restarted 24 hours after the procedure, whereas if postprocedural bleeding risk is higher, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours. For patients at high thrombotic risk who will be restarting VKA therapy, bridging anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulants may be considered once hemostasis is achieved, but such bridging is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decrease in thrombotic events in nonvalvular AF; if a DOAC is used postprocedurally, bridging anticoagulation should not be used. When surgeries or procedures are performed to control bleeding, restarting anticoagulation after the procedure may carry a higher bleeding risk; if the source of bleeding is identified and completely corrected with adequate hemostasis, restarting anticoagulation may be reasonable, and individualized strategies with close clinical monitoring apply when bleeding was not successfully controlled by surgical/procedural management.

Valvular heart disease — planned interruption of VKA and bridging — When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure and restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows; bridging with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (intravenous UFH) or 12 hours (subcutaneous LMWH) before the procedure. There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials in adequate numbers of prosthetic heart valve patients, evidence derives mostly from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups, and in other patient groups bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing thromboembolism; accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and account for the tradeoffs between thrombosis and bleeding.

### Peri-procedural management of patients taking oral anticoagulants [^116Ywy1q]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The use of oral anticoagulants is becoming increasingly common. For many years warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant available, but therapeutic options have expanded with the introduction of oral direct thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Management of patients taking any oral anticoagulant in the peri-procedural period poses a challenge to medical and surgical providers because of the competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage. Bridging therapy has been used to minimize time without anticoagulation when warfarin is interrupted for invasive procedures, but validated strategies based on high quality data are lacking. Existing data suggest that the use of bridging therapy may increase the risk of bleeding for some patients without reducing the risk of thrombosis. Clinical trials are currently under way to answer these questions. Because the half lives and time to anticoagulant activity of newer oral anticoagulants are shorter than for warfarin, bridging therapy is not thought to be necessary with these agents. Peri-procedural management of patients taking these agents is complicated by the lack of demonstrated reversal agents in emergency situations, although specific antidotes are being developed and tested. Existing guidelines for peri-procedural management of patients on oral anticoagulants highlight the importance of individualized patient decision making and suggest strategies to minimize complications. From a patient's perspective, given the uncertainties surrounding optimal management, explicit discussions regarding risks and benefits of treatment options and demonstration of effective communication among medical and surgical providers are essential.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^117UuKyb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Index VTE was classified as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), device-related thrombosis (neonatal population only), and other VTE (i.e. cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombus). Prior to randomization, patients could be treated with SOC anticoagulation for up to 14 days; overall mean (SD) duration of treatment with SOC anticoagulation prior to randomization was 4.9 (2.6) days, and for 92.9% of patients the duration was between 0 and 7 days. Patients were randomized according to a 2:1 ratio to receive either an age-appropriate formulation and body weight-adjusted doses of ELIQUIS or SOC. For patients 2 to less than 18 years, SOC was comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparins (UFH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA). For patients 28 days to less than 2 years of age, SOC was limited to heparins (UFH or LMWH). The main treatment phase lasted 6 to 12 weeks for patients aged birth to less than 2 years, and 12 weeks for patients aged greater than 2 years. Patients aged 28 days to less than 18 years who were randomized to receive apixaban had the option to continue apixaban treatment for 6 to 12 additional weeks in the extension phase.

A diagnostic imaging test was obtained at baseline, at week 6, and end of treatment for patients ≥ 2 years of age and at baseline and end of treatment for < 2 years of age.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

7.3 Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents

Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding.

APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of ELIQUIS in high-risk, post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with ELIQUIS compared to placebo. The rate of ISTH major bleeding was 2.8% per year with ELIQUIS versus 0.6% per year with placebo in patients receiving single antiplatelet therapy and was 5.9% per year with ELIQUIS versus 2.5% per year with placebo in those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.

In ARISTOTLE, concomitant use of aspirin increased the bleeding risk on ELIQUIS from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and concomitant use of aspirin and warfarin increased the bleeding risk from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.3%) use of dual antiplatelet therapy with ELIQUIS.

### Emergency department discharge of pulmonary embolus patients [^113Afox5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Reflective of the changing anticoagulant landscape, the majority of patients enrolled in MERCURY‐PE received treatment with a DOAC, most commonly rivaroxaban (51%) or apixaban (25%). While both of these agents have a rapid onset, 75% of all patients still were initially treated with unfractionated or low‐molecular‐weight heparin. The use of a heparinoid agent, despite no bridging therapy requirement with DOACs, may reflect historical patterns of early treatment in suspected PE or may represent concern for selecting a reversible agent (heparin can be reversed, factor Xa inhibitors do not currently have an available antidote) in the initial management period.

Finally, we noted a higher frequency of TE‐AEs with rivaroxaban. This seem to be a composite of several subjective complaints, which in the final analysis did not result in study drug termination or an association with AEs. While the precise causality of these TE‐AEs cannot be determined and are not reflected in very large investigations of rivaroxaban, it is possible that our finding represents a nociceptive bias (where subjects report a higher frequency of events in randomized controlled trials compared to observational registries, as they are specifically asked about these events randomized controlled trials).

Bridge therapy — evidence on perioperative heparin bridging for vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — indicates limited benefit: A meta-analysis of 34 studies (total of 12,278 patients included) of vitamin K antagonist users undergoing elective procedures found no difference in thrombotic events between bridged and unbridged groups; two randomized trials (PERIOP2 and BRIDGE) assessing bridging patients on warfarin found no reduction in thromboembolic events versus placebo; and in DOAC-treated atrial fibrillation patients (PAUSE), discontinuing DOACs without heparin bridging yielded low thromboembolic event rates. The text also notes that, for certain patients, the risks of bridging may outweigh the benefits.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^111BKFsH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 5244 patients were evaluable for efficacy and were followed for a mean of 154 days in the ELIQUIS group and 152 days in the enoxaparin/warfarin group. The mean age was 57 years. The AMPLIFY study population was 59% male, 83% Caucasian, 8% Asian, and 4% Black. For patients randomized to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0–3.0) was 60.9%.

Approximately 90% of patients enrolled in AMPLIFY had an unprovoked DVT or PE at baseline. The remaining 10% of patients with a provoked DVT or PE were required to have an additional ongoing risk factor in order to be randomized, which included previous episode of DVT or PE, immobilization, history of cancer, active cancer, and known prothrombotic genotype.

ELIQUIS was shown to be noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the AMPLIFY study for the primary endpoint of recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related death over 6 months of therapy (Table 17).

In the AMPLIFY study, patients were stratified according to their index event of PE (with or without DVT) or DVT (without PE). Efficacy in the initial treatment of VTE was consistent between the two subgroups.

### International consensus statement on the peri-operative management of direct oral anticoagulants in cardiac surgery [^112dHq1a]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite current recommendations on the management of severe peri-operative bleeding, there is no pragmatic guidance for the peri-operative monitoring and management of cardiac surgical patients taking direct oral anticoagulants. Members of the Transfusion and Haemostasis Subcommittee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology, of their own volition, performed an independent systematic review of peer-reviewed original research, review articles and case reports and developed the following consensus statement. This has been endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology. In our opinion, most patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy presenting for elective cardiac surgery can be safely managed in the peri-operative period if the following conditions are fulfilled: direct oral anticoagulants have been discontinued two days before cardiac surgery, corresponding to five elimination half-live periods; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or a high risk of bleeding, a pre-operative plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants has been determined and found to be below 30 ng.ml -1 (currently only valid for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). In cases where plasma level monitoring is not possible (e.g. assay was not available), discontinuation for 10 elimination half-live periods (four days) is required. For FXa inhibitors, a standard heparin-calibrated anti-Xa level of < 0.1 IU.ml -1 should be measured, indicating sufficient reduction in the anticoagulant effect. Finally, short-term bridging with heparin is not required in the pre-operative period.

The perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation who require an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is an area of ongoing uncertainty. Accumulating evidence from observational studies suggests that the use of bridging anticoagulation with heparin, although well-intentioned, might not reduce perioperative thromboembolism and can increase bleeding.

### Bleeding and recurrent VTE with apixaban vs warfarin as outpatient treatment: time-course and subgroup analyses [^115jCio9]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

In the phase 3 trial Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy, apixaban was noninferior to enoxaparin, overlapped and followed by warfarin, in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with significantly less bleeding; in a real-world evaluation, risks for bleeding and recurrent VTE were lower with apixaban vs warfarin plus parenteral anticoagulant (PAC) bridge therapy. The present study extends this research by comparing outcomes over time and within selected subgroups. A retrospective observational cohort design and 4 US private health care claims databases were used. Study population included patients who initiated outpatient treatment with apixaban or warfarin (plus PAC bridge therapy) for VTE. Major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding, and recurrent VTE were compared during the 180-day follow-up period, at selected follow-up time points (days 21, 90, 180), and within subgroups (pulmonary embolism [PE] with or without deep vein thrombosis [DVT], DVT only, provoked VTE, unprovoked VTE) using multivariable shared frailty models. Study population consisted of 20561 apixaban patients and 35080 warfarin patients; baseline characteristics were comparable. Overall, at selected follow-up time points, and within the aforementioned subgroups, adjusted risks were lower among apixaban vs warfarin patients: major bleeding, by 27% to 39%, CRNM bleeding, by 17% to 28%, and recurrent VTE, by 25% to 39% (all P ≤ .01). In this real-world study of VTE patients, risks of bleeding and recurrent VTE were lower among apixaban (vs warfarin) patients during the 180-day follow-up period, at selected follow-up time points, and within subgroups defined by index VTE episode.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1124McrQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The risk and benefit of periprocedural heparin bridging is not completely clarified. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Heparin bridging was associated with lower risks of thromboembolism and bleeding compared to non-bridging. PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library (2000–2016) were searched for English-language studies. Studies comparing interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging and continuous oral anticoagulation in patients at moderate-to-high thromboembolic risk before invasive procedures were included. Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Mantel-Haenszel method and random-effects models were used to analyze the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Eighteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies) were included (N = 23364). There was no difference in thromboembolic risk between bridged and non-bridged patients (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.61–2.58; RCTs: RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23–2.24; cohorts: RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63–3.37). However, bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall bleeding (RR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.00–4.01; RCTs: RR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.99–5.09; cohorts: RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 2.07–4.62) and major bleeding (RR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78–5.06; RCTs: RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.29–4.76; cohorts: RR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.65–6.32). Bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non-bridging. Thromboembolism risk was similar between two strategies. Our results do not support routine use of bridging during anticoagulation interruption.

### Bridging anticoagulation: primum non nocere [^111A3CwZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic oral anticoagulation frequently requires interruption for various reasons and durations. Whether or not to bridge with heparin or other anticoagulants is a common clinical dilemma. The evidence to inform decision making is limited, making current guidelines equivocal and imprecise. Moreover, indications for anticoagulation interruption may be unclear. New observational studies and a recent large randomized trial have noted significant perioperative or periprocedural bleeding rates without reduction in thromboembolism when bridging is employed. Such bleeding may also increase morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, physician preferences for routine bridging anticoagulation during chronic anticoagulation interruptions may be too aggressive. More randomized trials, such as PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism), will help guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation for indications such as venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves. In the meantime, physicians should carefully consider both the need for oral anticoagulation interruption and the practice of routine bridging when anticoagulation interruption is indicated.

### Replacement of warfarin with a novel oral anticoagulant in endoscopic mucosal resection: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^117VfqaY]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Increasing numbers of patients are receiving anticoagulant therapy as society ages, putting more and more of them at haemorrhage risk. Gastrointestinal bleeding is rare in such patients who undergo therapeutic endoscopy. Doctors who suspend a patient's anticoagulant therapy due to excess concern over gastrointestinal bleeding instead increase their risk of cerebral infarction, embolism, and other such serious events. Thus, both suspension and continuation of anticoagulant therapy can cause serious illness, leading to increases in hospitalisation and treatment costs. Heparin bridging is currently considered the standard treatment prior to therapeutic endoscopy for patients taking oral warfarin; however, higher proportion of postoperative bleeding and longer hospital stays associated with heparin bridging have also brought increases in hospitalisation costs and treatment costs. There are several reports on the risk of heparin bridging. However, since there is no clinical trial that examined heparin bridging at EMR, we believe that this trial is important. This study seeks to establish a procedure that presents lower risks of haemorrhage, thrombosis, and embolism, and which could lower medical costs by reducing the length of hospital stays. Assessing the effects and risks of apixaban's use in therapeutic endoscopy for patients receiving anticoagulant therapies could also lead to safer and more effective ways of managing anticoagulant therapies. The paucity of reports with high evidence levels was considered problematic when the JGES gastroenterological endoscopy guidelines were revised in 2012. The results of this trial will have clinical significance, as its data could serve as the basis for revisions in the next edition of the guidelines.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^116Q9aRH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism

Anticoagulation is recommended in all patients with acute PE to reduce the risk of early death and recurrent symptomatic or fatal VTE. Patients with high‐risk PE should receive prompt intravenous anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) prior to reperfusion 10. Guideline‐recommended options for anticoagulation in patients with confirmed non‐high‐risk PE include 10, 11:
A DOAC approved as a single‐drug therapy (apixaban or rivaroxaban)
Acute‐phase parenteral anticoagulation followed by a DOAC (e.g. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban)
Acute‐phase parenteral anticoagulation overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA)
Parenteral anticoagulation alone

From a patient and health care provider prospective, some of the DOACs offer several practical advantages over VKAs, including the lack of requirements for bridging anticoagulant injections, coagulation monitoring, limited dietary restrictions, and fewer drug–drug interactions 30. By simplifying VTE treatment, DOACs make outpatient PE therapy more tolerable and feasible. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban, both approved as single‐drug therapies, facilitate initial outpatient PE treatment because they eliminate the need for parenteral anticoagulants (i.e. bridging therapy) 32, 33.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZcRy]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

### The role of heparin lead-in in the real-world management of acute venous thromboembolism: the PREFER in VTE registry [^114PrEJK]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The appropriate strategy for initiating oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy after an acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) depends on the intermediate-term anticoagulant to be used. While heparin bridging to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is required, the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) rivaroxaban (30mg/day) and apixaban (10mg/day) can be initiated directly without parenteral anticoagulation. The objective was to evaluate OAC initiation patterns in clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

PREFER in VTE was an international, non-interventional registry conducted between January 2013 and August 2015. Consecutive acute VTE patients were grouped based on their OAC treatment at 1month after the index event (VKA or DOAC).

Results

At 1month, 825 patients were receiving a VKA and 687 a DOAC (rivaroxaban in 685/687 cases). DOAC patients were significantly younger, less comorbid, at a lower bleeding risk, and less frequently diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (34.4% vs. 44.7%). During the first month after VTE, the most common treatment pattern was heparin-OAC overlap for VKA patents (69.6%), and OAC only for DOAC patients (49.1%). However, 28.8% of DOAC patients received a heparin-OAC overlap (median heparin duration: 3days; IQR: 2–6) and 14.8% were switched from heparin to DOAC. For those on rivaroxaban at 1month, only 29.7% had received the initial 30mg/day recommended dose. Clinical event rates were comparable between the DOAC only, heparin-DOAC switch, and heparin-DOAC overlap subgroups at 1 and 6months.

Conclusions

Guidelines for DOAC/rivaroxaban initiation after VTE are often not adhered to in clinical practice. This could result in adverse outcomes or suboptimal anticoagulation. Intervention programs to raise awareness amongst physicians may be merited.

Cohort selection and anticoagulation strategy

Patient records were reviewed and categorized into 2 specific cohorts: a temporary anticoagulation cessation group ("no-bridge") and a bridging group ("hep-bridge"). The choice of periprocedural anticoagulation strategy was based upon patient-specific risk factors and was made by a clinical pharmacist in the hospital's anti-coagulation clinic, where all patients were managed using a standardized Providence VA protocol. In this protocol, patients with atrial fibrillation and CHADS 2 scores of 1 to 2 were not prescribed hep-bridge. Patients with atrial fibrillation and CHADS 2 scores of 3 to 4 were not prescribed a bridge unless the patient had a history of cerebrovascular accident. For those with atrial fibrillation and a CHADS 2 score of 5 to 6, hep-bridge was prescribed. Additionally, any patient with a mechanical cardiac valve was prescribed hep-bridge.

For patients in the no-bridge cohort, warfarin was stopped 5 days pre-procedure and reinitiated immediately following colonoscopy, as per standard protocol. In the hep-bridge cohort, warfarin was held and subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg b.i.d.) was started 5 days prior to the procedure. Enoxaparin was stopped on the day of the colonoscopy and warfarin was restarted immediately post-procedure and continued until the target international normalized ratio (INR) was reached. Enoxaparin was typically continued with warfarin for 5 days post-procedure in the hep-bridge cohort. Other oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban) were stopped 2 days pre-procedure, without any hep-bridge, and reinitiated immediately following colonoscopy, as per hospital protocol.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. 1 DOACs are categorized into 2 main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (ie, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (ie, dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the following years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; ie, warfarin), or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. 2, 3, 4, 5 Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. 6 As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 7

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome and challenging to integrate into everyday clinical use. The purpose of this review is to be a practical reference or algorithm for the busy clinician to navigate key aspects of effective DOAC prescribing, with an emphasis on addressing key situations where clinical uncertainty exists. This review will provide recommendations to address special clinical situations to include indications, use in specific comorbidities, monitoring parameters, transitioning to or off of therapy, drug interactions, and cost.

2.2 Data retrieval and quality evaluation

Included studies met all of the following criteria: patients ≥ 18 years of age, long‐term use of oral anticoagulant before a procedure, elective invasive procedure or surgery, comparison of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation and non‐bridging management (continuous oral anticoagulation or interrupted oral anticoagulation without bridging therapy), reporting of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and articles published in peer‐reviewed journals. Studies with unclear reporting of thromboembolic or bleeding events, case reports, or letters to the editor were excluded. Studies with no control arm or designed specific to patients using novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were also excluded. Two authors (H.C.K. and F.L.L.) independently reviewed and collected data, including study design, patient characteristics of interest and relevant outcomes. The third blinded reviewer (Y.H.T.) resolved any disagreements between reviewers.

Patients were classified as bridged if they received any bridging therapy with UFH or LMWH in the periprocedural period. Patients were classified as non‐bridged if they interrupted oral anticoagulation without heparin bridging or continued use of oral anticoagulants during periprocedural period. Classification of high and low thromboembolic risk was based on the definitions described in the primary studies.

Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and overall bleeding events. Secondary outcome was major bleeding events. Thromboembolic events were defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism occurring during the follow‐up period. Major bleeding was defined as a need for transfusion, drop in hemoglobin > 2 g/L, requirement for surgical hemostasis, need for rehospitalization, intracranial hemorrhage, or fatal bleeding.

Study quality was assessed with criteria adapted from the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, ninth ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence‐Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. 8 Disagreements on data acquisition were resolved by consensus with the third reviewer.

14.3 Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

Efficacy and safety of ELIQUIS for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment was derived from the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies. Both studies were randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trials in patients with symptomatic proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE. All key safety and efficacy endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded manner by an independent committee.

AMPLIFY

The primary objective of AMPLIFY was to determine whether ELIQUIS was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin for the incidence of recurrent VTE (venous thromboembolism) or VTE-related death. Patients with an objectively confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE were randomized to treatment with ELIQUIS 10 mg twice daily orally for 7 days followed by ELIQUIS 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR ≥ 2) followed by warfarin (target INR range 2.0–3.0) orally for 6 months. Patients who required thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent, and patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, significant liver disease, an existing heart valve or atrial fibrillation, or active bleeding were excluded from the AMPLIFY study. Patients were allowed to enter the study with or without prior parenteral anticoagulation (up to 48 hours).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Lvtn5]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35–0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

Methods

Patients and Design

The PAUSE methodology has been published. 11 The authors do not wish additional data and methods used to conduct the analyses to be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results and conducting additional analyses.

In brief, adults age ≥ 18 years, chronically anticoagulated patients with AF on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban were recruited into 3 cohorts. Patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min (< 25 mL/min for apixaban), based on the Cockcroft‐Gault formula, were excluded. Patients with cognitive impairment or psychiatric illness that could impair their ability to provide informed consent were also excluded. All included patients signed an informed consent form and patients were only allowed to be entered in the trial once. The study was managed by the McMaster Centre for Transfusion Research, and the institutional review board of each of the 23 participating clinical centers in Canada, the United States, and Europe approved PAUSE.

In the absence of a comparable interruption strategy, the 3 cohorts were managed according to a standardized interruption scheme based on estimated procedural bleeding risk and renal function for dabigatran. The procedure bleeding risk classification was similar to that which was used in the BRIDGE (Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or Surgery) trial, 6 and is concordant with the guidance by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. 1 A complete list of procedures considered to be high bleed risk is shown in Table 1. Procedures with high bleeding risk had a longer interruption and resumption interval (2 days) versus those who underwent a low bleeding risk procedure (1 day). DOAC interruption was longer for patients on dabigatran if the CrCl was 30 to 50 mL/min: 2 days in patients having a low bleeding risk procedure; and 4 days in patients having a high bleeding risk procedure (Figure 1). The use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin bridging perioperatively was not adopted in PAUSE, given potentially worse outcomes on post hoc analyses of large AF trials. 14 Low‐dose low‐molecular‐weight heparin prophylaxis was permitted postoperatively in patients at risk for venous thromboembolism until the DOAC was resumed.

### Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and treatment [^11588WDx]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is the third most common fatal cardiovascular condition in the United States. Clinical prediction rules such as the Wells' Criteria for DVT, Wells' Criteria for PE, and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria should be used to determine the pretest probability of DVT or PE. The D-dimer assay is used in low-risk patients to rule out DVT and in moderate-risk patients to rule out PE. Compression ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose DVT. PE typically is diagnosed with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or with ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy if the patient has contraindications to computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. Preferred outpatient therapy for VTE is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant rather than a vitamin K antagonist or low-molecular-weight heparin. Most patients with acute uncomplicated DVT can be treated as outpatients. The Simplified PE Severity Index can guide treatment decisions for patients with PE. Apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used for initial management without the need to bridge with parenteral therapy. Treatment is recommended for 3 to 6 months after initial VTE. Patients with chronic risk factors, a recurrent VTE after primary treatment, or a first unprovoked VTE should be considered for secondary prevention with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant or warfarin after a bleeding-risk assessment.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112vn2YQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

### Continued vs. interrupted direct oral anticoagulants at the time of device surgery, in patients with moderate to high risk of arterial thrombo-embolic events (BRUISE CONTROL-2) [^112tLxJF]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Guidelines recommend warfarin continuation rather than heparin bridging for pacemaker and defibrillator surgery, after the BRUISE CONTROL trial demonstrated an 80% reduction in device pocket haematoma with this approach. However, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now used to treat the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. We sought to understand the best strategy to manage the DOACs at the time of device surgery and specifically hypothesized that performing device surgery without DOAC interruption would result in a reduced haematoma rate.

Methods and Results

We randomly assigned patients with atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2, to continued vs. interrupted DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban). The primary outcome was blindly evaluated, clinically significant device pocket haematoma: resulting in re-operation, interruption of anticoagulation, or prolonging hospital stay. In the continued arm, the median time between pre- and post-operative DOAC doses was 12h; in the interrupted arm the median time was 72h. Clinically significant haematoma occurred in of 7 of 328 (2.1%; 95% CI 0.9–4.3) patients in the continued DOAC arm and 7 of 334 (2.1%; 95% CI 0.9–4.3) patients in the interrupted DOAC arm (P = 0.97). Complications were uncommon, and included one stroke and one symptomatic pericardial effusion in each arm.

Conclusions

These results suggest that, dependent on the clinical scenario, either management strategy (continued DOAC or interrupted DOAC) might be reasonable, at least for patients similar to those enrolled in our trial.

With the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, no strong evidence to support bridging exists currently. These anticoagulants have a shorter half-life and faster onset making the benefits of bridging less obvious. A study from the European Dresden registry from 2014 demonstrated that in patients taking nonvitamin K antagonists, heparin bridging did not reduce cardiovascular events, and major bleeding again was more frequent with bridging than without. Additionally, the HASBLED scoring system used to gauge the risk of hemorrhage can also be used to estimate risk of hemorrhage heparin bridging during warfarin cessation. Recommendations are unclear regarding the efficacy and need for bridging with DOACs.

Re-initiation of oral anticoagulation: The decision to restart anticoagulation after a procedure is again determined by weighing the risks for thromboembolism against that of hemorrhage. If hemostasis is assured after the procedure, vitamin K antagonists can be restarted 6–24 hours after surgery as therapeutic levels will take several days to reach. If periprocedural bridging is being used, patients at low risk of bleeding can resume bridging at 24 hours and those at higher bleed risk at 48–72 hours for all high-risk patients. Non-vitamin K antagonists could potentially be resumed after 6–24 hours in patients with low bleeding risk if hemostasis is assured, bearing in mind that these agents have a much faster time of onset. Those with higher bleeding risk should wait 48–72 hours prior to restarting and could be considered for bridging with heparin if the risk of thromboembolism is also high.

A causal relationship between bridging anticoagulation and studied outcomes cannot be confirmed as these findings are based on an observational study. Lastly, although as many confounding factors as possible were taken into account, such as comorbidities and concomitant medications, the confounding effect of unmeasured and/or unknown factors cannot be ruled out. However, our results should not be affected by diagnostic biases since databases to define bridging status and end points are completely independent.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### A call to reduce the use of bridging anticoagulation [^115eDW5R]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the recent publication of several important studies, there has been a major change in how we think about perioperative management of anticoagulation. Because of these changes, existing consensus guidelines are suddenly out of date and can no longer be used as is, particularly the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Guidelines, version 9. We estimate that well over 90% of patients receiving warfarin therapy should not receive bridging anticoagulation during periprocedural interruptions of therapy, except under unusual circumstances and with appropriate justification. Accumulating evidence also suggests that bridging is not indicated among patients receiving direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy. The large number of patients potentially affected represents an important safety concern and requires an immediate change in practice.

Communication and standardization of perioperative management — It is important to have alignment of the proposed management plan among the health-care team and that it is communicated to and agreed upon by the surgeon/proceduralist, so as to avoid miscommunication that may lead to adverse outcomes or a delay of the surgery/procedure, which can be facilitated with perioperative antithrombotic clinics that can be administered in-person or virtually and with the support of online tools. At an institutional level, harmonization of perioperative anticoagulant management care paths that encompass multiple specialties will facilitate standardization of patient management. Standardized management is important because unstructured usual care varies widely, and if anticoagulants are not managed with evidence-based protocols or guidelines in the perioperative clinical setting, patients may be exposed to as much as a 0.5% to 1.0% excess risk for disabling stroke (based on a benchmark risk ≤ 0.5%) and a 3% to 6% excess risk for serious bleeding (based on a benchmark risk ≤ 1.5%), if anticoagulant interruption is too short or too long or if excessive heparin bridging is used.

### The current status of bridging anticoagulation [^1138dfau]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

For patients prescribed chronic vitamin K antagonist therapy requiring a surgical or invasive procedure, the question of whether or not to bridge and how to bridge is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Bridging anticoagulation has evolved over the years and the evidence base for current practice is deficient in many areas. Clinical trials currently being completed with conventional anticoagulants should help strengthen the evidence base for future practice. The availability of novel oral anticoagulants is a welcome addition, though their optimal management peri-procedure is yet to be determined. Prospective multi-centre controlled studies that can provide the evidence base for novel oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management are required.

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: a review [^116nqRDb]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

Observations

For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (eg, minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (eg, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (eg, major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent (eg, prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet-α) prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Standardized low-molecular-weight heparin bridging regimen in outpatients on oral anticoagulants undergoing invasive procedure or surgery: an inception cohort management study [^114nZDMn]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin is usually recommended in patients who must stop oral anticoagulants before surgical or invasive procedures. To date, there is no universally accepted bridging regimen tailored to the patient's thromboembolic risk. This prospective inception cohort management study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of an individualized bridging protocol applied to outpatients.

Methods and Results

Oral anticoagulants were stopped 5 days before the procedure. Low-molecular-weight heparin was started 3 to 4 days before surgery and continued for 6 days after surgery at 70 anti-factor Xa U/kg twice daily in high-thromboembolic-risk patients and prophylactic once-daily doses in moderate- to low-risk patients. Oral anticoagulation was resumed the day after the procedure with a boost dose of 50% for 2 days and maintenance doses afterward. The patients were followed up for 30 days. Of the 1262 patients included in the study (only 15% had mechanical valves), 295 (23.4%) were high-thromboembolic-risk patients and 967 (76.6%) were moderate- to low-risk patients. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were 5 thromboembolic events (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.9), all in high-thromboembolic-risk patients. There were 15 major (1.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.0) and 53 minor (4.2%; 95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 5.5) bleeding episodes. Major bleeding was associated with twice-daily low-molecular-weight heparin administration (high-risk patients) but not with the bleeding risk of the procedure.

Conclusions

This management bridging protocol, tailored to patients' thromboembolic risk, appears to be feasible, effective, and safe for many patients, but safety in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves has not been conclusively established.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116aSsRZ]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

Anticoagulants

Large numbers of patients take either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents for the prevention of thrombosis. Increasing numbers now take a direct thrombin or Xa inhibitor rather than warfarin. The management of these drugs in the peri‐operative setting is a common problem, necessitating the balance of bleeding risk with the risk of thrombosis. There are two scoring systems that can be used to quantify the risk of thrombosis (CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc) and bleeding (HAS‐BLED) in patients who are anticoagulated for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Direct oral anticoagulants

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have more predictable pharmacodynamics, a faster onset of action and a shorter half‐life than warfarin and require less frequent monitoring of plasma levels. There are currently four drugs available – three anti‐Xa drugs (apixaban, edoxaban and rivoroxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran). These drugs are used: in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation; after stroke and transient ischaemic attacks; and prophylaxis/management of venous thromboembolism. Direct oral anticoagulants are now more commonly used than warfarin in these settings. They are not licensed for use in patients with prosthetic (metal) heart valves based on RCT data demonstrating increased rates of thromboembolic complications when compared with warfarin therapy.

The approach to the peri‐operative management of patients taking DOACs is based on an approximate calculation of the half‐life of the drug, considering renal function. This is combined with the bleeding risk of the proposed procedure and the patient's individual risk factors for thrombosis and bleeding (Fig. 1). If an anticoagulant effect cannot be excluded, neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided. Bridging anticoagulation (usually with low molecular weight heparin) is not required except in patients deemed to be at high risk on peri‐operative thromboembolism (e.g. with recent (< 3 months and especially 1 month) history of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis; severe thrombophilia (deficiency or protein C, protein S or antithrombin); antiphospholipid antibodies; or active cancer associated with a high thromboembolism risk).

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

VTE maintenance and bridging guidance emphasizes VTE-specific dosing and selective use of parenteral bridging. The VTE maintenance dose of rivaroxaban should be 20 mg daily, not 15 mg daily, as studied in the PIONEER-AF-PCI trial. An unusual scenario described is a patient on a treatment dose of a DOAC for VTE prior to PCI who develops significant renal dysfunction, warranting transition to a VKA. In patients requiring a VKA, bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin is associated with increased bleeding risk and should therefore be reserved for patients judged to be at a very high risk of recurrent VTE, such as those within 3 months of a VTE.

Bridging anticoagulation during VKA interruption — mechanical prosthetic heart valve (PICO 5): In patients receiving VKA therapy for a mechanical heart valve who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), supported by PERIOP-2 showing no significant difference between no bridging and bridging for major thromboembolism (0% vs 0.67%; p = 0.67) and major bleeding (1.96% vs 0.67%; p = 0.62), an observational study associating perioperative bridging with increased major bleeding (3.6% vs 1.2%; p = 0.0007), and a meta-analysis totaling 12,278 patients (24% had a mechanical heart valve) finding no significant difference in ATE (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.42–1.54) but increased major bleeding with bridging (OR = 3.60; 95% CI: 1.52–8.50); in non-randomized studies where all patients with a mechanical heart valve received perioperative therapeutic-dose heparin bridging, pooled incidences of ATE and major bleeding were 0.9% (95% CI: 0.2–1.5) and 2.8% (0.8–4.8), respectively, while for selected high-risk patients — such as those with an older-generation mechanical heart valve, a mechanical mitral valve with one or more risk factors for stroke, a recent (< 3 months) thromboembolic event, or other high-risk features (eg, prior perioperative stroke) — pre- and post-operative heparin bridging is suggested.

Emergency department management of acute lower-extremity DVT — evidence base and treatment context: Searches included January 1, 2006, to April 22, 2016 and May 2, 2016, identifying two hundred fifty-nine articles; forty-five were reviewed, with three Class II and 8 Class III articles included. Traditional therapy is subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) bridging and has been shown to be safe and effective as an outpatient treatment regimen; if safe and effective, NOACs with subsequent direct ED discharge could markedly simplify initiation and monitoring, and studies have shown reduced health care costs when a NOAC is used over LMWH/VKA in properly chosen patients. For both LMWHs and NOACs, physicians must pay attention to body mass index and renal function before initiating anticoagulation. For this critical question, 3 Class II and 8 Class III studies compared NOACs with standard therapy; all 3 Class II and 3 Class III studies focused on isolated DVT, whereas 5 Class III studies included DVT and pulmonary embolism cohorts. Of the 11 studies, only 1 directly addressed patients who began a NOAC and were directly discharged from the ED, using a multicenter Class III protocol in which low-risk patients per modified Hestia criteria were treated with oral rivaroxaban and discharged with arranged follow-up.

Device surgery evidence — bridging and DOAC management: Periprocedural unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin bridging has been associated with an increased risk of pocket hematoma after pacemaker or ICD procedures; BRUISE-CONTROL randomized elective device surgery patients with atrial fibrillation or a mechanical valve (estimated annual stroke risk ≥ 5%) to continued warfarin versus interruption with bridging; two RCTs and several observational studies have shown little or no difference in pocket hematoma and thromboembolic events with DOACs in device surgery; and lead extraction procedures are generally considered high bleeding risk and should be treated as such with warfarin interrupted, with occasional exceptions.
