## Question

What interventions can effectively reduce the incidence of LGA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what interventions can effectively reduce the incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) births. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how LGA is defined and why it matters clinically. Then, I should identify modifiable maternal risk factors that plausibly drive LGA. Next, I will appraise interventions by evidence tier and mechanism, and I should correct any misclassification I spot. After that, I will stratify by population, consider timing and safety, and finally synthesize pragmatic recommendations and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the construct and its clinical relevance. LGA is typically birthweight above the 90th percentile for gestational age and sex, and it is associated with higher risks of shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, NICU admission, and downstream adiposity and cardiometabolic risk, which underscores the clinical importance of prevention, not just detection [^114gtTQe].

> Now, I need to verify the dominant modifiable drivers. Maternal hyperglycemia across the spectrum, including impaired fasting glucose and milder dysglycemia below formal GDM thresholds, tracks with increasing LGA risk in a graded fashion, highlighting glycemia as a primary lever [^115tcV9s] [^111L6Eyr]. Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) and pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity also increase LGA and macrosomia risk, making weight trajectory another key mediator and target for intervention [^114ifXJ4] [^1114JRA6].

> Hold on, I should verify how the interventions were originally tiered by evidence because I notice a potential mislabel. The initial outline called "Tier 1: High-Credibility Randomized Trials", but it included an active glycemic management study in impaired fasting glucose that is actually a retrospective cohort, not an RCT; I should correct that classification while preserving its importance because the effect size is clinically meaningful despite nonrandomized design [^112WXndL]. By contrast, the individualized exercise program to limit GWG and reduce LGA is a randomized clinical trial and belongs in the highest evidence tier for LGA prevention via GWG modulation [^113afo5P].

> I will now examine glycemic control interventions for women with impaired fasting glucose. In a large integrated health system cohort, participation in a structured home glucose monitoring and centralized management program with pharmacotherapy as needed was associated with lower LGA rates versus non-participation, suggesting that targeting fasting hyperglycemia can curb fetal overgrowth, though residual confounding cannot be excluded given the nonrandomized design [^112WXndL].

> Next, I should review the randomized evidence for exercise. Individualized exercise guidance beginning in mid-pregnancy significantly reduced LGA and macrosomia without increasing preterm birth, and mediation analysis confirmed that the benefit was channeled through reductions in GWG, reinforcing GWG as a modifiable mediator rather than exercise exerting a direct fetal effect per se [^113afo5P] [^115UdFiT].

> Let me consider diet quality, but I should avoid overinterpreting. In the ROLO RCT of a low glycemic index diet in women at risk for macrosomia, there was no direct reduction in LGA, but GWG and maternal glucose intolerance were significantly lower, supporting an indirect pathway whereby dietary pattern improves the maternal metabolic milieu even if a pooled LGA effect was not demonstrated in that single trial [^111LdZdz] [^1176mrhk].

> Wait, I should also check combined lifestyle programs. The LIFE-Moms prospective meta-analysis across diverse RCTs in women with overweight/obesity reduced excess GWG by about 1.6 kg but did not significantly change LGA overall, which cautions me that reducing GWG alone may not consistently translate to LGA reduction at the population level, perhaps due to intervention intensity, timing, or adherence heterogeneity [^114ifXJ4]. Still, the DALI trial's PA+HE arm reduced GWG and neonatal adiposity, suggesting favorable alterations in fetal composition even when LGA incidence is not directly reported, which is biologically aligned with lowering fetal fat accretion risk [^117AybA4].

> Let me synthesize mechanisms so I do not conflate pathways. The primary causal axis is maternal glycemia driving fetal hyperinsulinemia and overgrowth, which explains why directly targeting fasting glucose in IFG reduces LGA and why the risk of LGA rises even within nondiabetic glycemia ranges, while the second axis is maternal energy balance and GWG, where structured exercise and diet quality lower GWG and thereby attenuate fetal growth trajectory, with randomized mediation demonstrated for exercise and consistent metabolic signals for low-GI diets [^112WXndL] [^115tcV9s] [^113afo5P] [^111LdZdz].

> I should now tailor by population because effect sizes and feasibility differ. For women with IFG or at the cusp of GDM, active glycemic management with home monitoring and pharmacotherapy when indicated appears to reduce LGA and is consistent with broader guidance that treating milder hyperglycemia improves growth-related outcomes, although optimal diagnostic thresholds are still being refined in ongoing trials [^112WXndL] [^113fzY4S]. For women with overweight/obesity, structured, individualized exercise with behavioral support plus dietary counseling is appropriate to limit GWG and improve neonatal adiposity, even if LGA reduction is not guaranteed in all settings, and higher-intensity or supervised approaches seem more effective than generic advice alone [^113afo5P] [^114ifXJ4] [^117AybA4]. For women with a prior macrosomic infant, a low-GI diet started early remains reasonable to limit GWG and dysglycemia, acknowledging it did not reduce LGA in ROLO but targets plausible mediators with a favorable safety profile [^111LdZdz].

> But wait, timing might be pivotal, so I should verify early initiation effects. Interventions that start earlier in pregnancy, ideally before 20 weeks, may have more consistent impacts on metabolic outcomes and growth trajectories, and preconception optimization of weight and metabolic health is emphasized by FIGO and preconception care guidance as a potentially more effective window, even if direct LGA RCT data are limited [^116aK9Ve] [^114LVbMa] [^1148u5jJ].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed explicitly. Individualized exercise programs did not increase preterm birth and are safe across trimesters absent contraindications, low-GI dietary patterns are nutritionally adequate without undue caloric restriction, and active glycemic management should be supervised to balance maternal hypoglycemia risk while achieving fasting glucose targets, which the cohort suggests is feasible with high uptake of pharmacotherapy when needed [^113afo5P] [^115UdFiT] [^111LdZdz] [^112WXndL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening as prevention. Third-trimester ultrasound can detect suspected LGA with reasonable discrimination and inform delivery planning, but it does not reduce the incidence of LGA; thus, it belongs to detection and risk management rather than primary prevention strategies [^115qeK7q] [^113UXLxH].

> Let me translate this into pragmatic recommendations while keeping effect sizes realistic. For pregnant individuals with impaired fasting glucose or high risk for hyperglycemia, implement structured home glucose monitoring with protocolized pharmacotherapy to achieve fasting targets under clinical supervision, anticipating a modest absolute reduction in LGA alongside broader perinatal benefits if glycemia improves, and counsel on individualized exercise concurrently to reduce GWG where appropriate [^112WXndL] [^113afo5P]. For all pregnant individuals, particularly those with overweight/obesity, provide supervised, tailored exercise programs from early to mid-pregnancy and pair with dietary counseling emphasizing lower-GI choices to limit GWG by approximately 1–2 kg, recognizing that while neonatal adiposity often improves, LGA effects may vary at population scale depending on adherence and intensity [^114ifXJ4] [^117AybA4] [^111LdZdz]. In women with a history of macrosomia, start low-GI guidance early and monitor GWG and glucose tolerance proactively, using glycemic management pathways if thresholds are crossed [^111LdZdz] [^113fzY4S].

> I should double-check key caveats and uncertainties so we set expectations appropriately. Meta-analyses show consistent GWG reductions across interventions but mixed or null pooled effects on LGA, likely reflecting heterogeneity in populations, intervention fidelity, and timing, and differences in effect sizes across settings caution against overgeneralization from single-country trials, which underscores the need for adequate intensity and early initiation in routine practice [^114ifXJ4] [^114jyQbx] [^111PQUck].

> Next, I should review the preconception window because it may offer larger gains. Counseling and support to optimize weight, physical activity, and metabolic health prior to conception are recommended by professional bodies and may shift the trajectory more effectively than starting in mid-pregnancy, though direct LGA outcome evidence remains sparse and should be a priority for future trials [^1148u5jJ] [^114LVbMa] [^113KrFEL].

> Let me summarize the main evidence gaps so we can refine practice and research. We need mechanism-specific randomized trials to disentangle the relative contributions of fasting glycemia versus GWG and diet composition to LGA; higher-intensity, earlier interventions with adherence support; and follow-up linking neonatal adiposity changes to longer-term child metabolic outcomes, as current signals on adiposity are encouraging but incomplete for LGA endpoints [^117AybA4] [^116aK9Ve] [^114ifXJ4].

> Final synthesis, and I should make sure it aligns with the data before concluding. The most reliable strategy to reduce LGA incidence is a targeted, risk-stratified approach instituted early: identify women with impaired fasting glucose and implement structured glycemic management; deploy individualized, supervised exercise and diet counseling to curb GWG, especially in those with overweight/obesity; and consider low-GI dietary patterns early for those with prior macrosomia, while recognizing that ultrasound detection aids planning but does not prevent LGA, and that preconception optimization is a critical, underutilized lever awaiting stronger LGA-specific trial confirmation [^112WXndL] [^113afo5P] [^111LdZdz] [^114ifXJ4] [^115qeK7q] [^1148u5jJ] [^114LVbMa].

The most effective interventions to reduce LGA are **tight glycemic control in GDM** [^113fzY4S] and **limiting gestational weight gain** through diet and physical activity [^1114JRA6]. Early **GDM screening and management** [^112WXndL], individualized exercise [^113afo5P], and third-trimester ultrasound for suspected LGA [^113UXLxH] support timely intervention. Preconception **weight optimization** [^114LVbMa] and avoiding excessive gestational weight gain [^1114JRA6] are key, while low-glycemic diets alone do not reduce LGA [^111LdZdz] but help control weight and glucose.

---

## Glycemic control and gestational diabetes management

GDM **screening and management**, including early screening and active glycemic management [^112WXndL], reduce LGA incidence, and structured programs with home glucose monitoring and timely pharmacotherapy lower LGA risk. Tight **glycemic control** to maintain euglycemia in GDM significantly reduces LGA risk [^115tcV9s].

---

## Maternal weight management and lifestyle interventions

- **Preconception weight optimization**: Achieving a healthy BMI before pregnancy reduces LGA risk [^1148u5jJ].

- **Gestational weight gain (GWG)**: Adhering to IOM GWG guidelines lowers LGA risk; excessive GWG increases LGA odds [^1114JRA6].

- **Dietary interventions**: Low-glycemic diets reduce GWG and glucose intolerance but do not independently reduce LGA [^111LdZdz].

- **Physical activity**: Individualized exercise reduces GWG and LGA incidence, with GWG mediating the effect [^113afo5P].

---

## Antenatal surveillance and clinical management

Ultrasound **monitoring** with third-trimester scanning [^113UXLxH] detects suspected LGA, enabling timely intervention [^115qeK7q]. Labor **induction** at 39–40 weeks for suspected macrosomia reduces shoulder dystocia and birth trauma without increasing cesarean rates [^11287112].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

In GDM, **metformin** reduces maternal weight gain and may lower LGA risk, though evidence is mixed. Insulin **therapy** remains the standard for GDM when diet and exercise are insufficient and effectively reduces LGA.

---

## Summary of effective interventions

| **Intervention** | **Effectiveness in reducing LGA** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Glycemic control in GDM | High | High |
| Preconception weight optimization | Moderate | Moderate |
| Adherence to GWG guidelines | Moderate | Moderate |
| Individualized exercise | Moderate | Moderate |
| Low-glycemic diet | Low (indirect via GWG) | Moderate |
| Third-trimester ultrasound | Moderate (enables intervention) | Moderate |
| Labor induction at 39–40 weeks | Moderate | Moderate |
| Metformin (GDM) | Moderate | Moderate |
| Insulin therapy (GDM) | High | High |

---

## Conclusion

The most effective strategies to reduce LGA are **glycemic control in GDM** and **limiting GWG** through diet and exercise. Early GDM screening, individualized exercise, and ultrasound surveillance enable timely intervention, and preconception weight optimization with adherence to GWG guidelines further reduce risk [^113fzY4S] [^1114JRA6].

### Accuracy of antenatal ultrasound in predicting large-for-gestational-age babies: Population-based cohort study [^113UXLxH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Pregnancies with large-for-gestational-age fetuses are at increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. There is uncertainty about how to manage birth in such pregnancies. Guidelines recommend a discussion with women of the pros and cons of options, including expectant management, induction of labor, and cesarean delivery. For women to make an informed decision about birth, antenatal detection of large for gestational age is essential.

- **Objective**: To investigate the ability of antenatal ultrasound scans to predict large for gestational age at birth.

- **Study design**: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from a routinely collected database from the West Midlands, United Kingdom. We included pregnancies that had an antenatal ultrasound-estimated fetal weight between 35+0 and 38+0 weeks gestation for any indication and a subgroup where the reason for the scan was that the fetus was suspected to be big. Large for gestational age was defined as > 90th customized GROW percentile for estimated fetal weight as well as neonatal weight. In addition, we tested the performance of an uncustomized standard, with Hadlock fetal weight > 90th percentile and neonatal weight > 4 kg. We calculated diagnostic characteristics for the whole population and groups with different maternal body mass indexes.

- **Results**: The study cohort consisted of 26,527 pregnancies, which, on average, had a scan at 36+4 weeks gestation and delivered 20 days later at a median of 39+3 weeks (interquartile range 15). In total, 2241 (8.4%) of neonates were large for gestational…

### Prevention of noncommunicable diseases by interventions in the preconception period: A FIGO position paper for action by healthcare practitioners [^114LVbMa]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Low credibility.

With the increase in obesity prevalence among women of reproductive age globally, the risks of type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and other conditions are rising, with detrimental effects on maternal and newborn health. The period before pregnancy is increasingly recognized as crucial for addressing weight management and reducing malnutrition (both under- and overnutrition) in both parents, to reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the mother as well as the passage of risk to her offspring.

Healthcare practitioners, including obstetricians, gynecologists, midwives, and general practitioners, have an important role to play in supporting women in planning a pregnancy and achieving healthy nutrition and weight before pregnancy. In this position paper, the FIGO Pregnancy Obesity and Nutrition Initiative provides an overview of the evidence for preconception clinical guidelines to reduce the risk of NCDs in mothers and their offspring. It encourages healthcare practitioners to initiate a dialogue on women's health, nutrition, and weight management before conception.

While acknowledging the fundamental importance of the wider social and environmental determinants of health, this paper focuses on a simple set of recommendations for clinical practice that can be used even in short consultations. The recommendations can be contextualized based on local cultural and dietary practices as part of a system-wide public health approach to influence the wider determinants as well as individual factors influencing preconception health.

### Impaired fasting glucose in pregnancy: Improved perinatal outcomes with active glycemic management [^112WXndL]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to assess the association between active glycemic management and large for gestational age (LGA) neonates and cesarean delivery (CD) among pregnant women with impaired fasting glucose (IFG).

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data of women with IFG who delivered at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2012 to 2017. IFG was defined as isolated fasting glucose ≥ 95 mg/dL. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or in whom GDM could not be ruled out were excluded. Baseline and treatment characteristics, and pregnancy outcomes were compared among women with IFG who participated in telephonic home glucose monitoring and glycemic management through a centralized standardized program (participants) with those who did not participate (nonparticipants). The relative risks (RRs) of perinatal complications associated with participation versus nonparticipation were estimated with Poisson's regression models.

- **Results**: We identified 1,584 women meeting inclusion criteria, of whom 1,151 (72.7%) were participants and 433 (27.3%) were nonparticipants. There were no differences between groups in baseline characteristics or comorbidities, except for higher mean levels of fasting glucose (FG) at the time of IFG diagnosis in participants than in nonparticipants (98.9 vs. 98.0 mg/dL, p = 0.01). Participants received hypoglycemic medications more frequently than nonparticipants (68.2 vs. 0.9%, p < 0.01). The rate of LGA was significantly lower in participants compared with nonparticipants (19.1 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.01).

### Mediating effect of gestational weight gain on the preventive effect of exercise during pregnancy on macrosomia: a randomized clinical trial [^113afo5P]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

We sought to investigate the impact of individualized exercise guidance during pregnancy on the incidence of macrosomia and the mediating effect of gestational weight gain (GWG). A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted at a hospital in Xingtai District, Hebei Province, involving mid-pregnancy, singleton pregnant women older than 20 years of age, without contraindications to exercise.

A randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 2021 to September 2022 to compare the effects of standard prenatal care with individualized exercise guidance on the incidence of macrosomia. The main outcome measure was the incidence of macrosomia.

In total, 312 singleton women were randomized into an intervention group (N = 162) or a control group (N = 150). Participants who received individualized exercise guidance had a significantly lower incidence of macrosomia (3.73% vs. 13.61%, P = 0.002) and infants large for gestational age (9.94% vs. 19.73%, P = 0.015). However, no differences were observed in the rate of preterm birth (1.86% vs. 3.40%, P = 0.397) or the average gestational age at birth (39.14 ± 1.51 vs. 38.69 ± 1.85, P = 0.258). Mediation analysis revealed that GWG mediated the effect of exercise on reducing the incidence of macrosomia.

Individualized exercise guidance may be a preventive tool for macrosomia, and GWG mediates the effect of exercise on reducing the incidence of macrosomia. However, evidence does not show that exercise increases the rate of preterm birth or affects the average gestational age at birth.

### Low glycaemic index diet in pregnancy to prevent macrosomia (ROLO study): randomised control trial [^111LdZdz]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

This study aimed to determine if a low glycaemic index diet in pregnancy could reduce the incidence of macrosomia in an at-risk group. The research was conducted as a randomized controlled trial at a maternity hospital in Dublin, Ireland. The participants included 800 women without diabetes, all in their second pregnancy between January 2007 and January 2011, having previously delivered an infant weighing more than 4 kg.

In this trial, women were randomized to either receive no dietary intervention or to start on a low glycaemic index diet from early pregnancy.

- **Main outcomes**: The primary outcome measure was the difference in birth weight, and the secondary outcome measure was the difference in gestational weight gain.

- **Results**: No significant difference was observed between the two groups in absolute birth weight, birth weight centile, or ponderal index. However, significantly less gestational weight gain occurred in the intervention group (12.2 kg vs. 13.7 kg; mean difference −1.3, 95% confidence interval −2.4 to −0.2; P = 0.01). The rate of glucose intolerance was also lower in the intervention arm: 21% (67/320) compared with 28% (100/352) of controls had a fasting glucose of 5.1 mmol/L or greater or a 1-hour glucose challenge test result greater than 7.8 mmol/L (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: A low glycaemic index diet in pregnancy did not reduce the incidence of large for gestational age infants in a group at risk of fetal macrosomia. However, it had a significant positive effect on gestational weight gain and maternal glucose intolerance.

The trial is registered under Controlled Trials ISRCTN54392969.

### Effect of a physical activity and healthy eating lifestyle intervention in pregnancy on fetal growth trajectories: The DALI randomised controlled trial [^117AybA4]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). High credibility.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age is increasing. Maternal obesity is related to adverse health outcomes for mothers and offspring, such as maternal glucose intolerance and related fetal overgrowth, and consequently, higher birthweight and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) offspring.

Interventions to reduce the adverse perinatal effects of overweight and obesity in pregnant women have been developed and tested, including the vitamin D And Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention (DALI) randomised controlled trial (RCT). It specifically targeted pregnant women with overweight and obesity, aiming primarily to reduce gestational weight gain (GWG) and fasting glucose and improve insulin sensitivity in late pregnancy through lifestyle modifications. The DALI lifestyle trial randomized women into four groups receiving counseling either on physical activity (PA), healthy eating (HE), both (PA + HE), or usual care (UC).

Previous analyses showed that, while all three intervention groups improved lifestyle behavior, no effects on fasting glucose or insulin sensitivity were achieved. The PA + HE group, however, showed a reduction in gestational weight gain and reduced adiposity in neonates, with the latter effect mediated by reducing maternal sedentary time.

Differences in neonatal weight and body composition at birth result from differences in fetal growth. The fetus gains most weight during the second half of gestation, with body fat accumulation starting at around this time.

### Potential prevention of small for gestational age in Australia: a population-based linkage study [^117D9fAM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

SGA is associated with a range of demographic, pregnancy history, and behavioural factors, as well as maternal medical conditions. Opportunities exist for modest reduction of the prevalence of SGA through reduced smoking during pregnancy, possibly earlier commencement of antenatal care, and improved management of high-risk pregnancies.

### Risk factors for large-for-gestational age infants in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes [^113RMBP9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Due to improved medical care, outcomes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) have improved substantially over the past decades. Nevertheless, the prevalence of macrosomia continues to increase. Macrosomia can cause major problems during labor and is associated with increased neonatal morbidity, as well as a long-term increased risk of developing overweight and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Neonatal overweight in T1DM is mainly caused by placental transfer of maternal glucose. However, since glycemic control has improved over time, other contributors need to be identified.

In healthy pregnant women, obesity and excessive weight gain in pregnancy predispose them to macrosomia. Most studies on this topic in women with diabetes include T2DM patients or women with gestational diabetes (GDM) and confirm the strong association between obesity, excessive weight gain in pregnancy, and fetal overgrowth. In women with T1DM, the evidence is far more scarce. A large Swedish cohort study in T1DM patients showed a positive relation between high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and the risk of fetal overgrowth. Recently, an observational study identified excessive weight gain during pregnancy as an independent risk factor for fetal overgrowth in T1DM patients.

The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the risk factors for large-for-gestational age infants (LGA) in our T1DM population and to evaluate whether the rate of LGA decreased over time. Our hypothesis was that the increasing prevalence of maternal overweight and excessive gestational weight gain may independently contribute to this trend, apart from maternal glycemic control.

### Second and third trimester fetal ultrasound population screening for risks of preterm birth and small-size and large-size for gestational age at birth: A population-based prospective cohort study [^1137KEZk]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Preterm birth, small size for gestational age (SGA), and large size for gestational age (LGA) at birth explain up to 30% of neonatal deaths and are strong risk factors for both short-term and long-term morbidity. The majority of newborns who experience abnormal fetal growth are unidentified until birth. Newborns classified as SGA or LGA who have not been identified antenatally face significantly increased risks of morbidity and mortality compared to those identified during pregnancy. Abnormal fetal growth is a significant reason for inducing labor and is a common cause of induced preterm birth. However, studies have shown that spontaneous preterm birth is often preceded by impaired or accelerated fetal growth.

Pregnancy care protocols typically include dating ultrasounds and detailed structural ultrasounds at 20 weeks gestational age (GA) to assess congenital anomalies and fetal size. Third trimester ultrasound screening is generally reserved for selected populations. Technological advancements in obstetric ultrasounds may lead to future changes in ultrasound screening protocols, such as assessments of early-pregnancy size and congenital anomalies, along with third trimester growth evaluations. The performance of routine third trimester ultrasound screening, independent of other maternal and fetal characteristics, remains unclear. A review of eight controlled trials did not suggest consistent benefits of ultrasounds performed after 24 weeks GA on pregnancy outcomes. A prospective observational cohort study among 3,977 nulliparous women suggested that third trimester ultrasound, in addition to the second trimester screening, could be beneficial, but further research is necessary to clarify this potential advantage.

### Windows of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to prevent gestational diabetes mellitus [^114uHrvG]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked with several acute maternal health risks and the long-term development of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Intrauterine exposure to GDM similarly increases offspring risk of early-life health complications and later diseases. GDM recurrence is common, affecting 40 to 73% of women, and augments associated maternal, fetal, and child health risks.

Modifiable and independent risk factors for GDM include maternal excessive gestational weight gain and prepregnancy overweight and obesity. Lifestyle interventions that target diet, activity, and behavioral strategies can effectively modify body weight. Randomized clinical trials testing the effects of lifestyle interventions during pregnancy to reduce excessive gestational weight gain have generally shown mixed effects on reducing GDM incidence. Trials testing the effects of postpartum lifestyle interventions among women with a history of GDM have shown reduced incidence of diabetes and improved cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the long-term effects of interpregnancy or prepregnancy lifestyle interventions on subsequent GDM remain unknown.

Future adequately powered and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the effects of lifestyle interventions to prevent GDM and identify pathways to effectively reach reproductive-aged women across all levels of society, before, during, and after pregnancy.

### Third trimester ultrasound for the prediction of the large for gestational age fetus in low-risk population and evaluation of contingency strategies [^115qeK7q]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of third trimester fetal biometry and Doppler studies in predicting the birth of a large for gestational age (LGA) neonate (LGA ≥ 95th percentile), as well as to assess the value of integrated models that combine maternal characteristics, first trimester parameters, and third trimester fetal biometry, and the usefulness of contingency strategies.

- **Method**: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 2,308 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, examined at 11 to 14 weeks and at 30 to 34 weeks.

- **Results**: Ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.83) emerged as the best single predictor of LGA. Maternal weight, delta nuchal translucency, and EFW were independent predictors for the integrated model; however, the model was not statistically better (AUC = 0.84) than using EFW alone. The detection rates for LGA were 72.5% using EFW and 73.7% for the third trimester integrated model, at a 25% screen positive rate. A contingency strategy of rescanning 50% of the population in the third trimester, based on risk estimation from a first trimester prediction model, resulted in a detection rate of 64.7% for LGA at the same 25% screen positive rate (AUC = 0.78).

- **Conclusions**: Third trimester ultrasound is an effective screening modality for identifying fetal macrosomia. A contingency strategy utilizing first trimester parameters can reduce the need for unnecessary examinations.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^1146X2yW]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Recommendations for follow-up of previously GH-treated adults born SGA highlight the need for continuous monitoring even after cessation of GH treatment, as there is currently limited literature on the long-term outcomes. It is advised that these individuals adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle, emphasizing regular exercise to avoid weight gain and maintain or improve lean body mass. Medical consultation is recommended in cases of chronic fatigue, significant weight gain, or hypertension, especially if there is a family history of diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease.

Establishing national and international registries for reporting long-term health issues of adults born SGA, whether treated with GH or not, is crucial to understand their future health status. It is also essential to educate neonatologists, general practitioners, pediatricians, and parents of infants born SGA about the importance of healthy catch-up growth — a balanced gain in weight and length, particularly during the first months of life. Those who achieve spontaneous catch-up growth to normal stature might be at a higher risk for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life compared to those who remain short; similar lifestyle, exercise, and medical consultation advice should be provided to them.

### Mediating effect of gestational weight gain on the preventive effect of exercise during pregnancy on macrosomia: a randomized clinical trial [^115UdFiT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of individualized exercise guidance during pregnancy on the incidence of macrosomia and the mediating effect of gestational weight gain (GWG).

- **Design**: A prospective randomized clinical trial.
- **Setting**: A hospital in Xingtai District, Hebei Province.
- **Population**: Participants were older than 20 years of age, in mid-pregnancy, and singleton pregnant women without contraindications to exercise during pregnancy.
- **Methods**: A randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 2021 to September 2022 to compare the effects of standard prenatal care with individualized exercise guidance on the incidence of macrosomia.
- **Main outcome measure**: Incidence of macrosomia.

Results showed that 312 singleton women were randomized into an intervention group (N = 162) or a control group (N = 150). Participants who received individualized exercise guidance had a significantly lower incidence of macrosomia (3.73% vs. 13.61%, P = 0.002) and infants large for gestational age (9.94% vs. 19.73%, P = 0.015). However, no differences were observed in the rate of preterm birth (1.86% vs. 3.40%, P = 0.397) or the average gestational age at birth (39.14 ± 1.51 vs. 38.69 ± 1.85, P = 0.258). Mediation analysis revealed that GWG mediated the effect of exercise on reducing the incidence of macrosomia.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that individualized exercise guidance may be a preventive tool for macrosomia, and GWG mediates the effect of exercise on reducing the incidence of macrosomia. However, evidence does not show that exercise increases the rate of preterm birth or affects the average gestational age at birth.

### Effects of interventions in pregnancy on maternal weight and obstetric outcomes: Meta-analysis of randomised evidence [^114jyQbx]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy on maternal and fetal weight and to quantify the effects of these interventions on obstetric outcomes.

The study design consisted of a systematic review and meta-analysis, utilizing major databases from inception to January 2012 without language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were selected to evaluate any dietary or lifestyle interventions with potential to influence maternal weight during pregnancy and outcomes of pregnancy.

Data synthesis involved summarizing results as relative risks for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data. The study identified 44 relevant randomised controlled trials, involving 7278 women, evaluating three categories of interventions: diet, physical activity, and a mixed approach.

Overall, there was a 1.42 kg reduction (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.89 kg) in gestational weight gain with any intervention compared with control. With all interventions combined, there were no significant differences in birth weight (mean difference -50 g, -100 to 0 g) and the incidence of large for gestational age (relative risk 0.85, 0.66 to 1.09) or small for gestational age (1.00, 0.78 to 1.28) babies between the groups. However, physical activity by itself was associated with reduced birth weight (mean difference -60 g, -120 to -10 g). Interventions were associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (0.74, 0.60 to 0.92) and shoulder dystocia (0.39, 0.22 to 0.70), with no significant effect on other critically important outcomes.

### Screening for small-for-gestational age neonates at early third trimester in a high-risk population for preeclampsia [^1132q1nF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Growth-restricted fetuses are at increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity, but the risks can be reduced when the condition is prenatally detected. The traditional approach to identifying pregnancies at high risk of delivering low-weight neonates involves measuring symphysis–fundus height, which has a low detection rate of affected fetuses, not higher than 30%. A routine third-trimester ultrasound examination with measurement of fetal biometrics is superior in identifying pregnancies at high risk of delivering low-weight neonates, offering detection rates around 50%; however, its impact on improving perinatal outcomes is unclear. The last meta-analysis concluded that routine ultrasound in a low-risk or unselected population did not confer any benefit for the mother or the baby concerning perinatal mortality, preterm birth before 37 weeks, caesarean section rates, and induction of labor rates.

The terms small-for-gestational age (SGA) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) have often been used interchangeably. However, not all small neonates are growth-restricted, and not all growth-restricted neonates are small. Therefore, identifying high-risk neonates only by estimating fetal weight via ultrasound may overlook a significant proportion of cases with latent placental insufficiency. It seems reasonable to explore new strategies to improve the detection of these neonates, especially since SGA neonates are well-known to be associated with poorer perinatal outcomes.

Maternal epidemiological characteristics, such as a maternal history of chronic hypertension and an incomplete final sentence, suggest that further investigation is needed to improve the early detection of growth-restricted fetuses.

### Low glycaemic index diet in pregnancy to prevent macrosomia (ROLO study): Randomised control trial [^1176mrhk]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

To determine if a low glycaemic index diet in pregnancy could reduce the incidence of macrosomia in an at-risk group, a randomised controlled trial was conducted at a maternity hospital in Dublin, Ireland. The study included 800 women without diabetes, all in their second pregnancy between January 2007 and January 2011, who had previously delivered an infant weighing more than 4 kg.

Women were randomised to either receive no dietary intervention or to start on a low glycaemic index diet from early pregnancy. The primary outcome measure was the difference in birth weight, while the secondary outcome measure was the difference in gestational weight gain.

The results showed no significant difference between the two groups in absolute birth weight, birth weight centile, or ponderal index. However, women in the intervention arm experienced significantly less gestational weight gain (12.2 kg vs. 13.7 kg; mean difference -1.3, 95% confidence interval -2.4 to -0.2; P = 0.01). Additionally, the rate of glucose intolerance was lower in the intervention arm: 21% (67/320) compared with 28% (100/352) of controls had a fasting glucose of 5.1 mmol/L or greater or a 1-hour glucose challenge test result of greater than 7.8 mmol/L (P = 0.02).

In conclusion, a low glycaemic index diet in pregnancy did not reduce the incidence of large for gestational age infants in a group at risk of fetal macrosomia. It did, however, have a significant positive effect on gestational weight gain and maternal glucose intolerance.

### The association between temporal changes in the use of obstetrical intervention and small-for-gestational age live births [^115CdYEg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The fetuses-at-risk model, on the other hand, shows that rates of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) increase with advancing gestation. The utero-placental system's ability to support the fetus declines over the course of pregnancy, and this viewpoint is supported by numerous animal and human studies which show that blood flow per unit fetal weight declines toward later gestation. Early delivery, whether at late preterm, early term, or late term gestation, will result in lower rates of SGA. This does not necessarily imply improved neonatal health status; indeed, the DIGITAT trial, which showed a reduction in SGA (< 3rd percentile) from 30.6% in the expectant management group to 12.5% in the labor induction group, did not show a significant difference in neonatal mortality or morbidity rates.

The reasons for the observed increase in obstetrical intervention are poorly understood. A proportion of this increase can be explained by changing maternal characteristics, such as increased rates of delayed childbearing and obesity, which increase pregnancy complications such as hypertension and diabetes. Additionally, with technological advances in fetal surveillance and monitoring, clinicians are now more aware of subtle changes in fetal well-being. However, in general clinical practice, it is estimated that less than one-third of fetal growth restriction is identified antenatally. It is estimated that much of the increase in obstetrical intervention for term deliveries appears to have been for informal medical indications or non-medical reasons. Additionally, a lower threshold for intervention in recent times may relate to this trend.

### The costs and benefits of scaling up interventions to prevent poor birth outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^114FyQhk]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

This study estimated the costs, benefits, and potential effects of scaling up the delivery of interventions during pregnancy to prevent poor birth outcomes. These analyses found that the interventions of proven efficacy to prevent poor birth outcomes yielded high benefits at low cost, with benefit–cost ratios above 1. This study also produced a framework and tools that countries could use to guide country-specific program planning.

These estimates, along with existing data on antenatal attendance by pregnant women, suggest that the interventions with proven effectiveness addressed in this study could be scaled up in most LMICs, and efforts to confirm the effectiveness of these promising interventions in diverse settings should be prioritized.

LiST is a widely used model that estimates the impact of increasing population coverage of interventions on health outcomes, including age-specific and cause-specific mortality and risk factors for morbidity and mortality such as stunting, wasting, and birth outcomes. LiST incorporates the best-available information on intervention efficacy, risk factors, and intervention coverage at national and often subnational levels. LiST also estimates the direct and incremental costs of scaling up intervention coverage, including options for incorporating markers of service quality. Numerous comparisons between LiST estimates of changes in mortality based on changes in intervention coverage and measured changes in mortality indicate…

### Prepregnancy and gestational interventions to prevent childhood obesity [^113KrFEL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is a significant global health issue with complex and multifactorial origins, often beginning before conception and influenced by both maternal and paternal health. The increased prevalence of prepregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus in women of reproductive age contributes to a heightened risk of metabolic dysfunction in offspring. Clinical practices often implement lifestyle interventions after the first trimester and have limited success, implying that they miss a critical window for effective metabolic adjustments. This review examines the limitations of lifestyle interventions during pregnancy in improving perinatal outcomes and highlights the importance of initiating such interventions before conception to positively impact parental health and fetal development. A re-evaluation of strategies is needed to enhance the metabolic health of prospective parents as a preventive measure against childhood obesity.

### Effects of interventions in pregnancy on maternal weight and obstetric outcomes: Meta-analysis of randomised evidence [^115EwND9]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary and lifestyle interventions during pregnancy on maternal and fetal weight, as well as to quantify the effects of these interventions on obstetric outcomes.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
- **Data sources**: Major databases from inception to January 2012, without language restrictions.
- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any dietary or lifestyle interventions with the potential to influence maternal weight during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: Results were summarised as relative risks for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data.

- **Results**: We identified 44 relevant randomised controlled trials (7278 women) evaluating three categories of interventions: diet, physical activity, and a mixed approach.
	- Overall, there was a 1.42 kg reduction (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.89 kg) in gestational weight gain with any intervention compared with control.
	- With all interventions combined, there were no significant differences in birth weight (mean difference −50 g, −100 to 0 g) and the incidence of large for gestational age (relative risk 0.85, 0.66 to 1.09) or small for gestational age babies (1.00, 0.78 to 1.28) between the groups.
	- Physical activity alone was associated with reduced birth weight (mean difference −60 g, −120 to −10 g).
	- Interventions were associated with reduced risks of pre-eclampsia (0.74, 0.60 to 0.92) and shoulder dystocia (0.39, 0.22 to 0.70), with no significant effect on other critically important outcomes.

### Potential prevention of small for gestational age in Australia: a population-based linkage study [^113vnWwA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

There is little information on the risks for small for gestational age (SGA) at a population level. A recently published population-based study from the British Columbia Perinatal Database Registry investigated a limited set of maternal risk factors for SGA, including maternal age, height, weight, smoking during pregnancy, hypertension, and placental disorders, as potential targets for intervention. The study aimed to reduce socio-economic SGA inequality by calculating the population attributable fractions for each factor. Other published estimates of population attributable fractions are largely limited to smoking during pregnancy.

New South Wales (NSW) is the most populous state in Australia, with approximately 7 million people, representing 32% of the Australian population. In 2010, there were 96,486 births in NSW, accounting for 32% of births in Australia. The NSW Government's State Health Plan–A New Direction for NSW towards 2010 on Strengthening Primary Health and Continuing Care in the Community aims to counteract the impact of genetic, social, and environmental factors that predispose infants to ill health. The plan promotes early interventions to ensure the birth of healthy infants and assist them in reaching their full potential for healthy and productive lives. To inform the NSW Government on priority areas for prevention activities, it is important to identify and quantify risk factors influencing SGA infants at a population level, with a particular interest in potentially modifiable risk factors. The aims of this study were to identify population risk factors associated with SGA.

### The management of large and small for gestational age fetuses [^116JCrFY]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The major influence on birth weight is gestational age. At any given week of gestation, however, size varies enormously. There is no specific cut-off that separates abnormally large or small babies for gestational age from normal; instead, function alters as a continuum across the weight distribution. Small babies are prone to hypoxia, acidosis, and stillbirth. Large babies, on the other hand, are associated with prolonged labor and mechanical problems. The optimum size for fetal survival is 1 to 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, whereas cesarean section rates are lowest when the fetal weight is 0.5 to 1.5 standard deviations below the mean. Antenatal detection of both very small and very large babies is difficult and imprecise. Expectant management is therefore preferable unless there are very specific indications for emergency or operative delivery.

### Lifestyle interventions limit gestational weight gain in women with overweight or obesity: LIFE-Moms prospective meta-analysis [^114ifXJ4]. Obesity (2018). High credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of varied lifestyle intervention programs designed to ameliorate excess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women with overweight or obesity compared with standard care, including effects on pregnancy outcomes.

- **Methods**: Seven clinical centers conducted separate randomized clinical trials to test different lifestyle intervention strategies to modify GWG in diverse populations. Eligibility criteria, specific outcome measures, and assessment procedures were standardized across trials. The results of the separate trials were combined using an individual-participant data meta-analysis.

- **Results**: For the 1,150 women randomized, the percentage with excess GWG per week was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the standard care group (61.8% vs. 75.0%; odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.40 to 0.67]). Total GWG from enrollment to 36 weeks' gestation was also lower in the intervention group (8.1 ± 5.2 vs. 9.7 ± 5.4 kg; mean difference: -1.59 kg [95% CI: -2.18 to -0.99 kg]). The results from the individual trials were similar. The intervention and standard care groups did not differ in preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, or birth weight.

- **Conclusions**: Behavioral lifestyle interventions focusing primarily on diet and physical activity among women with overweight and obesity resulted in a significantly lower proportion of women with excess GWG. This modest beneficial effect was consistent across diverse intervention modalities in a large, racially and socioeconomically diverse US population of pregnant women.

### Fetal growth and adiposity of infants born large for gestational age in three harmonized randomized trials [^114gtTQe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

Fetal growth z-scores of large for gestational age versus not large for gestational age infants

Fetal BPD, HC, FL, AC, and EFW z-scores were significantly greater among infants born LGA, compared with those born not LGA, at all time points assessed; the difference increased over time. With the exception of fetal BPD z-score at 36 weeks' gestation among non-LGA infants [−0.04, SD 1.15 cm], all z-scores were positive at all time points. This indicates that, even among those infants not born LGA, fetuses were larger on average than the reference population, likely because of the comparatively disproportionate number of women in this cohort who were overweight or obese. We have previously shown that these women consistently have mean fetal biometry z-scores greater than 0.

Fetal adiposity measures of large for gestational age versus not large for gestational age infants

With the exception of AFM measures at 28 weeks' gestation (not LGA mean: 3.54 [SD: 1.00] mm vs. LGA mean 3.67 [SD 0.95] mm; estimated mean difference 0.08 [95% CI: −0.05, 0.21] mm; p = 0.229), all adiposity measures were statistically significantly greater among infants born LGA, compared with those born not LGA, at all time points, and these differences increased over time. The magnitude of estimated mean differences ranged from 0.12 mm (95% CI: 0.00, 0.24) for SSFM measurements at 28 weeks' gestation, up to 0.98 mm (95% CI: 0.68, 1.27) for MTLM measurements at 28 weeks' gestation.

### Effects of Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction on prevention of small-for-gestational age birth weights in newborns born to at-risk pregnant individuals: The IMPACT BCN randomized clinical trial [^11765yGk]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Being born small for gestational age (SGA) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality with no effective prevention or therapy. Maternal suboptimal nutrition and high stress levels have been associated with poor fetal growth and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether structured interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction in high-risk pregnancies can reduce the percentage of newborns who were born SGA and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted at a university hospital in Barcelona, Spain, including 1221 individuals with singleton pregnancies (19–23 weeks' gestation) at high risk for SGA. Enrollment took place from February 1, 2017, to October 10, 2019, with follow-up until delivery (final follow-up on March 1, 2020).

- **Interventions**: Participants in the Mediterranean diet group (n = 407) received 2 hours monthly of individual and group educational sessions and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Individuals in the stress reduction group (n = 407) underwent an 8-week stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 2.5-hour sessions and 1 full-day session. Individuals in the usual care group (n = 407) received pregnancy care per institutional protocols.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was the percentage of newborns who were SGA at delivery, defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile. The secondary endpoint was a composite adverse perinatal outcome.

### Preconception and periconception interventions to prevent low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115E1rRf]. BMJ Global Health (2022). Low credibility.

Low birth weight (LBW), including preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA), contributes a significant global health burden. We aimed to summarize evidence on the effect of preconception and periconception interventions on LBW, SGA, and PTB.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Index Medicus for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published by 28 November 2020, which assessed interventions delivered in preconception and periconception or preconception and pregnancy. Primary outcomes were LBW, SGA, and PTB. Studies were categorized by intervention type and delivery during preconception and periconception or during preconception and pregnancy. Estimates were pooled using fixed-effects or random-effects restricted maximum likelihood method meta-analyses. The quality of evidence for primary outcomes was assessed using the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

- **Results**: We included 58 studies. Twenty-eight studies examined nutrition interventions (primarily micronutrient or food supplementation). Thirty studies (including one reporting a nutrition intervention) provided health interventions (general preconception health, early adverse pregnancy outcome prevention, non-communicable disease, and infectious disease prevention and management). One study assessed a social intervention (reproductive planning). Studies varied in terms of specific interventions, including delivery across preconception or pregnancy, resulting in diverse approaches and findings.

### A complex intervention to improve pregnancy outcome in obese women; the UPBEAT randomised controlled trial [^114qL82U]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). High credibility.

Despite the widespread recognition that obesity in pregnant women is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and child, there is no intervention proven to reduce the risk of these complications. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess, in obese pregnant women, whether a complex behavioural intervention based on changing diet (to foods with a lower glycemic index) and physical activity will reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) and the delivery of a large for gestational age (LGA) infant. A secondary aim is to determine whether the intervention lowers the long-term risk of obesity in the offspring.

- **Methods/design**: Multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing a behavioural intervention designed to improve glycemic control with standard antenatal care in obese pregnant women. Inclusion criteria include women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² and a singleton pregnancy between 15+0 weeks and 18+6 weeks' gestation. Exclusion criteria include pre-defined, pre-existing diseases, and multiple pregnancy. Randomisation is conducted online by a computer-generated programme and is minimised by BMI category, maternal age, ethnicity, parity, and centre.

- **Intervention**: This is delivered by a health trainer over 8 sessions. Based on control theory, with elements of social cognitive theory, the intervention is designed to improve maternal glycemic control. Women randomised to the control arm receive standard antenatal care until delivery according to local guidelines. All women undergo a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test at 27+0–28+6 weeks' gestation.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^114TtJDc]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, especially in relation to postnatal infant surveillance (laboratory monitoring), the ICG-SGA 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an annual assessment of serum concentrations of thyroid hormones (free T4, TSH) during growth hormone (GH) treatment. Routine assessments of metabolic parameters, such as fasting serum lipid and glucose/insulin/HbA1c concentrations, should be obtained only in children born SGA who are treated with GH and have risk factors such as overweight, obesity, ethnicity, and family history.

### Fetal growth trajectories of babies born large-for-gestational age in the LIFECODES Fetal Growth Study [^116g2rfr]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Babies born large-for-gestational age have an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including birth injuries, childhood obesity, and cardiometabolic disorders. However, little work has been done to characterize patterns of fetal growth among large-for-gestational age births, which may further elucidate high- and low-risk subgroups.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to identify subgroups of large-for-gestational age births based on trajectories of fetal growth derived from prenatal ultrasound measurements and explore differences in sociodemographic, pregnancy, and birth outcome characteristics across subgroups.

- **Study design**: This study identified and described trajectories of fetal growth among large-for-gestational age births (n = 235) in the LIFECODES Fetal Growth Study. Ultrasound measurements of fetal growth in middle to late pregnancy were abstracted from health records. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was applied to measurements of head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length z-scores to identify multivariate trajectories of fetal growth. Moreover, sociodemographic variables, pregnancy characteristics, and birth outcomes based on trajectory membership were summarized.

- **Results**: This study identified four multivariate trajectories of fetal growth among large-for-gestational age births: catch-up growth (n = 28), proportional abdominal circumference-to-femur length growth (n = 67), disproportional abdominal circumference-to-femur length growth (n = 96), and consistently large (n = 44). Fetuses in the "catch-up growth" group exhibited small relative sizes early on before accelerating in growth later in the gestational period.

### Systematic review of interventions in early pregnancy among pregnant individuals at risk for hyperglycemia [^116aK9Ve]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Low credibility.

The maternal metabolic environment in early pregnancy can influence fetal growth trajectories. Our objective was to identify interventions initiated in early pregnancy (< 20 weeks gestation) in pregnant individuals with risk factors for hyperglycemia and report their impact on primary outcomes, including neonatal adiposity, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and macrosomia, as well as secondary outcomes such as gestational weight gain, maternal hypertensive disorder, birth injury, NICU admission, preterm delivery, and emergency cesarean section.

- **Data sources**: We searched the Cochrane Central database, Medline, Embase, CINAHL databases, and clinicaltrials.gov (September 2024) for clinical trials published between 2009 and 2024. Search terms included "early OR during" OR "first trimester OR second trimester" AND "gestation OR pregnancy" OR "prenatal care" AND "insulin resistance" OR "metabolic health" OR "diabet" OR "body composition" OR "obes" OR "weight gain" OR "gestational diabetes" OR "hyperglycemia" OR "metabolic syndrome" AND "clinical trial".

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other trials reporting interventions initiated before 20 weeks gestation in participants with singleton pregnancies at risk for hyperglycemia (overweight and/or obesity, history of type 2 diabetes, and/or history of gestational diabetes mellitus) that reported at least one primary outcome were included. Studies had to be conducted with humans in high-income countries as defined by the World Bank and written in English.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: We used the Downs and Black checklist to assess…

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^112EtZHi]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

As a group, children born small for gestational age (SGA) do not achieve their genetic height potential, generally falling on average 1 standard deviation (SD) below mid-parental height or target height. At least 90% of children born SGA show spontaneous catch-up growth into the normal height range (> −2 standard deviations score (SDS)) during childhood. Catch-up growth is usually defined as a sustained growth rate (cm/year) greater than 0 SDS, meaning more than the median for chronological age and sex. Sufficient catch-up is arbitrarily defined as growing into the normal height range.

This process is more pronounced during the first 6 months and usually completed within the first 2 years of life, during which 85% of children show catch-up growth to a normal length. Catch-up might take longer in infants born preterm and SGA, up to the age of 4 years. Children born SGA with a height below −2 SDS at the age of 3 years have a 7-fold increased risk of remaining short, whereas those born SGA with a birth weight below −2 SDS have a 5-fold increased risk.

The reasons for insufficient catch-up growth in children born SGA are poorly understood. Factors that positively influence childhood growth include female sex, multiple birth, taller parents, and a more rapid gain in length during early life.

### Preconception and early-pregnancy risk prediction for birth complications: development of prediction models within a population-based prospective cohort [^113KwXmv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). High credibility.

Preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age at birth (SGA), and large-for-gestational-age at birth (LGA) are among the most common birth complications, affecting a substantial number of pregnancies. These birth complications are not only strongly related to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality but also increase the risk of adverse health outcomes in later life.

Maternal health and lifestyle during pregnancy are important determinants of fetal development and birth outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests that preconception and early-pregnancy are crucial periods for the negative effects of adverse maternal lifestyle and physical characteristics on fetal development and birth outcomes. Adverse maternal lifestyle and physical characteristics tend to cluster and are more often present among families with a low socio-economic background. This accumulation of risk factors further increases the risks of birth complications.

The preconception period, often defined as three months prior to pregnancy, offers an important opportunity for achieving desired health outcomes in preparation for pregnancy. Increasing efforts are being made to develop intervention programs to optimize maternal health and lifestyle from preconception onwards to improve birth outcomes. Early identification enables interventions to target those who will benefit most from lifestyle programs and allows intensified antenatal monitoring of those prone to birth complications. Lifestyle intervention trials, mainly conducted during pregnancy, have performed risk selection only on a single maternal factor.

### Effects of interventions in pregnancy on maternal weight and obstetric outcomes: Meta-analysis of randomised evidence [^113ckQxm]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Appropriate subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses planned a priori were undertaken for important factors such as BMI, diabetic status, maternal weight change with intervention, and study quality that could influence outcomes. We formally rated the strength of evidence for key outcomes identified through a Delphi survey. This enabled our confidence in the estimates of the important effects observed. Our careful scrutiny and presentation of evidence profiles provide the much-needed clarity necessary to make judgments about effects.

The validity of a meta-analysis depends on the quality of the component studies, heterogeneity observed, and the risk of publication bias. The quality across various outcomes, assessed by GRADE, was moderate for the benefit observed with gestational weight gain but low for other important obstetric outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preterm delivery. This weakens the inferences for these outcomes. The reasons for the low evidence rating were the significant heterogeneity observed in the effect size, deficiencies in the quality of the individual studies, and risk of publication and related biases.

We observed heterogeneity for beneficial effects of interventions on maternal weight gain that persisted after accounting for the type of intervention, BMI, and diabetic status. Further information is needed on characteristics of included women — such as age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parity, and underlying medical conditions — and characteristics of the interventions — such as frequency, duration, and intensity.

### Obesity in pregnancy: Could lifestyle interventions work [^1139hXza]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of obesity has led to major healthcare issues in obstetric practice. Despite a significant international effort, there is little evidence for interventions that can improve clinical outcomes. Two reports from the LIMIT randomized controlled trial involving more than 2,000 overweight and obese women, recently published in BMC Medicine, demonstrate how a lifestyle intervention in Australian women alters dietary and physical activity behaviors. This occurs without any evidence of harm to the newborn infant's health and with some suggestion of benefit. The improvements in maternal lifestyle, albeit modest, may account for a previously reported reduction in the number of macrosomic infants born to LIMIT participants randomized to the intervention arm of the trial.

### Prepregnancy counseling: Committee opinion no. 762 [^1148u5jJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

The goal of prepregnancy care is to reduce the risk of adverse health effects for the woman, fetus, and neonate by working with the woman to optimize health, address modifiable risk factors, and provide education about a healthy pregnancy. All individuals planning to initiate a pregnancy should be counseled, including heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and gender nonconforming individuals. Counseling can begin with the following question: "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?" Prepregnancy counseling is appropriate whether the reproductive-aged patient is currently using contraception or planning pregnancy. Because health status and risk factors can change over time, prepregnancy counseling should occur several times during a woman's reproductive lifespan, thereby increasing her opportunity for education and potentially maximizing her reproductive and pregnancy outcomes.

Many chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric illness, and thyroid disease have implications for pregnancy outcomes and should be optimally managed before pregnancy. Counseling patients about optimal intervals between pregnancies may be helpful to reduce future complications. Assessment of the need for sexually transmitted infection screening should be performed at the time of prepregnancy counseling. Women who present for prepregnancy counseling should be offered screening for the same genetic conditions as recommended for pregnant women. All patients should be routinely asked about their use of alcohol, nicotine products, and drugs.

### Preconception and periconception interventions to prevent low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm birth: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142JLeX]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Effect measures: For binary outcomes, risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) were used where risk could not be calculated. For continuous outcomes, mean differences were utilized (see online supplemental appendix 1 for details on the use of study estimates). Results adjusted for potential confounders were preferred; when not available, unadjusted results were used. For clustered studies, cluster-adjusted effect estimates as reported by the study or calculated independently were used (see online supplemental appendix 1). Risk estimates were excluded from meta-analyses if the outcome was a composite measure or if no outcome cases were observed in both intervention and comparator groups. Estimates based on intention-to-treat analyses were used where possible.

Synthesis methods: For each outcome, included studies were categorized by intervention into three domains based on a predefined framework (see online supplemental appendix 1), and then further into subdomains. The domains included:

- **Nutrition**: Subdomains included multiple micronutrients, iron and folic acid, folic acid or food supplementation, and other.
- **Health**: Subdomains comprised general preconception health interventions, interventions to prevent early adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with a history of miscarriage, interventions to prevent or manage non-communicable diseases, and interventions to prevent or manage infectious diseases.
- **Social**: The subdomain here was reproductive planning.

Within subdomains, studies were further categorized by any other relevant study-specific characteristics (e.g. high-dose vs. low-dose).

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^111nX682]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

**Definitions**: Being born small for gestational age (SGA) is defined as having a birth weight and/or birth length below −2 standard deviations (SDS) for gestational age. Catch-up growth in height is defined as a growth rate (cm/year) of > 0 SDS, which is more than the median for chronological age and sex. Appropriate catch-up growth in height is defined as growing into the normal height range, considering the mid-parental height. Short stature is defined as a height below −2.0 SDS for age and sex.

### Maternal glycemia and risk of large-for-gestational-age babies in a population-based screening [^111L6Eyr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes is a risk factor for large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns; however, many LGA babies are born to mothers with normal glucose tolerance. This study aimed to clarify the association of maternal glycemia across the entire distribution with birth weight and the risk of LGA births in mothers with normal glucose tolerance.

A population-based gestational diabetes screening was conducted in an urban area of Hungary between 2002 and 2005. The study included all singleton pregnancies of mothers aged 18 years or older without known diabetes or gestational diabetes, as defined by World Health Organization criteria. Data from a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 22–30 weeks of gestation were included (n = 3,787, representing 78.9% of the target population). LGA was defined as a birth weight greater than the 90th percentile using national sex- and gestational age-specific charts.

The mean maternal age was 30 ± 4 years, BMI was 22.6 ± 4.0 kg/m², fasting blood glucose was 4.5 ± 0.5 mmol/l, and postload glucose was 5.5 ± 1.0 mmol/l. The mean birth weight was 3,450 ± 476 g at 39.2 ± 1.2 weeks of gestation. There was a U-shaped association of maternal fasting glucose with birth weight (P(curve) = 0.004) and risk of having an LGA baby, with the lowest values between 4 and 4.5 mmol/l (P(curve) = 0.0004), showing little change after adjustments for clinical characteristics. The association of postload glucose with birth weight (P = 0.03) and the risk of an LGA baby (P = 0.09) was weaker and linear.

In conclusion, both low and high fasting glucose values at 22–30 weeks of gestation are associated with an increased risk of LGA births.

### The criteria to classify body-proportionality of the small for gestational age newborn: a scoping review [^113XSK6M]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

A preliminary search of PROSPERO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted on January 20th, 2021, and no reviews on this topic were found. An a priori review protocol was published in the Open Science Framework (OSF). This scoping review was conducted according to the latest JBI guidance and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR checklist (Appendix I). It includes articles about SGA newborns regardless of gestational age in which some type of classification is made into symmetric and asymmetric SGA.

- **Search strategy**: Based on a preliminary limited search of MEDLINE (PubMed), a list of index terms and text words was incorporated into a search strategy developed with the help of a literature specialist and according to the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist. The search strategy can be found in Appendix II. Key terms were "SGA newborn" and "body-proportionality".

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: The following inclusion criteria were used: articles published in English and/or Dutch; articles describing SGA newborns regardless of gestational age; articles describing the classification on body-proportionality for both symmetric and asymmetric SGA newborns (or equivalent terms used). Sometimes the terms FGR (or IUGR) are used to describe BW (in contrast to an EFW) below a certain percentile instead of the term SGA. Although all these terms are often used interchangeably, they do not refer to identical concepts nor definitions.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^115Uw7QP]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Upon discontinuation of GH treatment, young adults born SGA should be counseled to adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle with regular exercise to avoid excessive weight gain and to maintain or preferably improve lean body mass. Long-term medical and metabolic follow-up of previously GH-treated young adults born SGA is only recommended in those with risk factors for metabolic and/or cardiovascular disease. Registries are needed to report on the long-term health of older adults born SGA, whether treated with GH during childhood or not.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: Does an effective prevention strategy exist [^117YJ6Tz]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The overall incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide. Preventing pathological hyperglycemia during pregnancy could have several benefits: a reduction in immediate adverse outcomes during pregnancy, a decreased risk of long-term sequelae, and a decrease in the economic burden on healthcare systems. In this review, we examine the evidence supporting lifestyle modification strategies in women with and without risk factors for GDM, and evaluate the efficacy of dietary supplementation and pharmacological approaches to prevent this disease.

A high degree of heterogeneity exists between trials, so a generalized recommendation is problematic. In population studies of dietary or combined lifestyle measures, the risk of developing GDM is not improved, and those involving a physical activity intervention have yielded conflicting results. In pregnant women with obesity, dietary modification might reduce fetal macrosomia, but in these patients, low compliance and no significant reduction in the incidence of GDM have been observed in trials investigating physical activity.

Supplementation with probiotics or myoinositol has reduced the incidence of GDM, but confirmatory studies are still needed. In randomized controlled trials, metformin does not prevent GDM in certain at-risk groups. Given the considerable potential for reducing disease burden, further research is needed to identify strategies that can be easily and effectively implemented on a population level.

### Lower versus higher diagnostic criteria for the detection of gestational diabetes for reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity: Study protocol for the GEMS randomised trial [^113fzY4S]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). High credibility.

Gestational diabetes is a significant and increasing health problem globally that has a major negative effect on maternal and perinatal health, with lifelong consequences. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at higher risk of pre-eclampsia, and they are more likely to have their labour induced and to give birth by caesarean section than women without GDM. Their lifetime risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is high. Infants born to women with GDM are more likely to be large for gestational age (LGA) than infants born to women without GDM, with increased risk of an operative birth, birth injuries, and significant neonatal morbidity. Children born to women with GDM are at increased risk of being obese and developing high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Treatment of women with GDM with dietary and lifestyle advice reduces adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes; however, there is still uncertainty, due to a lack of high-quality evidence, regarding the optimal diagnostic criteria to use for the diagnosis and treatment of GDM.

The GEMS Trial is assessing two diagnostic thresholds for GDM. These include the currently used higher diagnostic criteria and the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) lower diagnostic criteria. The trial focuses on assessing their effects on fetal growth, perinatal morbidity, maternal physical and psychological morbidity, and health service utilization. The GEMS Trial results will establish which of these diagnostic criteria provides the most benefit for maternal and infant health.

The results of the GEMS Trial will be directly relevant to the health needs of pregnant women and their infants. They will provide the necessary information to guide clinical practice.

### Risk factors for large-for-gestational age infants in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes [^114HvUZH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The rate of neonatal overweight remains generally high in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Since glycemic control has improved over time, other contributors need to be identified. Our aim is to evaluate the risk factors for large-for-gestational age infants (LGA) in women with T1DM and to evaluate whether the rate of LGA decreased over time.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of the medical files of pregnant women with T1DM attending our university hospital from 01–01–1992 till 31–07–2014. The generalized mixed model was used to adjust for several pregnancies over time in the same women. A multivariable model was used to evaluate independent risk factors for LGA.

- **Results**: Over a 22-year period, 259 pregnancies in 180 T1DM women were identified. The mean diabetes duration of women was 13.7 ± 7.1 years, with a mean age of 29.5 ± 5.2 years. Macrosomia (> 4 kg) was present in 16.2% of deliveries, LGA was present in 45.2%, and these numbers did not change over time (resp. p = 0.19 and p = 0.70). Over time, significantly more women were overweight (23.3% vs. 39.3%, p = 0.009) and more women had excessive weight gain during pregnancy (21.3% vs. 37.7%, p = 0.019). Compared to women with a non-LGA baby, women with a LGA baby had a higher weight at delivery (84.1 ± 11.1 vs. 80.4 ± 10.8, p = 0.016), had more often excessive weight gain (45.3% vs. 25.2%, p = 0.003), and had less strict glycemic control in the first and third trimester [HbA1c of resp. 49 ± 10 mmol/mol (6.7% ± 0.9) vs. 47 ± 8 mmol/mol (6.5% ± 0.8), p = 0.01 and 44 ± 5 mmol/mol (6.2% ± 0.5) vs. 42 ± 6 mmol/mol (6.0% ± 0.6), p = 0.01].

### Preconception and periconception interventions to prevent low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Y8Yjf]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

We used Covidence review management software (Veritas Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) to manage study selection. Two authors independently assessed potential studies for inclusion through title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review. Studies with unclear eligibility during title and abstract screening were included for full-text review. Where possible, further doubts regarding eligibility were clarified through correspondence with study authors during the full-text review. Reports based on the same study were linked, and disagreements regarding eligibility of studies were resolved through discussion.

Two authors independently extracted data using a prespecified form. Broadly, data extracted included study population and setting, sample size (including the initial number of participants recruited and analytical size), study design, participant characteristics, interventions and comparators, and the preconception phase in which these were delivered. Outcomes and analytical strategy were also extracted. We obtained both crude and adjusted effect estimates where possible. Relevant group-level data were extracted for all reported study arms to facilitate comprehensive comparisons. For all outcomes, we noted and used definitions as described by the authors.

Data accuracy was verified, and we contacted study authors for further information if any relevant information was missing or unclear. Disagreements during data extraction were resolved by discussion or consultation with a third author.

### Optimal timing and mode of planned birth for term, large infants: a retrospective, population-based cohort study [^11287112]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Large infants are normally described as being either large for gestational age (birthweight or estimated fetal weight ≥ 90th percentile for gestational age and sex) or macrosomic, variably defined as birthweight > 4000 g or 4500 g. Whilst these infants make up only 6–10% of all births, their numbers are increasing globally. In Australia, approximately 1.2% of all infants have a birth weight of ≥ 4500 g. There is a strong correlation between fetal size and in-utero growth with maternal diabetes mellitus and obesity. From a clinical perspective, although the risks of adverse outcomes are greatest when birthweight exceeds the 95th percentile for gestation, there is a clear rise in the incidence of complications when birthweights exceed the 75th percentile for gestation.

Infants with birthweights > 75th percentile are at increased risk of mortality and severe neonatal neurological and non-neurological morbidity, largely because of maternal diabetes but also due to intrapartum complications during attempted vaginal birth. The most recent Cochrane review showed that although induction of labor for suspected fetal macrosomia resulted in lower mean birthweight and fewer cases of shoulder dystocia and birth fractures, there was no clear effect on the risk of cesarean section or instrumental vaginal birth, brachial plexus injury, low 5-minute Apgar score, or low cord arterial pH. Conversely, the 2021 National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence Guidelines state that practitioners need to balance the reduced risk of shoulder dystocia associated with induction of labor against the increasing complications involved.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^113kFYnP]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, specifically concerning postnatal infant surveillance (laboratory monitoring), the ICG-SGA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing fasting glucose and lipid concentrations only in children born SGA with at least one risk factor. These risk factors include overweight (BMI ≥ 1 SDS), obesity (BMI ≥ 2 SDS), ethnicity, and family history, or when clinical signs suggest a metabolic disease.

### Refining regional organization of services in the UK to improve outcomes of pregnancies delivering at extremely low gestational age [^114TZoGw]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

Care for pregnant women and their infants at extremely low gestational ages presents significant challenges to clinical teams. The continued increase in survival rates for gestational ages below 25 weeks has led to a re-evaluation of practice guidelines within the UK and other countries. This paper describes the background data that have guided our practice and outlines the approach taken to achieve optimal outcomes for pregnancies delivering at extremely low gestational ages in the UK, mainly by centralizing care. We discuss the research and audit data that support our practice. In particular, we emphasize the importance of a coordinated perinatal approach for both the mother and infant. A careful assessment of the risks to both is necessary to ensure the development of the highest quality personalized care for each family, supported by national quality improvement and research evidence.

### Large-for-gestational-age neonates in type 1 diabetes and pregnancy: Contribution of factors beyond hyperglycemia [^115kh41q]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Despite significant reductions in serious adverse perinatal outcomes for women with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy, the opposite effect has been observed for fetal overgrowth and associated complications, such as neonatal hypoglycemia, shoulder dystocia, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Additionally, infants born large for gestational age (LGA) have an increased lifetime risk of obesity, diabetes, and chronic disease. Although exposure to hyperglycemia plays an important role, even women who seemingly achieve adequate glycemic control during pregnancy continue to experience a greater risk of excess fetal growth, leading to LGA neonates and macrosomia.

We review potential contributors to excess fetal growth in pregnancies complicated by type 1 diabetes. In addition to hyperglycemia, we explore the role of glycemic variability, prepregnancy overweight and obesity, gestational weight gain, and maternal lipid levels. A greater understanding of the stimuli driving excess fetal growth could lead to targeted management strategies in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, potentially reducing the incidence of LGA neonates and the inherent risk of acute and long-term complications.

### Comparative effect sizes in randomised trials from less developed and more developed countries: Meta-epidemiological assessment [^111PQUck]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Significant differences in effect sizes were observed for any primary outcome. By combining trials using the fixed effects model, the treatment effects for the experimental intervention in trials from more developed and less developed countries showed relative differences that were beyond chance (relative risk and 95% confidence intervals excluding 1.00) in 20 cases. Of these, six cases pertained to mortality and 14 to non-mortality outcomes. In 15 of the 20 cases, results were more favorable (or less unfavorable) in trials from less developed countries (relative risk > 1.00).

Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, lipid-lowering regimens for peripheral arterial disease of the leg, vaccination for pneumococcal infection in adults, and intravenous immunoglobulin for sepsis in preterm or low birthweight infants had beneficial effects on the respective outcomes in trials from both less developed and more developed countries. However, the benefit was considerably larger in less developed countries. Antioxidants and vitamin E prevented pre-eclampsia, antioxidants prevented gastrointestinal cancers, and β blockers decreased the rate of caesarean sections in trials from less developed countries but not in trials from more developed countries. Finally, the reduced number of antenatal visits or goal-oriented visits only marginally increased the risk of preterm birth in more developed countries, but showed a small non-significant reduction in trials from less developed countries.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^116x43SR]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

In children born small for gestational age (SGA), there is a gradual development of insulin resistance from birth onwards. This is already detected by the age of 1 to 4 years in those with spontaneous catch-up in weight. The compensatory increase in insulin secretion maintains normoglycemia. Childhood insulin resistance is sharply amplified by accelerated fat mass accumulation and obesity in those with rapid weight gain in the first 3 months of life and in those with a high body mass index (BMI). However, there is no evidence that type 2 diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, clinically relevant dyslipidemia, or hypertension occur more commonly among children born SGA than in those born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). The risk for metabolic disorders can, however, be amplified by the presence of risk factors such as overweight (BMI ≥ 1 standard deviation score [SDS]), obesity (BMI ≥ 2 SDS), ethnicity, and family history. Routine evaluation of metabolic parameters is, therefore, not recommended for all children born SGA but for those with one or more risk factors.

### Preconception and periconception interventions to prevent low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm birth: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tY9LS]. BMJ Global Health (2022). Low credibility.

Low birth weight (LBW), including preterm and small-for-gestational-age babies, presents a significant global health burden. Approximately 20.5 million (14.6%) live births globally were estimated to be LBW in 2015, with 91% of these occurring in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is estimated that 14.84 million (10.6%) live births in 2014 were preterm, while approximately 23.3 million (19.3%) neonates were born small for gestational age (SGA) in LMICs in 2012. LBW is associated with an increased risk of mortality, especially in the neonatal period and infancy, and increased morbidity across the lifespan, including developmental and behavioral problems, undernutrition in childhood, and cardiometabolic disease development in adulthood. Much research and programmatic attention has focused on interventions during pregnancy to prevent LBW. However, there is growing recognition of the need to identify additional windows for interventions prior to pregnancy for its prevention.

Preconception is broadly understood as the period up to a few months before conception among women of reproductive age, although definitions encompassing a wider interval have also been proposed. Recent research indicates that maternal morbidity and nutritional status in the preconception period have important influences on pregnancy outcomes and the health of offspring, highlighting its value as a potentially critical window for preventative interventions. Although specific pathways have not been fully delineated, health and nutritional status up to conception are thought to inform physiological and developmental processes.

### Fetal growth trajectories of small/large for gestational age infants in twin pregnancies [^116SQqjU]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Low credibility.

Birthweight is the most common and accessible parameter in assessing neonatal perinatal outcomes, as well as in evaluating the intrauterine environment globally. Infants born too large or too small not only may alter the maternal mode of delivery but also may face other long-term disorders, such as metabolic diseases and neurodevelopmental delay. Studies have revealed different growth profiles of large-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age fetuses in singleton pregnancies. However, currently, no research is focused on the growth trajectories of these infants during twin pregnancies, even though they are at a much higher risk of being small for gestational age.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to explore fetal growth trajectories of large-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age infants in twin pregnancies to provide strategies for fetal growth management.

- **Study design**: This was a case-control study of all noncomplicated twin pregnancies delivered after 36 weeks of gestation at Peking University First Hospital between 2012 and 2021. Ultrasound data were recorded every 2 to 4 weeks until delivery. All the infants were divided into large-for-gestational-age, small-for-gestational-age, and appropriate-for-gestational-age groups. Longitudinal fetal growth (estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, etc) was compared among the three groups using a linear mixed model, and other maternal and neonatal perinatal outcomes were compared. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to explore optimal biometric parameters and gestational weeks for prediction.

### The risk of large for gestational age across increasing categories of pregnancy glycemia [^115tcV9s]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to estimate the risk of large for gestational age (LGA) across categories of glucose tolerance.

- **Study design**: In a cohort of 89,141 participants, women without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were categorized by their screening and diagnostic test results. Those with GDM were categorized as meeting the National Diabetes Data Group or only the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the risk of LGA; screening values 5.5–6.0 mmol/L comprised the referent.

- **Results**: In women without GDM, the odds ratio for LGA was 1.89 (95% confidence interval, 1.45–2.45) for fasting, 1.57 (95% CI, 1.31–1.89) for 1-hour, 1.60 (95% CI, 1.33–1.93) for 2-hour, and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.23–2.14) for 3-hour values meeting the ADA time point-specific thresholds.

- **Conclusion**: For GDM identified in a 2-step procedure, our findings support the use of isolated abnormal fasting values according to the ADA threshold in identifying women who could benefit from treatment.

### Newborn size among obese women with weight gain outside the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendation [^1114JRA6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of delivering macrosomic, large-for-gestational-age, and small-for-gestational-age neonates in obese women with gestational weight gain outside the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendation (11–20 pounds).

In a retrospective cohort study, 2,080 obese women (body mass index 30 or higher) with singleton pregnancies that resulted in term live births within one health maintenance organization between 2000 and 2005 were evaluated; women with diabetes or hypertensive disorders were excluded. Gestational weight gain was categorized as less than 0, 0 to less than 11, 11–20 (referent), greater than 20–30, greater than 30–40, and greater than 40 pounds and as above, below, or within Institute of Medicine recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of large-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age (birth weights greater than the 90th percentile and less than the 10th percentile for gestational age, respectively) and macrosomia (greater than 4,500 g) while adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: Eighteen percent of women gained below, 25% within, and 57% above the Institute of Medicine recommendations. The prevalence of macrosomia, large for gestational age, and small for gestational age was 4.3%, 19.8%, and 4.3% respectively. Compared with a weight gain of 11–20 pounds, weight gain above recommendations did not significantly decrease the risk of small-for-gestational-age but was associated with increased odds of macrosomia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74–6.51; 6.0% compared with 2.1%).
