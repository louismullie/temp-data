Hand pain

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hand pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical question and extract PICO elements. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and grade the quality of studies. Next, I will synthesize by condition, starting with carpal tunnel syndrome, then hand osteoarthritis, and finally other important etiologies and special scenarios. After that, I should integrate cross-cutting principles like imaging, psychosocial factors, and postoperative care. Finally, I will translate this into practical, condition-specific recommendations and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing and PICO. Hand pain is a symptom with a broad differential, so I need to ensure I address prevalence, common etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and treatment effectiveness across conditions, while keeping the audience in mind for primary care and specialty referral contexts. I should double-check that my PICO aligns with the literature: Population includes adults with hand pain, Interventions span nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, Comparisons include placebo, usual care, and surgical versus nonsurgical care, and Outcomes include pain, function, disability, and quality of life, with imaging appropriateness as a secondary question.

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and grading. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check which sources are highest quality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, RCTs, and high-credibility guidelines from ACR/Arthritis Foundation and EULAR carry the most weight, followed by cohort and case-control studies, and then case series or expert opinion. I should confirm that I apply GRADE-like principles and note limitations such as heterogeneity, risk of bias, and imprecision when downgrading certainty [^11246Cbo] [^115ufnwR] [^114FJ35i].

> I will now examine carpal tunnel syndrome, since it is a leading cause of hand pain with sensory deficits. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach: history and exam remain foundational, but no single test confirms CTS, so combining subjective and objective data improves diagnostic likelihood. Electrodiagnostics are reserved for inconclusive cases or when surgery is planned, and ultrasound's role remains unsettled for routine diagnosis, though it can aid anatomy assessment in select scenarios [^113y1poU] [^112zMx6A]. I should confirm treatment trajectories: nonsurgical care helps some, but progression to surgery is common over time, with 57–66% proceeding to carpal tunnel release within 1–3 years in some cohorts. Night splinting and corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief, and open versus endoscopic release have similar outcomes by 3 months, so patient preference and access can guide technique selection [^116Q8hy1] [^117LfBbp]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring advice: clinicians should track symptom duration, nocturnal severity, thenar wasting, and prior nonsurgical care, and escalate to surgical consultation if no improvement, given the risk of persistent deficits with prolonged compression [^113e5iRx].

> Now, hand osteoarthritis. Let me think about prevalence and burden to set context. Hand OA is highly prevalent, especially in older adults, and pain is the dominant symptom with substantial functional impact. Importantly, there is a discordance between radiographic severity and pain, implying non-nociceptive mechanisms in many patients [^113vba6p] [^113S1kXC]. I should confirm first-line management: guidelines prioritize nonpharmacologic care, including education, joint protection, assistive devices, and exercise, with modest but real benefits on pain and function. Topical NSAIDs are preferred over oral NSAIDs for safety, and acetaminophen has very small effect sizes and is best reserved for short-term or episodic use when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^115ufnwR] [^111hhLKo] [^114C1ZGe] [^112vLMK9]. But wait, what if inflammation is prominent? A short course of oral prednisolone reduced pain and local inflammation in patients with inflammatory hand OA, suggesting a targeted anti-inflammatory approach can be effective in the right phenotype, though this is not a blanket recommendation and requires careful selection and monitoring [^11795kJc]. I need to ensure I address pain mechanisms: central sensitization is present in a substantial subset and may explain treatment resistance, which argues for multimodal strategies and, in some cases, neuromodulator agents like duloxetine in refractory cases [^111CFr2R] [^116wZybL].

> Let me consider other common etiologies and special scenarios. Tendon disorders such as trigger finger and de Quervain's are common and often respond to corticosteroid injection, with surgery reserved for recalcitrant cases. I should confirm that mechanical and degenerative factors predominate over inflammation in many tendonopathies, which aligns with contemporary understanding [^111o3KLG]. Complex regional pain syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed; many patients labeled with CRPS have identifiable pain generators such as irritative CTS or neuromas, and addressing the underlying lesion can yield dramatic improvement, so I should maintain diagnostic vigilance and avoid premature closure [^111yNzXC]. For acute hand pain, I must not miss compartment syndrome, even in atypical locations like the thenar eminence, where prompt fasciotomy prevents irreversible injury [^114cdVKe]. I should also remember that hand pain can be the presenting manifestation of systemic disease, including rheumatoid arthritis and even transthyretin amyloidosis, so red flags and multisystem review remain essential [^116DG4WL] [^113gn4zZ].

> Next, I should review imaging appropriateness. Radiography is usually the appropriate first-line study for chronic hand or wrist pain, with advanced imaging guided by the differential. Ultrasound can identify synovitis and tendon involvement, MRI excels at soft tissues and occult fractures, and SPECT/CT can help in complex postoperative cases when standard imaging is unrevealing. I need to ensure I match modality to the suspected pain generator to avoid low-yield testing [^112b7KC9] [^113bAWJw]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering imaging; in many cases, a careful history and exam plus targeted imaging based on the working diagnosis is more efficient and informative than broad panels [^112b7KC9].

> I will now examine psychosocial and perioperative factors that modify outcomes. Depression, anxiety, and pain catastrophizing correlate with worse pain and disability after hand surgery, and patients' preoperative forecasts of disability moderately predict realized disability, which supports preoperative counseling and, when indicated, mental health integration. Next-day concerns after minor hand surgery are common and associated with catastrophic thinking, so proactive communication can mitigate anxiety-driven pain amplification [^115eiHYY] [^112pjhkL]. Let me reconsider postoperative analgesia: contemporary practice favors multimodal, opioid-sparing regimens, and many hand procedures can be managed with acetaminophen and NSAIDs, with regional techniques or local anesthesia as adjuncts, aligning with patient preferences and safety goals [^115kaf2z] [^111YVxgd].

> Translating this into practical recommendations, I should confirm condition-specific pathways. For suspected CTS, start with education, activity modification, and night splinting, consider a corticosteroid injection for flares, and refer for electrodiagnostics and surgical consultation if symptoms persist or are severe. For hand OA, emphasize joint protection, exercise, and topical NSAIDs, escalate to oral NSAIDs for limited duration if needed, and consider a short prednisolone trial in clearly inflammatory phenotypes. For trigger finger or de Quervain's, attempt injection first and proceed to release if symptoms recur. For acute severe pain with tenseness or neurovascular compromise, evaluate urgently for compartment syndrome. And for refractory or atypical pain, reassess the diagnosis, consider central sensitization, and coordinate multidisciplinary care [^115zwSgJ] [^115ufnwR] [^11795kJc] [^111o3KLG] [^114cdVKe] [^111CFr2R].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps. Many hand OA trials are small and short-term, exercise effect sizes are modest and may not be sustained, and we lack disease-modifying drugs. Placebo and contextual effects are substantial in hand OA trials, complicating interpretation. And we still need better phenotyping tools to match treatments to pain mechanisms, including inflammatory, mechanical, and sensitization subtypes [^116x6GCD] [^111AjztP] [^113S1kXC]. Hold on, I should verify that my bottom line aligns with guidelines: management should be individualized, preference-sensitive, and grounded in shared decision-making, with explicit monitoring and adjustment over time to optimize pain, function, and quality of life [^116PJZHR] [^116TTFgn].

Hand pain is most often due to **carpal tunnel syndrome** or **osteoarthritis**, but the differential is broad and includes tendon, nerve, vascular, and systemic causes [^115hMzP1] [^113vba6p]. A focused history and exam, with selective imaging, usually clarifies the diagnosis [^112b7KC9]. Management is **condition-specific**: CTS often improves with splinting and corticosteroid injection, but surgery is indicated for severe or refractory cases [^114fi51V]; hand OA benefits from topical NSAIDs, exercise, and joint protection, with surgery for structural deformity or refractory pain [^115ufnwR] [^114EddQP]. Persistent, atypical, or severe pain warrants **early referral** to exclude serious pathology and optimize outcomes [^115zwSgJ].

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: onset, duration, location, radiation, aggravating/relieving factors, occupational/repetitive tasks, trauma, systemic symptoms, comorbidities, medication use [^notfound].
- **Physical examination**: inspection, palpation, range of motion, neurovascular assessment, special tests (Phalen's, Tinel's, Finkelstein's, Durkan's compression) [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: radiographs for suspected fracture, OA, or deformity; ultrasound for soft tissue/tendon assessment; MRI for complex or occult pathology; electrodiagnostics for CTS confirmation when uncertain [^112b7KC9] [^113EkxN3].
- **Laboratory tests**: ESR/CRP, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, uric acid when inflammatory arthritis or gout is suspected [^116DG4WL].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Carpal tunnel syndrome**: night splinting, activity modification, corticosteroid injection; surgery for severe or refractory cases [^114fi51V] [^114AaaaR].
- **Osteoarthritis**: topical NSAIDs, hand exercises, joint protection, assistive devices; oral NSAIDs or duloxetine for refractory pain; surgery for structural deformity or persistent symptoms [^115ufnwR] [^114C1ZGe] [^116wZybL].
- **Tendon disorders**: corticosteroid injection, splinting, activity modification; surgery for recalcitrant cases [^111o3KLG].
- **Inflammatory arthritis**: DMARDs, biologics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, hand therapy [^116DG4WL].
- **Trauma**: immobilization, reduction, surgical fixation as indicated [^notfound].
- **Vascular disorders**: medical management, surgical consultation for compartment syndrome [^114cdVKe].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause and severity**. CTS has a good prognosis with treatment, but delayed care risks permanent nerve injury [^notfound]. OA is chronic and progressive, yet symptoms can be controlled with conservative care; surgery helps selected cases [^115ufnwR]. Inflammatory arthritis requires lifelong management to prevent deformity and disability [^116DG4WL]. Complications include chronic pain, functional impairment, nerve damage, and disability impacting quality of life [^116ddiHM].

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Prevention focuses on **ergonomics**, activity modification, weight management, smoking cessation, and hand exercises. Occupational therapy supports joint protection and adaptive strategies, and patient education improves adherence and outcomes [^111hhLKo] [^115Jzvqa].

Hand pain is common and multifactorial; a **focused history, exam, and selective testing** enable accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy. Early, condition-specific management — including conservative measures and timely referral — improves pain, function, and quality of life [^112b7KC9] [^114Q4RMC].

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: treating hand pain and numbness [^114fi51V]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain and a loss of feeling in your thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of your ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand that result from it are caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Guidelines published in the May 2019 issue of JOSPT make recommendations, based on best practices from the published literature, for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2019;49(5):361. doi:10.2519/jospt.2019.0502.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome… [^116vEoY8]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common focal peripheral neuropathy, results from compression of the median nerve at the wrist. 1 The syndrome affects an estimated 3 percent of adult Americans and is approximately three times more common in women than in men. 2 High prevalence rates have been reported in persons who perform certain repetitive wrist motions, but the significance of this relationship continues to be challenged. Although 30 percent of frequent computer users complain of hand pares-thesias, only 10 percent meet clinical criteria for carpal tunnel syndrome, and nerve conduction studies are abnormal in only 3. 5 percent of these persons.
3. Clinical Features The classic symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are pain, numbness, and tingling in the distribution of the median nerve, although numbness in all fingers may be a more common presentation. 4 Symptoms are usually worse at night and can awaken patients from sleep.

To relieve the symptoms, patients often "flick"their wrist as if shaking down a thermometer. In patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, pain and paresthesias may radiate to the forearm, elbow, and shoulder. Decreased grip strength may result in loss of dexterity, and thenar muscle atrophy may develop if the syndrome is severe. Although one hand typically has more severe symptoms, both hands often are affected. Diagnosis One systematic review 7 evaluated the effectiveness of findings from the history and physical examination in predicting positive nerve conduction studies. The most highly predictive findings were symptom location, hypalgesia, and weak thumb abduction.

Treatment GENERAL MEASURES Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome should avoid repetitive wrist and hand motions that may exacerbate symptoms or make symptom relief difficult to achieve. If possible, they should not use vibratory tools, because the motion of these tools can make their symptoms worse. Complications of surgery include injury to the palmar cutaneous or recurrent motor branch of the median nerve, hypertrophic scarring, laceration of the superficial palmar arch, and tendon adhesion. 25 Postoperative infection, hematoma, arterial injury, stiffness, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy are other possible complications. 21 If carpal tunnel release is incomplete, symptoms may recur.

### Enigmatic and unusual cases of upper extremity pain: mislabeling as malingerers [^1164BKRi]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

With the intricate anatomy of the hand and upper extremity, there are many possible etiologies of pain. In addition, one must be alert to conditions typically affecting other areas of the body presenting in the hand and upper extremity. To add to the complexity of diagnosis, one must also be aware of potential secondary gains. With this in mind, a thorough history, physical examination, and broad differential can help avoid mislabeling patients with uncommon ailments. In this article, we present 4 cases of unusual causes of hand and upper extremity pain.

### Hand osteoarthritis: clinical phenotypes, molecular mechanisms and disease management [^113vba6p]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent condition, and the hand is the most commonly affected site. Patients with hand OA frequently report symptoms of pain, functional limitations and frustration in undertaking everyday activities. The condition presents clinically with changes to the bone, ligaments, cartilage and synovial tissue, which can be observed using radiography, ultrasonography or MRI. Hand OA is a heterogeneous disorder and is considered to be multifactorial in aetiology. This Review provides an overview of the epidemiology, presentation and burden of hand OA, including an update on hand OA imaging (including the development of novel techniques), disease mechanisms and management. In particular, areas for which new evidence has substantially changed the way we understand, consider and treat hand OA are highlighted. For example, genetic studies, clinical trials and careful prospective imaging studies from the past 5 years are beginning to provide insights into the pathogenesis of hand OA that might uncover new therapeutic targets in the disease.

### Development of hand phenotypes and changes in hand pain and problems over time in older people [^115SWbcA]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Musculoskeletal hand problems are common in the general population aged 50 years and older, with an estimated 1-month prevalence of 47% for hand problems and of 31% for hand pain, with a significant impact on everyday life. Women and the older people appear especially vulnerable to the effect of hand problems on their daily activities and independence. Hand problems in older people can be due to a range of conditions, with osteoarthritis (OA) being the most frequent cause of pain and disability. In a community-based study of adults aged 50 years and older, approximately 80% of older people with hand pain attending a research clinic had radiographic change (Kellgren and Lawrence grade ≥ 2) in one hand or more joints. However, there is little information on the course of hand pain and functional limitations in the community-based and primary care samples of older people.

A study of adults consulting for hand and wrist problems in general practice reported that the main factors that influenced a poor outcome were female gender, older age, symptom duration over 3 months, and lower coping strategies. However, individuals consulting for hand problems may reflect a population with more severe symptoms, and therefore, a study based in the general population would capture a wider range of hand symptoms severities. A recent report has also highlighted the need for insights into risk factors for the onset of hand problems, specifically hand OA, and for changes in symptoms over time.

Hand pain and problems in older adults represent a heterogeneous group of conditions with a variable presentation and prognosis. Therefore, a more adaptive technique that identifies different profiles of hand pain and problems and the ability to move between profiles over time is needed. A potential impact of this would be that clinicians have more knowledge to identify the likely course of pain and functional limitations in patients presenting with hand problems and patients at the risk of poorer trajectories. The main objectives of this study were to identify subgroups of older individuals with distinct presentations (phenotypes) of hand pain and function, investigate how these might change over a 6-year period, and explore what factors, in addition to baseline hand phenotype, are associated with long-term status.

### The evidence for non-pharmacological therapy of hand and hip OA [^114ZNjTh]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide. Evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of OA consider non-pharmacological modalities as the cornerstone of modern OA management. Nonetheless, research evidence from clinical trials on non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hand and hip OA is scarce and considerably less than that for knee OA. In addition, research on non-pharmacological interventions for OA appears highly on the list of patients' research priorities. Thus, there is a clear mismatch between the available research evidence for non-pharmacological interventions for hip and hand OA and both the treatment guidelines and the interests of patients.

### What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes? An analysis of the hand-wrist study cohort [^116J7AfK]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and its associated lockdowns in many parts of the world, have changed our daily lives and may have a psychological impact on around the globe. However, it is unknown how this influences the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of patients involved in ongoing clinical research and medical care. For both the current and potential future lockdowns, it is important to determine if PROMs collected during such a period can be interpreted with confidence.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is there a difference in quality of life between patients in the COVID-19 period group (March 23, 2020 to May 4, 2020) and patients in a reference period group (from the same period in 2018 or 2019)? (2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group?

Methods

This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions. To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment. The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life (QoL), pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment. The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception. Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group. We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616; reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313; reference period group: n = 222). The primary outcome was QoL, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score. Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception.

Results

We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0.035; p = 0.98). Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression. There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on QoL and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort. This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research. Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures.

### Reduced pain perception in patients with schizophrenia; A missed case of hand fracture [^114LkEt1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Altered pain perception among patients with schizophrenia is often underrecognized in the medical community. The cause is not known, and medical professionals are not sure whether these patients experience less pain or are simply unable to express it. There are documented cases of patients with schizophrenia presenting to hospital settings with serious injuries without obvious (expected) pain. Research into the underlying cause(s) is underway; meanwhile, ensuring awareness of this issue among medical providers is of upmost importance. We report a case of a patient with schizophrenia who presented voluntarily to the emergency department (ED) with a hand fracture that went unrecognized in the ED and further discuss the implications of reduced pain perception. Additionally, we summarize existing hypotheses regarding the source of this reduced pain perception in this population.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hand and wrist pain: 2023 update [^112b7KC9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic hand and wrist pain is a common presenting complaint. The intricate anatomy results in a variety of pain generators-multiple bones, articular cartilage, intrinsic ligaments, triangular fibrocartilage complex, joint capsules and synovium, tendons and tendon sheaths, muscles, and nerves-in a compact space. The need for imaging and the choice of the appropriate imaging modality are best determined by the patient's presentation, physical examination, and the clinician's working differential diagnosis. Radiography is usually appropriate as the initial imaging study in the evaluation of chronic hand or wrist pain. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Surgical management of neuromas of the hand and wrist [^114CRtnr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuromas of the hand and wrist are common causes of peripheral nerve pain. Neuromas are formed after the nerve sustains an injury, and they can be debilitating and painful. The diagnosis is made by a thorough history and physical examination. The treatment options are quite varied, but conservative measures tailored to the patient should be initiated first. No surgical treatment has been proven superior to others or to nonsurgical treatment.

### Development of hand phenotypes and changes in hand pain and problems over time in older people [^115gE2qe]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Hand disabilities are frequent causes of pain and disability in older people, yet knowledge regarding the characteristics and patterns of hand pain and problems over time is lacking. The main aim of this study was to identify subgroups of older individuals with distinct presentations (phenotypes) of hand pain and function, investigate how these might change over a 6-year period, and explore what characteristics and factors are associated with long-term status. The study population stemmed from the North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis Project, a large, general population-based, prospective, cohort study of adults aged 50 years and older. Information on hand pain and problems was collected using questionnaires at baseline, 3 years, and 6 years. Overall, 5617 participants responded at all time points and were included in the analysis. Five phenotypes were identified using latent transition analysis ("least affected", "high pain", "poor gross function", "high pain and poor gross function", and "severely affected") based on 8 hand pain and functional items. The most common transition between phenotypes was from "high pain" at baseline to "least-affected" group. There was a high level of stability in individuals in the "least-affected" or "severely affected" group at baseline. Individuals with widespread body pain, nodes, sleep problems, and pain in both hands at baseline were more likely to be in a severe hand phenotype at 6 years. The results provide clinically relevant information regarding the pattern of hand pain and problems over time and factors that predict transition to more severe hand phenotypes.

### Determination and characterization of patient subgroups based on pain trajectories in hand osteoarthritis [^116ELcVy]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand OA is a frequently occurring, invalidating disease. Pain is the primary symptom, along with loss of function and destruction of the joints. Previous studies have identified various factors associated with pain in hand osteoarthritis, including sex, disease subtype and distribution, rapid radiological progression, and signs of depression and anxiety, indicating it is a multifactorial problem. The aetiology of hand OA pain is as of yet unclear, but both nociceptive mechanisms (joint damage, inflammation) and non-nociceptive mechanisms (sensitization) are thought to play a role. These mechanisms require different therapies, which complicates treatment. This indicates the importance of investigating factors associated with pain in hand OA, as it may provide insights leading to new treatment options. For example, differences in coping strategies and illness perceptions have been shown to influence functional disability in hand OA, which in turn has been associated with pain.

Along with the uncertainty regarding the aetiology, the development of hand OA pain over time is also unclear. Much previous research has focused on radiographic signs to study progression. Large cohort studies investigating the development of pain in hand osteoarthritis are still few in number. The studies that have been performed indicate that pain does not seem to increase on average. However, the lack of changes in average pain does not preclude the existence of subgroups within the hand OA population, in which increasing or decreasing pain trajectories may be found.

For knee and hip OA, subgroups with different pain trajectories have been identified. These subgroups were identified using latent class growth analysis (LCGA), a statistical technique to investigate inter-individual differences in intra-individual development. This technique identifies subgroups based on the course of a variable of interest over time.

Knowledge regarding subgroups with different pain trajectories within hand OA and their characteristics may help guide clinical decision making and patient education. Additionally, knowledge of factors associated with pain in hand OA, both cross-sectional and over time, may provide insights into potential treatments. Therefore, this study aimed: (i) to investigate the cross-sectional associations of disease and patient characteristics with pain in hand OA; (ii) to identify subgroups based on pain trajectories within the hand OA population (iii) to describe these trajectories; and (iv) to characterize the subgroups of patients that follow these trajectories.

### Associations between joint pathologies and central sensitization in persons with hand osteoarthritis: results from the nor-hand study [^111CFr2R]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is a major concern for patients with symptomatic hand OA that significantly reduces health-related quality of life. Symptomatic pain treatment can be challenging, and no disease-modifying drugs exist. Although previous research has found both structural and inflammatory features to associate with pain in the same joint, these features fail to fully explain the overall hand pain experience in hand OA.

Recent clinical studies have reported pain sensitization to be a clinically relevant contributor to hip and knee OA pain. The role of pain sensitization in hand OA is less studied. A few small-scale studies have demonstrated that peripheral and central sensitization are more common in hand OA patients than in healthy individuals. The authors of this report have previously reported data from the Nor-Hand study where the prevalence of central sensitization was 40% and peripheral and central sensitization was associated with greater hand pain severity, suggesting a likely clinical relevance of sensitization also in persons with hand OA. Pain sensitization involves mechanisms responsible for facilitated responsiveness of peripheral and central nociceptors to painful stimuli and to previously non-painful stimuli, causing increased pain sensitivity and pain perception. In arthritic diseases like hand OA, chronic joint pathologies, both mechanical and inflammatory, are believed to cause peripheral sensitization with primary hyperalgesia and allodynia, and possibly over time also central sensitization with widespread hyperalgesia and allodynia. Experimental models of OA in animals report that both mechanical stimuli and inflammation induce peripheral sensitization as well as neuroinflammation in the CNS, which is associated with central sensitization. The translation of this theory was recently illustrated in a brief report using data from the Nor-Hand study. These analyses showed that the severity of structural OA pathology and inflammatory severity in finger joints, independent of each other and of pain, were related to peripheral sensitization. Whether hand joint pathologies are related to clinical assessment of central sensitization like widespread hypersensitivity and temporal summation (TS) has not yet been explored.

New OA-pain therapeutics and pain management may be developed to target sensitization. Therapeutic trials targeting OA-related pathology, including inflammation and sensitization, are ongoing. Along this line, identifying patients' phenotypes will enable more individualized treatment strategies. To achieve these goals, we need greater understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind pain sensitization in individuals with hand OA. Hence, the current study explores the relationship of structural and inflammatory hand OA pathologies, as well as symptom duration, to central sensitization assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST).

### Determination and characterization of patient subgroups based on pain trajectories in hand osteoarthritis [^112L3xKH]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

However, in treating pain, one has to consider the expected development of pain over time, as well as the baseline level, as this can help tailor treatment to subgroups of patients. Thus, we studied pain longitudinally using LCGA. We identified three classes with different trajectories of pain development, characterized by the intercept rather than by the slope. This is different from previous studies in knee and hip OA, which yielded trajectories that showed more heterogeneous slopes. In the case of knee OA pain, three classes have been found. The groups were characterized by low baseline pain (intercept) and a slight decrease over time, medium baseline pain and a stable course and high baseline pain with an increase of pain over 5 years. LCGA analyses over 5 years in hip OA pain yielded four classes with different trajectories (constant mild, moderate pain with moderate regression, moderate pain with progression and constant severe pain). A possible explanation for the difference between hand OA vs knee or hip OA is that hand OA is polyarticular rather than monoarticular. Pain in the hands is a summary of the pain in all the individual joints, which may fluctuate in their symptoms. This could potentially cause the increased complaints of one joint to cancel out the improvement of another joint when asking about pain in the entire hand. Furthermore, there is a difference in studied disease stage; both the knee and hip studies were performed on patients with early OA, whereas the current study did not specifically select early hand OA patients. The progression of symptoms may differ between disease stages. This may indicate that development of pain in hand OA occurs more slowly or in a different stage of the disease than was captured in this study. However, the finding that average pain levels remain stable overtime can be of great use in informing patients with hand OA, as they often expect the disease to continually worsen over time, whereas our results indicate that symptoms remain stable on average. Our findings can thus be used to reassure patients that the symptoms need not necessarily progress.

### Association of changes in hand pain with BMI, employment, and mental well-being over four years in patients with hand osteoarthritis [^1147z9xB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Perhaps even more clinically relevant for the patient is the acceptability of a given level of pain. The limit of acceptability for a symptom can be defined with the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS). The PASS describes the highest level of symptoms at which patients regard the symptom as acceptable, should it remain at that level for the rest of their life. Little is known regarding determinants of reaching a PASS for pain in hand OA, with a previous study showing that patients with worse pain and function scores at baseline, as well as more painful joints at baseline, were less likely to reach PASS after six years.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the change in hand pain on the mid‐term for individual patients, and, after four years, to characterize the patients with improving or deteriorating pain and to investigate which patients are likely to achieve a good clinical outcome. We aimed to identify potential modifiable risk factors, to support the move toward personalized medicine, and to enable optimal patient inclusion in clinical trials.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^114Q4RMC]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis guideline — introduction describes that osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 302 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability among older adults, with the knees, hips, and hands the most commonly affected appendicular joints. OA is characterized by whole-joint pathology including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of normal joint function. Patients with OA are likely to be treated with a number of different pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, often in combination, and while some principles apply to all patients, some recommendations are specific to particular joints such as the hip, knee, patellofemoral joint, and first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), or to particular patient populations such as those with erosive OA.

### Health-related quality of life in patients with conditions affecting the hand: meta-analysis [^116ddiHM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA reporting guidelineand was registered in PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42021226098). The PRISMA checklist is available as Supplementary material. The design and conduct of this systematic review followed contemporary practical guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were included if they reported an original utility value for a specified health state experienced by adult patients (aged greater than or equal to 18 years) with conditions affecting the hand and/or wrist (irrespective of primary pathology, intervention status, or type of intervention). Health states were defined as perceivable descriptions comprising pathology, condition severity (where appropriate), intervention status, and the presence of complications (for example, moderate CTS complicated by complex regional pain syndrome after open decompression). Systemic conditions with secondary effects on the hand (such as scleroderma) were excluded. Studies that reported unfeasible utility values (that is values greater than 1) were also excluded.

Search strategy and study selection

Five databases were searched from inception until April 2023 (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)). No limitations were placed on publication date, language, or country of origin. References of included studies were hand searched to identify further potentially eligible articles.

A bespoke search strategy was devised in conjunction with a search strategist. The search comprised index and free-text terms relevant to the following key concepts: hand/wrist/fingers, quality of life, QALYs, and HSUVs. Detailed search terms are provided in Table S3.

All identified articles underwent title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review using the Covidence review management platform. Two reviewers performed abstract screening and full-text review in duplicate; conflicts were resolved through consultation with a third reviewer.

### Applying evidence to inform carpal tunnel syndrome care [^114qMfRZ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common problems treated by hand surgeons. As our understanding of the condition has improved and focus on quality and evidence-based care has evolved, management of CTS has shifted as well. Although for many patients the diagnosis and treatment plan are relatively straightforward, understanding how to decide what diagnostics are appropriate, how to avoid complications especially in high-risk patients, and even which surgical option to offer remains a challenge. As CTS research efforts broaden and available evidence grows, understanding the different research findings in order to implement the evidence into practice is critical for all surgeons. In this article, we approach commonly encountered challenges in CTS management and take a methodological viewpoint to guide evidence-based practice.

### Factors associated with concerns the day after office hand surgery [^112pjhkL]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pain after minor hand surgery can be misinterpreted as a problem. The sense that something may be wrong intensifies the pain. Some surgeons anticipate these feelings and call patients the evening or day after surgery to guide them through the recovery process. A study of routine, next day, postoperative phone calls can help determine the frequency of concerns and associated factors. We asked: 1) What factors are associated with concern the day after office hand surgery? 2) What factors are associated with pain intensity, satisfaction with care, and patient's perceived recovery trajectory the day after office hand surgery?

Methods

In a cross-sectional study, 82 patients who had office hand and upper extremity surgery completed a survey recording age, gender, insurance, income level, measures of symptoms of depression and anxiety, a measure of catastrophic thinking regarding pain, 10-point ordinal ratings of pain intensity and satisfaction with care, whether the patient was concerned about their hand (yes or no) and whether they felt their recovery was on track (yes or no).

Results

Ten patients (12%) were concerned about their hand. In bivariate analysis, concern the day after surgery was associated with greater catastrophic thinking and male gender. Greater pain intensity was associated with greater catastrophic thinking. There was insufficient variation in satisfaction or a sense that recovery was on track for a meaningful analysis.

Conclusions

The finding that concerns were common the day after minor office hand surgery supports the practice of contacting patients for support and helping to reorient unhelpful catastrophic thoughts.

### Diagnosis and outcomes of 225 consecutive cases of complex regional pain syndrome of the hand [^111yNzXC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The lack of specific tests and potential diagnostic inaccuracy may be behind the stunning figures of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) cases. The author tested the hypothesis that patients diagnosed with CRPS at referral could be assigned to recognized conditions and treated accordingly.

Methods

From January of 2018 to April of 2021, 225 consecutive patients attended the author's office having been diagnosed with and treated for CRPS for an average of 16 ± 26 months. There were 180 women and 45 men; no patient was excluded.

Results

All patients could be allocated in named conditions: 79 had a wrong diagnosis; seven had a true causalgia; 16 were dystonic-psychogenic hands; 20 presented a flare reaction; and 90 had an "irritative" carpal tunnel syndrome. The remaining 13 patients had a miscellany of symptoms within a substandard management setting. Surgery was offered to 175 with a correctable cause; 50 (20 of whom had a tangible cause responsible for their pain) declined, and their outcome is unknown. The remaining 125 were operated on and tracked for an average of 20 ± 9 months. In the operated group, pain dropped 7.5 ± 2.2 points (P < 0.0001) on a numerical rating scale of 0 to 10. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire scores fell from 80 to 16 (P < 0.0001). Patients who were operated on rated their satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10 as 8.9 ± 1.9.

Conclusions

Unlike with CRPS, all patients in this series had a true, diagnosable condition explaining their clinical picture. Most patients who agreed to be operated on had a favorable outcome.

### The emergent evaluation and treatment of hand and wrist injuries [^113RK5J8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The anatomy of the hand is complex, which allows for the dexterity, strength, and adaptability of the most functional aspect of the musculoskeletal system. The evaluation and management of injuries to this area can be time consuming and pose a significant medicolegal risk to the emergency physician. Improperly diagnosed and managed injuries can lead to chronic pain, inability to perform activities of daily living, and even seemingly minor injuries can lead to missed work causing a significant cost to the individual and society. The purpose of this article is to review injuries to the hand and wrist and discuss diagnostic studies and treatment plans that the emergency physician can use to treat patients effectively and minimize their exposure to risk.

### Exercise for hand osteoarthritis [^116x6GCD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease that may lead to pain, stiffness and problems in performing hand-related activities of daily living. Currently, no cure for OA is known, and non-pharmacological modalities are recommended as first-line care. A positive effect of exercise in hip and knee OA has been documented, but the effect of exercise on hand OA remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of exercise compared with other interventions, including placebo or no intervention, in people with hand OA. Main outcomes are hand pain and hand function.

Search Methods

We searched six electronic databases up until September 2015.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing therapeutic exercise versus no exercise or comparing different exercise programmes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes consisted of both continuous (hand pain, physical function, finger joint stiffness and quality of life) and dichotomous outcomes (proportions of adverse events and withdrawals).

Main Results

We included seven studies in the review. Most studies were free from selection and reporting bias, but one study was available only as a congress abstract. It was not possible to blind participants to treatment allocation, and although most studies reported blinded outcome assessors, some outcomes (pain, function, stiffness and quality of life) were self-reported. The results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias owing to unblinded participants and self-reported outcomes. Two studies with high drop-out rates may be vulnerable to attrition bias. We downgraded the overall quality of the body of evidence to low owing to potential detection bias (lack of blinding of participants on self-reported outcomes) and imprecision (studies were few, the number of participants was limited and confidence intervals were wide for the outcomes pain, function and joint stiffness). For quality of life, adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, we further downgraded the overall quality of the body of evidence to very low because studies were very few and confidence intervals were very wide. Low-quality evidence from five trials (381 participants) indicated that exercise reduced hand pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.47 to -0.07) post intervention. The absolute reduction in pain for the exercise group, compared with the control group, was 5% (1% to 9%) on a 0 to 10 point scale. Pain was estimated to be 3.9 points on this scale (0 = no pain) in the control group, and exercise reduced pain by 0.5 points (95% CI 0.1 to 0.9; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 9). Four studies (369 participants) indicated that exercise improved hand function (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.02) post intervention. The absolute improvement in function noted in the exercise group, compared with the control group, was 6% (0.4% worsening to 13% improvement). Function was estimated at 14.5 points on a 0 to 36 point scale (0 = no physical disability) in the control group, and exercise improved function by 2.2 points (95% CI -0.2 to 4.6; NNTB 9). One study (113 participants) evaluated quality of life, and the effect of exercise on quality of life is currently uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.30, 95% CI -3.72 to 4.32). The absolute improvement in quality of life for the exercise group, compared with the control group, was 0.3% (4% worsening to 4% improvement). Quality of life was 50.4 points on a 0 to 100 point scale (100 = maximum quality of life) in the control group, and the mean score in the exercise group was 0.3 points higher (3.5 points lower to 4.1 points higher). Four studies (369 participants) indicated that exercise reduced finger joint stiffness (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.15) post intervention. The absolute reduction in finger joint stiffness for the exercise group, compared with the control group, was 7% (3% to 10%). Finger joint stiffness was estimated at 4.5 points on a 0 to 10 point scale (0 = no stiffness) in the control group, and exercise improved stiffness by 0.7 points (95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; NNTB 7). Three studies reported intervention-related adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. The few reported adverse events consisted of increased finger joint inflammation and hand pain. Low-quality evidence from the three studies showed an increased likelihood of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 4.55, 95% CI 0.53 to 39.31) and of withdrawals due to adverse events in the exercise group compared with the control group (RR 2.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 27.18), but the effect is uncertain and further research may change the estimates. Included studies did not measure radiographic joint structure changes. Two studies provided six-month follow-up data (220 participants), and one (102 participants) provided 12-month follow-up data. The positive effect of exercise on pain, function and joint stiffness was not sustained at medium- and long-term follow-up. The exercise intervention varied largely in terms of dosage, content and number of supervised sessions. Participants were instructed to exercise two to three times a week in four studies, daily in two studies and three to four times daily in another study. Exercise interventions in all seven studies aimed to improve muscle strength and joint stability or function, but the numbers and types of exercises varied largely across studies. Four studies reported adherence to the exercise programme; in three studies, this was self-reported. Self-reported adherence to the recommended frequency of exercise sessions ranged between 78% and 94%. In the fourth study, 67% fulfilled at least 16 of the 18 scheduled exercise sessions.

Authors' Conclusions

When we pooled results from five studies, we found low-quality evidence showing small beneficial effects of exercise on hand pain, function and finger joint stiffness. Estimated effect sizes were small, and whether they represent a clinically important change may be debated. One study reported quality of life, and the effect is uncertain. Three studies reported on adverse events, which were very few and were not severe.

### Patterns of multisite pain and associations with risk factors [^116NkYPK]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Optimal case definition for multisite pain depends on its practical utility in distinguishing illness with causes, prognosis, or response to treatment that differs importantly from that of pain occurring in other patterns. Our analysis supports the classification of pain at multiple anatomical sites according to the number of sites affected. Although there was a threshold number of painful sites, above which prevalence was clearly higher than would have been expected by chance coincidence, we did not identify a threshold number of affected sites above which associations with risk factors were qualitatively different. Rather, associations became progressively stronger, the larger the number of sites with pain. Nevertheless, risk estimates for several variables were much larger in relation to extensive than limited pain. This suggests that in future research on pain at specific sites such as the back and wrist/hand, there may be value in distinguishing cases with localised pain from those in which pain is more extensive.

### Management of acute postoperative pain in hand surgery: a systematic review [^115kaf2z]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review to guide hand surgeons in an evidenced-based approach in managing postoperative pain.

Methods

We performed a literature review for primary research articles on management of postoperative pain in hand surgery patients using Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE; PubMed), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and the Cochrane Collaboration Library. Inclusion criteria were primary journal articles examining treatment of acute postoperative pain based on any modality. Data related to pain assessment, postoperative recovery, and total postoperative analgesic consumption were extracted.

Results

A total of 903 publications were reviewed; 184 publications underwent abstract review. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 primary articles were selected for inclusion in this review. Data were noted to be heterogeneous and findings were compiled. Results were divided into groups evaluating postoperative pain medications or pain infusion catheters.

Conclusions

Although this review did not demonstrate a best practices model for postoperative pain management, it provides evidence for alternative medications and treatment strategies. The evidence available suggests that postoperative pain control should begin before surgery and that combining multiple strategies for pain treatment is beneficial. Given the increasing attention paid to narcotic prescriptions and the potential for abuse, surgeons should adopt evidence-based pain management practices. We provide an example algorithm for pain treatment in hand surgery based on available data and the authors' experience.

### Severe hand pain as an extracardiac manifestation of transthyretin amyloidosis [^113gn4zZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Transthyretin amyloidosis is a multisystemic disease caused by the aggregation of amyloid fibrils, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in the presence of cardiac involvement. Patients often experience vague symptoms that make amyloidosis difficult to diagnose. Differential diagnosis for hand pain in a patient with systemic amyloidosis is broad. We present a patient with severe hand cramping and inability to perform activities of daily living. This preceded a new diagnosis of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. The patient was a poor responder to systemic corticosteroids, anti-inflammatories and anticonvulsant therapy. Her unique presentation gives insight into a rare but debilitating disorder and the potential link between amyloidosis and other disease processes.

### Pediatric ulnar-sided wrist pain: a review of the current literature [^115eeKuP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients presenting with ulnar-sided wrist pain can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to physicians because there are several pathologies with similar signs and symptoms. In comparison with adult patients, other etiologies must be considered in the pediatric patient, given the skeletal immaturity and potential for known or unrecognized syndromes. In addition, these patients may not be able to articulate their symptoms as clearly as an adult patient, further stressing the importance of obtaining a pertinent history and performing a focused physical examination. Having a thorough understanding of the anatomy, the varying pathologies, and the indications for surgical and nonsurgical management will assist in improved patient outcomes.

### A 40-year-old woman with pain in the chest, hands, and feet [^11475MKg]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 40-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain and pain in the joints of her hands and feet. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — best-practice documentation advises that in the course of the examination and episode of care, clinicians should document results of the following questions, tests, and measures; upon completion of the clinical patient/client data, clinicians should differentiate CTS from other nerve injuries and then assess the CTS severity to determine if an immediate surgical referral is warranted. Patients may require electrodiagnostic studies when the clinical exam is inconclusive, and when assessing effectiveness of nonsurgical management, results should be documented again at discharge or at other follow-up point. Documentation of standard elements supports standardization for quality improvement in clinical care and research.

### Development of classification criteria for hand osteoarthritis: comparative analyses of persons with and without hand osteoarthritis [^115RSzgv]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design

We collected data on patients with hand complaints from Europe and North America. Patients were recruited from primary (2 centres) and secondary/tertiary care (10 centres). Physicians recruited patients with hand complaints, which could be due to either hand OA (ranging from mild to severe) or inflammatory and non-inflammatory non-traumatic conditions. Strict numbers of patients within each category were not provided. Patients with unclear causes of their hand complaints were also included. The treating physician made the diagnosis. We aimed for approximately 200 patients in our data set, a number targeted in previous classification criteria efforts. The data collection was funded by the EULAR.

Hand questionnaires

All patients responded to questions about hand complaints, including symptom duration and duration of morning stiffness in fingers and thumb base joints. On four separate hand diagrams, they marked the hand joints (bilateral 2nd–5th distal interphalangeal (DIP), 1st–5th proximal interphalangeal (PIP), 1st–5th metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and thumb base) that had been painful and stiff during the last 48 hours and on most days the previous 6 weeks. On a whole-body homunculus, they marked the joints (bilateral shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles and toes) and spine (neck, upper, middle and lower back) that had been painful on most days the previous 6 weeks. All toes in one foot were regarded as one entity. Surgically modified joints were marked on the same diagram. They completed the Australian/Canadian hand index pain (range 0–20), stiffness (range 0–4) and function subscales (range 0–36) and the Functional Index of Hand OA (range 0–30).

The patients self-reported painful locking of fingers, numbness and tingling in the hands, current/past psoriasis, current/past inflammatory bowel disease, and family history of OA, bony swellings/nodes and psoriasis in first-degree relatives.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^114AaaaR]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Estimates suggest that around 1 in 10 people develop carpal tunnel syndrome at some point. The condition comprises potentially disabling sensory and/or motor symptoms in the hand, caused by compression of the median nerve, and carries considerable implications for employment and healthcare costs. Current standard treatment options are splinting, local corticosteroid injections and surgery, and there are a range of other suggested treatments. Here we review how best to manage patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Association of changes in hand pain with BMI, employment, and mental well-being over four years in patients with hand osteoarthritis [^112EzBjJ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

No other associations between change in pain or pain outcome and disease characteristics (Kellgren‐Lawrence score, presence of erosions, synovitis, and symptom duration) were found after adjustment. This indicates that a cross‐sectional association with pain, which is known to exist for erosive disease, does not necessarily indicate an association with change in pain, as well. The discordance between radiographic damage and pain in hand OA has been described previously, and is again confirmed by our study. Regarding symptom duration, no association was expected given the lack of change in pain over time on the group level. Change in synovitis measured on MRI was previously shown to be associated with change in pain on the joint level. Previous ultrasonography studies have also shown that the association between synovitis and pain is stronger on the joint level than on the patient level. In the current study, we found no effect between synovitis and pain on the patient level, indicating the effect may have been diluted because of the large number of joints contributing to the pain on patient level. This is exacerbated by the fact that synovitis was only scored in eight joints (the PIP and DIP joints of the right hand), which is a limitation in our study.

We used data from a large cohort, consisting of consecutively referred patients with hand OA presenting at the rheumatology outpatient clinic, only excluding patients with secondary OA or hand symptoms due to other causes. This sample is therefore expected to be representative of patients with hand OA seeking care from a rheumatologist.

There were a few limitations to our study in addition to the ones mentioned previously. Patients recruited from a secondary or tertiary center may be only partly generalizable to the larger hand OA population because not all patients with hand OA will visit a rheumatologist. Another limitation is that this study investigated the progression of hand OA pain in a cohort of patients with hand OA and could have been affected by collider stratification bias or selective loss to follow‐up, most likely biasing found effects toward the null. The real effects would then be larger than what was found in this study. As stated previously, this study could also suffer from residual confounding due to unmeasured variables, skewing the results in either direction. As such, replication and validation of these results is essential. We did not have data on all potential factors of interest, such as repeated hand movements. This is also a limitation of the current study that should be complemented in future studies.

### Hand osteoarthritis-nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments [^111iEdX3]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disease with a high clinical burden. The number of clinical trials in hand OA is limited and, therefore, recommendations for the management of hand OA are mostly expert-based instead of evidence-based, and medication is often prescribed off-label. However, in the past 5 years, this 'forgotten' disease has attracted increasing attention and a number of high-quality clinical trials have now been performed, or are ongoing. The results from studies conducted to assess nonpharmacological treatment modalities indicate that educating patients about self-management, the provision of assistive devices and the application of splints for thumb base OA, are effective for pain and disability. For pharmacological management, more high-quality trials are needed, although evidence is available for short-term symptom alleviation of pain by topical and oral NSAIDs. The role of anti-inflammatory medication, such as corticosteroids and biologic agents, is controversial, and the same holds true for the efficacy of symptomatic slow acting drugs for OA. Disease modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) for hand OA are currently not available. The results from the ongoing pharmacological trials will increase our knowledge for evidence-based management of hand OA in the near future.

### Hand osteoarthritis phenotypes based on a biopsychosocial approach, and their associations with cross-sectional and longitudinal pain [^111pwewA]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain in OA is a complex phenomenon, and has significant impact on quality of life. Traditionally, OA pain was thought to originate from structural joint damage and/or inflammation. However, there is a discordance between the burden of symptoms and joint pathology. – The pain in hand osteoarthritis (OA) is both heterogeneous and multifactorial, and can involve biological, psychological and social aspects extending beyond OA joint pathology. Pain in people with OA are cross-sectionally related to factors representing the biological domain such as pain sensitization, overweight/obesity and comorbidities, factors of the social domain such as emotional and cognitive factors, and factors reflecting the social domain like socioeconomical status. – Currently, we have limited knowledge about the pain experience in people with hand OA in the context of a biopsychosocial framework.

Considering the multifactorial and heterogenous nature of OA, the hand OA pain experience may be due to subtypes or possible phenotypes determined by a co-occurrence of factors across multiple domains. A phenotype has been defined as "Any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiologic properties, or behavior, without any implication of a molecular mechanism or pathway". There is a lack of studies focused on investigating phenotypes of OA in hands among other less studied joints. In terms of hand OA, thumb base OA vs. interphalangeal OA and non-erosive vs. erosive hand OA have been suggested as different phenotypes. Possible hand OA phenotypes based on factors beyond joint pathology have not previously been explored. Therefore, we aimed to identify possible hand OA phenotypes using the biopsychosocial model of pain as a framework and explore their associations with pain severity and change in pain during a 3,5-year-follow-up.

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^113R6xbL]. APA (2024). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis hand pain — other treatments reviewed (insufficient evidence) indicates there is insufficient evidence for the panel to recommend one intervention over the other intervention or vice versa for exercise vs. usual care and multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary rehabilitation. Based on the literature reviewed that met the IOM standards, there was insufficient evidence for the panel to be able to recommend for or against the listed interventions; patients with chronic hand pain may benefit from being referred to a hand specialist as therapy from a hand specialist can be useful by introducing alternative mechanisms for performing activities of daily living. The panel was unable to form conclusions whether to recommend for or against multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary rehabilitation as the study included within the systematic review did not meet the definition for multidisciplinary rehabilitation, noting that the study reported in Skelly and colleagues (2020) did not follow the usual pattern of care offered in most multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs; therefore, no conclusions could be drawn from this study. The panel recommends that decisions be based on shared decision making with the patient and consideration of available resources.

### Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Controversies in the diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^113EkxN3]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder responsible for considerable patient suffering and cost to health services. Despite extensive research, controversies still exist with regards to best practice in diagnosis, treatment, and service provision. Current best practise would support the use of history, examination and electro-diagnostic studies. The role for ultrasound scanning in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is yet to be proven. It appears magnetic resonance image scanning has a role where a rare cause for carpal tunnel syndrome may be suspected and also in the detailed reconstruction of the anatomy to aid endoscopic procedures. Treatment options can be surgical or non-surgical and patient choice will dictate the decision. For non-surgical interventions many options have been trialled but until now only steroid use, acupuncture, and splinting have shown discernable benefits. Open surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel appears to be more simple and cost-effective than minimally invasive interventions. For those patients who reject surgery, splinting, acupuncture, and steroid injection can play a role. Recent work looking at different service delivery options has shown some positive results in terms of decreasing patient waiting time for definitive treatment. However, no formal cost-effectiveness analysis has been published and concerns exist about the impact of a stream-lined service on surgical training. In this review, we look at the different diagnostic and treatment options for managing carpal tunnel syndrome. We then consider the different service delivery options and finally the cost-effectiveness evidence.

### Hand osteoarthritis – an increasing need for treatment and rehabilitation [^112LSHY4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes advances in our knowledge on the clinical burden of hand osteoarthritis, its relation to radiographic signs of osteoarthritis and potential targets for therapy. Treatments and trial methodology for hand osteoarthritis are critically reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that there is an association between radiographic hand osteoarthritis and hand pain, and that symptomatic hand osteoarthritis leads to substantial disability. Some risk factors for hand osteoarthritis have been described but the development of hand osteoarthritis is still unclear. Unfortunately, pharmacological therapies for hand osteoarthritis are lacking and have been investigated little. Only a few studies on other treatment modalities are available. Surgical treatments are not covered in this review.

Summary

Advances have been made in our understanding of symptomatic hand osteoarthritis. Potential targets for therapy are recognized. The challenge for the coming years is to conduct clinical trials of high quality in hand osteoarthritis.

### Can patients forecast their postoperative disability and pain? [^115eiHYY]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Forecasting is a construct in which experiences and beliefs inform a projection of future outcomes. Current efforts to predict postoperative patient-reported outcome measures such as risk-stratifying models, focus on studying patient, surgeon, or facility variables without considering the mindset of the patient. There is no evidence assessing the association of a patient's forecasted postoperative disability with realized postoperative disability. Patient-forecasted disability could potentially be used as a tool to predict postoperative disability.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Do patient-forecasted disability and pain correlate with patient-realized disability and pain after hand surgery? (2) What other factors are associated with patient ability to forecast disability and pain?

Methods

We completed a prospective, longitudinal study to assess the association between forecasted and realized postoperative pain and disability as a predictive tool. One hundred eighteen patients of one hand/upper extremity surgeon were recruited from November 2016 to February 2018. Inclusion criteria for the study were patients undergoing hand or upper extremity surgery, older than 18 years of age, and English fluency and literacy. We enrolled 118 patients; 32 patients (27%) dropped out as a result of incomplete postoperative questionnaires. The total number of patients eligible was not tracked. Eighty-six patients completed the preoperative and postoperative questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included patients unable to give informed consent, children, patients with dementia, and nonEnglish speakers. Before surgery, patients completed a questionnaire that asked them to forecast their upper extremity disability (DASH [the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand] [QuickDASH]) and pain VAS (pain from 0 to 10) for 2 weeks after their procedure. The questionnaire also queried the following psychologic factors as explanatory variables, in addition to other demographic and socioeconomic variables: the General Self Efficacy Scale, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale. At the 2-week followup appointment, patients completed the QuickDASH and pain VAS to assess their realized disability and pain scores. Bivariate analysis was used to test the association of forecasted and realized disability and pain reporting Pearson correlation coefficients. Unpaired t-tests were performed to test the association of demographic variables (for example, men vs women) and the association of forecasted and realized disability and pain levels. One-way analysis of variance was used for variables with multiple groups (for example, annual salary and ethnicity). All p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Forecasted postoperative disability was moderately correlated with realized postoperative disability (r = 0.59; p < 0.001). Forecasted pain was weakly correlated with realized postoperative pain (r = 0.28; p = 0.011). A total of 47% of patients (n = 40) were able to predict their disability score within the MCID of their realized disability score. Symptoms of depression also correlated with increased realized postoperative disability (r = 0.37; p < 0.001) and increased realized postoperative pain (r = 0.42; p < 0.001). Catastrophic thinking was correlated with increased realized postoperative pain (r = 0.31; p = 0.004). Patients with symptoms of depression realized greater pain postoperatively than what they forecasted preoperatively (r = -0.24; p = 0.028), but there was no association between symptoms of depression and patients' ability to forecast disability (r = 0.2; p = 0.058). Patient age was associated with a patient's ability to forecast disability (r = .27; p = 0.011). Catastrophic thinking, self-efficacy, and number of prior surgical procedures were not associated with a patient's ability to forecast their postoperative disability or pain.

Conclusions

Patients undergoing hand surgery can moderately forecast their postoperative disability. Surgeons can use forecasted disability to identify patients who may experience greater disability compared with benchmarks, for example, forecast and experience high QuickDASH scores after surgery, and inform preoperative discussions and interventions focused on expectation management, resilience, and mindset.

### Why do people with complex regional pain syndrome take longer to recognize their affected hand? [^1142ZVuP]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

People with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) take longer to recognize the laterality of a pictured hand when it coincides with their affected hand. The author explored two aspects of this phenomenon: whether the duration of symptoms relates to the extent of the delay and whether guarding-type mechanisms are involved.

Methods

Eighteen patients with CRPS type 1 of the wrist and 18 matched control subjects performed a hand laterality recognition task. McGill pain questionnaire, Neuropathic Pain Scale, and response time (RT) to recognize hand laterality were analyzed. Regressions related 1) mean RT for patients to the duration of symptoms and to pain intensity; and 2) mean RT for each picture to the predicted pain on executing that movement as judged by the patient, and to the awkwardness of the movement that would be required.

Results

For patients, the duration of symptoms correlated with mean RT (Spearman rho = 0.44; p = 0.02). Predicted pain rating explained 45% of the variance in RT for each picture for each patient (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results suggest that in patients with complex regional pain syndrome type 1, delayed recognition of hand laterality is related to the duration of symptoms and to the pain that would be evoked by executing the movement. The former is consistent with chronic pain and disuse and may involve reorganization of the cortical correlate of body schema. The latter is consistent with a guarding-type response that probably occurs upstream of the motor cortex at a motor planning level.

Carpal tunnel syndrome clinical practice guidelines — levels of evidence outline study-design hierarchies across intervention/prevention, prognosis, diagnosis/diagnostic accuracy, prevalence, and exam/outcomes. Level I includes systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and diagnostic studies, as indicated by "Systematic review of high-quality RCTs" and "Systematic review of high-quality diagnostic studies". Level II for interventions encompasses cohort and observational designs including "High-quality cohort study Outcomes study or ecological study Lower-quality RCT". Level III includes "Systematic reviews of case-control studies", and Level IV lists "Lower-quality cross-sectional study", while Level V is expert opinion across domains. Quality definitions specify thresholds and criteria: "High quality includes RCTs with greater than 80% follow-up, blinding, and appropriate randomization procedures", and "High-quality cohort study includes greater than 80% follow-up"; a "High-quality diagnostic study includes consistently applied reference standard and blinding", and a "High-quality prevalence study is a cross-sectional study that uses a local and current random sample or censuses". The table cautions that "less than 80% follow-up may add bias and threats to validity".

### Implementing core NICE guidelines for osteoarthritis in primary care with a model consultation (MOSAICS): a cluster randomised controlled trial [^115Jzvqa]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and disability in older adults: musculoskeletal pain in adults aged 45 years and over is the number one cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Routine OA management in UK general practice has been found to lack adherence to guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), updated in 2014, especially for 'core' self-management approaches such as written information, exercise and weight loss. Implementation of the NICE recommendations has not yet been evaluated in UK general practice.

Healthcare professionals often frame consultations in terms (such as 'wear and tear') thought to reassure patients or be patient-friendly which may have a negative impact. Patients and general practitioners (GPs) want more advice and support on understanding OA and the use of non-pharmacological approaches. Patient perceived health service needs have also been found to align with clinical guideline recommendations.

The MOSAICS (Managing OSteoArthritis In ConsultationS) study was a cluster-randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of a complex intervention – a model OA consultation (MOAC) – on clinical outcomes, and on the uptake of core NICE OA core recommendations in participants aged ≥ 45 years consulting their GP with peripheral joint pain (hand, hip, knee, foot).

### Complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity [^112mLEV3]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of complex regional pain syndrome is often challenging. Early diagnosis and intervention improve outcomes in most patients; however, some patients will progress regardless of intervention. Multidisciplinary management facilitates care in complex cases. The onset of signs and symptoms may be obvious or insidious; temporal delay is a frequent occurrence. Difficulty sleeping, pain unresponsive to narcotics, swelling, stiffness, and hypersensitivity are harbingers of onset. Multimodal treatment with hand therapy, sympatholytic drugs, and stress loading may be augmented with anesthesia blocks. If the dystrophic symptoms are controllable by medications and a nociceptive focus or nerve derangement is correctable, surgery is an appropriate alternative. Chronic sequelae of contracture may also be addressed surgically in patients with controllable sympathetically maintained pain.

### Ideas about pain, a historical view [^111Ajd9y]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

The expression 'painful' can be used to describe both an embarrassing moment and a cut on the finger. An explanation for this dichotomy can be found in the convoluted history of ideas about pain. Whether pain is an independent sensation and the product of dedicated neural mechanisms continues to be a topic of debate. This overview concentrates on the issue of specificity together with other notable information regarding pain that has emerged since 1800.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^115zwSgJ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome clinical practice guidelines — Component 2: Evaluation — triage after examination states that a patient/client is appropriate for therapy and best evidence based intervention is provided when examination data show findings consistent with mild to moderate CTS and the patient/client agrees with a trial of nonsurgical management, or when examination data show findings consistent with severe CTS and (1) the patient/client has seen a surgeon who decided the individual is not a surgical candidate due to comorbidities; (2) the patient/client is awaiting surgery; or (3) the patient/client has refused surgery after counseling on the negative effects of long-standing nerve compression. The patient/client may benefit from referral to a physician when examination data suggest any severity of CTS with concurrent signs and symptoms of another condition that warrant further medical testing, with CTS treatment allowed if there are no contraindications, or when examination data suggest severe CTS and the patient/client chooses a trial of nonsurgical intervention while awaiting a physician visit. A patient is not appropriate for therapy and requires referral to a physician when examination data reveal a suspected neuromuscular diagnosis other than CTS that is beyond the scope of physical therapy treatment.

### Hand to hand [^114xQKq9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Examination of the hands has the potential to transform the encounter between physician and patient. Taking the hands conveys a sense of warmth and connectedness and is a means to communicate the physician's mindfulness. The hands can focus the examination on the individual patient as a complete human being, and not merely a disease or a collection of symptoms. The hands provide readily accessible information that may not be available through other evaluations, and they offer clues to a patient's physical and mental health. Commonplace observations, such as those revealed in the hands, can unravel medical mysteries and provide profound clinical insights.

Modern anesthetic agents have allowed for the rapid expansion of ambulatory surgery, particularly in hand surgery. The choice between general anesthesia, peripheral regional blocks, regional intravenous anesthesia (Bier block), local block with sedation, and the recently popularized wide-awake hand surgery depends on several variables, including the type and duration of the procedure and patient characteristics, coexisting conditions, location, and expected length of the procedure. This article discusses the various perioperative and postoperative analgesic options to optimize the hand surgical patients' experience.

### Pharmacological pain management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative literature review [^116DG4WL]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune-mediated condition, characterised by persistent synovial inflammation (particularly of the hand and feet small joints, although any synovial joint can be affected). Raised inflammatory markers and autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies) are common. Contemporary RA management focuses on treat-to-target strategies. These involve measuring disease activity regularly — often using the Disease Activity Score for 28-Joint Counts (DAS28), which represents a composite score combining information on swollen and tender joint counts, the patient global assessment of disease activity, and inflammatory markers — and increasing treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) until the "target" of remission or low disease activity is achieved. The high prevalence of RA (which affects approximately 0.8% of adults in England, and 17.6 million people globally, and is rising in both contexts) and far-reaching personal and economic impacts (including increased disability and unemployment) mean that optimising the care patients with RA receive is a clinical priority.

### Painful hand and moving finger treated by wearing a glove [^113b72nj]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The authors report a patient with unilateral painful hand and moving finger in whom tactile stimulation interrupted both the movement and the pain. This effect suggests a gating mechanism at a segmental level. The difference between afferent and efferent pathway levels and the delay of several months between trauma and occurrence of symptoms support a central mechanism, most probably involving sensorimotor reorganization at a segmental level.

RESULTS

We recruited 224 patients, of whom 70 (31.3%) and 128 (57.1%) were in the control and hand OA groups, respectively. We excluded 26 (11.6%) patients from analyses since it was unclear whether their complaints were due to hand OA or not. Most controls (n = 65, 92.9%) and patients with hand OA (n = 123, 96.1%) were recruited from secondary/tertiary care (n = 8 and n = 10 different centers, respectively). The remaining controls and patients with hand OA were recruited from two primary care centres. The hand OA group was older and included more women than the controls. In both groups, the majority had experienced symptoms in their finger joints for more than 6 months. Fewer patients had symptoms in their thumb base (table 1). Online supplementary tables 1–3 provide detailed information about other explanatory variables, including the number of missing variables. Patients in the control group demonstrated a wide range of RMDs (table 2).

### Association of changes in hand pain with BMI, employment, and mental well-being over four years in patients with hand osteoarthritis [^116qwxnV]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to investigate pain development and good clinical pain outcomes in patients with hand OA. We observed 356 patients with hand OA over four years and found that 137 patients experienced an improvement in pain, 106 patients experienced a deterioration, and 113 patients experienced a stable level of pain. The changes over four years were consistent with annual changes. An improvement in pain after four years (38% of patients) was seen most in patients who, at baseline, had a better hand function, fewer mental problems, a paid job, and attributed fewer negative emotions and consequences to the disease than other patients. A deterioration in pain over four years was seen in 30% of patients, and this was most prevalent in patients with a higher BMI and a job at baseline, who used comforting cognitions as a coping strategy and who perceived they understood the disease better. A good clinical outcome, defined as being at PASS after four years, was seen in 49% of patients, a slight increase from 44% at baseline. Being at PASS at baseline was strongly associated with being at PASS at year 4. Furthermore, patients with better hand function and fewer painful joints on palpation and who attributed less symptoms to their hand OA at baseline were more likely to be at PASS at year 4.

Previously, we found that pain remained stable on a group level in patients with hand OA over four years. This stable group level may mask a mixture of patients experiencing a deterioration or an improvement. This was confirmed by our findings reported here. Part of the change in pain over time can be explained by regression to the mean. Investigation of the annual changes showed that changes over four years were consistent with annual changes, as well. Participants experiencing a deterioration over four years also experienced a deterioration in pain per year more often than patients in the stable and improvement groups. This makes it unlikely that the changes seen in this study are solely due to regression to the mean or chance. A previous study with six years' follow‐up reported more participants experiencing deterioration in pain (40%) than improvement (26%). There may be a number of explanations: the difference in average baseline pain between the studies (6.7 in the previous study vs 9.1 in the current study), differences in type of patients with OA studied (hand OA vs polyarticular familiar hand OA), or the difference in follow‐up duration (four vs six years).

### Narcotic-free, over-the-counter pain management after wide-awake hand surgery [^111YVxgd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The practice of prescribing opioids for postoperative pain has increased steadily over the past few decades. Hand surgery has not been an exception, and patients have received more opioids than needed. Several studies have challenged the necessity of routine prescription of opioids after a variety of hand surgeries. Current literature suggests that patients undergoing hand surgery consume 10 or fewer doses of analgesics irrespective of what the analgesic is. Opioids and non-narcotic analgesics provide equivalent pain control for soft-tissue hand surgery.

Current hand surgery literature does not describe the efficacy of pain self-management postoperatively. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience with over-the-counter (OTC), narcotic-free, postoperative pain management in a continuous cohort of 81 patients who underwent soft-tissue hand surgery in an office-based setting over a 14-month period.

### Tendon involvement and its association with pain and hand function in patients with osteoarthritis of the hand [^113f64Tj]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we found only very slight agreement on the level of individual patients between clinical and US detection of tendon involvement and no agreement on the level of individual tendons. We further found low sensitivity but higher specificity on the tendon level, but higher sensitivity and a lower specificity on the patient level for clinical examination using sonography as a gold standard. Considering that the clinical assessment of tendons is not standardized and more difficult compared with joint examination, our findings suggest that patients with tendon involvement might be identified by clinical examination, but accurate assignment to the respective tendon may not always be possible. Furthermore, clinical examination might not differentiate between tendon involvement or other causes for pain. Pain, bony deformation and loss of function, which are known characteristics of hand OA, likely all contribute to the difficulties facing clinical assessment, and prominent joint involvement may 'overshadow' concomitant tendon pathology. Imaging modalities such as US may facilitate this designation and provide an opportunity to treat tendon involvement more specifically.

Limitations of our study include the lack of a standardized clinical examination and that of a gold standard to detect tenosynovitis and/or tendon damage. Our study did not assess clinical tenderness of individual joints separately, which may have allowed a more detailed evaluation of pain. Finally, the M-SACRAH questionnaire is validated to assess overall hand function in hand OA and RA, but not tendon involvement specifically.

In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of tenosynovitis in patients with hand OA. It was associated with the number of osteophytes along the tendon. We found high sensitivity but low specificity of clinical examination for tendon involvement on the level of patients. Physicians treating patients with hand OA should keep the high prevalence of tendon involvement in mind. In case of clinical suspicion, a sonographic examination should be performed. If tenosynovitis or tendon damage is detected, treatment may be tailored accordingly. Whether tendon involvement develops only secondary to biomechanical factors (osteophytes) or whether it can be regarded as an independent inflammatory feature of hand OA should be evaluated in future studies.

### Osteoarthritis [^113S1kXC]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disorder that is increasingly prevalent largely due to aging and obesity, resulting in a major disease burden worldwide. Knowledge about the underlying aetiology has improved, with increased understanding of the role of genetic factors, the microbiome, and existence of different pain mechanisms. However, this knowledge has not yet been translated into new treatment options. New evidence has questioned the efficacy of recommended treatments, such as therapeutic exercise programmes and the focus on weight loss, but managing obesity and maintaining activity remain important for the prevention and management of osteoarthritis. Approaches should consider individual and cultural preferences and resource availability to increase patient and community engagement, and optimise outcomes worldwide. Most of the focus has been on established osteoarthritis where management is primarily directed at relieving symptoms. The search for the much needed effective treatments that improve both symptoms and structure, often referred to as disease-modifying osteoarthritic drugs, is ongoing. Promising data indicate that targeting inflammation is effective in hand osteoarthritis.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^112vLMK9]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis — acetaminophen — is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Effect sizes in clinical trials are very small and meta-analysis has suggested monotherapy may be ineffective, and longer-term treatment is no better than placebo for most individuals. For those with limited pharmacologic options due to intolerance of or contraindications to NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be appropriate for short-term and episodic use, and regular monitoring for hepatotoxicity is required for patients who receive acetaminophen on a regular basis, particularly at the recommended maximum dosage of 3 g daily in divided doses.

### Acute hand pain resulting in spontaneous thenar compartment syndrome [^114cdVKe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Compartment syndrome is a potentially limb-threatening disease process, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and cellular death [1]. The following presentation is believed to be the first reported case of thenar compartment syndrome, which occurred without an identifiable cause. A 67-year-old male presented with 12 h of left-hand pain, located at the base of the thumb and worsened with movement. Firmness of the thenar eminence, along with pallor, poikilothermia, and paresthesias of the first and second digits lead to the increased suspicion for compartment syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed and successfully managed in the operating room. While relatively uncommon, clinicians should consider the diagnosis of compartment syndrome of the hand when patients present with acute hand pain. A missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to severe morbidity, which can profoundly affect patients' functional outcomes and quality of life.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: the role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, because of some similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. The latter may lead to elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand, and emphasizes the key points that assist in the differentiation of the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.

### Development of hand phenotypes and changes in hand pain and problems over time in older people [^114cUpPw]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4. Discussion

This exploratory study has identified 5 phenotypes of hand pain and functional limitations from a population-based sample of older people. Item selection was informed by opinions of older individuals with hand problems. These phenotypes indicate that in general, individuals with functional hand problems are more likely to deteriorate over time, whereas those with hand pain only are more likely to see an improvement in the future. However, once individuals reach the severely affected phenotype (with high probabilities of hand pain and functional limitation), they were less likely to see change over time (stability of > 68% at each transition point). An exploratory analysis of predictors of long-term phenotypes suggests that those in the severely affected phenotype at 6 years were more likely to have baseline widespread bodily pain, nodes, and difficulties in sleeping, after adjusting for baseline hand phenotype membership.

### Comparative effectiveness of different placebos and comparator groups for hand osteoarthritis exploring the impact of contextual factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111AjztP]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the pain relief effects of comparators (placebos and untreated control groups) in hand osteoarthritis trials and the impact of contextual factors.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL from inception to December 26, 2021. We included randomised controlled trials of people with hand osteoarthritis with a placebo or an untreated control group. We assessed the Risk of Bias with Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool version 2. Each comparator was contrasted with a null-arm, imputed as having a zero change from baseline with the same standard deviation as the comparator. We combined the standardised mean differences with a random effects meta-analysis. The contextual factors' effect was explored in meta-regression and stratified models with pain as the dependent variable.

Results

84 trials (7262 participants) were eligible for quantitative synthesis, of which 76 (6462 participants) were eligible for the stratified analyses. Placebos were superior to their matched null-arms in relieving pain with an effect size of -0.51 (95% confidence interval -0.61 to -0.42), while untreated control groups were not. When analysing all comparators, blinded trial designs and low risk of bias were associated with higher pain relief compared to an open-label trial design and some concern or high risk of bias.

Conclusion

The placebo response on pain for people with hand osteoarthritis was increased by appropriate blinding and a lower risk of bias assessment. Placebos were superior to a null-arm, while untreated control groups were not. Results emphasise the importance of using appropriate comparators in clinical trials.

### Tendon disorders of the hand and wrist [^111o3KLG]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The terminology used to describe most common tendon disorders in the hand and wrist suggests that they are inflammatory in nature, although current evidence indicates that mechanical and degenerative factors are more important. Corticosteroid injections provide relief in 60% or more of cases; however, the duration of their effectiveness remains uncertain. Surgical release of the stenotic pulley or sheath is curative in well over 90% of cases; complications of surgery are rare, and relief is long-lasting. Enlightened management of these common problems demands evidence-based guidelines defining indications for surgery that will maximize outcomes and minimize costs.

### Hand surgery in rheumatoid arthritis: state of the art and suggestions for research [^112YZEWF]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of surgery in the clinical management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated hand dysfunction is still a subject of controversy. The efficacy of surgery in RA-associated hand dysfunction is assessed through an exhaustive review of published studies.

Methods

A high-sensitivity search strategy was used to identify in MedLine and CENTRAL original studies related to hand and wrist surgery in RA patients. We selected articles including at least two adult RA patients which evaluated clinical outcomes through an observational or experimental design. Eligible studies were evaluated by standardized criteria. Two investigators independently used a pre-defined form to extract data about patient population, intervention, follow-up and clinical outcomes. Disagreements were discussed and resolved.

Results

One hundred and ninety-six papers met inclusion criteria. Only five were randomized trials, while most studies followed an observational design, often of poor quality. As such, we could not pool data for statistical analysis; however, we were still able to provide a best evidence synthesis. A positive trend suggesting the efficacy of total carpal arthrodesis and metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty in reducing pain and improving function seemed to emerge from the published studies.

Conclusions

Despite recent advances in medical treatment, surgery still plays a role in the clinical management of RA-associated hand dysfunction. However, the majority of the available studies showed methodological flaws that prevented a clear definition of both surgical indications and criteria for choosing any specific procedure. Suggestions for further investigations are also provided.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^116Q8hy1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — clinical course with and without treatment indicates variable natural history and substantial progression to surgery with nonsurgical care. In a systematic review, some patients (28%-62%) recovered without intervention while others (23%-58%) deteriorated, and among those undergoing nonsurgical management, 57% progressed to surgery within 6 months, 58% in 1 year, and 62% to 66% in 3 years. In an RCT dataset using a wrist orthosis, 21 (22%) of 96 individuals went on to have surgery, and a 12-month success rate of 31% was reported for a neutral night wrist orthosis used for 6 weeks. In a cohort of CTS of all levels of severity, 14 (16%) of 89 hands improved with nonsurgical treatment alone, while 75 (84%) underwent CTR surgery during or after 3 months of nonsurgical management.

### Response to intramuscular methyl prednisolone in inflammatory hand pain: evidence for a targeted clinical, ultrasonographic and therapeutic approach [^113obRbb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hand pain with stiffness is a common clinical presentation to early arthritis clinics, with outcome varying from resolution to the development of rheumatoid arthritis.

Objective

To assess the response and predictors of response to intramuscular methylprednisolone (MP) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) using a standardised treatment protocol.

Methods

Patients with inflammatory hand pain (IHP), defined as predominantly hand pain and morning stiffness of at least 30 min duration, received a standardised assessment prior to receiving intramuscular MP. Response (primary outcome) at 4 weeks was a 50% improvement in symptoms as perceived by the patient; responders who relapsed received repeat intramuscular MP and HCQ.

Results

102 patients were recruited, of which 21% were rheumatoid factor (RF) positive, 23% had clinical synovitis, 25% had raised C-reactive protein level and 55% had ultrasound-detected synovitis. 73% responded, with associated significant reductions in morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire, painful and tender joint counts, and visual analogue scores (p ≤ 0.006 for all). Ultrasound-detected synovitis (p < 0.001) and RF (p = 0.04), but not clinical synovitis (p = 0.74), were significantly associated with response to intramuscular MP. 86% who remained on HCQ long term reported a benefit.

Conclusions

Patients with IHP have significant improvement in symptoms and function following intramuscular MP. Further placebo-controlled trials are required to assess the role of intramuscular MP and ultrasonography in managing this patient group.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^115BKdre]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline — oral/systemic pharmacologic agents for osteoarthritis: Bisphosphonates are strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and the preponderance of data shows no improvement in pain or functional outcomes. Glucosamine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA; the weight of the evidence indicates a lack of efficacy of glucosamine, though some patients exposed to glucosamine may show elevations in serum glucose levels. Chondroitin sulfate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA as are combination products that include glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, but is conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA, with a single trial suggesting analgesic efficacy without evidence of harm in hand OA. Hydroxychloroquine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, with well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in erosive hand OA demonstrating no efficacy. Methotrexate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, and well-designed RCTs in erosive hand OA have demonstrated no efficacy.

### Development of hand phenotypes and changes in hand pain and problems over time in older people [^116HNnfN]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

There have been limited studies on predictors of the long-term course of hand pain and problems. A previous study in all adults (> 18 years) consulting with hand and wrist problems found that factors such as female gender, long symptom duration at presentation, and certain psychosocial factors were predictive of a poorer outcome at 12 months, similar to the findings in this study. More broadly, a systematic review identified that female gender, age, occupation, pain levels, and personal opinions about hand pain have been shown to be cross-sectionally associated with severity of hand function limitation and hand pain. These findings are similar to the factors we identified in this study. While previous state membership was, in most cases, the strongest predictor of current state, in addition to the factors listed above, we also found sleep problems, presence of nodes, and bilateral hand pain to be strong predictors of having a more severe hand problem at long-term (6-year) follow-up.

4.3. Implications

This exploratory work has defined phenotypes of hand problems, based on self-reported answers to brief pain and functional items. In addition, it provides evidence that there is movement between some phenotypes. Individuals presenting with pain and no functional issues were less likely to get worse over time (and some will improve); however, there was less likelihood of improvement into less severe phenotypes once a member of the "severely affected" phenotype. While this study was exploratory, we have found some evidence that clinicians, particularly those based in primary care, should be aware that those with nodes, sleep problems, and longer duration appear to have an increased risk of worsening hand conditions and may benefit from earlier intervention. In addition, clinicians should be more concerned about older adults consulting for poor hand function because our study has found that they appear to have less chance of recovery and may benefit from self-management approaches, including occupational therapy, joint protection, ergonomic aids, and advice.

### The impact of anxiety and depressive symptoms on chronic pain in conservatively and operatively treated hand surgery patients [^115EGxpZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, all together, this study motivates to take more care about patient's psychological conditions in hand surgery. Obviously, future studies will have to examine the extent to which concomitant treatment of psychological symptoms can improve the outcome of hand surgical treatments. Findings of interdisciplinary pain centers offering multimodal therapeutic approaches suggest that such an effect can be expected.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — evidence synthesis and gaps: Variability in study methods makes it difficult to compare results and arrive at a recommendation for one preferred test, and while diagnostic accuracy values of some tests may be acceptable, there is no evidence to support an isolated test or measure that can confirm the presence of CTS; the greatest likelihood ratios were found when subjective and/or objective data were combined with anthropometric measurements, but these data need further validation in separate and larger samples; additional research is needed to determine how these tests can help clinicians assess the presence and severity of CTS.

### Patients' perceptions of the treatment and management of hand osteoarthritis: a focus group enquiry [^113GbfEA]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest reason for a musculoskeletal consultation in primary care in older adults. There is evidence that appropriate advice and management is sub-optimal. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions and experiences of the treatment and management of hand OA in older adults.

Methods

Four focus groups were conducted with primary (n = 15) and secondary (n = 14) care participants aged 50–84 years (mean age 64.9 years; 3 males, 14 females) with a clinical diagnosis of hand OA. Data were tape-recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis and constant comparison method.

Results

Participants described a lack of help and information with regards to management of their hand OA and also a perceived lack of understanding of the impact of hand OA on the individual. Some received contradictory advice about its management. Beliefs about treatment efficacy were balanced against perceived and actual side-effects and tolerance, and such perceptions appeared to influence the use of alternative therapies.

Conclusions

The study identified a perceived unmet need in people with hand OA presenting in primary and secondary care. This may be due to the clinical uncertainty of treatment, lack of high-quality randomised controlled trials evaluating therapeutic options, and the limited written information available incorporating the patient experience. The study emphasised the need to understand patient illness and treatment beliefs. A better understanding of illness and treatment beliefs will facilitate the use of evidence-based approaches in the management of hand OA.

### Nonrheumatoid arthritis of the hand [^113feVTR]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Arthropathy of the hand is commonly encountered. Contributing factors such as aging, trauma, and systemic illness all may have a role in the evolution of this pathology.

### SPECT / CT in postoperative hand and wrist pain [^113bAWJw]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In this review we summarize the current evidence and experience regarding the performance of SPECT/CT in the evaluation of patients with postoperative painful wrist or hand. There is a wide range of operative wrist and hand interventions due to congenital, traumatic, degenerative, or inflammatory diseases. A significant number of patients suffer from pain after operative procedures. Several imaging modalities have been used to evaluate the reason for painful postoperative wrists like standard conventional x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI, or bone scintigraphy. In the last decade, bone SPECT/CT has offered a new approach in combining metabolic and morphologic cross-sectional information in patients with painful postoperative wrists and is increasingly used if standard imaging fails to identify the pain generator. SPECT/CT is less hampered by artifacts caused by metallic implants and shows more details of the cortical bone compared with MRI. MRI is generally superior regarding visualization of soft tissue structures like tendons, synovia, cartilage, muscles, and ligaments. SPECT/CT arthrography has been established to enable the assessment of cartilage and ligament tears.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^113e5iRx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — nonsurgical management monitoring and baseline assessment: Clinicians should assess symptom duration, severity of nighttime symptoms, presence of a positive Phalen test, presence of thenar eminence muscle wasting, and prior nonsurgical interventions in individuals with CTS because these factors have been shown to influence results with nonsurgical management. In light of a preponderance of studies reporting fairly high rates of progression to surgery, clinicians must measure progress carefully and refer patients for surgical consultation if improvement with nonsurgical management is not observed.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115YF7ZH]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the intensive care unit — poor communication during handoffs can increase the frequency of adverse events, and because pain levels prior to dismissal from the intensive care unit (ICU) are the best predictors of pain on the ward, poor communication can contribute to inadequate pain management following transfer. The delivery of optimal analgesia to ICU patients often requires multiple, simultaneously occurring pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, and with such complexity, a structured hand-off facilitating communication between care teams is warranted.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117LfBbp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. As a result of median nerve compression, the patient reports pain, weakness, and paresthesias in the hand and digits. The etiology of this condition is multifactorial; anatomic, systemic, and occupational factors have all been implicated. The diagnosis is based on the patient history and physical examination and is confirmed by electrodiagnostic testing. Treatment methods range from observation and splinting, to cortisone injection and splinting, to surgical intervention. Both nonsurgical and surgical management provide symptom relief in most patients. The results of open and endoscopic surgery essentially are equivalent at 3 months; the superiority of one technique over the other has yet to be established.
