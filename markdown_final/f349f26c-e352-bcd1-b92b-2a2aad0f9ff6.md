## Question

Cricopharyngeal bar

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cricopharyngeal bar, including its definition, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and how it differs from related conditions. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup, including when to use barium swallow, endoscopy, and manometry. After that, I need to appraise treatment options, from conservative to endoscopic and surgical, and weigh efficacy and durability. Finally, I should consider special populations, complications, and synthesize a practical algorithm with strength of evidence and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical relevance. A cricopharyngeal bar is a radiologic descriptor of a prominent cricopharyngeus muscle at the upper esophageal sphincter, often reflecting hypertrophy and fibrosis with impaired relaxation, which can cause oropharyngeal dysphagia to solids and liquids and increase aspiration risk, though it may also be incidental on imaging [^3a2ab1c4] [^39a7192f].

> I need to check the pathophysiology carefully. The cricopharyngeus is the principal component of the UES; failure to relax or coordinate during deglutition, often compounded by muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis, creates a fixed transverse bar that narrows the pharyngoesophageal segment and impedes bolus transit, sometimes with concomitant pharyngeal dilation and weakness above the obstruction, and in some cases this process culminates in Zenker's diverticulum via mucosal herniation through Killian's triangle [^38eadf92] [^3971f399] [^3a2ab1c4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. While many cases are idiopathic, I should confirm associations with neuromuscular disease, particularly inclusion body myositis, where a cricopharyngeal bar on videofluoroscopy is highly specific and correlates with obstruction-related dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia risk, and I should also remember unilateral presentations from vagal injury that can mimic or contribute to CP dysfunction on PA views [^ec589912] [^e9baaef6] [^5d8d5f4f].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Let me verify the role of barium swallow: videofluoroscopy is the gold standard to identify the bar, quantify pharyngoesophageal segment opening, and detect aspiration or pouching; endoscopy complements by excluding alternative pathology and enabling therapy, but it can miss the bar without adequate distension; manometry can characterize UES pressures and intrabolus gradients, though access and cooperation limit utility in the oropharynx [^3a2ab1c4] [^70840c18] [^144cdfcf] [^6347c5ed].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and pitfalls. A cricopharyngeal bar can be incidental, so I should correlate with symptoms and exclude other causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, head and neck cancer treatment effects, and primary esophageal disease; in older adults, CP bars are not rare, and missing an alternative diagnosis is a common error if I anchor prematurely on the bar [^39a7192f] [^9e18969a].

> I will now examine treatment options, starting with conservative measures. Diet modification and swallow therapy are reasonable first steps in mild or equivocal cases, but I should confirm that durable benefit is limited when a fixed bar is the dominant pathology; botulinum toxin injection can transiently reduce UES pressure and may help in select spastic or neurogenic phenotypes, though responses are often short-lived and repeat injections are common [^notfound].

> Let me consider dilation next. Balloon or Savary dilation is minimally invasive and achieves high initial success, but I should double-check durability: recurrence is frequent, with about 57% needing repeat dilation and a meaningful fraction proceeding to myotomy, so dilation is best framed as a bridge or for patients with high surgical risk; nonetheless, guidelines endorse UES dilation for CP bar dysphagia when indicated [^293c6793] [^a168f5a6] [^2e75410b] [^a24e2d81].

> Now, I should review myotomy options. Open transcervical myotomy is definitive but carries morbidity and inpatient recovery; endoscopic approaches reduce invasiveness, and among these, C-POEM is emerging with high technical and clinical success in small series, though leaks and edema can occur and technique matters; rigid endoscopic myotomy with laser or stapler is established for Zenker's and can be adapted to isolated bars, with tissue removal (myectomy) potentially lowering recurrence; robotic myotomy is promising for deep-field visualization and may facilitate outpatient care in experienced hands [^9e1f5aba] [^bb577f15] [^d03307d2] [^f1437928] [^7449f077].

> But wait, what if the bar coexists with a Zenker's diverticulum. I should confirm that the endoscopic stapler and CO2 laser approaches target the common wall/septum and include a myotomy to relieve outflow obstruction; network meta-analysis suggests open diverticulectomy with myotomy has the lowest odds of persistent or recurrent symptoms compared with endoscopic stapler or laser, though endoscopic techniques remain acceptable and are often preferred in older adults due to lower morbidity [^dbe4acbc] [^984bd897].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In inclusion body myositis, a cricopharyngeal bar signals high-risk dysphagia and aspiration; myotomy or dilation can palliate obstruction, but disease progression and aspiration risk persist, so multidisciplinary care and aspiration precautions are essential; in pediatrics, congenital cricopharyngeal achalasia is rare and may respond to botulinum toxin or endoscopic myotomy after careful workup [^e9baaef6] [^1c51fcab] [^02448e2a].

> Next, I should review complications and follow-up. Leaks after C-POEM are uncommon but consequential; conservative management with antibiotics and NPO is often effective, and through-the-scope suturing can rescue persistent defects; routine post-procedure imaging is not mandated after dilation unless symptoms arise, but establishing a new baseline swallow study after myotomy can help interpret future recurrences; recurrence after myotomy is generally manageable with revision, with reported rates around 6–7% in myectomy series [^7c57f595] [^a24e2d81] [^d03307d2].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. In a patient with oropharyngeal dysphagia, I should start with a careful history to localize the problem and then obtain a videofluoroscopic swallow study to confirm a bar and assess severity; if mild and symptoms are intermittent, a trial of diet modification and therapy is reasonable; if moderate to severe or aspiration risk is present, I should discuss dilation as a lower-risk but less durable option versus myotomy for definitive relief, tailoring to comorbidity, anatomy, and local expertise; in refractory or complex cases, C-POEM or transoral myotomy/myectomy are appropriate at experienced centers, with open surgery reserved for failures or concomitant Zenker's requiring diverticulectomy [^3a2ab1c4] [^2e75410b] [^9e1f5aba] [^dbe4acbc].

> Finally, I should confirm the strength of evidence and counseling points. Much of the literature consists of retrospective series and case reports; nonetheless, convergence across modalities supports the pathophysiologic model and the relative efficacy of myotomy over dilation for durable relief, while acknowledging that patient selection and operator experience strongly influence outcomes; shared decision-making should emphasize trade-offs in invasiveness, durability, and recurrence, and patients should be counseled that aspiration risk may persist even after successful myotomy if underlying neuromuscular disease is present [^79ab4bfc] [^293c6793] [^e9baaef6].

A cricopharyngeal bar is a **radiographic finding** of cricopharyngeus muscle hypertrophy at the upper esophageal sphincter, often causing oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration risk [^3a2ab1c4]. Diagnosis relies on **videofluoroscopy** [^3a2ab1c4] or barium esophagram [^69b5ccfa], with endoscopy to exclude other causes [^70840c18]. Management is tailored: mild cases may use diet and speech therapy; persistent symptoms warrant dilation [^2e75410b] or myotomy [^9e1f5aba], with C-POEM emerging as a minimally invasive option [^9e1f5aba] [^bb577f15]. Prognosis is **generally favorable** with treatment, though recurrence can occur and repeat intervention may be needed [^a168f5a6] [^d03307d2].

---

## Pathophysiology

The cricopharyngeus muscle is the **principal component of the UES** [^38eadf92]; its hypertrophy or fibrosis causes a fixed bar that impairs UES opening, leading to dysphagia and aspiration [^3a2ab1c4]. Chronic obstruction can cause **pharyngeal dilation and weakness** above the bar [^3971f399].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Oropharyngeal dysphagia**: solids > liquids, sensation of sticking, choking, nasal regurgitation [^notfound].
- **Aspiration**: coughing, choking, recurrent pneumonia [^3a2ab1c4].
- **Globus sensation**: feeling of a lump or fullness in the throat [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging studies

- **Videofluoroscopy (modified barium swallow)**: gold standard; shows a prominent bar at the UES, delayed opening, and pharyngeal residue [^3a2ab1c4] [^1ca6a6ce].
- **Barium esophagram**: identifies the bar and excludes other structural lesions [^39a7192f].
- **High-resolution manometry**: elevated UES pressure, impaired relaxation, and abnormal intrabolus pressure gradients [^notfound].

---

### Endoscopy

Endoscopy excludes other pathology and may show the bar as a **posterior ridge**; it is less sensitive than fluoroscopy for subtle bars [^70840c18] [^39a7192f].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment is individualized based on symptom severity, aspiration risk, and comorbidities:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Diet modification and speech therapy | Mild symptoms, low aspiration risk | Variable; noninvasive |
| Balloon dilation | Moderate symptoms, high surgical risk | 64–83% initial improvement; recurrence common [^a168f5a6] [^6fdcf2e9] |
| Cricopharyngeal myotomy (open or endoscopic) | Severe symptoms, aspiration risk, refractory cases | 95–100% success; durable relief [^a168f5a6] [^9e1f5aba] |
| Cricopharyngeal POEM (C-POEM) | Refractory cases, high surgical risk | 100% technical success; low recurrence; emerging [^9e1f5aba] [^bb577f15] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate treatment; myotomy provides durable relief, but recurrence can occur and may require repeat intervention [^a168f5a6] [^d03307d2]. Persistent dysphagia may reflect incomplete myotomy, fibrosis, or alternative pathology [^82f36127].

---

## Complications

Potential complications include:

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: from ongoing dysphagia [^e9baaef6].
- **Perforation**: rare with dilation or myotomy [^0d77d194].
- **Recurrence**: 6–20% after myotomy, often manageable endoscopically [^d03307d2].

---

A cricopharyngeal bar is a **treatable cause of oropharyngeal dysphagia**; accurate diagnosis with videofluoroscopy and judicious use of dilation or myotomy yield excellent outcomes, with C-POEM offering a promising minimally invasive option [^3a2ab1c4] [^9e1f5aba].

### Assessment of videofluoroscopic swallow study findings before and after cricopharyngeal myotomy [^27830be8]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cricopharyngeal myotomy is a treatment for obstructive cricopharyngeal bar and Zenker's diverticulitis. Little is reported regarding contrast study findings and their correlation with patient symptoms.

Methods

All patients treated by cricopharyngeal myotomy underwent a preoperative and postoperative videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) and completed the self-reported Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10). Studies were analyzed quantitatively.

Results

Forty cricopharyngeal myotomies were performed (mean age 76 years; SD 8.72) all for dysphagia. Symptomatic improvement (change in EAT-10 scores) occurred in 95% (38/40). Presurgical versus postsurgical VFSS demonstrated significantly improved pharyngoesophageal segment opening, pharyngeal constriction ratio, and pouch residue (P < .01). Symptomatic improvement was unrelated to the presence of retained barium.

Conclusion

Both symptomatic and objective improvement in swallowing measures occurs after cricopharyngeal myotomy. Pouch remnants and retained barium are seen postoperatively but do not correlate with reported symptoms. Routine follow-up barium studies may be needed to establish a new baseline and allow for comparison if future symptom recurrence occurs.

### Savary dilation is a safe and effective long-term means of treatment of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar: a single-center experience [^6fdcf2e9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goals

Dilation of a cricopharyngeal (CP) bar can be a safe and effective means of nonsurgical treatment as elderly patient population has high morbidity and is at a higher risk of surgical complications.

Background

CP bar is a relatively uncommon radiologic finding, which is an infrequent cause of oropharyngeal dysphagia in the elderly population.

Methods

Patients were included in study from January 2007 to January 2012, if their dysphagia was solely attributed to CP bar on predilation radiologic imaging by either modified barium swallow or barium esophagogram. A functional outcome swallowing score (FOSS) was calculated at 1, 4, and 6 months from initial and last dilation performed.

Results

A total of 31 patients with a mean age of 71.65 (54 to 88) years and mean body mass index 27.81 (15 to 41) were included in the study. Over the time period of 5 years, a total of 53 dilations were performed. The median predilation FOSS was 3. The median postdilation FOSS was 1 at the end of 6 months from last dilation performed. There were no immediate or remote complications.

Conclusions

On follow-up from first dilation, 65% patients had statistically significant improvement in FOSS lasting for at least 6 months. Savary dilation seems to be a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic CP bar patients.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^3a2ab1c4]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Cricopharyngeal dysfunction occurs at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). There are multiple aetiologies, but the overall effect is of impaired bolus transit with a possibility of misdirection of the bolus into the airway potentially resulting in choking, aspiration, pneumonia, or death.

Cricopharyngeus (CP) muscle hypertrophy is a structural entity that contributes to cricopharyngeal dysfunction and is likely due to a combination of fibrosis in the connective tissue of the (UES), and loss of elasticity of the slow twitch loop muscle fibers. CP hypertrophy and loss of distensibility are thought to trigger a compensatory increase in hypopharyngeal pressure to increase bolus velocity and assist flow through the UES. In some individuals, increasing pressures result in an outpouching of pharyngeal mucosa through Killian's dehiscence (a natural deficiency in the muscular wall of the pharynx), known as a Zenker's diverticulum (ZD). This finding is seen radiologically on barium swallow (or videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, VFSS) as a 'bar' that can narrow the pharyngoesophageal lumen and an associated sac that fills with contrast media. Fluoroscopy is the gold standard diagnostic procedure to identify the CP bar and ZD. The pouch can collect swallowed material, pills, or saliva and acts as a reservoir that can spill contents unexpectedly toward the airway, triggering a cough or a choking response or resulting in aspiration if clearance is not adequate.

### No pouch, no problem: successful endoscopic division of a symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar using a modified peroral endoscopic myotomy technique for zenker's diverticulum [^1d0436df]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 78-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, asthma, and hypothyroidism presented to an Otolaryngologist with a 3-month history of intermittent dysphagia to solids and liquids. Dysphagia was associated with coughing episodes and aspiration pneumonia. Modified barium swallow study revealed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with a prominent CPB (Fig. 1 A). The patient later underwent direct laryngoscopy with cricopharyngeal botulinum toxin injection, with no improvement of symptoms. Barium swallow was repeated several weeks later, with similar findings. He was then referred to the gastroenterology department for definitive therapy.

### Swallowing outcomes in 7 patients following endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy with primary closure [^671a00e7]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Cricopharyngeal spasm and pharyngeal pouch can result in severe dysphagia symptoms that can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Several surgical interventions have been demonstrated including balloon dilatation, botox injection, and open and endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy. The aim of this case series is to describe our technique for endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy and compare pre- and postoperative swallowing outcomes using objective swallowing questionnaires in a small series of patients. Seven patients diagnosed with cricopharyngeal spasm or grade 1 pharyngeal pouch on barium swallow were prospectively observed. MD Anderson Dysphagia inventory (MDADI) and Dysphagia handicap index (DHI) were given to patients before and after their operation. All patients underwent the same surgical technique with the cricopharyngeal bar divided and the defect closed with dissolvable sutures. Mean inpatient stay was 7 days (range 1–8) and mean time to resumption of soft diet was 4 (range 1–7) days. All patients resumed oral diet before discharge. MDADI scores showed improvement across all domains, however only the emotional score achieved statistical significance (P = 0.04). Dysphagia handicap index scores showed a statistically significant improvement across functional, emotional, and total domains. Postoperative chest infection treated with oral antibiotics occurred in 3 patients (43%) and no other complications were documented. In conclusion, endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy with primary sutured endoscopic closure can result in a significant benefit to patient's swallowing symptoms, emotional well-being, and quality of life.

### Effectiveness of esophageal dilation for symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar [^fc927b0a]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The cricopharyngeal (CP) bar is an uncommon but important cause of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD). Treatment options include CP myotomy, which can be problematic, because CP bars primarily occur in elderly patients who are at higher risk for perioperative complications. The effectiveness of esophageal dilation for patients with symptoms caused by a CP bar is not well studied.

Methods

A review of medical records (1999 to 2002) identified 32 patients with CP bar. Six of these patients who had OPD that could only be attributed to a CP bar underwent EGD and dilation with either over-the-guidewire polyvinyl dilators (5) or a balloon (1).

Observations

All 6 patients experienced immediate relief of dysphagia. Five had continued improvement at short-term follow-up (1 to 4 weeks). Three patients still had complete resolution of dysphagia at long-term follow-up (range 8 to 27 months).

Conclusions

CP bar is an important cause of dysphagia in elderly patients. Esophageal dilation of a CP bar can produce long-term relief of dysphagia.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^bb577f15]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A cricopharyngeal bar refers to a radiological description of a prominent cricopharyngeal muscle. While these may be incidental, they can lead to significant oropharyngeal dysphagia due to incoordination of the upper esophageal sphincter and true luminal narrowing. Various treatments have been used for the management of cricopharyngeal bar, including botulinum toxin injection, dilation, and surgical myotomy. Cricopharyngeal peroral endoscopic myotomy (C-POEM) is a novel procedure that uses the principles of "third-space" endoscopy to treat symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar.

Methods

We report a retrospective case series of 5 patients referred with oropharyngeal dysphagia to 2 UK tertiary referral centers between 2022 and 2023 who subsequently underwent C-POEM. Technical success was defined as completion of all steps of the C-POEM procedure and clinical success as a reduction in the pre-treatment Dakkak and Bennett score to ≤ 1, or 0 if the pre-treatment score was 1.

Results

C-POEM was associated with a technical success of 100% and clinical success of 100% over a median follow up of 2 months (interquartile range 1–8). There was 1 adverse event due to a small mucosal defect and associated leak on barium swallow, which was the result of difficult access during mucosal closure. This was managed conservatively with antibiotics. A step-by-step video demonstration of the procedure is provided.

Conclusion

C-POEM offers an alternative upfront therapy for symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar, but should be undertaken by endoscopists with significant experience in third-space endoscopy in view of the difficulty of working within the hypopharynx.

### Comparison of surgical treatments for zenker diverticulum… [^dbe4acbc]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, open diverticulectomy with cricopharyngeal myotomy was associated with lowest incidence of persistent or recurrent symptoms compared with endoscopic stapler–assisted and CO2 laser diverticulotomy. There was no significant difference with the primary outcome measure when comparing the 2 endoscopic techniques. Zenker diverticulum is an acquired pharyngeal outpouching in the hypopharynx between the inferior constrictor and the cricopharyngeus muscles. 1 It most frequently occurs in the older adult population, typically after the seventh decade of life. 2 Symptoms. There is ongoing debate as to the comparative effectiveness of endoscopic and open techniques. 18, 19 Shah et al15 compared the size of the residual party wall following endoscopic and open surgical approaches.

While the authors found that the endoscopic stapler technique tended to incompletely remove the common pouch wall compared with the open approach, there was no significant difference in the degree of symptomatic improvement based on the Eating Assessment Tool 20 scores. A geometric network was created among the 3 study groups. The OR for persistent or recurrent symptoms following surgery was calculated using pooled network comparisons. Between endoscopic laser-assisted diverticulotomy and open diverticulectomy with cricopharyngeal myotomy, the open approach showed a statistically lower likelihood of persistent or recurrent symptoms following treatment. This translates to the open technique having approximately 20% the likelihood of recurrent or persistent symptoms, compared with the 2 endoscopic techniques.

The CIs, however, are fairly wide for both comparisons, suggesting that the decreased odds observed with the open technique could be substantially more modest than the aforementioned effect size. Miller et al30 reported a 1. 21-point mean reduction in their dysphagia score for the endoscopic stapler cohort and a

1. 38-point mean reduction in CO2 laser cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant. Leibowitz et al29 reported similar outcomes to those from Miller et al, with reductions in dysphagia scores of 1. 63 and
2. 70 for the CO2 laser and endoscopic stapler groups, respectively.

### A 78-year-old man with difficulty swallowing [^39a7192f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

CP bar is an uncommon but important cause of dysphagia in elderly people. A CP bar is often undetected during upper endoscopy and might be missed with barium radiography if adequate attention is not focused on the hypopharynx. In suspected cases, evaluation for alternative etiologies of dysphagia is important because the CP bar might be an incidental finding. Secondary causes of CP dysfunction resulting from underlying primary myopathic or neuropathic disorders should be considered before therapy. The effectiveness of dilation and surgical myotomy in alleviating dysphagia associated with CP bars has been reported in small series.

### Comparison of methods for determining cricopharyngeal intrabolus pressure in normal patients as possible indicator for cricopharyngeal myotomy [^6347c5ed]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to compare methods for determining intrabolus cricopharyngeal pressure as a possible indicator for cricopharyngeal myotomy.

Study Design

We determined multiple intrabolus pressures in the cricopharyngeal region of 20 normal volunteers, of whom 12 were 20 to 35 years old and 8 were older than 75 years. Data were collected using a commercially available manofluorography system and a 6-sensor unidirectional solid-state 2- x 4-mm catheter. Each subject underwent 5 5-mL and 5 10-mL liquid barium swallows. Data were analyzed, and young subjects were compared with old subjects.

Results

The mean mid-bolus pressures in young subjects were 5.2 ± 4.9 mm Hg and 7.2 ± 6.5 mm Hg for the 5-mL and 10-mL swallows, respectively, and in older subjects, 10.8 ± 8.8 mm Hg and 12.3 ± 7.4 mm Hg. The mean gradient pressures across the 3-cm cricopharyngeal region in young subjects were 2.02 ± 5.0 mm Hg, and -0.91 ± 4.8 mm Hg for the 5-mL and 10-mL swallows, respectively, and for older subjects, 4.38 ± 3.1 mm Hg and 2.82 ± 3.4 mm Hg.

Conclusions

Cricopharyngeal intrabolus pressures were lower in young than in older subjects. The mid-bolus pressure and the gradient pressure across the cricopharyngeal region appeared to be the most consistent methods for evaluating intrabolus pressures.

Significance

Intrabolus pressure anomalies in the cricopharyngeal region have been proposed as an indicator for selecting patients who would benefit from cricopharyngeal myotomy. The methods of determining intrabolus pressures vary, with resulting variations in recommendations.

### Over-the-bar peroral endoscopic myotomy for the therapy of treatment-refractory cricopharyngeal dysphagia [^b17924e8]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Description

A 71-year-old woman with a pertinent history of type II achalasia, successfully treated with previous peroral endoscopic myotomy, presented with chronic cough and recurrent aspiration pneumonia secondary to a cricopharyngeal bar. Her cricopharyngeal bar was longstanding and refractory to intervention; she had previously been treated by otolaryngology with endoscopic carbon dioxide laser myotomy and with repeated balloon dilation, both of which were unsuccessful. A barium swallow and upper endoscopy showed her lower esophageal sphincter to be widely patent, consistent with appropriately treated achalasia, and delayed passage of contrast at the level of a prominent cricopharyngeal bar. She was thus referred to our center for C-POEM.

### UK guidelines on oesophageal dilatation in clinical practice [^a24e2b81]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Upper oesophageal sphincter disturbances, including motor disorders and mechanical disorders, can result in symptoms of dysphagia. Pathologies associated with disordered neurally mediated opening of the upper oesophageal sphincter, including oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophies, may be amenable to dilatation to relieve symptoms. Furthermore, while a cricopharyngeal bar is often an incidental radiological finding in cricopharyngeal fibrosis, treatment of associated dysphagia by both balloon and bougie dilatation methods can be successful.
Consider upper oesophageal sphincter dilatation in the treatment of dysphagia with disordered upper oesophageal sphincter opening, post-cricoid web, cricopharyngeal bar with or without the presence of a Zenker's diverticulum, or to permit passage of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheters (GRADE of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).

Aftercare and follow-up

(a) Postprocedure and discharge instructions
Monitor patients for at least 2 hours in the recovery room and provide clear written instructions with advice on fluids, diet and medications after the procedure (GRADE of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).
Do not perform imaging and contrast studies routinely after the procedure, unless patients — during recovery — develop persistent chest pain, fever, breathlessness or tachycardia (GRADE of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: weak).
Ensure that patients are well and tolerating water on leaving the hospital (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).
Suspect perforation when patients develop pain, breathlessness, fever or tachycardia. Transient chest pain is not uncommon following dilatation but persistent pain should prompt a CT scan with oral contrast to look for perforation (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

### Treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to idiopathic cricopharyngeal bar: surgical cricopharyngeal muscle myotomy versus dilation [^a168f5a6]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare swallowing outcomes following cricopharyngeal (CP) dilation versus surgical myotomy in patients with dysphagia secondary to idiopathic CP bar.

Methods

All patients had an idiopathic CP bar without a history of Zenker's diverticulum, head and neck cancer, or systemic neurologic disease treated between 2000 and 2013. The Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale (FOSS) was utilized to assess dysphagia symptoms.

Results

Twenty-three patients underwent 46 dilations and 20 patients had a myotomy. Nineteen of 23 (83%) patients in the dilation group and all patients in the myotomy group reported improved swallow function. The median difference in pre- versus post-intervention FOSS scores was not statistically significant (p = 0.07) between the dilation and myotomy groups with mean reductions of 1.3 and 1.8, respectively. Seventeen of 23 (74%) dilation patients had persistent or recurrent dysphagia with 13 (57%) requiring repeat dilation and 4 (17%) undergoing CP myotomy. The median time to first reintervention in the dilation group was 13.6months. Nineteen of 20 (95%) surgical myotomy patients did not experience recurrent dysphagia.

Conclusion

Both endoscopic CP dilation and myotomy led to similar initial improvement in swallow function for patients with primary idiopathic CP bar; however, dilation is more likely to provide temporary benefit.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for cricopharyngeal bar [^fd2bcb9b]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Cricopharyngeal dysfunction, or failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle to relax in response to swallowing, is an uncommon but potentially severe cause of dysphagia that manifests as Zenker's diverticulum or cricopharyngeal bar on contrasted fluoroscopy. In Zenker's diverticulum, the cricopharyngeus forms a septum between the esophageal lumen and the diverticulum, serving as an identifiable target for intraluminal endoscopic and surgical treatment (Fig. 1). In cricopharyngeal bar, the landmarks are less reliable, and thus treatment options are more limited. Endoscopic dilation can be effective, but many patients experience inadequate or transient response. Cricopharyngeal peroral endoscopic myotomy (c-POEM) may represent a viable treatment option.

### Congenital cricopharyngeal achalasia… [^04fa1721]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Financial Disclosure: None. Cricopharyngeal achalasia is a rare condition of unknown etiology in which the upper esophageal sphincter fails to open properly during deglutition. 1 The normal UES is tonically closed to prevent the inflow of air into the esophagus during inspiration and the regurgitation of food from the esophagus back into the pharynx. 2, 3 The UES briefly relaxes during deglutition, belching, or emesis.

### No pouch, no problem: successful endoscopic division of a symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar using a modified peroral endoscopic myotomy technique for zenker's diverticulum [^5a61e416]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The patient was admitted overnight. Day 1 barium swallow showed no leak or subcutaneous emphysema (Fig. 1 H). The patient tolerated clear fluids with no pain and was discharged on oral antibiotics. At 1-month follow-up, the patient was feeling well and tolerating solid foods, with complete resolution of dysphagia. This case demonstrates the use of a modified Z-POEM technique as safe and effective management of symptomatic CPBs. We have previously reported 1 prior case of successful single-session cricopharyngeal myotomy and Z-POEM. In symptomatic patients with a CPB, a submucosal tunneling technique still allows for excellent exposure of the muscle and complete myotomy in a manner similar to that performed during Z-POEM. This technique can be considered as an alternative management option for symptomatic patients with a prominent CPB.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^0f12ef62]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case series

This was a retrospective case series evaluating the clinical outcomes of 5 patients who underwent C-POEM for symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar, performed by a single operator between 2022 and 2023 at 2 tertiary referral centers within the UK (Cleveland Clinic London and University College London Hospital). A total of 41 patients who had troublesome oropharyngeal symptoms secondary to a suspected anatomical defect of the upper esophageal sphincter on barium imaging were referred for consideration of endoscopic management. Of these, 5 were confirmed to have a cricopharyngeal bar on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and were included in the study. All 5 cases of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar went on to have C-POEM. No patient underwent balloon dilatation or surgery.

Primary outcomes

The primary outcomes were technical success, clinical success, and rate of procedure-related adverse events. Technical success was defined as completion of all steps of the C-POEM procedure. Clinical success was defined as a reduction in the pre-treatment Dakkak and Bennett score (DBS) to ≤ 1, or 0 if the pre-treatment score was 1. DBS is a simple dysphagia score based on the patients' reported symptoms (Table 1). All adverse events were recorded for up to 30 days.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of dysphagia [^70840c18]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia due to hypopharyngeal or upper esophageal sphincter disorders — endoscopic evaluation and therapy guidance indicates these disorders can cause oropharyngeal dysphagia, and EGD should be performed in suspected cases to exclude alternative or additional pathologic conditions and should include a complete examination of the upper esophageal sphincter and hypopharynx; endoscopy based therapies including dilation and injection therapy have been described for upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction and cricopharyngeal bars.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^1a8967bb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

When conducting C-POEM, or any intervention of the upper esophageal sphincter, one should consider the potential issues from its disruption. Abnormal upper esophageal sphincter function can lead to troublesome regurgitation, and has been linked to the development of laryngeal symptoms (e.g. hoarse voice, globus). Nonetheless, there is currently a paucity of data, and these symptoms were not reported by our patients on follow up.

Ultimately, C-POEM offers an alternative upfront therapy for symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar, but should be undertaken by endoscopists with significant experience in third-space endoscopy, in view of the potential difficulty and risk of adverse events. Studies comparing available treatment modalities for cricopharyngeal bar are required to clarify whether C-POEM should be considered the first-line treatment.

### Hypopharyngeal bar… [^6bc54681]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

There is no definite anatomical borderline between hypopharynx and cervical esophagus. In 1949 Testut and Latarjet1 claimed that it was generally agreed upon to place the borderline at a horizontal plane which touches the inferior margin of the cricoid cartilage and crosses the body of the sixth cervical vertebra. This borderline is arbitrary and, in addition, is not accepted by all anatomists and clinicians. Since the classical description of Luschka2 the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx is divided into an oblique portion which makes its insertion mainly on the thyroid cartilage, and a transverse portion which is attached to the cricoid cartilage. Killian3 claims that the cricopharyngeal muscle consists of both oblique and transverse fibers. Of importance are two areas in the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the cervical esophagus, respectively, because in these areas the wall is BRUNNER H. Hypopharyngeal Bar. AMA Arch Otolaryngol.

Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection, used for colorectal polyps as early as 2012, leverages the inherent density differences in tissue planes to facilitate tissue separation. Given the technical difficulty of performing cricopharyngeal POEM, we believe that underwater endoscopic mucosal resection can enable easier entry into the tunnel and facilitate more complete myotomy.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^f11fc486]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient records were reviewed for demographic information, pre‐operative and post‐operative videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) information, self‐rated outcomes measures (Eating Assessment Tool‐10, EAT‐10), diet level as per the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), complications, length of stay, and recurrence of cricopharyngeal dysfunction. Specific measures made from VFSS included maximum opening of the pharyngoesophageal segment (PESmax), PCR, aspiration into the airway, and BCR as per Leonard and Kendall, Table 1. Measures were made using Swallowtail [Belldev Medical, IL, USA]. Student t ‐tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare pre‐ and postsurgical measures with significance established if p < 0.0125.

TABLE 1
Quantitative videofluoroscopic swallowing study measures.

VFSS were performed to standard protocol, previously described. In brief, subjects were administered measured quantities of barium sulfate mixture (E‐Z Paque 96% w/v diluted to 19%, E‐Z‐paste 60% w/w), a 13 mm diameter round barium tablet and 13 mm long barium‐filled gel capsule, E‐Z‐EM Inc. Westbury, NY and instructed to "swallow all in one go" while images were obtained in lateral and AP views at 30 frames per second and recorded for analysis onto digital media. Definitions of measures are listed in Table 1.

All patients were offered postoperative VFSS no sooner than 3 months following surgery and these were analyzed in the same manner. Further fluoroscopic studies were performed based on symptoms.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^ec0da895]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 5 patients underwent the C-POEM procedure. The full characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 2. Their median age was 74 years (interquartile range [IQR] 70.5–78.5), 2 (40%) were female, and all patients had a Charlson comorbidity index of 3. The median pre-treatment DBS was 2 (IQR 1.5–3) and 1 patient (20%) had undergone prior intervention. The average procedural time was 40.2 min (95% confidence interval ± 20.8), technical success was achieved in 100%, and the median length of stay was 1 day (IQR 1–2.5). Clinical success was achieved in 100% over a median follow up of 2 months (IQR 1.0–8.0). There was 1 adverse event due to a small mucosal defect and associated leak on barium swallow. This was the result of difficult access during mucosal closure that limited further endoscopic intervention. It was successfully managed conservatively with 48 h of intravenous antibiotics and observation in hospital before discharge on an oral course.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^c47ea40c]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Quantitative measures from our swallowing studies prior to and postsurgery demonstrate significant improvements in PES opening diameter, reduction in retained bolus in the pharynx (decreased BCR) and improvement in pharyngeal contractile efficiency (decreased PCR). These parameters provide objective evidence that physical changes have occurred at the operative site that facilitate bolus flow. Coupled with a reduction in the patient‐reported EAT‐10 scores (indicating a functionally easier swallow) and improvement in diet (FOIS improved from 5 to 7), this supports Gold laser‐assisted endoscopic CP myectomy as a valid treatment for this group. Few studies have documented quantitative improvement alongside subjective improvement in swallow parameters postmyotomy. Ozgursoy and Salassa measured fluoroscopic area and manometric parameters pre‐ and postmyotomy for cricopharyngeal bar without pouch reporting significant improvement in area measures following surgery. McMillan and colleagues measured narrowing at the UES on fluoroscopy in 12 patients with inclusion body myositis undergoing open or endoscopic myotomy demonstrating significant improvement in UES opening postsurgically. Yip et al. examined 20 patients before and after open CPM (12 with ZD) and reported improvement in PESmax (0.3 cm presurgery to 0.51 cm postsurgery, p < 0.000). Our current study is the largest to evaluate pre‐ and postsurgical fluoroscopic assessments with quantitative measures. It is important to note that although improvements in measured parameters correlated with symptom improvement, measured parameters often did not return to normal. Many patients continue to have elevated PCR and BCR values; however, surgical intervention enabled return to normal oral diet (as measured by normalization of FOIS scores) and decreased regurgitation.

### Videofluoroscopic swallow studies in unilateral cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^5d8d5f4f]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Although the cricopharyngeus muscle is a ring-like structure, unilateral cricopharyngeal dysfunction can produce significant dysphagia. This entity has not been well described in the literature. The aims of the study were to identify the characteristic findings on videofluoroscopic swallow studies in patients with dysphagia secondary to unilateral cricopharyngeal dysfunction, to note the associated vagal nerve injury, and to evaluate patient outcomes following ipsilateral cricopharyngeal myotomy.

Study Design

Retrospective clinical investigation.

Methods

The clinic charts, electromyographic tests, videostroboscopic examinations, and videofluoroscopic swallow studies were reviewed from a series of patients who presented to our institution from 1993 to 2001 with dysphagia and findings on videofluoroscopic swallow studies suggestive of unilateral cricopharyngeal dysfunction on posterior-anterior view. In patients treated with ipsilateral cricopharyngeal myotomy, postoperative findings on swallow studies and patient outcomes were also reviewed.

Results

Eighteen patients demonstrated findings characteristic of unilateral cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction on videofluoroscopic swallow study. The common feature was a unilateral shelf-like barrier at the cricopharyngeus on the posterior-anterior view with pooling of liquid bolus in the ipsilateral pyriform sinus and episodic shunting to the contralateral side. Eight patients did not have evidence of cricopharyngeal dysfunction (ie, cricopharyngeal bar) on lateral films. Of the 18 patients, 14 had histories consistent with vagal injury secondary to trauma (n = 2), neoplastic involvement (n = 7), iatrogenic injury (n = 2), or central nervous system disease (n = 3). Results of videostroboscopic examinations demonstrated vocal fold motion impairment in 14 patients, and electromyographic test results confirmed unilateral vagal injuries in those who underwent electromyographic testing (n = 6). In the remaining 4 of 18 patients, videostroboscopic examinations demonstrated normal vocal fold abduction but impaired lengthening with a posterior glottic gap, and electromyographic test results (n = 4) indicated unilateral superior laryngeal nerve involvement. Of the 15 patients treated with ipsilateral cricopharyngeal myotomy, 1 patient required postoperative esophageal dilations for an esophageal stricture distal to the cricopharyngeus, whereas the remaining 14 patients had functional resolution of their dysphagia.

Conclusion

In patients presenting with dysphagia and evidence of unilateral vagal injury, careful assessment of posterior-anterior view on videofluoroscopic swallow study should be included to evaluate for unilateral cricopharyngeal dysfunction.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for cricopharyngeal bar [^eb1d02bd]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

In this video series (Video 1, available online at), we present 3 cases of patients between 75 and 83 years of age with multiple medical problems who presented with lifestyle-limiting dysphagia ranging from 2 months to 15 years in duration. All patients had radiographic evidence of a cricopharyngeal bar and had symptoms refractory to endoscopic dilation. Complete cricopharyngeal exposure and division, followed by entry site closure, were successful in all 3 cases. Relative to POEM for Zenker's diverticulum, c-POEM was more technically challenging because of limited working space in the region of the upper esophageal sphincter. Two of the 3 patients developed postprocedural hypopharyngeal edema, requiring a several-day hospitalization for conservative management. After recovery from c-POEM, all patients reported complete resolution of dysphagia and tolerated an unrestricted diet.

### Cricopharyngeal bar on videofluoroscopy: high specificity for inclusion body myositis [^ec589912]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and characteristics of the cricopharyngeal bar (CPB), defined as marked protrusion with lacking relaxation and stricture of the upper esophageal sphincter on videofluoroscopy, in patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Methods

We conducted a case-control study of comprehensive series of adult healthy individuals and consecutive patients with neuropsychiatric disorders aged over 45 (52 versus 2486). A standard videofluoroscopy was performed.

Results

Overall, 47 individuals with CPB were identified. Of the individuals with CPB, 36% were IBM followed by neurodegenerative disorders, muscular disorders, neuromuscular disorders, and others (32%, 21%, 2.1%, and 8.5%, respectively), indicating the heterogeneity of the etiologies. Against muscular disorders, the sensitivity and specificity of the CPB for IBM were 33% (= 17/52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 20–45%) and 96% (= 264/274; 95% CI, 94–99%), respectively. IBM with CPB showed a higher frequency of obstruction-related dysphagia (88% versus 22%, p < 0.001) and severe CPB (76% versus 23%, p < 0.001) than the control with one. The ratio of the upper esophageal distance at the maximum distension at the level of C6 to that of C4 was lower in IBM with CPB than in the controls with one (0.50 versus 0.77, p < 0.001), which suggests the insufficient opening of the upper esophageal sphincter.

Conclusion

A CPB could be indicative of IBM. The upper esophagus in IBM with CPB became narrow, like a bottleneck. We provide new perspectives of dysphagia diagnosis by videofluoroscopy, especially for IBM-associated dysphagia, to expand the knowledge on the CPB.

### Management of cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction [^38eadf92]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The cricopharyngeus muscle (CPM) is a key component of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). In dysphagia, cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (CPD) refers to the muscle's failure to appropriately and completely relax or expand during deglutition. A variety of disease processes may cause CPD, and the resultant clinical manifestation is solid food or solid and liquid dysphagia. Several diagnostic tools are available for dysphagia clinicians to distinguish CPD from other causes of UES dysfunction. For CPD, accurate diagnosis is paramount for the recommendation of appropriate treatment. In appropriately selected patients, intervention at the CPM may yield significant improvement in dysphagia.

### Endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy for management of cricopharyngeal achalasia (CA) in an 18-month-old child [^02448e2a]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

A 6-month-old patient presented with dysphagia and failure to thrive. Video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and manometry were diagnostic for CA. A gastrostomy tube was placed at 8 months. Botulinum toxin injection improved symptoms, but within 10 weeks symptoms returned. At 18 months, an uncomplicated endoscopic CPM was performed. A postoperative VFSS demonstrated cricopharyngeal bar resolution. Within 3 months, patient was feeding orally without a G tube. Pediatric CPA treatment options consist of dilation, botox, and transcervical CPM. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient treated with endoscopic CPM. Intraoperative video and photographs are presented.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^e6161e5d]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1

To address elevated endoscopic recurrence rates, the senior author has modified the surgical endoscopic midline myotomy to routinely remove the segment of cricopharyngeal muscle (and overlying mucosa) accessible between the two lateral margins of the rigid suspension diverticuloscope (Figure 1) [approximately a 1 cm block], down to the buccopharyngeal fascia, thereby performing a partial CP myectomy (CPMec). Identification of the buccopharyngeal fascia is considered the landmark for complete myotomy. This study aimed to evaluate long‐term outcomes of CPMec with Gold laser, utilizing quantitative fluoroscopic measures, dietary grading, and patient‐reported metrics.

1.2 Follow Up

Follow up fluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS) post‐CPM surgery are not routine, and are typically only used as a method of examining for an immediate postoperative perforation. However, if a patient presents with recurrence of symptoms then VFSS are usually performed for repeat assessment. Often a diverticulum will be seen; however, in the context of a past endoscopic myotomy, whether this is residual or recurrent can be unclear unless there was established postoperative imaging baseline. This risks patients being sent for unnecessary revision surgery. Therefore, our center routinely performs follow up VFSS at 3 months postmyotomy to establish the new baseline pharyngoesophageal segment opening (PESmax), pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), bolus clearance ratio (BCR), residual pouch depth or lip, and airway safety.

### Pharyngeal dilation in cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction and zenker diverticulum [^3971f399]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Prolonged obstruction at the level of the lower esophageal sphincter is associated with a dilated, poorly contractile esophagus. The association between prolonged obstruction at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and dilation and diminished contractility of the pharynx is uncertain. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the association between prolonged obstruction at the level of the UES and dilation and diminished contractility of the pharynx.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Methods

The fluoroscopic swallow studies of all persons with cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (CPD) diagnosed between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008 were retrospectively reviewed from a clinical database. Three categories of CPD were defined: nonobstructing cricopharyngeal bars (CPBs), obstructing CPBs, and Zenker diverticulum (ZD). The primary outcome measure was the pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), a surrogate measure of pharyngeal strength on fluoroscopy. Secondary outcome measures included pharyngeal area in the lateral fluoroscopic view and UES opening. The outcome measures were compared between groups and to a cohort of nondysphagic age- and gender-matched controls with the analysis of variance.

Results

A total of 100 fluoroscopic swallow studies were evaluated. The mean age (+ or -standard deviation) of the cohort was 70 years (+ or -10 years). Thirty-six percent were female. The mean PCR progressively increased, indicating diminishing pharyngeal strength, from the normal (0.08), to the nonobstructing CPB (0.13), to the obstructing CPB (0.22), to the ZD group (0.28) (P < .001 with trend for linearity). There was a linear increase in pharyngeal area from the normal (8.75 cm²) to the nonobstructing CPB (10.00 cm²), to the obstructing CPB (10.46 cm²), to the ZD group (11.82 cm²) (P < .01 with trend for linearity).

Conclusions

The data suggest that there is an association between cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction and progressive dilation and weakness of the pharynx. Laryngoscope, 2010.

Case

A 69-year-old woman with a medical history of GERD presented to our practice with progressive oropharyngeal dysphagia to solids. A barium esophagram showed a large cricopharyngeal bar causing obstruction of the cervical esophagus (Fig. 1; Video 1, available online at). Initial endoscopy showed a hypertrophic cricopharyngeal bar below the upper esophageal sphincter at 18 cm from the incisors (Fig. 2). CP-POEM was successfully performed without immediate adverse events or unintentional mucosal injury. The mucosal incision was completely closed with 5 through-the-scope clips (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Prophylactic antibiotics were administered during CP-POEM, as is our standard practice. The total procedure time was 32 minutes.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^0d77d194]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objectives

To describe cricopharyngeal myectomy (CPMec) with Gold laser for the treatment of CP bar with Zenker's diverticulum and evaluate long‐term outcomes of CPMec with Gold laser, utilizing quantitative fluoroscopic measures, dietary grading, and patient‐reported metrics.

Methods

All patients undergoing CPMec with Gold laser over a 14‐year period were evaluated. CPMec entails division of the diverticulum septum with removal of approximately 1 cm³ of muscle and mucosa. Demographic data, Eating Assessment Tool‐10 scores, and videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) parameters were compared pre‐ and postsurgery.

Results

Eighty‐four patients underwent 90 successfully completed CPMec with Gold laser. EAT‐10 scores decreased from mean of 20 to 2 (SD 9, p < 0.00) following surgery. Mean opening of the pharyngoesophageal segment (PESmax) improved from 0.56 to 0.86 cm (SD 0.4, p < 0.007), pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR) improved from 0.15 to 0.09 (SD 0.1, p < 0.000) and bolus clearance ratio (BCR) improved from 16% residue to 4% (SD 6%, p < 0.000) following surgery. Six recurrences occurred (6.7%) and all were successfully treated with further CPMec (completion rate 90/92, 98%). Four (4.4%) post‐operative leaks occurred, and all were managed conservatively.

Conclusion

CPMec with Gold laser is safe, achievable, and provides significant symptomatic and objective improvement in swallowing for those with CP bar and Zenker's diverticulum. Removal of tissue reduces recurrence rates following CPMec and does not increase chances of adverse events.

### Effect of cricopharyngeus muscle surgery on the pharynx [^19f1cd03]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (CPD) ranges from asymptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (CPB) to Zenker's diverticulum. Previous work suggests that CPD can result in dilation and weakening of the pharynx above the obstruction. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the ability of surgery on the cricopharyngeus muscle to improve pharyngeal area and strength.

Study Design

Retrospective case study.

Methods

Videofluoroscopic swallowing studies of all persons with CPD who underwent cricopharyngeus (CP) intervention followed by routine postoperative fluoroscopic study, between October 1, 1999 and January 1, 2010 were reviewed. Objective measures of pharyngeal area and constriction were obtained from pretreatment and post-treatment studies. Paired t tests and repeated measures analysis of variance were employed to compare results.

Results

Fifty-four patients were included. Pharyngeal constriction and pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening improved significantly after intervention (P < .05). Pharyngeal dilation was unchanged (P > .05). PES opening improved more with CP myotomy than with dilation and botulinum toxin.

Conclusions

Relief of CP obstruction by surgery or dilation improves pharyngeal constriction and PES opening. Dilation of the pharynx possibly related to prolonged outlet obstruction does not improve. CP myotomy appears more effective than dilation or botulinum toxin in relieving obstruction.

The patient developed a fever on postoperative day (POD) 1. A barium esophagram showed a defect in the posterior esophagus with collection of contrast concerning for a leak (Fig. 6, Video 1), which was confirmed on a CT scan. The esophageal leak was managed conservatively with a 7-day course of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and maintenance of nothing-by-mouth status. The patient became afebrile on POD 3; however, the patient's dysphagia and odynophagia persisted, and an esophageal leak was seen on a CT scan on POD 10 (Fig. 7, Video 1). A repeat EGD on POD 13 was notable for a dehisced mucosal incision with irregular borders, edematous mucosa, and a pant submucosal tunnel. An initial suture pattern was planned (Fig. 8, Video 1), but based on the characteristics of the defect during closure, a total of 5 tacks from 2 systems of a novel through-the-scope suturing (TTSS) system (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Tex) were placed sequentially in a running suture pattern. The first TTSS system was completely deployed before application of the second TTSS system. The total procedure time was 44 minutes. A repeat video fluoroscopic study was performed on POD 24, which showed no leak in the proximal esophagus (Fig. 9, Video 1). Repeat endoscopy was performed on POD 76 (Video 1). The site of prior mucosal defect was well healed without evidence of a persistent defect or cricopharyngeal bar. The tacks remained in place and were removed with snare mucosectomy. The total procedure time was 10 minutes. The patient subsequently had complete resolution of dysphagia, odynophagia, and globus sensation.

### Primary cricopharyngeal dysfunction: treatment with balloon catheter dilatation [^856596c6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Primary cricopharyngeal dysfunction (PCD) is a rare, idiopathic, functional disorder of the upper esophageal sphincter, characterized by dysphagia, frequent aspiration, and functional narrowing at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter.

Methods

Five of 29 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia were found to have PCD. Patients presented with severe dysphagia and predisposition to aspiration. Radiography demonstrated narrowing at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter and aspiration. An endoscope could be introduced into the esophagus in only 2 patients before dilation.

Observations

In contrast to organic stenoses, these functional upper esophageal sphincter stenoses were dilated without difficulty with a balloon catheter. After low-pressure (1.5–2 atm) progressive balloon dilation (to 20 mm), superficial mucosal injury was observed only in one patient. After dilatation, symptoms resolved and barium swallow demonstrated normal passage through the upper esophageal sphincter. During a mean follow-up of 21 months (7–33), redilation was necessary in only 1 case.

Conclusions

Balloon catheter dilatation of PCD is minimally invasive and provides both important diagnostic information and effective therapy. It should be the first choice of therapy for PCD.

### Manofluorographic and functional outcomes after endoscopic laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for cricopharyngeal bar [^144cdfcf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the manofluorographic and functional outcomes after endoscopic laser cricopharyngeal myotomy (ELCPM) for cricopharyngeal (CP) bar.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Subjects and Methods

Review of patients undergoing ELCPM between 2001 and 2007 was undertaken to determine the demographic, clinical, and manofluorographic findings before and six months after surgery. Two groups were established according to pharyngeal driving pressures: normal pressure group (> 55 mm Hg) and low pressure group (< 55 mm Hg).

Results

Fourteen patients underwent ELCPM for CP bar without a concomitant head and neck or Zenker's procedure. There were no major surgical complications. All 14 patients improved at least one stage on the Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale (FOSS) after surgery. There was a statistically significant decrease in the FOSS stages after surgery. Videofluoroscopy demonstrated a significant postoperative increase in the mean cross-sectional CP opening (CP-area) from 32.75 to 123.52 mm². Manofluorographic pressure recordings showed a significant postoperative decrease in the intrabolus pressure gradient across the cricopharyngeal region (IB-Gra) from 25.44 to 13.22 mm Hg. Despite significant overall results, the change in the IB-Gra showed no difference between the patient groups.

Conclusion

Subjective (FOSS) and objective manofluorographic (CP-area, IB-Gra) improvement in CP bar patients occurred after ELCPM. We suggest IB-Gra as a reliable objective indicator for patients who might benefit from ELCPM and as an appropriate parameter for follow-up after surgery. However, continued research on a larger patient population is required to enhance our understanding of CP bar and predictors of outcome after treatment of CP bar dysphagia.

### Underwater cricopharyngeal peroral endoscopic myotomy [^e0c84511]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a well-established third-space endoscopic technique that can be technically challenging when used to treat a cricopharyngeal bar, even for experienced operators, due to the limited working space in the hypopharynx and upper esophageal sphincter. Here we propose the use of saline immersion to improve the technical success rate of the procedure.

We present the case of a 58-year-old woman with a history of inclusion body myositis for 10 years and dysphagia due to a symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar for 3 years (Fig. 1). We performed cricopharyngeal POEM under general anesthesia. Once the cricopharyngeal bar was identified, thermal markings were made at the entry point < 1 cm proximally using a triangle-tip knife. A submucosal bleb was created using indigo carmine and saline, followed by a transverse mucosotomy. A short submucosal tunnel was created using spray coagulation. To gain entry into the tunnel, facilitate further dissection, and ultimately perform the myotomy, saline immersion was used to lift the mucosa away from the cricopharyngeal muscle (Video 1, Fig. 2). The myotomy was extended 2 cm beyond the cricopharyngeal muscle to ensure complete division. The resistance at the hypopharynx was eliminated. The mucosotomy was closed longitudinally using four hemoclips (Fig. 3). After the dysphagia had resolved and the esophagogram showed no leaks, the patient was discharged on day 3. Barium swallow performed 15 days after the procedure showed resolution of the cricopharyngeal bar and complete passage of barium (Fig. 4). At the 1 month follow-up, the patient reported resolution of her dysphagia.

Cricopharyngeal bars (CPBs) are fibrous thickenings of the cricopharyngeus (CP) muscle that can rarely lead to dysphagia. Established treatment modalities include esophageal dilation, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection, and surgical cricopharyngeal myotomy. There has been no reported experience with peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) for symptomatic CPBs.

### Obstruction-related dysphagia in inclusion body myositis: cricopharyngeal bar on videofluoroscopy indicates risk of aspiration [^e9baaef6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To show the predictive risk factors for aspiration pneumonia and prognostic importance of a cricopharyngeal bar (CPB) on videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing (VFS) in inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Methods

In this retrospective study, we examined a consecutive series of 37 patients with clinico-pathologically defined IBM based on the European Neuromuscular Center diagnostic criteria for IBM from 2013. The Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire was used for the evaluation of dysphagia. A standard VFS was performed at diagnosis. The primary outcome was aspiration pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included IBM Functional Rating Scale score, forced vital capacity (FVC), and body mass index.

Results

Aspiration pneumonia occurred in 10 of 37 IBM patients (27%). Based on univariate analysis, 4 factors increased aspiration pneumonia risk: BMI < 18.5 (n = 5; hazard ratio [HR], 10.7; 95% CI, 2.50–46.0; p = .001); aspiration (n = 7; HR, 7.57; 95% CI, 1.82–31.6; p = .005); insufficient opening of the upper esophageal sphincter (n = 11; HR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.12–18.3; p = .03); and CPB presence (n = 15; HR, 11.6; 95% CI, 1.46–91.8; p = .02). Clinical features of IBM-CPB(+) were elderly onset, obstruction-related dysphagia, and mild decreases in FVC, resulting in aspiration pneumonia in 1.3 years (interquartile range, 0.9–5.2); 67% of IBM-CPB(+) patients underwent interventional procedures for dysphagia. IBM-CPB(+) patients had a lower FVC than IBM-CPB(-).

Conclusions

A CPB in IBM largely contributes to obstruction-related dysphagia and is a risk factor that predicts aspiration pneumonia and refractory dysphagia requiring aggressive therapy.

### UK guidelines on oesophageal dilatation in clinical practice [^2418bdd1]. Gut (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for esophageal rings and webs, more specifically with respect to endoscopic dilation (technical considerations), BSG 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing upper esophageal sphincter dilation for the treatment of dysphagia in patients with disordered upper esophageal sphincter opening, post-cricoid web, cricopharyngeal bar with or without the presence of a Zenker's diverticulum, or to permit passage of radiofrequency ablation catheters.

### Zenker's diverticulum: advancing beyond the tunnel [^627605e4]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Submucosal fibrosis, commonly seen in patients who have undergone prior treatment, limits submucosal dissection. In this setting, a hybrid technique can be adopted, whereby a traditional septotomy is performed until submucosal tissue is visualized. Submucosal tunneling then allows exposure of the base of the septum for a full-thickness myotomy. A major difference between Z-POEM and standard FECM is that the mucosal flap is left intact after Z-POEM. For management of large ZD, where persistence of the mucosal flap may contribute to residual dysphagia, we propose Z-POEM with mucosotomy. The added tunneling technique in Z-POEM with mucosotomy allows exposure of the muscular layer at the critical point (ie, at the base of the diverticulum). This helps to ensure that a complete myotomy is achieved, theoretically reducing the risk of recurrence, although comparative trials are awaited to confirm this. Finally, the demonstrated techniques can be adapted to treatment of other esophageal diseases. For example, despite the absence of a diverticular pouch or septum in cricopharyngeal bar, a modified Z-POEM can be performed. Furthermore, concurrent cricopharyngeal bar and distal esophageal diverticulum can be treated in a single session.

### Cricopharyngeal myotomy in the treatment of zenker's diverticulum [^2e93507f]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Transection of the cricopharyngeus muscle supposedly is of crucial therapeutic importance, because of its hypothesized pathogenic role in Zenker's diverticulum (ZD). This retrospective, nonrandomized study evaluates the outcomes of surgical therapy, with reference to cricopharyngeal myotomy (CM).

Study Design

Seventy-nine patients underwent diverticulectomy from 1985 to 1999. Group A (n = 47; men:women, 29:18; mean age ± SD: 69 ± 12 [range 35 to 87] years) underwent CM because of clearly discernible hypertrophic transverse fibers. In group B (n = 32; men:women, 22:10; mean age ± SD 68 ± 13 [range 36 to 95] years), without such transverse fibers, no CM was carried out. Dysphagia, regurgitation, and diverticular radiomorphology were classified according to ordinal scales. Diverticular volumes were calculated from barium swallows. Postoperative symptoms and outcomes were evaluated by questionnaires sent to the patients.

Results

The two groups did not differ significantly in severity of preoperative dysphagia and regurgitation, radiomorphology, or median diverticular volume. Both groups experienced postoperative alleviation of symptoms (p < 0.001), persisting slightly in 11 of 47 (23%) group A and 4 of 32 (13%) group B patients (p > 0.05). Of these, seven group A (64%) patients and three group B patients (75%) had additional upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases. Recurrent diverticula occurred in one patient and postoperative complications in five patients per group (p > 0.05). Diverticular volume and upper GIT comorbidities, but not CM, were significant risk factors for persistent symptoms in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

CM has no significant influence on postoperative results, if carried out depending on the anatomic state and configuration of the cricopharyngeus muscle. This is suggested by the favorable outcomes of patients, with persistent symptoms being caused by factors other than CM.

### Over-the-bar peroral endoscopic myotomy for the therapy of treatment-refractory cricopharyngeal dysphagia [^be48d3ea]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates the use of a modified, over-the-muscle C-POEM technique to treat symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar. The superiority of this technique is that it allows for the precision of submucosal dissection and performance of a full-thickness myotomy without the need for a long submucosal tunnel, which can be difficult to perform in patients who have scarring such as from prior interventions. The more distal point of entry also assists with closure, as moving away from the tight hypopharynx and working over the bar enlarges the procedural working space. We find this technique particularly beneficial in patients who are expected to have significant submucosal fibrosis, as highlighted in this case. The concept of minimizing or forgoing tunneling to improve working space and facilitate closure has previously been demonstrated to be effective in peroral endoscopic myotomy for treatment of Zenker's diverticulum, in which similar challenges may be encountered, and this case shows that these concepts can be readily applied to C-POEM. Endoscopists should consider moving away from proximal tunneling in favor of working directly over the cricopharyngeus muscle (Video 1, available online at).

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^293c6793]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated that C-POEM is a safe and effective treatment option for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar, with a high rate of technical success. In addition, early follow-up data show that the procedure is associated with good clinical success. C-POEM offers the benefit of a controlled and more complete myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle fibers. The endoscopist can directly visualize the dissection, as opposed to balloon dilatation where it is unclear how much the muscular fibers are being disrupted. Balloon dilatation is often used as the first-line intervention, because it is safe (adverse events in ≤ 5%, often from mucosal tears), can be completed as a day-case, provides acceptable initial relief of symptoms (> 80% clinical success), and can be repeated. However, recurrence is common, with 57% requiring repeat dilatation, and 17% proceeding to surgical myotomy in 1 retrospective series. The benefit of an endoscopic approach (e.g. rigid, flexible) is that it mitigates against some of the major risks of surgery, which can include recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, fistula formation, and mediastinitis. Risks from any type of myotomy have been reported to range from 0–39%, with the risk of open myotomy 13.6% in 1 study, compared to 7.4% in the largest C-POEM series to date. Regarding outcomes, endoscopic myotomy has shown equivalent efficacy, and in 1 report better efficacy, compared to traditional open myotomy.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^f19b012a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peroral endoscopy myotomy (POEM) is a minimally invasive procedure of the so called "third space". The overarching principal is creation of a mucosal incision, careful dissection of the submucosal space with electrosurgical knives (i.e. tunneling), myotomy, and finally closure of the mucosal incision. This procedure was originally applied to the treatment of achalasia (E-POEM), and later to Zenker diverticulum (Z-POEM), gastroparesis (G-POEM), and epiphrenic diverticulum (D-POEM). More recently, it has emerged as a potential treatment for refractory cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM).

A cricopharyngeal bar refers to a radiological description of a prominent cricopharyngeal muscle. While this may be incidental, it can lead to significant oropharyngeal dysphagia due to incoordination of the upper esophageal sphincter and true luminal narrowing (Fig. 1). Traditional treatments have included balloon dilatation, botulinum toxin injection, and surgical myotomy. C-POEM is a new technique that allows careful transection of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Early data from case series are encouraging, with high technical and clinical success rates based on the resolution of symptoms. The largest cohort to date is a retrospective series on 27 patients that had a technical success of 100%, clinical success of 100% over a median follow up of 42 months, and an adverse event rate of 7.4%. Here, we report our experience of 5 patients undergoing C-POEM for symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar with a step-by-step video demonstration.

Figure 3
A, Postprocedural endoscopic image. B, Postprocedural anteroposterior image from a gastrografin swallow.

A Zenker diverticulum is an outpouching arising above the cricopharyngeal bar at upper endoscopy, and its sac lies posterior to the cervical esophagus on lateral images and in the midline on anteroposterior images. By contrast, a Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is an outpouching arising from the anterolateral wall of the cervical esophagus inferior to the cricopharyngeus at upper endoscopy, and its sac lies off midline on anteroposterior images. The adverse events of an esophageal diverticulum include obstruction, perforation, ulceration, bleeding, and fistula. Standard management for a symptomatic Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is surgery, but endoscopic management adopting the same technique as for a Zenker diverticulotomy may be considered. Submucosal tunneling endoscopic septum division could also be considered, with the advantage of maintaining mucosal integrity. For operative candidates, surgery by a transcervical approach is favored because of the concern for recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the management of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM): a case series and video demonstration [^d44d5c4f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite this evidence of high technical and clinical success rates, C-POEM can be a challenging procedure, given the tight working space of the hypopharynx. One of our patients, who had previously undergone intervention, had a mucosal leak post-procedure. Leak following C-POEM is one of the major concerns; the risk may be higher in those have undergone previous attempted intervention, because of significant submucosal fibrosis. Therefore, although balloon dilatation is a reasonable alternative, successive dilatations could lead to submucosal fibrosis, making the subsequent myotomy, if required, more difficult. We recognize concerns about C-POEM recently raised by Pittala et al, who reported 3 cases that all developed an esophageal leak post-endoscopy. They determined that this was due to difficulty working within the hypopharynx and conducting the initial mucosotomy, alongside other technical aspects. We would agree that the most challenging aspect of the procedure is the mucosotomy, which sets the precedent for a successful procedure. It is interesting to see that Pittala et al started their mucosotomy 2 cm above the bar, whereas we would argue that the mucosotomy should take place directly over the bar to ensure orientation and enable tunnelling down into the esophagus, rather than inadvertently into the pharynx. Use of a conical transparent distal attachment can help within the tight space of the hypopharynx. Placement of endoscopic clips at the end of the procedure can be very challenging, but they are essential to ensure mucosal apposition to prevent leak development. These anatomical considerations of working within the patients' hypopharynx should be considered before embarking on the procedure. Swei et al, recently reported on their difficulty undertaking C-POEM because of this very issue. They underwent a modified approach with initial cricopharyngeal muscle dissection followed by tunnelling to ensure a complete myotomy, which may help to mitigate against the risk of leak.

### Transoral resection of short segment zenker's diverticulum and cricopharyngeal myotomy: an alternative minimally invasive approach [^4dae0088]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Transoral treatment of cricopharyngeal bar and small Zenker's diverticulum remains a challenge. We propose a new transoral approach for transoral cricopharyngeal myotomy (TOCPM) for patients with cricopharyngeal spasm and pharyngeal bar, and for transoral resection of diverticula (TORD) with cricopharyngeal myotomy in the patient with small (< 3 cm) Zenker's diverticulum.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of 45 patients with cricopharyngeal spasm (21) and Zenker's diverticulum (24), where 14 patients were considered suitable for TORD and TOCPM. TOCPM used the Weerda laryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) to expose the cricopharyngeal bar using a microscope; the mucosa is cut and then the muscle is transected using monopolar cautery. A 0 degrees endoscope is inserted through the incision to ensure complete myotomy. Incision closure is by interrupted 4–0 Vicryl sutures (Ethicon Inc, Somerville, NJ) and fibrin glue. For the TORD procedure, the diverticular sac is everted and then resected using scissors. Through the sac opening, the TOCPM is completed. The sac opening is then closed as described in TOCPM. The patients are kept without food for 24 hours, followed by feeding and discharge. Modified barium swallow (MBS) evaluated functional results.

Results

Fourteen patients underwent TOCPM (eight), and TOCPM+TORD (six). There was one case of TOCPM that was aborted due to excessive bleeding, which prevented full myotomy. The rest did well. All were discharged the next day. Two poor results from the TOCPM and TOCPM+TORD group were due to poor esophageal motility. The remainder of patients had resolution of dysphagia and normalized MBS. No patient developed stricture or complications.

Conclusions

Short segment Zenker's diverticulum and cricopharyngeal bar can now be addressed completely with a transoral approach. Because there is complete closure of the mucosal incision, prolonged hospitalization can be avoided.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for cricopharyngeal bar [^2d304fc3]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Definitive treatment options for refractory dysphagia due to cricopharyngeal bar are limited. We aimed to demonstrate a novel adaptation of peroral endoscopic myotomy to treat this condition (cricopharyngeal peroral endoscopic myotomy [c-POEM]).

Methods

The approach to c-POEM is similar to that in the distal esophagus for the treatment of achalasia. A submucosal injection and overlying mucosal incision are performed, ideally 1.5 to 2 cm upstream of the upper esophageal sphincter, and then a submucosal tunnel is extended beyond the level of the cricopharyngeus. The target muscle is then transected before closure of the mucosotomy.

Results

In 3 cases of refractory cricopharyngeal bar, c-POEM was successfully performed. Although no major adverse events occurred, significant postprocedural edema at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter prolonged hospitalization in 2 of the 3 patients. After recovery, all patients reported complete resolution of dysphagia and tolerated an unrestricted diet.

Conclusions

C-POEM allows reliable and complete muscular division in patients with refractory cricopharyngeal bar who have limited treatment options.

6 Conclusion

Endoscopic Gold‐laser assisted CPMec for management of CP bar with Zenker's diverticulum is successful in improving UES opening, improving pharyngeal clearance, and efficiency. The rate of recurrence is lower than other endoscopic techniques, and there was no increase in adverse events. CPMec is safe and achievable for patients with CP bar and ZD.

### Zenker's diverticulum: advancing beyond the tunnel [^82f36127]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) is attributed to a poorly compliant cricopharyngeus muscle, and the mainstay of treatment is a cricopharyngeal myotomy. We present a video series summarizing endoscopic treatment options for ZD and related conditions.

Methods

We review the rationale and key technique for various endoscopic treatment modalities for ZD, cricopharyngeal bar, and other esophageal diverticula.

Results

Standard flexible endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy involves the division of the common wall or septum of the ZD, aiming for complete transection of the cricopharyngeus. However, recurrence rates are high, likely owing to incomplete myotomy. Zenker's peroral endoscopic myotomy (Z-POEM) uses a proximal submucosal tunnel to provide direct visualization of the cricopharyngeus and septum, allowing confirmation of complete myotomy. We demonstrate an over-the-septum modification to simplify the technique. Submucosal fibrosis, commonly seen in patients with prior treatment, limits submucosal dissection. We present a hybrid technique to overcome this, whereby a traditional septotomy is performed until submucosal tissue is visualized. The intact mucosal flap after Z-POEM in a large ZD may contribute to residual dysphagia. We propose Z-POEM with mucosotomy for large ZD. Finally, we demonstrate modifications for treatment of other esophageal diseases, including cricopharyngeal bar and non-Zenker's esophageal diverticula.

Conclusion

Endoscopic treatment options for ZD and related conditions are rapidly expanding. With careful tailoring to individual patient characteristics, our expanding arsenal of options allows effective and safe treatment of a broad spectrum of patients.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^d03307d2]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Endoscopic myotomy for obstructive CP pathology is well‐recognized as providing significant symptom relief and airway protection for patients with CP dysfunction with or without ZD. The endoscopic route is safe and fast, reducing chances of complications. Critics of the endoscopic approach cite an increased recurrence rate over time compared to open surgery, which may be due to the standard procedure of ECPM performing a midline myotomy and leaving the cut edges of the muscle in close proximity, allowing healing to re‐establish circumferential connection. In addition, scar tissue at the division site may reduce distensibility of the PES region. In this study, we have performed endoscopic CPMec, removing a segment of muscle and mucosa, to reduce the chance of reformation of the CP bar. The 6.7% rate of recurrence is lower than previously published series that report recurrence rates between 17% and 45%. This suggests that removing tissue to ensure a larger muscle division results in a reduction in the risk of the incised edges healing together. In the six individuals with recurrence, further endoscopic treatment with the same surgical strategy was utilized and successful in all cases. Removal of this muscle segment did not increase complication rates or result in other adverse consequences. No subjects describe problematic reflux issues.

### Cricopharyngeal spasm and zenker's diverticulum [^af91785b]. Head & Neck (2003). Low credibility.

Cricopharyngeal spasm and Zenker's diverticulum represent disorders of the pharyngoesophageal junction for which a unifying theory of etiology has yet to be established. There is, however, a large body of evidence that supports an association with gastroesophageal reflux. Cricopharyngeal myotomy is the key to successful management of both disorders. Newer transoral endoscopic techniques of management have a lower overall morbidity than traditional open approaches in appropriately selected patients and are therefore gaining popularity as the preferred method of treatment.

### Over-the-bar peroral endoscopic myotomy for the therapy of treatment-refractory cricopharyngeal dysphagia [^72889d1b]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the treatment of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM) is becoming more widespread. The initial approach to C-POEM can be technically challenging because of limited working space at the upper esophageal sphincter near the hypopharynx. In addition, because C-POEM is a newer technique, many referred patients have been refractory to previous therapies, and prior interventions predispose patients to significant submucosal fibrosis. These difficulties may lead to unsuccessful mucosal closure and resultant esophageal leak. We propose a modified, over-the-bar approach to facilitate closure.

### Prevalence of esophageal webs in patients undergoing direct laryngoscopy [^54f4e5cf]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

The paucity of literature regarding PES webs is also likely related to diagnostic challenges on endoscopy and fluoroscopy. Because of the basal tone of the cricopharyngeus muscle and the elastic collapse and mucosal redundancy of the PES, sufficient distension of the PES is imperative for adequate endoscopic visualization and impacts the diagnostic sensitivity of endoscopy for webs. The use of a rigid laryngoscope in this study provides favorable exposure, simultaneously acting as a stent and endoscope to evaluate the PES. In contrast, flexible esophagoscopy relies on gaseous insufflation for esophageal distension and may be suboptimal for visualization of the PES and accurate diagnosis of webs, particularly if performed under general anesthesia.

Allen et al. and Ekberg and Nylander estimated the prevalence of PES webs on fluoroscopic imaging to be 12.5%–14% in patients with dysphagia and up to 7% in normal volunteers, and authors from both studies identified the importance of distension of the PES with a sizeable contrast bolus for accurate diagnosis. Radiologic evaluation of the PES on barium fluoroscopy is additionally limited by resolution and frame rate. A barium swallow (esophagram) typically obtains images at 4 frames/s, although this can vary widely between institutions, while a modified barium swallow typically captures 15–30 frames/s. Even with an adequate frame rate, PES webs are typically only visualized on a limited number of frames throughout an entire imaging sequence and may be missed without careful review during the passage of the contrast bolus through the PES (Figure 3). These diagnostic challenges with barium fluoroscopy may account for the lower prevalence in these imaging studies compared to our cohort.

A barium esophagram revealed Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) (Fig. 1 A), and he subsequently underwent cricopharyngeal myotomy with a flexible endoscope (Video 1, available online at). Both flexible and rigid endoscopic myotomy are treatment modalities for ZD; however, the flexible approach may be preferred in the elderly because there is a lower failure rate in this population, who may have limited neck extension.

Endoscopy with the patient under general anesthesia was performed. Nasogastric intubation notably was difficult, given the degree of hypertrophy of the cricopharyngeus (Fig. 1 B). A nasogastric tube was successfully placed and remained in place to separate the posterior esophageal wall and diverticulum while the septum was incised. The cricopharyngeus was initially incised with a needle-knife and later with a ceramic ball insulated tip knife. The neck and chest were periodically examined for crepitus to assess for esophageal perforation. After a successful incision through the cricopharyngeus, through-the-scope clips were placed to close any potential defect between the esophagus and the diverticulum (Figs. 1 C-F). A barium esophagram after the myotomy revealed a small residual ZD (Fig. 1 G), with subsequent resolution of dysphagia.

### Pharyngeal stasis of secretions in patients with zenker diverticulum [^1a25f976]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with Zenker diverticulum are more likely to have stasis of secretions in the left piriform sinus, on in-office endoscopy, than patients with nonspecific dysphagia.

Study Design

A case-control study.

Setting

A subspecialty swallowing clinic.

Subjects and Methods

All patients with radiographically confirmed Zenker diverticulum who were evaluated over a 5-year period were selected. A control group with dysphagia due to radiographically confirmed esophageal dysmotility, prominent cricopharyngeal bar, or stricture was identified. Two blinded laryngologists reviewed the recorded laryngopharyngoscopies.

Results

Thirty-four patients with Zenker diverticulum were identified; 11 were excluded because of previous surgery or other neurological conditions. Twelve (52.17%) of the remaining 23 Zenker diverticulum patients and 2 of the 73 (2.74%) control patients had greater pooling in the left versus right piriform sinus (2-tailed t test, P < .0001). The sensitivity of this physical examination finding in identifying patients with Zenker diverticulum was 52.17% (95% confidence interval, 31.08%-72.58%) and specificity was 97.26% (95% confidence interval, 89.56–99.52%). Patients with Zenker diverticulum less than 4 cm in size had increased pooling in the left versus right piriform compared with larger diverticulums. After surgical intervention, there was a statistically significant decrease in the asymmetrical pooling (2-tailed t test, P = 0.0067).

Conclusion

Increased pooling in the left compared with the right piriform, on in-office endoscopy, is predictive of the presence of a Zenker diverticulum. This information can sharpen clinical acumen in evaluating patients with dysphagia. In turn, it will help the clinician counsel the patient regarding diagnosis and radiographic imaging.

### Swallowing outcomes after cricopharyngeal myotomy: a systematic review [^79ab4bfc]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

No practice guidelines have been established for swallowing outcomes after cricopharyngeal myotomy (CPM). The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize evidence for swallowing outcomes in patients undergoing CPM to treat symptomatic cricopharyngeal dysfunction, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol.

Methods

Swallowing outcomes examined included penetration/aspiration ratings, manometric measures, patient-rated dysphagia scales, clinician-rated dysphagia scales, diet level, and weight.

Results

Three databases were queried for studies published between January 1995 and July 2015, resulting in a total of 122 full-text eligible records. Studies were screened and reviewed, culminating in 10 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal of study design, swallowing outcomes measures, and statistical analysis were summarized.

Conclusion

This systematic review revealed insufficient evidence for guiding clinical practice. Future investigations should use validated patient-rated and clinician-rated instruments as well as detailed high-resolution manometry measures to optimally capture postoperative swallowing outcomes.

### Relationship between swallow motility disorders on videofluorography and oral intake in patients treated for head and neck cancer with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy [^5aa15b33]. Head & Neck (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current research demonstrates that swallow function is impaired after treatment with organ-sparing chemoradiotherapy. Few studies, however, have related observed swallowing disorders with the patient's oral intake and diet in a large cohort of patients.

Methods

Swallowing function was examined using the modified barium swallow (MBS) procedure in 170 patients treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for cancer of the head and neck at 5 evaluation points: pretreatment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the relationship between swallow motility disorders and oral intake or diet consistencies.

Results

Limitations in oral intake and diet during the first year after cancer treatment were significantly related to reduced laryngeal elevation, reduced cricopharyngeal opening, and rating of nonfunctional swallow on at least 1 swallow of any bolus type.

Conclusions

Swallow motility disorders had a significant impact on the eating ability of patients after treatment for head and neck cancer with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.

### The role of barium esophagography in an endoscopy world [^65417eea]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Barium esophagography, although an old test, remains important to the understanding of esophageal physiology and diagnosis of esophageal disorders. It provides additive and/or confirmatory information to endoscopy and is the more accurate means of yielding diagnosis. Barium esophagography allows correlation of symptoms with barium findings and with varied textures substances. It allows, particularly for oropharyngeal dysfunction, implementation therapeutic maneuvers and instructions while testing. The caveat to maintaining the benefits of barium esophagography is continuing to promote and support expertise from our radiologists in performing these studies, which has been challenged by our cost-efficient and high-tech medical society.

### Robotic cricopharyngeal myotomy for the treatment of cricopharyngeal bars [^f1437928]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Failure of the cricopharyngeal muscle to relax leads to the formation of a cricopharyngeal (CP) bar which causes dysphagia and increased risk for aspiration. Open myotomy is one definitive treatment option; however, there are several drawbacks including a long neck incision, possible drain placement, and invasiveness of the procedure. We aim to share an updated dataset of our experience using the DaVinci robotic platform to perform a minimally invasive CP myotomy, which has never been described before prior to our original dataset.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of consecutive robotic CP myotomies performed in adult patients by a single surgeon from August 2021 to March 2024. Outcomes of interest included length of procedure, time to diet resumption, hospital length of stay, complications, symptom improvement at follow-up, and symptom recurrence.

Results

Twenty-five robotic CP myotomies were performed. The median age was 72 years old (62–91) and near evenly split between sexes (n = 13 female, 52%) with a median BMI of 28.5 kg/m² (17.7–39.5). The median procedure length was 111 min (75–141), and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients underwent a post-procedural esophagram with no leaks identified. All patients were started on a full liquid diet in the recovery room prior to discharge. Same-day discharge rate was 88%. Symptom resolution was reported in 23/24 patients (95.8%) who completed post-operative follow-up. There was one delayed subacute hematoma with wound dehiscence but no other complications and no readmissions. Two patients reported recurrent symptoms but only one with radiographic evidence of a recurrent cricopharyngeal bar.

Conclusion

Robotic cricopharyngeal myotomy represents a promising treatment for cricopharyngeal bars with cervical dysphagia with encouraging safety and efficacy.

### The robot can break bars with the best of them: a novel approach to treating cricopharyngeal bars with myotomy [^7449f077]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Failure of the cricopharyngeus to relax results in oropharyngeal dysphagia, which over time results in hypertrophy and increased risk for aspiration. Open myotomy is one definitive treatment option, however there are several drawbacks attributable to the long neck incision, ± drain placement, and invasiveness of the procedure. We aim to share our experience using the DaVinci robotic platform to perform a minimally invasive cricopharyngeal myotomy, which has never been described before in the literature.

Methods

All robotic cricopharyngeal myotomies performed in adult patients by a single surgeon from 2021 to 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. No patients were excluded. Outcomes of interest included length of procedure, time to diet resumption, hospital length of stay, complications, symptom improvement at follow-up, and symptom recurrence.

Results

Eight robotic cricopharyngeal myotomies were performed. The median age was 65 years old (62–91) and mostly female (n = 5, 56%) with a median BMI of 28.9 kg/m² (21.7–39.5). The median procedure length was 113 min (94–141) and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients underwent a post-procedural esophagram with no leaks were identified. All patients were started on clear liquids in recovery and transitioned to full liquids prior to discharge. All but one patient was subsequently discharged home on the same day as procedure. All patients had routine 2-week post-operative follow-up in addition to phone follow-up at a later date (6–11 months post-operative). All patients reported resolution of symptoms. There were no complications or readmissions. No instances of recurrence were reported. On cost analysis, the minimally invasive robotic approach allows for an outpatient procedure with similar cost to an open approach with a one-night stay.

Conclusion

Our experience with the novel technique of minimally invasive robotic cricopharyngeal myotomy for cricopharyngeal bars with cervical dysphagia is safe, efficacious, less invasive, and cost saving, with excellent patient outcomes.

### Gold laser cricopharyngeal myectomy for cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^68fc5409]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Limitations

This study is a retrospective case series without randomization, and as such presents selection bias. There is no control cohort for comparison. All participants received the same surgical procedure from the same surgeon. Blinding was not possible in measuring the VFSS, as dates of studies indicated pre‐ and postsurgical timeframes; however, the clinicians undertaking VFSS measurement did not review patients in the clinic nor have access to their EAT‐10 scores. The exact amount of tissue removed was not standardized but was undertaken in a consistent manner for each patient. Future work will compare those undergoing CPMec with patients undergoing flexible endoscope‐mediated CPM and examine differences in outcomes.

### Pathophysiology of GERD… [^af3f5fd3]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of GERD The primary barrier to gastroesophageal reflux is the lower esophageal sphincter, which is located at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus and acts as the main deterrant to reflux. The upper esophageal sphincter consists mainly of the cricopharyngeal muscle and a small portion of the circular muscle fibers of the esophagus immediately distal to it. The upper esophageal sphincter is referred to as the pharyngoesophageal junction and serves as the main barrier in preventing laryngopharyngeal reflux. caused by dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter); halitosis; buccal burning; otalgia; food sticking in the throat; pharyngeal tightness; a choking sensation; aerophagia; and water brash. Laryngopharyngeal reflux should be suspected in patients who present with any of these symptoms.

Although oropharyngeal dysphagia can result from GERD, other causes must be considered, especially if this symptom persists despite adequate treatment for GERD. Of course, this principle applies to all of the symptoms listed above, since they can also have other causes. PHARYNGEAL The pharyngeal complications of GERD include cricopharyngeal dysfunction, chronic pharyngitis and Zenker's diverticulum. 3, 15–17 Zenker's diverticulum is a posterior pulsion pseudodiverticulum that arises from Killian's area. This area is located posterior to and bounded superiorly by the cricopharyngeal muscle and inferiorly by the inferior pharyngeal muscle. Because of the inherent muscle weakness in this area, it is predisposed to the development of Zenker's diverticulum. Zenker's diverticulum results from increased intraluminal pressure caused by cricopharyngeal muscle spasm, which has been linked to gastroesophageal reflux.

3 Regurgitation of partially digested food should alert the clinician to the possibility of a Zenker's diverticulum. A small asymptomatic Zenker's diverticulum can be managed with observation. Surgical therapy is reserved for patients with a large or symptomatic diverticulum.

### The modified barium swallow and the functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing [^1ca6a6ce]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews the current standard of care for the instrumental evaluation of swallow function using the modified barium swallow (MBS) and the functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Both the MBS and FEES are valuable procedures for evaluating dysphagia and show good agreement with diagnostic findings as related to tracheal aspiration, laryngeal penetration, pharyngeal residue, diet level, and compensatory swallow safety strategies. The use of the MBS and FEES has advantages and disadvantages and both should be considered the gold standard for evaluating swallow function.

### Flexible endoscopic diverticulotomies for bilateral zenker's diverticula (with videos) [^ab026e3a]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) is the posterior pulsion diverticulum below the esophageal introitus through or above the cricopharyngeal muscle. We report a unique case of bilateral ZD that was successfully treated with an endoscopic diverticulotomies on the bilateral cricopharyngeal bars.

Study Design

Case report at a tertiary referral center.

Methods

A patient with bilateral ZD who failed surgery underwent two endoscopic diverticulotomies on the bilateral cricopharyngeal bars. Outcome measures were symptomatic improvement and radiological measurements.

Results

After up to 18 months follow-up, the patient enjoys near complete symptomatic resolution with associated radiological improvements.

Conclusions

Endotherapy can disrupt the circular muscle of the cricopharyngeal bar, decrease the depth of bar, increase the esophageal ZD diameter, and create an opening of the diverticulum allowing diverticular drainage into the esophagus.

### How to effectively use and interpret the barium swallow: current role in esophageal dysphagia [^207bc4c0]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The barium swallow is a commonly performed investigation, though recent decades have seen major advances in other esophageal diagnostic modalities.

Purpose

The purpose of this review is to clarify the rationale for components of the barium swallow protocol, provide guidance on interpretation of findings, and describe the current role of the barium swallow in the diagnostic paradigm for esophageal dysphagia in relation to other esophageal investigations. The barium swallow protocol, interpretation, and reporting terminology are subjective and non-standardized. Common reporting terminology and an approach to their interpretation are provided. A timed barium swallow (TBS) protocol provides more standardized assessment of esophageal emptying but does not evaluate peristalsis. Barium swallow may have higher sensitivity than endoscopy for detecting subtle strictures. Barium swallow has lower overall accuracy than high-resolution manometry for diagnosing achalasia but can help secure the diagnosis in cases of equivocal manometry. TBS has an established role in objective assessment of therapeutic response in achalasia and helps identify the cause of symptom relapse. Barium swallow has a role in the evaluating manometric esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, in some cases helping to identify where it represents an achalasia-like syndrome. Barium swallow should be performed in dysphagia following bariatric or anti-reflux surgery, to assess for both structural and functional postsurgical abnormality. Barium swallow remains a useful investigation in esophageal dysphagia, though its role has evolved due to advancements in other diagnostics. Current evidence-based guidance regarding its strengths, weaknesses, and current role are described in this review.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^1c51fcab]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT LANDSCAPE

Although, there is currently no pharmacologic cure for IBM, current treatment strategies primarily revolve around implementing supportive measures to address symptoms such as dysphagia, respiratory compromise, muscle weakness, and limited mobility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in IBM patients and can be debilitating. Dysphagia-targeted interventions may provide temporary relief, such as myotomy or dilation of a cricopharyngeal bar when patients have a significant obstructive components. Botox injections remain controversial and may pose some safety concerns. There is anecdotal evidence for IVIG improving dysphagia in IBM. Most importantly, regular evaluation by a speech and swallow therapist would ensure proper dietary modification to avoid aspiration.

Neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency usually occurs at advanced disease stages. Screening for and managing respiratory involvement is crucial. Patients often need referral to pulmonary and/or sleep medicine specialists who can assist with initiation and management of noninvasive ventilation in the appropriate setting.

The biggest challenge facing treatment of IBM to date is the lack of disease-modifying therapy. Over 20 unique drug therapies or combinations have been studied in IBM as summarized in Table 2 and further detailed below.

Table 2
Pharmacologic clinical trials in inclusion body myositis (IBM)

Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies included azathioprine, methotrexate, IVIG, IVIG + prednisone, interferon beta 1a, etanercept, infliximab, anakinra, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and canakimumab. Drugs with pleiomorphic mechanism of action, including an anti-inflammatory effects, such as sirolimus, oxandrolone, simvastatin, and more recently testosterone in tandem with exercise training have also been tried. Sirolimus inhibits mTOR and has pleiotropic effects on cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Additional investigational treatments included drugs to increase muscle mass such as follistatin gene therapy and bimagrumab, and arimoclomol addressed protein homeostasis by prolonging the activation of Heat Shock Factor-1 augmenting heat shock protein levels. Currently, randomized controlled trials for sirolimus (clinical trial NCT04789070) and ABC008 a monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes cytotoxic T cells (clinical trial NCT05721573) are underway with highly anticipated results.

### Upper esophageal sphincter and esophageal motility pathology on manometry in retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction [^7fc43e66]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

There exists a paucity of data regarding the mechanism and manometric findings in retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (RCPD). In this study, we aimed to compare esophageal physiologic findings between patients with RCPD compared to an asymptomatic cohort.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Tertiary Care Center.

Methods

Esophageal high-resolution impedance manometry was completed preoperatively in patients diagnosed with RCPD. Manometric data were compared between the RCPD and asymptomatic cohorts. A 2:1 age-sex-matched asymptomatic cohort was used as the control group. Treatment response was assessed among the RCPD cohort.

Results

Thirty-nine patients are included: 13 RCPD [mean age: 31.1 (SD: 12.6) years, female sex: 11 (85%)] and 26 asymptomatic [mean age: 32.1 (SD: 1.5) years, female sex: 22 (85%)]. The RCPD cohort, compared to the asymptomatic cohort, exhibited significantly greater upper esophageal sphincter (UES) length [4.5 (SD: 0.7) vs 3.7 (0.9) cm, P = 0.01] and higher UES basal pressures [91.9 (35.0) vs 49.7 (25.5) mm Hg, P = 0.002]. Patients with RCPD demonstrated higher rates of ineffective swallows [70.0% (31.6%) vs 15.4% (21.6%), P < .001] and incomplete bolus clearance [81% (22.0%) vs 21.8% (30.0%), P < .001]. All patients who underwent cricopharyngeal botulinum injections experienced initial improvement of symptoms with 3 patients requiring repeat intervention.

Conclusion

RCPD is associated with a longer UES, elevated UES basal pressures, and an increased incidence of ineffective esophageal motility. This study is the first to compare preoperative manometry results among patients with RCPD to those of an asymptomatic cohort, providing insights into the mechanism of RCPD.

### Peroral endoscopic myotomy for management of cricopharyngeal bars (CP-POEM): a retrospective evaluation [^9e1f5aba]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cricopharyngeal bars (CPBs) are a unique etiology of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Symptomatic patients are managed with endoscopic dilation or surgical myotomy. Cricopharyngeal peroral endoscopic myotomy (CP-POEM) is an emerging technique for the management of dysphagia due to CPBs. This study evaluated technical success, clinical success, adverse events, and long-term recurrence following CP-POEM.

Methods

Consecutive patients who underwent POEM for management of CPBs between May 2015 and December 2020 at four tertiary care centers were included. Primary outcome was clinical success (defined as improvement of dysphagia score to ≤ 1). Secondary outcomes were technical success, rate and severity of adverse events, procedure duration, and symptom recurrence.

Results

27 patients (mean age 69 years; 10 female) underwent CP-POEM during the study period. The most common presenting symptoms at the time of index procedure were dysphagia (26; 96.3%) and regurgitation (20; 74.1%). Clinical and technical success were achieved in all patients. Mild/moderate adverse events occurred in two patients (7.4%). CP-POEM significantly reduced the median dysphagia score.

Conclusions

CP-POEM was a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic CPBs. Although symptom recurrence was low, long-term outcome data are needed. CP-POEM should be considered as a management option for symptomatic CPBs at centers with POEM expertise.

### Ten questions about barium esophagography and dysphagia [^9bdb6042]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The barium esophagogram is a global test for patients with dysphagia that can simultaneously detect morphologic abnormalities in the pharynx and esophagus, pharyngeal swallowing dysfunction, esophageal dysmotility, and gastroesophageal reflux. The barium esophagram is an inexpensive, noninvasive, and widely available procedure that can serve as the initial diagnostic test for dysphagia and facilitate selection of other diagnostic studies such as endoscopy. This article addresses 10 questions about barium esophagography and dysphagia that should help gastroenterologists gain a better perspective about the utility of barium studies in this clinical setting.

### Diagnostic evaluation of dysphagia [^9e18969a]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Taking a careful history is vital for the evaluation of dysphagia. The history will yield the likely underlying pathophysiologic process and anatomic site of the problem in most patients, and is crucial for determining whether subsequently detected radiographic or endoscopic 'anomalies' are relevant or incidental. Although the symptoms of pharyngeal dysphagia can be multiple and varied, the typical features of neurogenic pharyngeal dysphagia are highly specific, and can accurately distinguish pharyngeal from esophageal disorders. The history will also dictate whether the next diagnostic procedure should be endoscopy, a barium swallow or esophageal manometry. In some difficult cases, all three diagnostic techniques may need to be performed to establish an accurate diagnosis. Stroke is the most common cause of pharyngeal dysphagia. A videoradiographic swallow study is vital in such cases to determine the extent and timing of aspiration and the severity and mechanics of dysfunction as a prelude to therapy.

### Dysphagia in inclusion body myositis: clinical features, management, and clinical outcome [^414eb608]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcome of dysphagia in patients with inclusion body myositis.

Design

Retrospective review of all 26 patients (20 women, 6 men, mean age of 72.2 yrs) with inclusion body myositis-associated dysphagia seen in 1997–2001 at our institution.

Results

Twenty-four patients (92%) had a dysphagia evaluation. Cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction was noted in all nine patients who had barium swallow studies. Eighteen patients (69%) underwent one or more interventional procedures: cricopharyngeal myotomy (10), pharyngoesophageal dilation (6), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (6), and botulinum injection of the upper esophageal sphincter (2). Dysphagia tended to worsen with time. Symptomatic improvement was noted with cricopharyngeal myotomy (63%) and pharyngoesophageal dilation (33%). The Mendelsohn maneuver seemed helpful in maintaining oral intake in the three patients in whom it was recommended. Thirteen patients died during follow-up at a mean age of 81 yrs. The cause of death was identified in eight and in all cases was because of the respiratory complications of aspiration.

Conclusions

Dysphagia is a progressive condition in patients with inclusion body myositis and often leads to death from aspiration pneumonia. Treatment targeting cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, such as the Mendelsohn maneuver, will benefit from further investigation.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^22f4d8be]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Oro-Pharyngo-Esophageal Scintigraphy (OPES) is a useful tool for the early detection of dysphagia, but its diagnostic role in PD remains to be ascertained as only a single study has been carried out in this patient population. Although only preliminary evidence is available, swallowing evaluation with high-resolution manometry (HRM) represents another interesting diagnostic tool, capable to show subtle swallowing changes in the early stages of PD even in the absence of swallowing changes on VFSS.

The Electro-Kinesiologic Swallowing Study (EKSS) represents an additional useful diagnostic tool to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of oropharyngeal dysphagia and provide clues for treatment selection. For example, electromyography of the cricopharyngeal muscle (i.e. the main component of the upper esophageal sphincter, UES) helps to clarify whether failure in UES opening during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing is due to persistent sphincter hyperactivity or to reduced elevation of the pharyngeal-laryngeal structures. In the former case, botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeal muscle may be beneficial. However, very few centers use UES electromyography routinely, thus this examination cannot currently be considered as a standard test for dysphagia.

Gastroenterological investigations including esophageal manometry, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, acid- and reflux-related tests, and/or radiological investigations such as barium swallow should always be carried out in the presence of esophageal symptoms (e.g. dysphagia for solid foods, regurgitation, food sticking after swallowing) and/or when oropharyngeal evaluations detect findings suggestive of structural or functional deficits in the esophagus, including a Zenker's diverticulum, a neoplasm or an esophageal motility dysfunction. In recent years, pharyngo-esophageal HRM has provided useful insights into the process of swallowing by enabling the detection of esophageal dysmotility, with particular interest in upper and lower esophageal sphincters. Manometry studies, often in combination with VFSS or FEES, have shown that dysphagia in PD is associated with a high prevalence of esophageal motility disturbances. However, the impact of these alterations on swallowing and their role in influencing the clinical management of dysphagia remain to be clarified.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 46 patients meeting the criteria for cricopharyngeal dysphagia from 2004 to 2008 presenting in the outpatient setting. Patients were treated with 60 French esophageal dilators. Outcomes were analyzed as a function of symptomatology, manometry, duration of benefit, and safety.

Results

Over the period reviewed, 59 dilatations were performed on 46 patients with cricopharyngeal dysfunction. Eight patients were dilated more than once. Four patients were lost to follow-up. The average starting Functional Outcome Swallowing Score (FOSS) was 2.07. Of the patients reviewed, 64.29% experienced an improvement in their FOSS with a median duration of 741 days. There were five minor complications and no major complications.

Conclusions

In the largest series of esophageal dilatation for cricopharyngeal dysfunction in the literature, we found large-bore bougienage to have significant utility due to its efficacy, ease of use, and safety when compared to other modalities such as botulinum injection, balloon dilatation, and cricopharyngeal myotomy.

### Pill shape determines esophageal transit times – A pill-to-pill study [^9033cb36]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Age differed significantly across groups. Age has previously been shown to affect ETT for a 20‐mL bolus, but the age effect has not been noted in pill swallowing. There is relevance, though, from a holistic point of view in considering age in relation to medication swallowing, as older individuals are more likely to need to take greater numbers of medications. Gender was also asymmetric across cohorts but has not previously been associated with pill swallowing issues. The imbalanced age between groups likely reflects small subgroup sizes in this study.

More than 50% of dual pill swallowers presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (esophageal dysmotility, cricopharyngeal dysfunction) and 34% had undergone treatment for head and neck cancer, typically with surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. These treatments can lead to significant swallow morbidity and xerostomia, impacting pill and solid food transit (Table 1). Our previous large cohort study (n = 756) also found significant differences in ETT in patients with neurological conditions compared to healthy controls or those with respiratory conditions. These aetiologies, with known risks of esophageal dysfunction, may explain the disparity in ETTp between normal swallowers and patients for a single pill type, for example, round pill normal swallow mean ETTp 26 s versus 45 s for the patient cohort.

### Endoscopic stapling technique for the treatment of zenker diverticulum vs standard open-neck technique… [^984bd897]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Presently, the 2 most widely used methods for the treatment of Zenker diverticulum are endoscopic stapling of the common party wall between the diverticulum sac and the esophagus and the standard open-neck technique involving diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeal myotomy. Reapplication of the stapler was performed as needed for larger diverticula in which a residual portion of the common party wall was identified. Postoperatively, patients underwent a barium swallow within the first 24 hours of surgery. If no evidence of a leak existed, the patient resumed oral feedings. Eight patients in the review had undergone the standard open diverticulectomy and CP myotomy procedure. In this procedure, the diverticulum was mobilized and its base was stapled. Supplemental sutures were placed as needed. Following the removal of the diverticulum, the fibers of the CP muscle were identified and divided sharply.

Patients were hospitalized for approximately 5 days and fed by a nasogastric tube. At the end of that period, a barium swallow was performed prior to resumption of oral intake of nutrition. Among the 16 patients, 1 patient in the endoscopic group had mild postoperative bleeding, which spontaneously resolved without evidence of further sequelae. There were no major complications in either group, including infection, fistula, subcutaneous emphysema, or adverse pulmonary sequelae. The goal of surgical treatment of ZD is 2-fold: elimination of the reservoir that traps food particles and secretions and results in the classic array of symptoms, and release of the upper esophageal sphincter via a CP myotomy, thereby eliminating increased pressures of the upper esophageal sphincter, which are believed to be the main causative factor in the development of ZD.

Over the years, other less invasive techniques have evolved in an attempt to avoid the pharyngotomy, thereby reducing postoperative healing time and time to resume oral intake as well as reducing potential complications associated with a pharyngotomy. Many authors during the 1960s and 1970s reported that ZD could be treated with CP myotomy alone without addressing the reservoir itself. 14–18 However, studies by Payne and King19 in 1983 and Bonafede et al20 in 1997 showed that this method was associated with higher rates of recurrence and persistent dysphagia.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: one size does not fit all [^30d4b374]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Barium swallow data

Barium swallow data compatible with mEMD were observed in 136/176 (77.3%), and were more common in patients with typical symptoms (119/146, 81.5% vs. 17/30, 56.6%, P = 0.003). Specific barium swallow data for the total study group and for patients with a diagnosis of mEMD are given in Table 1.

Among patients with an HRM diagnosis positive for mEMD, no difference was found in the rate of barium swallow data compatible with mEMD between patients with typical and those with atypical symptoms (110/116, 94.8% vs. 9/9, 100%, P = 0.633 respectively). Among patients with achalasia, almost every patient (97.3%) presented barium swallow findings compatible with achalasia. The rate of specific barium swallow study findings among patients diagnosed with achalasia by HRM is given in Fig. 3. Among patients with mEMD apart from achalasia diagnosed by HRM, suggestive barium swallow esophagogram findings were observed in 16/19 (84.2%)

The level of agreement between a barium swallow study compatible with mEMD and a positive HRM diagnosis was significant, and higher than that of endoscopy, but still suboptimal (Table 2).

Combination of endoscopic and/or barium swallow data and their agreement with HRM diagnosis

HRM diagnosis of mEMD among patients with compatible findings from either barium swallow or endoscopy was found more frequently among patients with typical symptoms (134/145, 92.4% vs. 10/19, 52.6%, P < 0.001). Most importantly, among 43 patients with non-typical symptoms and normal endoscopy and barium swallow study, only 1 (2.3%) had an mEMD diagnosis by HRM (EGJOO findings in a patient with GERD symptoms; an EGJOO diagnosis could not be established because of non-typical symptoms and a negative barium study). The level of agreement between endoscopy data, barium swallow data and their combination with HRM diagnosis of a mEMD for the total cohort, as well as among patients with typical and atypical symptoms, are given in Table 2. The same table also shows the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of endoscopy and barium swallow, and their combination, for the diagnosis of an mEMD by HRM.

3 Results

Ninety CPMec were performed over 14 years in 84 patients. Mean age was 76.3 years. (SD 8.4) and 44% female (n = 37). Two procedures were aborted during attempted CPMec, with one patient opting for flexible endoscopic myotomy (successfully completed) and one patient declining further surgical intervention (98% completion rate). Six recurrences occurred during the study period (6.7%), and all six were successfully revised endoscopically. Average duration to recurrence was 33 months (range 4–64). Mean age of patients with recurrent disease was 68 years (SD 15.2, range 50–89). Average time from surgery to final data collection date was 71 months across the whole cohort (SD 39 months, range 3–138 months).

Four postoperative leaks occurred (4.4%) and were managed conservatively. Two patients experienced postoperative aspiration and two patients experienced atrial fibrillation with full recovery in all cases. Average length of stay was 2.2 days (SD 1.9, range 1–8). No major surgical complications or deaths occurred.

3.1 Objective Swallowing Outcomes

Pre‐operative mean PESmax was 0.5 cm, increasing to 0.85 cm (p < 0.001) at 3 months postsurgery. Pre‐operative mean PCR was 0.15, reducing to 0.09 (p < 0.007), and mean BCR was 16% pre‐ and 4% postoperatively (p < 0.001) (Table 2).

### Through-the-scope suturing for closure of contained leak after cricopharyngeal peroral endoscopic myotomy [^4e030d4c]. VideoGIE (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cricopharyngeal bar peroral endoscopic myotomy (CP-POEM) is a safe and effective technique for treatment of symptomatic cricopharyngeal bar. Before CP-POEM, treatment strategies for cricopharyngeal bar dysphagia included surgical myotomy, laser endoscopic approach, balloon dilation of the upper esophageal sphincter, and botulinum toxin injection. Esophageal leaks are a rare adverse event that is typically managed conservatively, although clips and endoscopic suturing are options for closure of persistent leaks.

7 TREATMENT EFFECTS FOR OD AFTER TLE WITH AND WITHOUT PHARYNGEAL RECONSTRUCTION

In total, nine studies concerning treatment effects for OD were identified (Tables 5 and 6). Six of these described surgical treatment for OD, 32, 44, 51, 54, 55, 56 two described pharmacological treatment, 52, 53 and in one study dysphagic TLE patients were treated with a coping strategy. 13

7.1 Surgical treatment for OD

Four studies investigated the effect of dilatation of neopharyngeal strictures after primary pharyngeal closure or after a pedicled or microvascular free flap reconstruction 32, 44, 51, 56 and two studies investigated the effects of endoscopic laser therapy of a neopharyngeal pseudodiverticulum. 54, 55 Radiological guided balloon dilatation was reported to relieve strictures, as measured by symptomatologic relief of OD symptoms, of the neopharynx without serious complications. 51 Endoscopic dilatation(s) of neopharyngeal strictures resulted in improved dietary outcomes and a significant decrease in pharyngoesophageal junction resistance observed during VFSS, videomanometry, and barium swallows, which was correlated with symptomatic improvement of OD. 32, 44, 56 Two studies reported improved OD symptoms using a barium swallow and clinical assessment after endoscopic laser therapy for anterior neopharyngeal pseudodiverticulum without clinically relevant postoperative complications. 54, 55

7.2 Pharmacological treatment for OD

Botulinum toxin A injections used as a treatment for cricopharyngeal dysphagia improved swallowing function (measured with VFSS) and swallow‐related QoL in two studies. 52, 53

### Radiographic findings and complications after surgical or endoscopic repair of zenker's diverticulum in 16 patients [^040633a9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to reassess the radiographic findings and complications associated with surgical or endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum.

Materials and Methods

Sixteen patients who underwent various procedures for repair of Zenker's diverticulum (diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeal myotomy in [n = 8], diverticulopexy and cricopharyngeal myotomy [n = 4], endoscopic stapling diverticulotomy [n = 3], and cricopharyngeal myotomy alone [n = 1]) had radiographic studies with water-soluble contrast material, barium, or both during the early postoperative period (n = 7), late postoperative period (n = 4), or both (n = 5). The radiologic reports and images were reviewed to determine the postoperative findings and complications associated with surgical or endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum.

Results

Radiographic studies revealed leaks during the early postoperative period in three (27%) of 11 patients after surgical repair of Zenker's diverticulum and in zero of three patients after endoscopic diverticulotomy. Pharyngeal dysfunction (pharyngeal paresis, decreased epiglottic tilt, laryngeal penetration, or tracheobronchial aspiration) was detected in seven (54%) of 13 patients after surgery and in one (33%) of three patients after endoscopic diverticulotomy; five of these eight patients had follow-up barium studies during the late postoperative period, and all five showed marked improvement in pharyngeal function. An extrinsic cricopharyngeal impression was detected in six (38%) of these 16 patients, a remnant diverticulum in four (25%), and mucosal beaking in three (19%). A suspended or inverted diverticulum was detected in one of the four patients who underwent surgical diverticulopexy.

Conclusion

Radiologists should be aware of the various postoperative findings and complications associated with surgical or endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum so that appropriate interventions can be taken in patients with this condition.
