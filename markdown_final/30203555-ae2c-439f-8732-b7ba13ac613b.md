## Question

Fluoxetine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fluoxetine's evidence across indications, dosing, safety, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and regulatory status. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for each major indication. Next, I will review dosing and dose-response, followed by safety and adverse effects. After that, I need to examine special populations, including pediatrics, pregnancy, and older adults. Finally, I will appraise off-label and emerging uses, and close with a concise clinical synthesis and bottom-line recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the basics: fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with long half-life and active metabolite, approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, and depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder when combined with olanzapine. I should double-check that the bipolar indication is indeed the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and not monotherapy, which is correct per FDA labeling [^113VPZGc] [^115Scpr1].

> Now, for major depressive disorder in adults, I need to verify efficacy and dosing. High-quality evidence shows modest but clinically meaningful benefit over placebo, with a pooled standardized mean difference around −0.23 and response/remission odds ratios near 1.5, and the optimal dose-response plateau is typically 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, beyond which tolerability declines without added efficacy. I should confirm that this comes from dose–response meta-analyses and USPSTF synthesis, which it does [^113EjAaN] [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH].

> For pediatric and adolescent depression, hold on, I should verify guideline alignment. Multiple guidelines endorse fluoxetine as first-line pharmacotherapy for moderate-to-severe depression in youth, supported by RCTs and meta-analyses showing clinically significant symptom reduction; typical dosing starts at 10 mg with a target of 20 mg, and I need to ensure we emphasize monitoring for suicidality and activation, which is standard in pediatric guidance [^115yHFb4] [^113d4F47] [^113VPZGc].

> Turning to obsessive-compulsive disorder, I should confirm that fixed-dose trials demonstrate superiority over placebo across 20–60 mg/day, with clinically relevant Y-BOCS response rates and guideline support for SSRIs including fluoxetine as first-line pharmacotherapy. Yes, both RCT data and APA practice guidelines support this [^111QtRxg] [^114zfPR9].

> For bulimia nervosa, wait, let me verify the dose that separated from placebo. The pivotal trials showed that 60 mg/day reduced binge/purge frequency and is the FDA-approved target dose; I initially thought 20 mg might suffice, but I should correct that — only 60 mg was statistically superior to placebo in reducing core behaviors, though lower doses may help with associated symptoms [^113EwCBU].

> Panic disorder next. I need to check that two 12-week flexible-dose trials demonstrated higher panic-free endpoints with fluoxetine versus placebo, supporting its use as a first-line SSRI option in panic disorder, with typical dosing in the 20–60 mg/day range [^117Tda97] [^113r1t5q].

> For bipolar I depression, I should confirm the indication is specifically the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, which is FDA-approved for acute depressive episodes. Efficacy reflects the combination rather than fluoxetine monotherapy, and I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize to monotherapy in bipolar depression [^113VPZGc] [^115Scpr1].

> Now, stroke recovery — this is where I need to be cautious. Early smaller studies like FLAME suggested motor gains, but large, multicenter RCTs (FOCUS, EFFECTS, AFFINITY) consistently show no improvement in functional outcomes with 6 months of fluoxetine 20 mg/day after acute stroke, and they demonstrate increased risks of fractures and, in some trials, hyponatremia or seizures. Cochrane meta-analyses corroborate no disability benefit and higher fracture risk, so routine post-stroke use is not supported [^113azSK7] [^115ftxF7] [^115LMWvH] [^112jqUYh].

> Dosing and titration deserve a careful look. Standard adult MDD dosing starts at 20 mg/day with consideration of 40–60 mg if needed, acknowledging diminishing returns and more adverse effects beyond 40 mg; pediatric MDD typically starts at 10 mg with a 20 mg target, and for bulimia the effective, evidence-based dose is 60 mg/day; I should double-check that weekly dosing has supportive data for continuation but is not standard for acute treatment, which is accurate [^113VPZGc] [^112vEbnF] [^115KmsUw].

> Safety and tolerability next. I will now examine class and drug-specific adverse effects. Common SSRI effects include nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and activation; serious risks include hyponatremia, bleeding, and bone effects with long-term use. I need to ensure I cite the fracture signal from stroke trials and mechanistic bone data, and confirm sexual dysfunction prevalence and management guidance, which are well documented in FDA materials and clinical reviews [^117S5B2R] [^111mUfNv] [^112fxDos].

> Sexual dysfunction deserves explicit attention. Let me verify the scope. Fluoxetine is associated with delayed ejaculation/orgasm, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction, with management options including dose reduction, drug holidays, or switching. I should confirm that FDA labeling discusses this and offers practical counseling points, which it does [^111mUfNv].

> For older adults, I should confirm the principle of "start low, go slow" and preferred agents. Guidelines often favor citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, or mirtazapine in late life due to tolerability and interaction profiles; fluoxetine's long half-life can reduce withdrawal risk but may increase accumulation, so careful monitoring for hyponatremia, falls, and QT interactions is prudent [^1154GbFB].

> In pregnancy and lactation, I need to check the risk–benefit framing. Fluoxetine is commonly used when benefits outweigh risks, with no clear teratogenic signal but potential neonatal adaptation concerns; I should confirm that FDA communications and labeling advise individualized risk–benefit discussions and note that sertraline and paroxetine have lower milk transfer, which may influence lactation choices [^114iZdBv] [^113MAsfh].

> For pediatric anxiety disorders, let me verify SSRI class recommendations. AACAP and related guidance support SSRIs, including fluoxetine, for pediatric anxiety (GAD, SAD, separation, panic) with moderate-quality evidence for symptom reduction and functional gains, while emphasizing careful monitoring for adverse effects and activation [^111ViqT5] [^116v7jjD].

> Off-label and emerging uses require a cautious lens. For obesity, low-certainty RCTs suggest modest weight loss with fluoxetine but at the cost of more adverse events. For functional heartburn, evidence is limited and mixed. For migraine prevention, guidelines judge evidence insufficient. For PTSD, SSRIs including fluoxetine are reasonable options, with recent pragmatic data suggesting comparable short-term effectiveness to trauma-focused psychotherapy in primary care, though switching strategies after SSRI nonresponse may matter. For COVID-19, small randomized studies suggest at most weak antiviral effects and no definitive clinical outcome benefit, so routine use is not supported pending larger trials [^112Jw65T] [^114kDPE7] [^1113zXsu] [^117Vwehh] [^116HiWjm] [^114jCu7c] [^112ZL79V].

> I should also review drug–drug interactions and activation syndromes. Fluoxetine is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor and interacts with tricyclics, certain antipsychotics, and antiarrhythmics; MAOIs are contraindicated within the washout windows; activation and agitation can occur early, warranting close follow-up and dose adjustments, particularly in youth and anxiety presentations [^113VPZGc] [^115Scpr1].

> Let me reconsider the clinical synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Fluoxetine remains a first-line SSRI for adult and pediatric depression, OCD, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorder, with dosing tailored to indication and tolerability; it is not recommended for routine post-stroke recovery due to lack of functional benefit and increased fracture risk; across indications, the 20–40 mg range typically balances efficacy and tolerability, with higher doses reserved for selected cases and indications like bulimia where 60 mg is evidence-based [^113VPZGc] [^113azSK7] [^112vEbnF].

> Finally, I should double-check practical pearls. For patients with poor adherence or those desiring less frequent dosing, weekly fluoxetine can be considered in maintenance phases. For those with prominent sexual side effects, consider dose minimization, timing changes, or switching. And for patients on interacting medications, review the CYP2D6 liability and adjust accordingly, documenting shared decision-making around risks, benefits, and uncertainties [^115KmsUw] [^113VPZGc].

Fluoxetine is a **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)** approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (with olanzapine) [^115Scpr1] [^114iZdBv]. It is **first-line in adolescents** with moderate-to-severe depression and is also used for anxiety disorders [^115yHFb4] [^111ViqT5]. Common adverse effects include nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and activation symptoms; rare risks include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, and suicidal ideation, especially in younger patients [^1132EVve] [^115ftxF7]. Fluoxetine is generally well tolerated, with a low risk of withdrawal due to its long half-life, but should be tapered gradually to minimize discontinuation symptoms [^113xrwuF] [^115Scpr1]. It is not recommended for routine use after acute stroke due to lack of functional benefit and increased fracture risk [^113azSK7] [^112jqUYh].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits serotonin reuptake, increasing synaptic serotonin and improving mood and anxiety symptoms [^114iZdBv].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Long half-life (2–4 days; norfluoxetine 7–15 days) supports once-daily dosing, low withdrawal risk, and flexible scheduling [^113xrwuF] [^113JUizt].

- **Metabolism**: Hepatic CYP2D6 metabolism; inhibitors can raise fluoxetine levels and increase adverse effects [^notfound].

---

---

## Efficacy

Fluoxetine demonstrates **moderate efficacy** in adults with MDD (NNT ~7) [^113v6wCt] and is **first-line in adolescents**, with robust evidence of benefit [^115yHFb4] [^113d4F47]. It is also effective for OCD, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorder, with **response rates superior to placebo** [^111QtRxg] [^117Tda97].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, activation symptoms, headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal upset [^1132EVve] [^112Jw65T] [^116hhRUK].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia (especially in older adults), suicidal ideation (particularly in patients < 25 years), and QT prolongation (rare) [^115ftxF7].

- **Discontinuation symptoms**: Low risk due to long half-life; taper gradually to minimize symptoms [^113xrwuF] [^115Scpr1].

---

## Special populations

In **pregnancy**, use only if benefits outweigh risks (Category C); potential neonatal adaptation symptoms and congenital anomalies have been reported. In **pediatrics**, it is first-line for adolescent depression and effective for pediatric OCD; monitor for suicidal ideation and growth effects [^115yHFb4] [^117F7fRr] [^1132EVve]. In **geriatrics**, start low and go slow; monitor for hyponatremia and falls [^1154GbFB].

---

## Drug interactions

- **MAOIs**: Contraindicated due to risk of serotonin syndrome [^111mUfNv].

- **CYP2D6 inhibitors**: May increase fluoxetine levels and adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Warfarin**: Increased risk of bleeding; monitor INR [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend fluoxetine as **first-line for adolescent depression** and as a treatment option for anxiety disorders [^115yHFb4] [^111ViqT5]. Routine use after acute stroke is **not recommended** due to lack of functional benefit and increased fracture risk [^113azSK7] [^112jqUYh].

---

## Patient counseling points

Counsel patients on **adherence** — take as prescribed and avoid abrupt discontinuation [^113JUizt]. Inform them of **common adverse effects** and when to seek care, and advise avoiding alcohol and other CNS depressants [^114zz92D]. Discuss **suicide risk**, especially in younger patients, and ensure close monitoring [^116CtA16].

---

Fluoxetine is a well-established SSRI with broad efficacy across mood and anxiety disorders, **favored in adolescents** and generally well tolerated; careful monitoring for adverse effects and interactions is essential, and it is not recommended for routine post-stroke use.

### Fluoxetine versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^1151uUE6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in primary care and it is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Treatment is predominantly pharmaceutical or psychological. Fluoxetine, the first of a group of antidepressant (AD) agents known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison with tricyclic (TCA), heterocyclic and related ADs, and other SSRIs. These comparative studies provided contrasting findings. In addition, systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to fluoxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of fluoxetine in comparison with TCAs, SSRIs and newer agents.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine, compared with other ADs, in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression, and to review its acceptability.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were located by searching the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline (1966–2004) and Embase (1974–2004). Non-English language articles were included.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were included. For trials which have a crossover design only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using a standard form. Responders to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: drop-outs were always included in this analysis. When data on drop-outs were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation, they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as treatment failures. Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed including patients with a final assessment or with the last observation carried forward. Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study and who experienced adverse reactions out of the total number of randomised patients. The primary analyses used a fixed effects approach, and presented Peto Odds Ratio (PetoOR) and Standardised Mean Difference (SMD).

Main Results

On a dichotomous outcome fluoxetine was less effective than dothiepin (PetoOR: 2.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.05), sertraline (PetoOR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76), mirtazapine (PetoOR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.65) and venlafaxine (Peto OR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.70). On a continuous outcome, fluoxetine was more effective than ABT-200 (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) random effects: - 1.85, 95% CI - 2.25 to - 1.45) and milnacipran (SMD random effects: - 0.38, 95% CI - 0.71 to - 0.06); conversely, it was less effective than venlafaxine (SMD random effect: 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23), however these figures were of borderline statistical significance. Fluoxetine was better tolerated than TCAs considered as a group (PetoOR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), and was better tolerated in comparison with individual ADs, in particular than amitriptyline (PetoOR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85) and imipramine (PetoOR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99), and among newer ADs than ABT-200 (PetoOR: 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.41), pramipexole (PetoOR: 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47) and reboxetine (PetoOR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There are statistically significant differences in terms of efficacy and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain, and no definitive implications for clinical practice can be drawn. From a clinical point of view the analysis of antidepressants' safety profile (adverse effect and suicide risk) remains of crucial importance and more reliable data about these outcomes are needed. Waiting for more robust evidence, treatment decisions should be based on considerations of clinical history, drug toxicity, patient acceptability, and cost. We need for large, pragmatic trials, enrolling heterogeneous populations of patients with depression to generate clinically relevant information on the benefits and harms of competitive pharmacological options. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from the randomised trials is clearly necessary.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^111ViqT5]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety disorders guideline — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and adolescents: AACAP recommends (1B) that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) be offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, 13 RCTs compared SSRIs to pill placebo; overall, 1,708 patients were included (54.1% male; mean age 11.6 years; range: 6–18 years). Compared to pill placebo, SSRIs as a class improved primary anxiety symptoms (parent and clinician report), response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), as well as global function (high SOE), but did not separate from pill placebo for primary anxiety symptoms (child report), secondary measures, or social function (all low SOE). For harms, SSRIs as a class did not separate from pill placebo with respect to short-term AEs (all moderate to low SOE); insufficient data precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior and of AEs related to neurologic or oral (dry mouth) AEs. This recommendation was supported by the findings from three meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/Mayo review, and no meta-analyses or systematic reviews published since the AHRQ/Mayo review refuted this recommendation. There were no differences of opinion, and the CQI Guideline Writing Group voted unanimously in favor of this recommendation. A medication from the SSRI class should be considered among treatments offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and panic disorders. Medications from the SSRI class currently marketed in the United States are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone; in the AHRQ/Mayo review, the SSRIs for which sufficient data were available for comparisons were fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Although there is substantial empirical support for the effectiveness and safety of the SSRI class of medications for the treatment of anxiety, no SSRI has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this indication.

### Are all antidepressants really the same? The case of fluoxetine: a systematic review [^1135SNyR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine, the most widely studied of newer antidepressants, in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute treatment of depression in patients aged more than 18 years.

Data Sources

Studies were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2004. The terms FLUOXETIN* OR adofen or docutrix or erocap or fluctin or fluctine or fluoxeren or fontex or ladose or lorien or lovan or mutan or prozac or prozyn or reneuron or sanzur or saurat or zactin were used. MEDLINE (1966–2004) and EMBASE (1974–2004) were searched using fluoxetine and randomized controlled trial or random allocation or double-blind method. No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched for published reports up to March 2004.

Study Selection

Only randomized controlled trials (either blind or nonblind) were included.

Data Synthesis

131 randomized controlled trials were eligible. A p value less than .01 was chosen to test the null hypothesis, and a 99% confidence interval was calculated to detect statistically significant differences with a high degree of confidence. Fixed- and random-effects relative risks, odds ratios (ORs), and Peto ORs were routinely calculated for each outcome measure. In terms of efficacy, we found a statistically significant difference favoring sertraline and venlafaxine over fluoxetine. In terms of tolerability, patients allocated to fluoxetine were less likely to leave the study early only in comparison with those allocated to amitriptyline and pramipexole.

Conclusions

This systematic review highlighted that there are differences between fluoxetine and specific comparator antidepressants. Several of the differences met a prespecified criterion for clinical significance. The statistical approach adopted in this systematic review could represent a useful tool for putting clinical trial data into practice.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113tkMBT]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, AMED, the UK National Research Register, and PSYNDEX from the date of their inception to Jan 8, 2016, with no language restrictions. We used the search terms "depress" OR "dysthymi" OR "adjustment disorder" OR "mood disorder" OR "affective disorder" OR "affective symptoms" combined with a list of all included antidepressants.

We included double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants with placebo or another active antidepressant as oral monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults (≥ 18 years old and of both sexes) with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10). We considered only double-blind trials because we included placebo in the network meta-analysis, and because this study design increases methodological rigour by minimising performance and ascertainment biases. Additionally, we included all second-generation antidepressants approved by the regulatory agencies in the USA, Europe, or Japan: agomelatine, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine. To inform clinical practice globally, we selected the two tricyclics (amitriptyline and clomipramine) included in the). We also included trazodone and nefazodone, because of their distinct effect and tolerability profiles. Additionally, we included trials that allowed rescue medications so long as they were equally provided among the randomised groups. We included data only for drugs within the therapeutic range (appendix pp 133, 134). Finally, we excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness.

### Recent trends in primary-care antidepressant prescribing to children and young people: an e-cohort study [^1126pXUA]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Additionally, strategies to improve the implementation of current guidance on the prescribing of antidepressants for depression in CYP should be adopted. This could include adoption of programmes such as Therapeutic identification of depression in young people (TIDY) which trains primary-care staff to differentiate between emotional turmoil and depression and to implement appropriate management strategies (Kramer et al.). A current focus should be the use of citalopram rather than fluoxetine as a first line treatment. The updated NICE guidance of 2015 recommends that citalopram should only be prescribed if fluoxetine is unsuccessful or is not tolerated because of side-effects and then only once advice is sought from a senior child and adolescent psychiatrist. These preferences in initiating antidepressant treatment also warrant further research. It may be that GPs find that citalopram is better tolerated than fluoxetine, or results may simply reflect trends seen in adult populations (Kessler et al.) despite citalopram's higher case-fatality in overdose than other SSRIs (Hawton et al.). It is also possible that the increase in citalopram prescriptions is related to diagnoses other than depression, such as pain, prescribing for which appears to have increased during the study period. The absence of data regarding any interventions that may have been received at secondary and tertiary mental healthcare levels make it difficult to draw conclusions on whether this trend is a reflection of GP preference or of prescribing patterns initiated in secondary or tertiary care. However, the rate of rejection of referrals from primary-care to specialist mental health services (Hinrichs et al.) make it likely that treatment for at least a proportion of individuals is exclusive to primary care. Further research is required to fully understand the increasing trend in prescribing without an associated indication. It may be that indications go beyond those studied here or that GPs are increasingly choosing not to record depression in this population.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^115FGWW7]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Results of small trials indicate that fluoxetine might improve functional outcomes after stroke. The FOCUS trial aimed to provide a precise estimate of these effects.

Methods

FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 103 hospitals in the UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical stroke diagnosis, were enrolled and randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after onset, and had focal neurological deficits. Patients were randomly allocated fluoxetine 20 mg or matching placebo orally once daily for 6 months via a web-based system by use of a minimisation algorithm. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), at 6 months. Patients, carers, health-care staff, and the trial team were masked to treatment allocation. Functional status was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83290762.

Findings

Between Sept 10, 2012, and March 31, 2017, 3127 patients were recruited. 1564 patients were allocated fluoxetine and 1563 allocated placebo. mRS data at 6 months were available for 1553 (99.3%) patients in each treatment group. The distribution across mRS categories at 6 months was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (common odds ratio adjusted for minimisation variables 0.951 [95% CI 0.839–1.079]; p = 0.439). Patients allocated fluoxetine were less likely than those allocated placebo to develop new depression by 6 months (210 [13.43%] patients vs 269 [17.21%]; difference 3.78% [95% CI 1.26–6.30]; p = 0.0033), but they had more bone fractures (45 [2.88%] vs 23 [1.47%]; difference 1.41% [95% CI 0.38–2.43]; p = 0.0070). There were no significant differences in any other event at 6 or 12 months.

Interpretation

Fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to improve functional outcomes. Although the treatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function.

Literature data published between 1987 and 2014 from 16 placebo‐controlled trials of anti‐depression treatments venlafaxine (ten trials, 1289 patients), and fluoxetine (eight trials, 982 patients), and 1161 placebo‐treated patients, selected from an original literature database were used. The two selected drugs were some of the most frequently reported in placebo‐controlled studies and data reported from dose‐ranging studies for these drugs enabled assessment of dose–response. For venlafaxine, doses ranged from 25 to 375 mg/day, while fluoxetine doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg/day were available. Change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD) scale, the clinical end point of interest in line with the recommendations as included in the 2023 European Medicines Agency draft guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of depression, was analyzed at the time of primary analysis of each study (primary timepoint). The full list of studies showing the HAMD change from baseline scores, mean baseline HAMD scores and the sample size of each study arm is provided in Table S1.

The original database was developed to document clinical efficacy and safety information from randomized‐controlled clinical trials investigating drugs approved or in development for treatment of depression. The database development was conducted systematically, based on relevant identification, screening, and assessment steps, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionsand reporting items in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The main purpose of this analysis was to illustrate methodology rather than compare the selected drugs.

### Antiviral efficacy of fluoxetine in early symptomatic COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV) [^113zeE49]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measure was the rate of viral clearance estimated from viral genome densities in serial duplicate oropharyngeal viral swab eluates taken daily between days 0 and 7 (see Statistics below and Supplementary Appendix S9 for the method of estimation).

Secondary endpoints were:
(i) All-cause admission to hospital for clinical deterioration (until day 28);
(ii) Time-to-resolution of fever in patients febrile at admission;
(iii) Time-to-resolution of symptoms.

These endpoints were assessed using survival methods because the data at the last visit were right-censored. Patients were defined as febrile at admission if at least one axillary temperature measurement within 24 h of randomisation was ≥ 37.5 °C. Resolution of fever was defined as an axillary temperature ≤ 37.0 °C for at least 24 h. Symptom resolution was defined as no reported symptoms. All adverse events were graded as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Summaries were generated if the adverse event was grade 3 or worse, and was new or had increased in intensity. Serious adverse events were recorded separately and reported to the data safety monitoring board, however there were no serious adverse events during this portion of the trial.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^114kDPE7]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — neuromodulators and clinical trial data — neuromodulators have established value in functional esophageal disorders, with commonly used classes including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators (agonists and antagonists), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and they alter neuronal function with a primary central action and a minor secondary peripheral action on esophageal pain. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 83 functional heartburn and reflux hypersensitivity patients, imipramine 25 mg daily for 8 weeks showed no difference in improvement of heartburn versus placebo but significantly improved quality of life on per-protocol analysis (P = 0.045). Fluoxetine is stated as the only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor studied in functional heartburn.

### Treatment of bulimia nervosa in a primary care setting [^11641APc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors' goal was to determine whether treatments known to be effective for bulimia nervosa in specialized treatment centers can be used successfully in primary health care settings. They examined the benefits of two treatments for bulimia: 1) fluoxetine, an antidepressant medication, and 2) guided self-help, an adaptation of cognitive behavior therapy.

Method

Ninety-one female patients in two primary care settings were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine alone, placebo alone, fluoxetine plus guided self-help, or placebo and guided self-help.

Results

The majority of the patients did not complete the treatment trial; many patients found the treatment program too demanding, but others indicated it was not sufficiently intensive. Patients assigned to fluoxetine attended more physician visits, exhibited a greater reduction in binge eating and vomiting, and had a greater improvement in psychological symptoms than those assigned to placebo. There was no evidence of benefit from guided self-help.

Conclusions

The treatment of patients with bulimia nervosa in a primary care setting is hampered by a high dropout rate. Guided self-help, a psychological treatment based on cognitive behavior therapy, appears ineffective, but treatment with fluoxetine is associated with better retention and substantial symptomatic improvement.

### Maintenance or discontinuation of antidepressants in primary care [^116nFNUH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with depression who are treated in primary care practices may receive antidepressants for prolonged periods. Data are limited on the effects of maintaining or discontinuing antidepressant therapy in this setting.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving adults who were being treated in 150 general practices in the United Kingdom. All the patients had a history of at least two depressive episodes or had been taking antidepressants for 2 years or longer and felt well enough to consider stopping antidepressants. Patients who had received citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, or mirtazapine were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to maintain their current antidepressant therapy (maintenance group) or to taper and discontinue such therapy with the use of matching placebo (discontinuation group). The primary outcome was the first relapse of depression during the 52-week trial period, as evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. Secondary outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical and withdrawal symptoms, quality of life, time to stopping an antidepressant or placebo, and global mood ratings.

Results

A total of 1466 patients underwent screening. Of these patients, 478 were enrolled in the trial (238 in the maintenance group and 240 in the discontinuation group). The average age of the patients was 54 years; 73% were women. Adherence to the trial assignment was 70% in the maintenance group and 52% in the discontinuation group. By 52 weeks, relapse occurred in 92 of 238 patients (39%) in the maintenance group and in 135 of 240 (56%) in the discontinuation group (hazard ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.56 to 2.70; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as the primary outcome. Patients in the discontinuation group had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and withdrawal than those in the maintenance group.

Conclusions

Among patients in primary care practices who felt well enough to discontinue antidepressant therapy, those who were assigned to stop their medication had a higher risk of relapse of depression by 52 weeks than those who were assigned to maintain their current therapy.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^111zEt6K]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the USA, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the USA and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1127mihJ]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Child/adolescent pharmacotherapy — scope of recommendations: While there is clear evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials for the use of fluoxetine (Prozac) in children and adolescents, there is limited evidence meeting the IOM or AMSTAR criteria for other antidepressants, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidepressant for youth, escitalopram (Lexapro). In the panel's review of the evidence for escitalopram, we were unable to recommend for or against this medication, and the panel has elected not to provide a recommendation on the use of Nefazodone (Serzone) as an antidepressant given its lack of clinical relevance for current practice. The panel concludes that the strongest evidence for a pharmacologic treatment for adolescent depression is for fluoxetine (Prozac), and if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113h76DH]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28554 records were identified through our search (24524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Long-term use of fluoxetine accelerates bone loss through the disruption of sphingolipids metabolism in bone marrow adipose tissue [^112fxDos]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study provided new insights into the fluoxetine-induced bone loss. We showed that sphingolipids metabolism is the primary metabolic pathway altered in BMAT during the progression of bone loss. Inhibition of ASM, a key enzyme for the conversion of sphingomyelins to ceramides by fluoxetine or genetic loss of ASM, accelerates bone loss. Further mechanistic analysis in BMAs revealed that inhibition of ASM by fluoxetine reduces ceramides and S1P levels, leading to the marked increase of RANKL secretion through the upregulation of COX-2/PGE2 pathway. In contrast, the regulation of ASM expression by CDDP normalizes fluoxetine-induced RANKL overproduction. In addition, we reported that the acceleration of bone loss caused by chronic use of fluoxetine was prevented by L-serine treatment.

### Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in primary health care: a six-month randomised study comparing fluoxetine to imipramine [^111nCC84]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decade, studies of the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for depression have often been based on research designs intended to measure efficacy, and for this reason the results are of limited generalizability. Research is needed comparing the clinical and economic outcomes of antidepressants in day-to-day clinical practice.

Methods

A six-month randomised prospective naturalistic study comparing fluoxetine to imipramine carried out in three primary care health centres. Outcome measures were the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), direct costs, indirect costs and total costs. Subjects were evaluated at the beginning of treatment and at one, three and six months thereafter.

Results

Of the 103 patients, 38.8% (n = 40) were diagnosed with major depressive disorder, 14.6% (n = 15) with dysthymic disorder, and 46.6% (n = 48) with depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Patients with major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder achieved similar clinical improvement in both treatment groups (mean MADRS ratings decrease in major depressive disorder from baseline to 6 months of 18.3 for imipramine and 18.8 for fluoxetine). For patients with major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder, the imipramine group had fewer treatment-associated costs (imipramine 469.66 Euro versus fluoxetine 1,585.93 Euro in major depressive disorder, p < 0.05; imipramine 175.39 Euro versus fluoxetine 2,929.36 Euro in dysthymic disorder, p < 0.05). The group with depressive disorder not otherwise specified did not experience statistically significant differences in clinical and costs outcomes between treatment groups.

Limitations

Exclusion criteria, participating physicians may not represent GPs.

Conclusions

In a primary care context, imipramine may represent a more cost-effective treatment option than fluoxetine for treating major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder. There were no differences in cost-effectiveness in the treatment of depressive disorder not otherwise specified.

### Use of fluoxetine in anorexia nervosa before and after weight restoration [^117GxEJD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence for the use of fluoxetine in treatment of underweight and weight-restored patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and provide recommendations for the clinical usefulness of fluoxetine in AN.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed via PubMed through June 2013 using the terms fluoxetine and anorexia nervosa. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled trials published in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. Studies including the use of fluoxetine in underweight or weight-restored patients with AN were included. Studies of fluoxetine in preclinical animal models of anorexia nervosa were excluded.

Data Synthesis

AN is a serious psychiatric illness with no currently approved medication therapy. Because patients with AN frequently display symptoms of major depressive and obsessive-compulsive disorders, medication therapy is commonly used in attempts to improve these symptoms and prevent relapses of AN. Antidepressants such as fluoxetine are the most frequently used medications for these symptoms. The evidence for fluoxetine in the treatment of AN is controversial, particularly in patients who remain underweight. One theory of inefficacy is that underweight patients do not have the nutrients required to make serotonin, therefore preventing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors from taking effect. Another theory involves dysregulation of the serotonin receptor. Despite the lack of evidence, fluoxetine may still be useful in certain underweight and weight-restored patients.

Conclusions

The risk-benefit ratio of fluoxetine in underweight and weight-restored patients with AN is undefined by clinical trials; therefore, clinical experience must be applied for its use in this patient population.

### Which placebo to cure depression? A thought-provoking network meta-analysis [^111yXikd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

Types of participants

We reviewed studies involving adults (age 18 and over) with a diagnosis of major depressive episode (DSM IV, DSM IV-R, DSM III, DSM III-R, ICD 10, Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria). Studies involving patients with other psychiatric or medical comorbidity were considered only when it was not an explicit inclusion criterion for the study. Studies involving patients with a diagnosis of anxious depression were also considered.

Studies involving more than 20% subjects with bipolar disorder were excluded, as were studies exclusively involving patients with seasonal affective disorder, post-partum depression, postmenopausal depression, atypical depression, dysthymia and studies involving elderly patients.

Types of intervention(s)

Our primary aim was to compare placebo arms. We focused our attention on three different placebos: 1) fluoxetine placebo (FLUp, where placebo was compared to fluoxetine), 2) venlafaxine placebo (VENLAFp, where placebo was compared to venlafaxine), and 3) venlafaxine/fluoxetine placebo (FLU/VENLAFp, where placebo was compared to both venlafaxine and fluoxetine), which were obviously compared with the corresponding antidepressants in oral mono-therapy in major depressive disorder first line acute treatment.

Types of outcomes

Response was chosen as the primary outcome. Remission was chosen as a secondary outcome. These outcomes are the most consistently reported estimates of acute-treatment efficacy. Response was defined as the proportion of patients who had a reduction of at least 50% from the baseline score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Remission was defined as the proportion of patients who had a HDRS score ≤ 7 or a MADRS score ≤ 12.

When trials reported results from both rating scales, we extracted data from the scale considered in the study as the primary outcome.

Types of studies

In this review were included 1) randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine or venlafaxine against placebo and 2) head-to-head trials of fluoxetine versus venlafaxine with or without placebo control. All studies were conducted from January 1989 to July 2009. Only study reports in English, French and Spanish language were considered.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^113JUizt]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

You could take too much medicine (overdose).

How should I take fluoxetine?

Take fluoxetine exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may need to change (adjust) the dose of fluoxetine until it is right for you.
If you miss a dose of fluoxetine, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of fluoxetine at the same time.
To prevent serious side effects, do not stop taking fluoxetine suddenly. If you need to stop taking fluoxetine, your doctor can tell you how to safely stop taking it.
If you take too much fluoxetine, call your doctor or poison control center right away, or get emergency treatment.
Fluoxetine can be taken with or without food.
Fluoxetine is usually taken once a day or once weekly, depending on how your doctor prescribes your medicine.
If you do not think you are getting better or have any concerns about your condition while taking fluoxetine, call your doctor.

What should I avoid while taking fluoxetine?

Fluoxetine can cause sleepiness and may affect your ability to make decisions, think clearly, or react quickly. You should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how fluoxetine affects you.

### Fluoxetine [^115Scpr1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any changes in your sexual function or if you have any questions or concerns about sexual problems during treatment with fluoxetine capsules. There may be treatments your healthcare provider can suggest.

Do not stop fluoxetine capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping fluoxetine capsules too quickly may cause serious symptoms including:

anxiety, irritability, high or low mood, feeling restless or changes in sleep habits
headache, sweating, nausea, dizziness
electric shock-like sensations, shaking, confusion

What are fluoxetine capsules?

Fluoxetine capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat depression. It is important to talk with your healthcare provider about the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. You should discuss all treatment choices with your healthcare provider.

Fluoxetine capsules are used to treat:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Bulimia Nervosa*
Panic Disorder*
Depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder, taken with olanzapine (Zyprexa®)
Treatment Resistant Depression (depression that has not gotten better with at least 2 other treatments), taken with olanzapine (Zyprexa®)*

* Not approved for use in children

Talk to your healthcare provider if you do not think that your condition is getting better with fluoxetine capsule treatment.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116jBjup]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients, pharmacotherapy, APA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend other medications in adolescent patients. Ensure shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable.

### Fluoxetine for adults who are overweight or obese [^112Jw65T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluoxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor indicated for major depression. It is also thought to affect weight control: this seems to happen through appetite changes resulting in decreased food intake and normalisation of unusual eating behaviours. However, the benefit-risk ratio of this off-label medication is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine for overweight or obese adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP Search Portal. The last date of the search was December 2018 for all databases, to which we applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of fluoxetine versus placebo, other anti-obesity agents, non-pharmacological therapy or no treatment in overweight or obese adults without depression, mental illness or abnormal eating patterns.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles for relevance. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed by one author and checked by the second. We assessed trials for the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. For additional information we contacted trial authors by email. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 1036 records, scrutinized 52 full-text articles and included 19 completed RCTs (one trial is awaiting assessment). A total of 2216 participants entered the trials, 1280 participants were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d) and 936 participants were randomly assigned to various comparison groups (placebo; the anti-obesity agents diethylpropion, fenproporex, mazindol, sibutramine, metformin, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, fluvoxamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptophan; no treatment; and omega-3 gel). Within the 19 RCTs there were 56 trial arms. Fifteen trials were parallel RCTs and four were cross-over RCTs. The participants in the included trials were followed up for periods between three weeks and one year. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low: the majority of trials had a high risk of bias in one or more of the risk of bias domains. For our main comparison group - fluoxetine versus placebo - and across all fluoxetine dosages and durations of treatment, the MD was -2.7 kg (95% CI -4 to -1.4; P < 0.001; 10 trials, 956 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -7.1 kg and 1.7 kg. The MD in body mass index (BMI) reduction across all fluoxetine dosages compared with placebo was -1.1 kg/m² (95% CI -3.7 to 1.4; 3 trials, 97 participants; very low certainty evidence). Only nine placebo-controlled trials reported adverse events. A total of 399 out of 627 participants (63.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 352 out of 626 participants (56.2%) receiving placebo experienced an adverse event. Random-effects meta-analysis showed an increase in the risk of having at least one adverse event of any type in the fluoxetine groups compared with placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.42; P = 0.07; 9 trials, 1253 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.74 and 1.88. Following fluoxetine treatment the adverse events of dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea were observed approximately twice as often compared to placebo. A total of 15 out of 197 participants (7.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 12 out of 196 participants (6.1%) receiving placebo experienced depression. The RR across all fluoxetine doses compared with placebo was 1.20 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.52; P = 0.62; 3 trials, 393 participants; very low certainty evidence). All-cause mortality, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects were not reported. The comparisons of fluoxetine with other anti-obesity agents (3 trials, 234 participants), omega-3 gel (1 trial, 48 participants) and no treatment (1 trial, 60 participants) showed inconclusive results (very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that off-label fluoxetine may decrease weight compared with placebo. However, low-certainty evidence suggests an increase in the risk for dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea following fluoxetine treatment.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^114sviog]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Literature inclusion process and data extraction

Article titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion. Subsequently, potentially relevant full text articles from the literature search were then screened for inclusion by a structured process and standard terms supporting inclusion and exclusion. Studies that did not meet the criteria outlined above were excluded.

We extracted the following data for each review article using a standardised data collection form specifically designed and tested for this systematic review: review characteristics (eg, lead author, type of review, protocol driven review, patient level data or not, type of depression being treated, review setting in primary or secondary care), antidepressant and comparator information (eg, SSRI used, fixed or flexible dose study, placebo controlled, dose standardisation technique, treatment duration), and dose-response effects (eg, efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects).

Risk-of-bias assessment

Each review article was assessed according to the ROBIS (risk of bias in systematic reviews) tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations. Reviews were assessed by CFJ using ROBIS and checked by SM. The ROBIS tool has been specifically developed and designed to assess reviews within healthcare settings, and has three phases: assessment of relevance, identification of concerns with the review process, and judgment of risk of bias. The second phase covers four domains: study eligibility criteria, identification and selection of studies, data collection and study appraisal, and synthesis of findings. The third phase assesses overall risk of bias (low, high, unclear) from interpretation of review findings, and considers limitations identified in any of the domains in the second phase.

No consensus exists on how best to assess and deal with overlap (ie, duplication), where primary studies are included more than once across two or more reviews that might bias findings; although a range of methods have been applied (such as only including meta-analysis or reviews assessed as being at low risk of bias), these could lead to loss of information. In order to avoid loss of information, and to demonstrate the diversity of reviews that met inclusion criteria, we conducted a subanalysis assessing the corrected covered area (CCA) for reviews assessed as being at low risk of bias. A citation matrix and pairwise CCA were calculated and tabulated according to Cochrane guidance. Grading was applied, as previously defined by Pieper et al. Similarly, no consensus exists regarding sensitivity analysis and how best assess sensitivity of findings; therefore, findings from the CCA analysis were analysed to identify discordant review findings and assess differences.

### Fluoxetine for motor recovery after acute ischaemic stroke (FLAME): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^113s1kcR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

The study FLAME (fluoxetine) was published by Chollet F and colleagues in 2011 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of fluoxetine in patients who have motor deficits secondary to ischemic stroke? In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the population was: 118 patients (46 female, 72 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18–85 years with ischemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, who had Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores < 55. The key exclusion criteria were severe post-stroke disability, substantial premorbid disability, clinically diagnosed with depression, receipt of antidepressants, residual motor deficit from a previous stroke, severe aphasia. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the interventions were: n = 59 fluoxetine (20 mg once per day PO for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke) n = 59 placebo (matching placebo for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores at day 90 (34 points vs. 24.3 points; AD 9.8 points, 95% CI 3.4 to 16.1). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in mean NIHSS scores at day 90 (5.8 points vs. 6.9 points;) Significant increase in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (26% vs. 9%; AD 17%, 95% CI 3.29 to 30.71) Significant increase in change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 90 (-0.1 points vs. 3.2 points; AD 3.3 points, 95% CI 0.28 to 6.32). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, including hyponatremia, insomnia, psychiatric disorders, and partial seizure. significant difference in transient digestive disorders (25% vs. 11%) and hepatic enzyme disorders (9% vs. 18%). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged between 18–85 years with ischemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, who had Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores < 55, fluoxetine was superior to placebo with respect to change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores at day 90.

### Gene expression signatures of response to fluoxetine treatment: systematic review and meta-analyses [^114rEoZG]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The objectives of this systematic review are to synthesize the evidence for gene expression modification by treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine, and whether gene expression levels distinguish clinical or behavioral response to treatment, across multiple tissue types in humans and rodent models. In this paper, we use "Response Signatures" to refer to gene expression distinguishing those with good vs. poor response to fluoxetine, while "Treatment Signatures" signifies differences between fluoxetine treatment vs. control. We select fluoxetine for this review due to the abundance, yet also heterogeneity, in gene expression studies already conducted. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic meta-analysis of gene expression data to investigate behavioral or clinical response to an antidepressant, as well as the first to integrate biological pathways across multiple organisms and tissue types; in addition to synthesizing studies profiling gene expression across varying brain regions, we include studies in peripheral tissue to identify shared pathways or potential biomarkers that would be easier to assess in clinical settings. We apply a consistent analysis pipeline across all studies, so that we do not rely on varying definitions of statistical significance applied by different researchers. Results of the meta-analyses may be applied to improving the prediction and assessment of fluoxetine response shortly after treatment, and they may provide hints for combination therapies or new drug development for MDD.

### Antiviral efficacy of fluoxetine in early symptomatic COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV) [^112ZL79V]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and fluvoxamine were repurposed for the treatment of early COVID-19 based on their antiviral activity in vitro, and observational and clinical trial evidence suggesting they prevented progression to severe disease. However, these SSRIs have not been recommended in therapeutic guidelines and their antiviral activity in vivo has not been characterised.

Methods

PLATCOV is an open-label, multicentre, phase 2, randomised, controlled, adaptive pharmacometric platform trial running in Thailand, Brazil, Pakistan, and Laos. We recruited low-risk adult outpatients aged 18–50 with early symptomatic COVID-19 (symptoms < 4 days) between 5 April 2022 and 8 May 2023. Patients were assigned using block randomisation to one of eleven treatment arms including oral fluoxetine (40 mg/day for 7 days), or no study drug. Uniform randomisation ratios were applied across the active treatment groups while the no study drug group comprised ≥ 20% of patients at all times. The primary endpoint was the rate of oropharyngeal viral clearance assessed until day 7. Measurements were taken daily between days 0 and 7 and analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population (> 2 days follow-up). The viral clearance rate was estimated under a Bayesian hierarchical linear model fitted to the log 10 viral densities measured in standardised duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates taken daily over one week (18 measurements per patient). Secondary endpoints were all-cause hospital admission at 28 days, and time to resolution of fever and symptoms. This ongoing trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05041907).

Findings

271 patients were concurrently randomised to either fluoxetine (n = 120) or no study drug (n = 151). All patients had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 67% were female (182/271). In the primary analysis, viral clearance rates following fluoxetine were compatible with a small or no increase relative to the no study drug arm (15% increase; 95% credible interval (CrI): -2 to 34%). There were no deaths or hospitalisations in either arm. There were no significant differences in times to symptom resolution or fever clearance between the fluoxetine and the no study drug arms (although only a quarter of patients were febrile at baseline). Fluoxetine was well tolerated, there were no serious adverse events and only one grade 3 adverse event in the intervention arm.

Interpretation

Overall, the evidence from this study is compatible with fluoxetine having a weak in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, although the primary endpoint is also compatible with no effect. This level of antiviral efficacy is substantially less than with other currently available antiviral drugs.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care [^113v6wCt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Concern has been expressed about the relevance of secondary care studies to primary care patients specifically about the effectiveness of antidepressant medication. There is a need to review the evidence of only those studies that have been conducted comparing antidepressant efficacy with placebo in primary care-based samples.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in patients (under the age of 65 years) with depression in primary care.

Search Strategy

All searches were conducted in September 2007. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register was searched, together with a supplementary search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and PSYNDEX. Abstracts of all possible studies for inclusion were assessed independently by two reviewers. Further trials were sought through searching the reference lists of studies initially identified and by scrutinising other relevant review papers. Selected authors and experts were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they were randomised controlled trials of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo in adults. Older patients (over 65 years) were excluded. Patients had to be recruited from a primary care setting. For continuous outcomes the Hamilton Depression scale of the Montgomery Asberg Scale was requred.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using data extraction forms by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. A similar process was used for the validity assessment. Pooling of results was done using Review Manager 5. The primary outcome was depression reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of depression symptoms, using the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6–8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo. For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively). The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs.

Authors' Conclusions

Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^117Tda97]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

14.4. Panic Disorder

The effectiveness of fluoxetine in the treatment of Panic Disorder was demonstrated in 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of Panic Disorder (DSM-IV), with or without agoraphobia.

Study 1 (N = 180 randomized) was a 12-week flexible-dose study. Fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg/day for the first week, after which patients were dosed in the range of 20 to 60 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. A statistically significantly greater percentage of fluoxetine-treated patients were free from panic attacks at endpoint than placebo-treated patients, 42% versus 28%, respectively.

Study 2 (N = 214 randomized) was a 12-week flexible-dose study. Fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg/day for the first week, after which patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. A statistically significantly greater percentage of fluoxetine-treated patients were free from panic attacks at endpoint than placebo-treated patients, 62% versus 44%, respectively.

### Exploring treatment alternatives: weekly dosing of fluoxetine for the continuation phase of major depressive disorder [^115KmsUw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Antidepressant medications are typically taken on a daily basis owing to both tradition and the pharmacokinetics of these agents. Because fluoxetine and its primary metabolite norfluoxetine have long half-lives and flat dose-response curves, we examined the tolerability of a weekly dose and its equivalence to daily dosing during the continuation phase of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Open-label treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 7 weeks began with 114 subjects. Subsequently, 70 subjects who met criteria for response were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to 1 of 3 treatment groups (20 mg of fluoxetine daily [N = 21], 60 mg of fluoxetine weekly [N = 28], or placebo [N = 21]) and followed for 7 weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed in several clinical measures. Tolerability in the 3 groups was similar; there was no difference in dropout rates or adverse events. Hence, weekly dosing of fluoxetine appears to be well tolerated and possibly as effective as daily dosing in the treatment of MDD. It is proposed that less frequent dosing could potentially benefit patients by enhancing adherence and minimizing the risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions.

### Mortality risk among patients with COVID-19 prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants [^114JfbGg]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, the RR of mortality was reduced 8% among patients prescribed any SSRI and 28% among those prescribed fluoxetine. These findings suggest that SSRIs, if proven effective, could be a therapeutic option to reduce mortality among patients with COVID-19. Further research and large, randomized clinical trials are needed to elucidate the effect of SSRIs generally, or more specifically of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, on the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.

### Fluoxetine exposures: are they safe for children? [^116DBhwz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Although it is generally believed that unintentional ingestions of fluoxetine by children are relatively safe, there are no large published studies supporting this concept. The goal of this retrospective study is to determine the signs and symptoms of these children. Inclusion criteria included fluoxetine exposures from six certified regional poison centers: < 6 years old, known amount, single substance, 20 mg or more ingested, and follow up done to determine outcome. One hundred twenty cases met all inclusion criteria. Average age was 25 months ± 12 months. Median amount ingested was 20 mg. Mild signs and symptoms were noted in 3.3%, and no major signs or symptoms were reported. In 48 cases, a milligram per kilogram dose was calculated, and the median dose ingested was 2.26 mg/kg. In 92% of the cases, the amount ingested was 60 mg or below. These children will have no adverse effects or only minimal effects and require no emergency treatment or gastric decontamination.

### Compliance with fluoxetine use in men with primary premature ejaculation [^116hhRUK]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common sexual dysfunction for which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used effectively for treatment. However, compliance with therapy and predictors of long-term SSRI use in the treatment of PE are not well known.

Aim

To analyze our experience with drop-out rates with fluoxetine in the primary PE population and to identify predictors of continued use of this agent.

Methods

Men with primary PE constituted who used fluoxetine and had at least 12 months follow-up constituted the study population. Subjects underwent a comprehensive interview to ascertain self-reported (non-stopwatch) intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), self-rated control over ejaculation, and personal and patient-reported partner distress due to PE. Patients were treated with fluoxetine 20 mg daily, with the possibility of dose titration up or down based on efficacy and side effects.

Outcomes

The PE parameters of interest included self-reported IELT, self-rated control over ejaculation, personal and partner distress due to PE, and medication adherence.

Results

130 men were included in the study. Dropout rates at 6 and 12 months were 56% and 72%. Self-rated "poor" ejaculatory control decreased from 98%-41% (P < .01), high personal distress from 47%-11% (P < .01), and high partner distress rates from 72%-27% (P < .01). Predictors of continued use at 12 months included high partner distress, being unpartnered, and having a post-treatment IELT ≥ 5 minutes (P < .01). Overall side effects included headache (5%), dizziness (4%), nausea (5%), nervousness (5%), and sleepiness (8%); however, moderate to severe side effects reported included nausea (2%), sleepiness (2%), headache (2%), and dizziness (2%).

Clinical Implications

Compliance with SSRIs is a well-described problem in the depression literature, but data are sparse regarding continued use of SSRIs in the treatment of PE.

Strengths and Limitations

We report on 12-month compliance with SSRIs for the treatment of PE. Our early compliance rates were more encouraging than what has been reported in the past. However, IELT was self-reported and not measured objectively, and we did not use validated patient-reported outcomes but rather self-reported ejaculatory control and distress levels, which have limitations.

Conclusions

Fluoxetine is an effective agent for the treatment of PE with significant improvement realized in IELT, ejaculatory control, and distress levels for both men and their partners. Despite its efficacy, continued use of fluoxetine beyond 6 months is poor. Jenkins LC, Gonzalez J, Tal R, et al. Compliance with Fluoxetine Use in Men with Primary Premature Ejaculation.

### Screening for anxiety disorders in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115Xjo3o]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — Two randomized clinical trials (n = 918) directly evaluated screening for anxiety disorders in primary care adults, and neither trial found differences in anxiety, depressive, or general psychological symptom severity at 13 to 22 weeks of follow-up. Regarding treatment, 24 RCTs (n = 5307) and 8 systematic reviews (44 RCTs; n = 11 030) assessed psychological interventions; in primary care patients with anxiety disorders they showed a small but statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptom severity (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.41 [95%CI, −0.58 to −0.23]) but not in mixed anxiety/depression populations (SMD, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.39 to 0.03]). Existing systematic reviews reported reduced anxiety symptoms, including SMD among persons with generalized anxiety disorder of −0.80 [95% CI, −0.93 to −0.67], and functional status improvements (SMD, −0.63 [95% CI, −0.83 to −0.43]; 33 RCTs [n = 3063]). In older adults, only 7 RCTs (n = 215) were found with a pooled SMD of −0.66 (95% CI, −0.94 to −0.38). Pharmacotherapy evidence in primary care included only 2 RCTs (venlafaxine and escitalopram), both showing a benefit; broader reviews reported improved outcomes with antidepressants versus placebo, with generalized anxiety disorder SMD for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of −0.66 (95% CI, −0.90 to −0.43; 23 studies [n = 2142]).

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional outcome after acute stroke (AFFINITY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115LMWvH]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Trials of fluoxetine for recovery after stroke report conflicting results. The Assessment oF FluoxetINe In sTroke recoverY (AFFINITY) trial aimed to show if daily oral fluoxetine for 6 months after stroke improves functional outcome in an ethnically diverse population.

Methods

AFFINITY was a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done in 43 hospital stroke units in Australia (n = 29), New Zealand (four), and Vietnam (ten). Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke in the previous 2–15 days, brain imaging consistent with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and a persisting neurological deficit that produced a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or more. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 via a web-based system using a minimisation algorithm to once daily, oral fluoxetine 20 mg capsules or matching placebo for 6 months. Patients, carers, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was functional status, measured by the mRS, at 6 months. The primary analysis was an ordinal logistic regression of the mRS at 6 months, adjusted for minimisation variables. Primary and safety analyses were done according to the patient's treatment allocation. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12611000774921.

Findings

Between Jan 11, 2013, and June 30, 2019, 1280 patients were recruited in Australia (n = 532), New Zealand (n = 42), and Vietnam (n = 706), of whom 642 were randomly assigned to fluoxetine and 638 were randomly assigned to placebo. Mean duration of trial treatment was 167 days (SD 48.1). At 6 months, mRS data were available in 624 (97%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 632 (99%) in the placebo group. The distribution of mRS categories was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (adjusted common odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.76–1.15; p = 0.53). Compared with patients in the placebo group, patients in the fluoxetine group had more falls (20 [3%] vs seven [1%]; p = 0.018), bone fractures (19 [3%] vs six [1%]; p = 0.014), and epileptic seizures (ten [2%] vs two [< 1%]; p = 0.038) at 6 months.

Interpretation

Oral fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months after acute stroke did not improve functional outcome and increased the risk of falls, bone fractures, and epileptic seizures. These results do not support the use of fluoxetine to improve functional outcome after stroke.

### The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine has direct effects on beta cells, promoting insulin secretion and increasing β-cell mass [^1111DUZW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

We have demonstrated here, for the first time, that when used at the therapeutically relevant concentration of 1 μmol/L, fluoxetine potentiated glucose‐induced insulin secretion from mouse and human islets in vitro, indicating its direct stimulatory effect on the endocrine pancreas. We used islets from obese as well as lean donors as there is evidence that a large proportion of people taking SSRIs are overweight or obese. Our data indicated that 1 μmol/L fluoxetine did potentiate glucose‐induced insulin secretion from islets obtained from the obese donor, suggesting that obese individuals taking this SSRI would benefit from its direct effects to enhance insulin secretion and the lack of effect of fluoxetine on basal insulin secretion at 2 mmol/L glucose suggests that it is unlikely to induce hypoglycaemia in the fasting state. We also found that 0.1 and 1 μmol/L fluoxetine promoted beta‐cell proliferation and protected islet cells from cytokine‐induced apoptosis. These in vitro observations are consistent with the improved glucose tolerance induced by fluoxetine administration to ob/ob mice, a leptin‐deficient model of obesity and hyperglycaemia. The improved glycaemic control was not associated with any reduction in insulin resistance in this model, suggesting that the primary site of action of fluoxetine was the beta cells. Consistent with this, islets isolated from fluoxetine‐treated mice demonstrated increased capacity to secrete insulin in response to 20 mmol/L glucose. Furthermore, measurement of BrdU incorporation into islet cells from the fluoxetine‐treated mice showed significantly elevated levels of beta‐cell proliferation. Taken together, it is possible that the increased insulin secretory capacity and augmented beta‐cell mass account for the improvement in glucose tolerance seen in ob/ob mice chronically administered fluoxetine. Nonetheless, the overt insulin resistance of these mice most likely accounted for the delayed reduction in glucose levels observed in the ipGTTs, and use of milder mouse models of glucose dysregulation may allow the in vivo glucose‐lowering effect of fluoxetine to be more readily seen. The dose and duration of fluoxetine used in the in vivo experiments are in line with previously published studies where fluoxetine has been delivered in vivo, and plasma concentrations of fluoxetine remain in the low micromolar range even upon chronic use at 10 mg/kg/d.

The study EFFECTS was published by EFFECTS Trial Collaboration. and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage and Acute ischemic stroke. In the EFFECTS study, the trial question was: what is the role of fluoxetine in patients with acute stroke? In the EFFECTS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EFFECTS study, the population was: 1500 patients (575 female, 925 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage in the previous 2–15 days. The key exclusion criteria were primary subarachnoid hemorrhage; epileptic seizures; unavailable for follow-up for next 12 months; previous drug overdose or attempted suicide; ongoing depression. In the EFFECTS study, the interventions were: n = 750 fluoxetine (an oral dose of 20 mg/day for 6 months) n = 750 placebo (matching placebo for 6 months). In the EFFECTS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in physical function as measured by the stroke impact scale score (76.7 points vs. 77.4 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -6.06 to 4.66). In the EFFECTS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in memory as measured by the stroke impact scale score (89.3 points vs. 92.9 points; AD -3.6 points, 95% CI -6.19 to -1.01) Borderline significant increase in NIHSS (1 point vs. 1 point;). In the EFFECTS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, new stroke, thrombotic events, bleeding events. significant differences in new depression (7% vs. 11%), bone fractures (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (1% vs. < 1%) at 6 months. In the EFFECTS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage in the previous 2–15 days, fluoxetine was not superior to placebo with respect to physical function as measured by the stroke impact scale score.

In the AFFINITY study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in new depression at 6 months (5% vs. 7%; ARD -2, 95% CI -4.59 to 0.59). In the AFFINITY study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in fatigue at 6 months as measured by the vitality subscale of 36-item short form health survey (70 points vs. 70 points;) No significant difference in health-related QoL as measured by the European QoL 5-dimensional 5-level questionnaire (0.81 vs. 0.78; AD 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.06). In the AFFINITY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, recurrent stroke, thrombotic events, hemorrhagic stroke. significant differences in epileptic seizures (2% vs. < 1%), fall with injury (3% vs. 1%), and new bone fracture (3% vs. 1%) at 6 months. In the AFFINITY study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with acute stroke, brain imaging consistent with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a persisting neurological deficit, fluoxetine was not superior to placebo with respect to new depression at 6 months.

### Antiviral efficacy of fluoxetine in early symptomatic COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV) [^114jCu7c]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and fluvoxamine were repurposed for the treatment of early COVID-19 based on their antiviral activity in vitro, and observational and clinical trial evidence suggesting they prevented progression to severe disease. However, these SSRIs have not been recommended in therapeutic guidelines and their antiviral activity in vivo has not been characterised.

Methods

PLATCOV is an open-label, multicentre, phase 2, randomised, controlled, adaptive pharmacometric platform trial running in Thailand, Brazil, Pakistan, and Laos. We recruited low-risk adult outpatients aged 18–50 with early symptomatic COVID-19 (symptoms < 4 days) between 5 April 2022 and 8 May 2023. Patients were assigned using block randomisation to one of eleven treatment arms including oral fluoxetine (40 mg/day for 7 days), or no study drug. Uniform randomisation ratios were applied across the active treatment groups while the no study drug group comprised ≥ 20% of patients at all times. The primary endpoint was the rate of oropharyngeal viral clearance assessed until day 7. Measurements were taken daily between days 0 and 7 and analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population (> 2 days follow-up).

The viral clearance rate was estimated under a Bayesian hierarchical linear model fitted to the log 10 viral densities measured in standardised duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates taken daily over one week (18 measurements per patient). Secondary endpoints were all-cause hospital admission at 28 days, and time to resolution of fever and symptoms. This ongoing trial is registered at.

Findings

271 patients were concurrently randomised to either fluoxetine (n = 120) or no study drug (n = 151). All patients had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 67% were female (182/271). In the primary analysis, viral clearance rates following fluoxetine were compatible with a small or no increase relative to the no study drug arm (15% increase; 95% credible interval (CrI): −2 to 34%). There were no deaths or hospitalisations in either arm. There were no significant differences in times to symptom resolution or fever clearance between the fluoxetine and the no study drug arms (although only a quarter of patients were febrile at baseline). Fluoxetine was well tolerated, there were no serious adverse events and only one grade 3 adverse event in the intervention arm.

Interpretation

Overall, the evidence from this study is compatible with fluoxetine having a weak in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, although the primary endpoint is also compatible with no effect. This level of antiviral efficacy is substantially less than with other currently available antiviral drugs.

### FLUOXETINE… [^113EwCBU]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric — In the short-term controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, patients were administered fluoxetine doses of 10 to 20 mg/day. Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 10 or 20 mg/day. After 1 week at 10 mg/day, the dose should be increased to 20 mg/day. Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment — It is generally agreed that acute episodes of Major Depressive Disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.

Daily Dosing — Systematic evaluation of fluoxetine in adult patients has shown that its efficacy in Major Depressive Disorder is maintained for periods of up to 38 weeks following 12 weeks of open-label acute treatment at a dose of 20 mg/day. Consequently, a dose of 20 mg/day, administered in the morning, is recommended as the initial dose. Since there was a suggestion of a possible dose-response relationship for effectiveness in the second study, a dose increase may be considered after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. The full therapeutic effect may be delayed until 5 weeks of treatment or longer.
2. 3 Bulimia Nervosa Initial Treatment — In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, patients were administered fixed daily fluoxetine doses of 20 or 60 mg, or placebo.

Only the 60 mg dose was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting. Consequently, the recommended dose is 60 mg/day, administered in the morning. For some patients it may be advisable to titrate up to this target dose over several days. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically studied in patients with bulimia. Fluoxetine should be administered in combination with oral olanzapine once daily in the evening, without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 mg of oral olanzapine and 20 mg of fluoxetine. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, can be made according to efficacy and tolerability within dose ranges of fluoxetine 20 to 50 mg and oral olanzapine 5 to 12. 5 mg.

### Placebo for depression: we need to improve the quality of scientific information but also reject too simplistic approaches or ideological nihilism [^117MVkvo]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study results

Accepting that randomized evidence shows both antidepressants and placebo to be effective in major depression, and that different antidepressants have different efficacy profiles, Naudet et al. wanted to investigate whether the effects of placebo may vary in different situations. As acknowledged by the authors, this is more an epistemological question than a pragmatic clinical issue. However, Naudet and colleagues approached it scientifically and performed a review of the literature comparing the placebos of two widely prescribed antidepressants: fluoxetine and venlafaxine.

Their primary aim was to compare placebo arms in fluoxetine and venlafaxine placebo-controlled studies, so the authors looked at three different types of placebo: fluoxetine placebo (in studies where placebo was compared to fluoxetine), venlafaxine placebo (where placebo was compared to venlafaxine), and fluoxetine/venlafaxine placebo (where placebo was compared in the same trial with both venlafaxine and fluoxetine). The authors find that the two antidepressant agents are more efficacious than the placebos and the three placebos do not differ in terms of response or remission. As has been previously reported, venlafaxine is more efficacious than fluoxetine, but the funnel plots show some evidence of publication bias. Emphasising this last point - and almost neglecting the primary finding of no difference between placebos - Naudet and colleagues argue that no one can be sure placebo really equals placebo in trials of major depressive disorder. Following this theoretical reasoning, they warn clinicians to 'step back to take a more objective view when interpreting a scientific result', because 'Science can never be actually sure that "sucrose = sucrose" in the treatment of major depressive disorder'. For Naudet and colleagues, these clinical implications are more important than the differences in efficacy between antidepressants (which, in our view, is much more likely and clinically very meaningful).

### Cost-effectiveness of treatments for adolescent depression: results from TADS [^117PJrxD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

While the evidence base for treatments for adolescent depression is building, little is known about the relative efficiency of such treatments. Treatment costs are a relevant concern given the competing demands on family and health care budgets. The authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three active treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder.

Method

Volunteers (N = 439) ages 12 to 18 with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder participated in a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 13 U.S. academic and community clinics from 2000 to 2004. Subjects included those participants who did not drop out and had evaluable outcome and cost data at 12 weeks (N = 369). Subjects were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either fluoxetine alone (10–40 mg/day), CBT alone, CBT combined with fluoxetine (10–40 mg/day), or placebo (equivalent to 10–40 mg/day). Both placebo and fluoxetine were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT in combination with fluoxetine were administered unblinded. Societal cost per unit of improvement on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were compared.

Results

Results ranged from an incremental cost over placebo of $24,000 per QALY for treatment with fluoxetine to $123,000 per QALY for combination therapy treatment. The cost-effectiveness ratio for CBT treatment was not evaluable due to negative clinical effects. The models were robust on a variety of assumptions.

Conclusions

Both fluoxetine and combination therapy are at least as cost-effective in the short-term as other treatments commonly used in primary care (using a threshold of $125,000/QALY). Fluoxetine is more cost-effective than combination therapy after 12 weeks of treatment.

### Comparing venlafaxine extended release and fluoxetine for preventing the recurrence of major depression: results from the PREVENT study [^117UhqjE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

This secondary analysis from the Prevention of Recurrent Episodes of Depression with Venlafaxine Extended Release (ER) for Two Years (PREVENT) study compared the efficacy of venlafaxine ER and fluoxetine for the prevention of recurrence in patients with a history of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients received double-blind treatment with venlafaxine ER (75–300 mg/d) or fluoxetine (20–60 mg/d) for 10 weeks (acute phase). Responders (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D(17)] score ≤ 12 and ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) continued on the same treatment during the 6-month continuation phase. At the start of the first and second 12-month maintenance phases, venlafaxine ER responders were randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine ER or placebo, whereas patients receiving fluoxetine continued to receive fluoxetine throughout both maintenance phases. The primary outcome was time to recurrence (HAM-D(17) > 12, reduction in HAM-D(17) score ≤ 50% from acute baseline, and meeting DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of MDD), which was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Using the primary definition of recurrence, the estimated probability of not experiencing a recurrence was 71.9% for venlafaxine ER (n = 160) and 55.8% for fluoxetine (n = 99) across 24 months of maintenance treatment. For this primary analysis, the overall effect of venlafaxine ER treatment was not statistically significant (p = 0.399) compared with fluoxetine; however, a significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (p = 0.034). No significant between-group differences were observed with any of the secondary efficacy variables. Venlafaxine ER and fluoxetine were similarly well tolerated across 2 years of maintenance-phase therapy.

### Fluoxetine [^113VPZGc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adult — Initiate fluoxetine 20 mg/day orally in the morning. Consider a dose increase after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon). The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80 mg/day.

In controlled trials used to support the efficacy of fluoxetine, patients were administered morning doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day. Studies comparing fluoxetine 20, 40, and 60 mg/day to placebo indicate that 20 mg/day is sufficient to obtain a satisfactory response in Major Depressive Disorder in most cases [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Pediatric (children and adolescents) — Initiate fluoxetine 10 or 20 mg/day. After 1 week at 10 mg/day, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. However, due to higher plasma levels in lower weight children, the starting and target dose in this group may be 10 mg/day. Consider a dose increase to 20 mg/day after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. In the short-term (8 to 9 week) controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, patients were administered fluoxetine doses of 10 to 20 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

All patients — As with other drugs effective in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, the full effect may be delayed until 4 weeks of treatment or longer.

Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Switching Patients to a Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) — Dosage of a TCA may need to be reduced, and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.7)].

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^117SaP66]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The main limitation of FOCUS was the moderate adherence to the trial medication, which might have led us to under-estimate any treatment effect. However, adherence measured in FOCUS was superior to that reported in routine clinical practice, and did not differ substantially between the treatment groups. Differences in adherence between the fluoxetine and placebo groups were more likely if reduced adherence resulted from possible adverse reactions or perceived change (or no change) in patients' conditions. We repeated the analysis of our primary outcome after sequentially excluding patients with different reasons for, and different degrees of, adherence. Such per-protocol analyses can increase the risk of bias, usually in favour of the active treatment. However, our analyses (shown in the appendix) did not show any increased benefit from fluoxetine in patients with greater adherence.

Our use of the smRSq as the primary outcome measure could be perceived as a limitation. However, the smRSq is a valid, reliable, and patient-centred measure of functional outcome, thus ensuring our results are relevant to patients and their families. Additionally, local, face-to-face assessments of outcomes might be more prone to unmasking than those done through postal and telephone follow-up because of patients reporting adverse effects of trial medication. We used patient-reported outcomes, the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) at baseline and the smRSq, MHI-5, and SIS motor score at follow-up by postal and telephone questionnaires. Other limitations of FOCUS include the absence of a standardised psychiatric assessment at baseline or follow-up and absence of a structured neurological examination during follow-up, which were impractical to include in this large, pragmatic, multicentre trial.

We cannot definitively exclude an effect of fluoxetine on a directly measured neurological deficit — such as the Fugl-Meyer motor score, which was measured in the FLAME trial. However, we have shown that a resulting improvement in functional status measured with the mRS or SIS is unlikely.

Other trials of similar design to FOCUS, but with smaller recruitment targets, are ongoing. These studies should allow us to confirm the effects of fluoxetine on post-stroke depression and bone fractures, and provide more precise estimates of the benefits and harms of early fluoxetine, to guide its use in patients with stroke and perhaps other older people with comorbidities. These ongoing trials will also establish the external validity of the FOCUS trial in stroke populations with different ethnic groups and health-care backgrounds — for example, with different intensities of physical rehabilitation.

### Similar effectiveness of paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline in primary care: a randomized trial [^111yN7bg]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressant, yet it is not known whether one SSRI is more effective than another.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of 3 SSRIs (paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline) in depressed primary care patients.

Design

Open-label, randomized, intention-to-treat trial, with patient enrollment occurring in April-November 1999.

Setting

Thirty-seven clinics in 2 US primary care research networks.

Patients

A total of 573 depressed adult patients for whom their primary care physician thought that antidepressant therapy was warranted and who completed a baseline interview.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive paroxetine (n = 189), fluoxetine (n = 193), or sertraline (n = 191) for 9 months. Primary care physicians were allowed to switch patients to a different SSRI or non-SSRI antidepressant if they did not adequately respond to or tolerate the initial SSRI.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was change in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Component Summary score (range, 0–100), compared across treatment groups at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included other depression and psychological measures, multiple measures of social and work functioning, and other domains of health-related quality of life, such as physical functioning, concentration and memory, vitality, bodily pain, sleep, and sexual functioning.

Results

Follow-up interviews were successfully completed in 94% of patients at 1 month, 87% at 3 months, 84% at 6 months, and 79% at 9 months. Responses to the 3 SSRIs were comparable on all measures and at all time points. The mean change in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score at 9 months was + 15.8 in the paroxetine group, + 15.1 in the fluoxetine group, and + 17.4 in the sertraline group. The drugs were also associated with similar incidences of adverse effects and discontinuation rates.

Conclusions

The SSRI antidepressants paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were similar in effectiveness for depressive symptoms as well as multiple domains of health-related quality of life over the entire 9 months of this trial.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^114xMCMw]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Another difficulty with imipramine dose equivalents is that researchers have used irregular dose groupings: imipramine doses of < 100, 100–199, 200–250, and > 250 mg/day. Introducing these groupings reduces sensitivity to detect dose-response differences, and gives greater weight to those patients that can tolerate higher doses. Imipramine dose equivalents are also based on arbitrary SSRI doses that cannot routinely be prescribed in clinical practice (eg, 45 mg citalopram, 125 mg sertraline, and 33.3 mg fluoxetine). However, other dose standardisation techniques have different limitations; for example, Braun et al compared non-equivalent low (potentially subtherapeutic) SSRI daily doses with standardised doses of the same compound (eg, ≤ 10 mg citalopram (equivalent to 5 mg escitalopram) v ≤ 9 mg escitalopram (equivalent to 18 mg citalopram)). Citalopram is a racemic 50:50 mixture of active S-enantiomer (escitalopram) and inactive R-enantiomer, such that 2 mg of citalopram contains 1 mg of S-citalopram (escitalopram) and 1 mg of R-citalopram. Conversely, Braun et al also categorised a wide range of doses as high in their study, which could have affected their findings — for example, ≥ 40 mg citalopram with ≥ 80 mg fluoxetine. But other systematic reviews have focused on individual SSRIs, using the actual drug dose — therefore, removing interclass and intraclass variations.

Few reviews focus on primary care (ie, general/family practice and outpatients). While some reviews combine primary and secondary care inpatient studies, most lack clarity regarding the study settings. Therefore, the inclusion of inpatient studies could limit the generalisability of their findings to wider primary care populations, as demonstrated by Cheng et al. Other methodological limitations include: inclusion of mild depression studies; non-placebo controlled studies; narrative reviews that might lack a systematic approach; use of data on file, which misses search strategies and misses references, preventing others from replicating the review; assessing and reporting on efficacy but not on adverse effects or dropout rates; and assessing response without reporting remission effects. However, even after considering the potential limitations of previous reviews, this systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis shows an overall consensus that SSRIs demonstrate a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and poorer acceptability and tolerability as SSRI doses are increased for the treatment of depression.

### Common questions about the pharmacologic management of depression in adults [^1154GbFB]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

One in 11 U.S. adults currently meets diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and a similar number report that they have taken an antidepressant medication in the past 30 days. In the primary care population, medications are modestly superior to placebo in achieving remission, with a number needed to treat of seven or eight for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and seven to 16 for tricyclic antidepressants. The benefit of antidepressants over placebo is more pronounced in patients with severe depression. Second-generation antidepressants are generally considered first-line therapy. Specific therapy choice should be based on cost, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. About two-thirds of patients receiving second-generation antidepressants experience at least one adverse effect during treatment. Nausea and vomiting are the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy. The optimal treatment duration is unclear, but clinical guidelines suggest four to 12 months for an initial episode of major depression. Patients with recurrent depression may benefit from prolonged treatment. High-quality evidence is lacking on the benefits and harms of antidepressant use in pregnancy. It is unclear whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in breastfeeding mothers causes adverse effects in their infants, but sertraline and paroxetine transfer to breast milk in lower concentrations than other antidepressants. Consensus guidelines recommend a "start low, go slow" approach to antidepressant therapy in older persons; preferred medications include citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine.

### Pragmatic comparative effectiveness of primary care treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^116HiWjm]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

There have only been 3 efficacy trials reporting head-to-head comparisons of pharmacotherapy and trauma-focused psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and none were conducted in primary care. In addition, few trials have examined treatment sequences for patients not responding to an initial treatment.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that (1) brief trauma-focused psychotherapy (written exposure therapy [WET]) is more effective than a choice of 3 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; ie, sertraline, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) and (2) WET augmentation is more effective than switching to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine for those not responding to an SSRI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial conducted from April 2021 to June 2024 that randomized primary care patients to 1 of 3 treatment sequences: (1) SSRI followed by WET augmentation, (2) SSRI followed by switch to SNRI, or (3) WET followed by SSRI. Effectiveness in this pragmatic trial depends on treatment engagement and treatment fidelity. The study included patients meeting clinical criteria for PTSD from primary care clinics of 7 federally qualified health centers and 8 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers.

Interventions

SSRI followed by WET augmentation, SSRI followed by switch to SNRI, or WET followed by SSRI.

Main Outcomes and Measures

PTSD symptom severity, as measured by the DSM-5 PTSD Checklist (PCL-5).

Results

A total of 700 patients (mean [SD] age, 45.1 [15.4] years; 368 men [62.1%]). The mean (SD) baseline PCL-5 score was 52.8 (11.1), indicating considerable symptom severity. At 4 months, 144 of 278 patients (51.8%) randomized to an SSRI were adherent and reported a 14.0-point PCL-5 decrease, whereas 11 of 352 patients (31.5%) randomized to WET completed all sessions and reported a 12.1-point decrease. There was no significant between-group difference (adjusted mean difference [MD],1.79; 95% CI, -0.76 to 4.34; p = 0.17). For the 122 of 295 patients (41.4%) randomized to an SSRI who did not respond to treatment, those randomized to switch to the SNRI reported a 9.2-point PCL-5 decrease compared with a 2.3-point decrease for those randomized to WET augmentation, which was a statistically significant between-group difference (adjusted MD,10.19; 95% CI, 4.97–15.41; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Study results showed that treatment of PTSD in primary care with either SSRIs or WET was feasible and effective. For patients not responding to an SSRI, switching to an SNRI may be more effective than WET augmentation.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^116v7jjD]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AHRQ/Mayo review — scope and methods for treatments of child and adolescent anxiety disorders — The objective of the AHRQ/Mayo review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of specific child and adolescent anxiety disorders and to evaluate safety concerns, and it was made available in August 2017 with errata published in July 2018. To be eligible, studies included children and adolescents between 3 and 18 years old with confirmed diagnoses of panic, social anxiety, specific phobia (including school phobia), generalized anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, who received any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (alone or combined), and reported specified outcomes. Specified outcomes included primary anxiety symptoms from patient, parent, or clinician measures; secondary anxiety outcomes such as coping, avoidance, or anxious thoughts; global function; social function; satisfaction with treatment; response to treatment; and remission of the disorder. Both randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies were included for effectiveness outcomes, and case reports or case series were used to identify adverse events. The key questions were twofold, addressing the comparative effectiveness of treatments for these disorders and the general and potential harms of available treatments. The strength of evidence for each outcome and comparison (e.g., fluoxetine vs. CBT) was rated via a consensus process, with randomized controlled trials starting with high strength of evidence and observational studies starting with low strength, and initial ratings were then raised or lowered based on five additional domains: risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency, and publication bias.

Time to relapse

The analysis of time to relapse, using the primary definition of relapse in which failure to complete the study for any reason was considered a relapse, found a significant interaction between drug (fluoxetine vs placebo) and level of depression (high vs low): hazard ratio = 0.46, 95% CI [−0.25, 0.85], p = 0.01) (Figure 1).

Light gray lines indicate time course for all patients; blue lines for the more depressed group; red lines for the less depressed group.

In post-hoc analyses, among the more depressed patients, the time to relapse was significantly longer for those treated with fluoxetine compared to those treated with placebo hazard ratio = 0.46, 95% CI:[0.24, 0.89], p corrected = 0.04). The difference in time to relapse between the fluoxetine and placebo groups among the less depressed patients was not significant (hazard ratio = 1.15, 95%CI: [0.82, 1.61], p corrected = 0.82).

Sensitivity analyses using alternative definitions of relapse produced results that were qualitatively consistent with those of the primary analysis (see).

### Antidepressant use and risk of cardiovascular outcomes in people aged 20 to 64: cohort study using primary care database [^116DEGoW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Fig 1 Adjusted hazard ratios (compared with periods of non-use of antidepressants) for arrhythmia for individual antidepressant drugs over 5 years' follow-up. SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA = tricyclic and related antidepressant

In an analysis of dose for individual antidepressants (table 3), rates of arrhythmia were not significantly increased for higher doses of citalopram (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 0.74 to 1.57, for doses > 20 mg/day) or escitalopram (1.06, 0.52 to 2.16, for doses > 10 mg/day), but we found a significant increase for lower doses of lofepramine (3.89, 1.92 to 7.90, for doses ≤ 105 mg/day) and a significantly reduced risk for lower doses of fluoxetine (0.72, 0.56 to 0.91, for doses ≤ 20 mg/day). Even for doses of citalopram of 40 mg/day or greater, we saw no significantly increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.11, 0.72 to 1.71), although the number of events was small (n = 28) (supplementary table C).

Antidepressant treatment during follow-up

The majority of patients in the cohort (209,476, 87.7%) were treated with antidepressants during follow-up. The median duration of treatment was 221 days (interquartile range 79–590 days), with 36.6% of treated patients having 1 or more years of treatment and 5.5% having 5 or more years of treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed antidepressant class (189,968 patients had 2,379,668 prescriptions), followed by tricyclic and related antidepressants (61,901 patients had 533,798 prescriptions), other antidepressants (33,631 patients had 422,079 prescriptions), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (156 patients had a total of 1791 prescriptions). There were 83,784 combined prescriptions where two or more different antidepressant drugs were prescribed on the same day.

The three most commonly prescribed antidepressants were citalopram (1,023,255 prescriptions; 31.5%), fluoxetine (778,285; 23.9%) and amitriptyline (236,416; 7.3%), out of a total of 3,252,633 prescriptions (with combined prescriptions counting as single prescriptions). Numbers of prescriptions overall and by prescribed daily dose category for the 11 most commonly prescribed antidepressants are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Prescribed doses tended to be lowest for tricyclic and related antidepressants, with the exception of lofepramine, which had the highest prescribed doses.

### Role of fluoxetine in anorexia nervosa [^114rd7Eq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.

Data Sources

Literature obtained through searching MEDLINE (1966-January 2003).

Data Synthesis

Studies conducted on the efficacy of fluoxetine in treating anorexia nervosa have conflicting results. Study design and methodology should be carefully evaluated.

Conclusions

Fluoxetine played a role in the reduction of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression in anorexic patients. While psychotherapy, nutritional therapy, and behavioral therapy should be the mainstays of treatment, fluoxetine should be considered as an option to prevent relapse or to treat associated symptoms of anorexia nervosa following adequate weight restoration as a part of maintenance therapy and not as a primary or acute therapy. Although fluoxetine appears to be promising for the treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa, further studies need to be performed with a larger sample size and/or better design.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^111zQV1P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used for many years to manage depression and other mood disorders after stroke. The 2012 Cochrane Review of SSRIs for stroke recovery demonstrated positive effects on recovery, even in people who were not depressed at randomisation. A large trial of fluoxetine for stroke recovery (fluoxetine versus placebo under supervision) has recently been published, and it is now appropriate to update the evidence.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 16 July 2018), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, July 2018), MEDLINE (1946 to July 2018), Embase (1974 to July 2018), CINAHL (1982 July 2018), PsycINFO (1985 to July 2018), AMED (1985 to July 2018), and PsycBITE March 2012 to July 2018). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke survivors at any time within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, given at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. We excluded drugs with mixed pharmacological effects. The comparator was usual care or placebo. To be included, trials had to collect data on at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the trial early).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, type of stroke, time since stroke, our primary and secondary outcomes, and sources of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data from each trial. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) to estimate treatment effects for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous effects, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risks of bias and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified a total of 63 eligible trials recruiting 9168 participants, most of which provided data only at end of treatment and not at follow-up. There was a wide age range. About half the trials required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between trials. Only three of the included trials were at low risk of bias across the key 'Risk of bias' domains. A meta-analysis of these three trials found little or no effect of SSRI on either disability score: SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; P = 0.75; 2 studies, 2829 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or independence: RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; P = 0.99; 3 studies, 3249 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We downgraded both these outcomes for imprecision. SSRIs reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.11 lower, 0.19 lower to 0.04 lower; 2 trials, 2861 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a higher observed number of gastrointestinal side effects among participants treated with SSRIs compared to placebo (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.76; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 148 participants; moderate-quality evidence), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 0%). For seizures there was no evidence of a substantial difference. When we included all trials in a sensitivity analysis, irrespective of risk of bias, SSRIs appeared to reduce disability scores but not dependence. One large trial (FOCUS) dominated the results. We identified several ongoing trials, including two large trials that together will recruit more than 3000 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no reliable evidence that SSRIs should be used routinely to promote recovery after stroke. Meta-analysis of the trials at low risk of bias indicate that SSRIs do not improve recovery from stroke. We identified potential improvements in disability only in the analyses which included trials at high risk of bias. A further meta-analysis of large ongoing trials will be required to determine the generalisability of these findings.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^113azSK7]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

The results of the Fluoxetine Or Control Under Supervision (FOCUS) trial suggest that fluoxetine 20 mg given orally daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not improve functional outcomes. Although the treatment might lead to a reduction in the occurrence of depression, it also seems to increase the frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function.

Implications of all the available evidence

Ongoing trials might be able to confirm the external generalisability of these findings to different populations, and a planned individual patient data meta-analysis could clarify whether any subgroups might benefit from fluoxetine and provide more precise estimates of any harms.

The primary aim of the Fluoxetine Or Control Under Supervision (FOCUS) trial was to ascertain whether patients with a clinical stroke diagnosis would have improved functional outcomes with a 6-month course of fluoxetine compared with placebo. Important secondary aims were to identify any other benefits or harms and to assess whether any benefits persisted from the end of the treatment period to 12 months after stroke.

Patient characteristics at randomisation by allocated treatment

The primary measure of adherence was the estimated duration of study medication (interval in days from first to last dose of study medication) based on all available data, including a capsule count, which was available in 398 (25%) of 1564 patients allocated fluoxetine, and 410 (26%) of 1563 allocated placebo. Patients returned a median of 32 capsules (IQR 10–135) in the fluoxetine group and 33 (11–139) in the placebo group. Our primary measure of adherence was available in 1417 (91%) patients in each group. The median duration of treatment was 185 days (IQR 149–186) in the fluoxetine group, and 183 days (136–186) in the placebo group. The median delay between randomisation and first dose was 0 days (IQR 0–1) in both treatment groups. 1519 (97%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 1494 (96%) in the placebo group received their first dose by day 2 after randomisation. The number and proportion of patients meeting our eligibility criteria and with different levels of adherence to the study medication are shown in the appendix. 143 (9%) patients in the fluoxetine group stopped the trial medication because of perceived adverse effects within the first 90 days compared with 122 (8%) in the placebo group. Around two-thirds of patients took the study medication for at least 150 days.

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional recovery after acute stroke (EFFECTS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115ftxF7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Studies have suggested that fluoxetine could improve neurological recovery after stroke. The Efficacy oF Fluoxetine-a randomisEd Controlled Trial in Stroke (EFFECTS) trial aimed to assess whether administration of oral fluoxetine for 6 months after acute stroke improves functional outcome.

Methods

EFFECTS was an investigator-led, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older between 2 and 15 days after stroke onset in 35 stroke and rehabilitation centres in Sweden. Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of ischaemic or intracerebral haemorrhage, brain imaging that was consistent with intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke, and had at least one persisting focal neurological deficit. A web-based randomisation system that incorporated a minimisation algorithm was used to randomly assign (1:1) participants to receive oral fluoxetine 20 mg once daily or matching placebo capsules for 6 months. Patients, care providers, investigators, and outcomes assessors were masked to the allocation. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months, analysed in all patients with available mRS data at the 6-month follow-up; we did an ordinal analysis adjusted for the minimisation variables used in the randomisation. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2011–006130–16; ISRCTN, 13020412; and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02683213.

Findings

Between Oct 20, 2014, and June 28, 2019, 1500 patients were enrolled, of whom 750 were randomly assigned to fluoxetine and 750 were randomly assigned to placebo. At 6 months, mRS data were available for 737 (98%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 742 (99%) patients in the placebo group. There was no effect of fluoxetine on the primary outcome-distribution across mRS score categories-compared with placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.78 to 1.13]; p = 0.42). The proportion of patients with a new diagnosis of depression was lower with fluoxetine than with placebo (54 [7%] patients vs 81 [11%] patients; difference -3.60% [-6.49 to -0.71]; p = 0.015), but fluoxetine was associated with more bone fractures (28 [4%] vs 11 [2%]; difference 2.27% [0.66 to 3.87]; p = 0.0058) and hyponatraemia (11 [1%] vs one [< 1%]; difference 1.33% [0.43 to 2.23]; p = 0.0038) at 6 months.

Interpretation

Functional outcome after acute stroke did not improve with oral fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 6 months. Fluoxetine reduced the occurrence of depression but increased the risk of bone fractures and hyponatraemia. Our results do not support the use of fluoxetine after acute stroke.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^114eSFUe]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We aimed to recruit at least 3000 patients. We estimated that this sample size would allow us to identify a treatment effect size of fluoxetine in the FOCUS trial that we thought would be important to patients and health and social care services. This effect size would also justify a 6-month course of treatment. FOCUS had 90% power to identify an increase in the proportion of patients with good outcomes (ie, mRS of 0–2) from 39.6% to 44.7% (ie, an absolute difference of 5.1 percentage points), based on an ordinal analysis expressed as a common odds ratio (OR) of 1.23.

The unmasked trial statistician (C Graham) prepared analyses of the accumulating data, which the data monitoring committee reviewed in strict confidence at least once a year. No other members of the trial team, trial steering committee, or patients had access to these analyses. Before recruitment was completed, and without input from the unmasked trial statistician or reference to the unblinded data, the trial steering committee prepared a detailed statistical analysis plan that was then published. For all primary analyses, including our primary analyses of adverse events and safety outcomes, we retained patients in the treatment group to which they were randomly allocated irrespective of the treatment they had actually received. We did a secondary safety analysis according to the treatment patients actually received rather than what they were randomly allocated (comparing those who received some fluoxetine in the first 6 months and those who received no fluoxetine).

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115pV99F]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Two studies examined the relationships between doses and side-effects. Bollini and colleaguesfound a monotonic increase in adverse event rates, from 20% to 50%, as the dose increased, from zero to more than 50 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Jakubovski and colleaguesfound a monotonic dose relationship for dropouts due to side-effects, but an almost flat relationship for all-cause dropouts. These findings might be confounded by the inclusion of both fixed-dose and flexible-dose studies. By contrast, by focusing on fixed-dose studies and using flexible spline curves, we found a linear to exponential relationship between dose and dropouts due to side-effects, and a curvilinear relationship between dose and all-cause dropouts for SSRIs.

Our study is not without limitations. First, the findings mainly pertain to patients with major depression who were judged eligible for placebo-controlled trials. For patients who suffer from physical comorbidities or for older (ie, age ≥ 65 years) patients, the optimal dose might be lower than 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. In this context, the positive dose-efficacy association through zero to 30 mg of fluoxetine equivalents is clinically relevant. Second, the fixed-dose regimen might be regarded as not reflecting clinical practice, especially when no or rapid titration scheme is used, and might overestimate withdrawal due to adverse effects. Tolerability might then confound efficacy because interventions with high dropouts are likely to show lower endpoint efficacy because the majority of patients leave the study early and therefore have less time to improve; however, strict examination of dose dependency is possible only with fixed-dose studies. Third, there is some uncertainty about how best to calculate dose equivalency among antidepressants. We used the most comprehensive empirically derived conversion algorithms, which were similar to the ones used in previous systematic reviews on this topic. We tested our results via sensitivity analyses that used alternative conversion algorithms and confirmed the primary results. Fourth, spline curves for individual drugs were based on a few studies, resulting in wide CIs. We therefore meta-analysed all SSRIs because they share a key therapeutic mechanism. The curves for individual SSRIs provided little evidence of heterogeneity. For venlafaxine and mirtazapine, the numbers of available trials were few and the resultant wide CIs, particularly regarding tolerability and acceptability, warn against overinterpreting the results. Fifth, we used dropouts for side-effects from the acute-phase treatment as an index of tolerability: these numbers do not necessarily reflect rare but severe adverse events, nor do they include long-term side-effects, including withdrawal symptoms. Lastly, the search date for the relevant studies could be considered old; however, an update search for eligible trials in PubMed on March 21, 2019 revealed only one additional eligible study with a small sample size (55 patients randomly assigned to paroxetine 10 mg and 49 to placebo), which would not change the results of our analysis with 19 364 patients.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^111thmid]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adolescent major depressive disorder — additional pharmacotherapy guidance for initial treatment notes that information is lacking regarding other medication options for adolescents; thus, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care. This is a Conditional recommendation for use, and the stated rationale is that the recommendation is due to safety concerns such as increased suicide risk for adolescents when using other medications.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^117U4pmJ]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Review design and setting

Reviews assessing dose-response effects for oral SSRI use in human adults for the treatment of moderate to severe depression were included. Data from the following study designs were included: pooled data, systematic literature, narrative, meta-analysis, meta-regression, or network meta-analysis. Data from primary and secondary care were included — although currently most antidepressants are prescribed in primary care to treat depression, a large proportion of the initial randomised controlled trials that inform current practice were based in secondary care inpatient or outpatient settings, not general practice. The duration of treatment was not defined in order to capture information regarding short and long term use and potential dose-response effects at different periods of depression treatment.

Information sources and literature search

We searched Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Collaboration library electronic databases. Reference lists of national and international depression treatment guidelines were searched by hand to identify previous reviews. Reference lists of editorials, commentaries, and letters identified from the electronic database searches were also searched for previous reviews. We searched for reviews or meta-analysis for all licensed SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) as monotherapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Key search terms included "systematic review", "meta-analysis", "dose-response relationship", "dose-response", "antidepressant$", "antidepressive agent$", "citalopram", "escitalopram", "fluoxetine", "fluvoxamine", "paroxetine", "sertraline", "serotonin uptake inhibitor$", "serotonin reuptake inhibitor$", "SSRI", "depression", "depressive disorder", "depressive disorder major", "unipolar depression", "major depressive disorder", and "human" (online supplemental file 1).

Studies on fluoxetine were first published in the mid-1970s; the SSRI that has been available on the market for the longest period. Therefore, 1975 was used as the start date until the end of December 2021. Reviews were limited to English language.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^114hao1N]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Anxiety management in athletes — medications and psychotherapy: Some psychotropic medications may be used to treat anxiety in athletes, but caution is noted regarding potential negative impact on athletic performance, potential athletic performance-enhancing effects, and safety risks. The use of SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, is recommended for athletes. In general, as-needed anxiolytics are not recommended for athletic performance anxiety. Beta-blockers can be either performance enhancing or performance inhibiting and have been banned in various Olympic sports because of their ability to improve fine motor control. In a membership survey, the most commonly prescribed medication for anxiety by sport psychiatrists was the SSRI escitalopram, and members previously reported that they avoided benzodiazepines because of sedation, dependence, impaired reflexes and balance, and cognitive impairment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the primary nonpharmacological intervention; although there are no randomized controlled trials of CBT specifically within athletes, CBT is well established as an effective treatment in other clinical populations. CBT interventions generally include cognitive interventions and exposure to the anxiety stimuli and should be delivered by a qualified CBT clinician with experience with athlete populations; additional adjunctive treatments such as exercise, sleep management, mindfulness training, and diet change may also be considered.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^112jqUYh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) might theoretically reduce post-stroke disability by direct effects on the brain. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2012 and last updated in 2019.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 7 January 2021), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 7 January 2021), MEDLINE (1946 to 7 January 2021), Embase (1974 to 7 January 2021), CINAHL (1982 to 7 January 2021), PsycINFO (1985 to 7 January 2021), and AMED (1985 to 7 January 2021). PsycBITE had previously been searched (16 July 2018). We searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting stroke survivors within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. The comparator was usual care or placebo. Studies reporting at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, cognition, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the study early) were included in the meta-analysis. The primary analysis included studies at low risk of bias.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, stroke type and, our pre-specified outcomes, and bias sources. Two review authors independently extracted data. We used mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed bias risks and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified 76 eligible studies (13,029 participants); 75 provided data at end of treatment, and of these two provided data at follow-up. Thirty-eight required participants to have depression to enter. The duration, drug, and dose varied. Six studies were at low risk of bias across all domains; all six studies did not need participants to have depression to enter, and all used fluoxetine. Of these six studies, there was little to no difference in disability between groups SMD -0.0; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; 5 studies, 5436 participants, high-quality evidence) or in independence (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 5 studies, 5926 participants; high-quality evidence) at the end of treatment. In the studies at low risk of bias across all domains, SSRIs slightly reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.14 lower, 95% CI 0.19 lower to 0.08 lower; 4 studies; 5356 participants, high-quality evidence) and there was a slight reduction in the proportion with depression (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86; 3 studies, 5907 participants, high-quality evidence). Cognition was slightly better in the control group (MD -1.22, 95% CI -2.37 to -0.07; 4 studies, 5373 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study (n = 30) reported neurological deficit score (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.33; low-quality evidence). SSRIs resulted in little to no difference in motor deficit (SMD 0.03, -0.02 to 0.08; 6 studies, 5518 participants, moderate-quality evidence). SSRIs slightly increased the proportion leaving the study early (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.40; 6 studies, 6090 participants, high-quality evidence). SSRIs slightly increased the outcome of a seizure (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.98; 6 studies, 6080 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and a bone fracture (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.41; 6 studies, 6080 participants, high-quality evidence). One study at low risk of bias across all domains reported gastrointestinal side effects (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.33, to 8.83; 1 study, 30 participants). There was no difference in the total number of deaths between SSRI and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.24; 6 studies, 6090 participants, moderate quality evidence). SSRIs probably result in little to no difference in fatigue (MD -0.06; 95% CI -1.24 to 1.11; 4 studies, 5524 participants, moderate-quality of evidence), nor in quality of life (MD 0.00; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, 3 studies, 5482 participants, high-quality evidence). When all studies, irrespective of risk of bias, were included, SSRIs reduced disability scores but not the proportion independent. There was insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis of outcomes at end of follow-up. Several small ongoing studies are unlikely to alter conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that SSRIs do not make a difference to disability or independence after stroke compared to placebo or usual care, reduced the risk of future depression, increased bone fractures and probably increased seizure risk.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination for acute treatment of children and adolescents with depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116CtA16]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Background

Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents. Antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination are often used in routine clinical practice; however, available evidence on the comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions is inconclusive. Therefore, we sought to compare and rank all available treatment interventions for the acute treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ProQuest, CINAHL, LiLACS, international trial registries, and the websites of regulatory agencies for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials from database inception until Jan 1, 2019. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 16 antidepressants, seven psychotherapies, and five combinations of antidepressant and psychotherapy that are used for the acute treatment of children and adolescents (≤ 18 years old and of both sexes) with depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. Trials recruiting participants with treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, treatment duration of less than 4 weeks, or an overall sample size of fewer than ten patients were excluded. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy of outcome measures, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using validated methods. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and acceptability (treatment discontinuation due to any cause). We estimated summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with credible intervals (CrIs) using network meta-analysis with random effects. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020841.

Findings

From 20366 publications, we included 71 trials (9510 participants). Depressive disorders in most studies were moderate to severe. In terms of efficacy, fluoxetine plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was more effective than CBT alone (-0.78, 95% CrI -1.55 to -0.01) and psychodynamic therapy (-1.14, -2.20 to -0.08), but not more effective than fluoxetine alone (-0.22, -0.86 to 0.42). No pharmacotherapy alone was more effective than psychotherapy alone. Only fluoxetine plus CBT and fluoxetine were significantly more effective than pill placebo or psychological controls (SMDs ranged from -1.73 to -0.51); and only interpersonal therapy was more effective than all psychological controls (-1.37 to -0.66). Nortriptyline (SMDs ranged from 1.04 to 2.22) and waiting list (SMDs ranged from 0.67 to 2.08) were less effective than most active interventions. In terms of acceptability, nefazodone and fluoxetine were associated with fewer dropouts than sertraline, imipramine, and desipramine (ORs ranged from 0.17 to 0.50); imipramine was associated with more dropouts than pill placebo, desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine plus CBT, and vilazodone (2.51 to 5.06). Most of the results were rated as "low" to "very low" in terms of confidence of evidence according to Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis.

Interpretation

Despite the scarcity of high-quality evidence, fluoxetine (alone or in combination with CBT) seems to be the best choice for the acute treatment of moderate-to-severe depressive disorder in children and adolescents. However, the effects of these interventions might vary between individuals, so patients, carers, and clinicians should carefully balance the risk-benefit profile of efficacy, acceptability, and suicide risk of all active interventions in young patients with depression on a case-by-case basis.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112vEbnF]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Fluoxetine: a suitable long-term treatment [^113xrwuF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A review of fluoxetine's safety profile, especially during long-term treatment, is presented. Key safety advantages for fluoxetine include lower adverse events and dropout rates compared with tricyclic antidepressants and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), safety in overdose, and safe use in special population groups such as women in pregnancy. Prospectively ascertained pregnancy outcomes following exposure to SSRIs, mainly fluoxetine, consistently show no teratogenic effects as assessed in the postnatal period and in comparison with controls. An additional advantage of fluoxetine is the absence or mildness of discontinuation symptoms following treatment interruption, probably a consequence of fluoxetine's long half-life in comparison with other SSRIs. The available data on these topics confirm the suitability of long-term fluoxetine treatment.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^114DEagV]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome, an ordinal comparison of the distribution of patients across the mRS categories at 6 months, adjusted for variables included in the minimisation algorithm, was similar in the two groups (common OR 0.951 [95% CI 0.839–1.079]; p = 0.439; figure 2). The unadjusted analysis provided similar results (common OR 0.961 [95% CI 0.848–1.089]; p = 0.531). The ordinal analysis was done with the assumption of proportional odds, in the model of mRS by treatment. This assumption was found to hold in the score test for proportional odds assumption (p = 0.9947). Comparison of the mRS dichotomised into 0–2 vs 3–6 similarly showed no significant difference between the groups (adjusted OR 0.955 [95% CI 0.812–1.123], p = 0.576; unadjusted OR 0.957 [0.827–1.107], p = 0.352).

Figure 2
Primary outcome of disability on the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months by treatment group

Ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) adjusted with logistic regression for the variables included in our minimisation algorithm. 1553 patients had mRS data available in each group; 11 patients in the fluoxetine group and ten in the placebo group had missing mRS data. Common odds ratio 0.951 (95% CI 0.839–1.079), p = 0.439; adjusted for baseline variables.

The results of our prespecified subgroup analyses are shown in the appendix. No significant interactions were observed between the prespecified subgroups and the effect of treatment on the primary outcome.

The appendix shows the effect of fluoxetine on our primary outcome in subgroups defined by the eligibility criteria and increasing degrees of adherence to the study medication; we did a series of prespecified per-protocol analyses, which sequentially excluded subgroups of patients who either did not meet our eligibility criteria or had incomplete adherence to the study medication. We did not observe greater benefit in patients with greater adherence.

Results

We identified 24 524 published records through electronic search, manual search, or personal communication, and 4030 unpublished records through industry and regulatory agency websites, contact with authors, and trial registries. 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and we included 77 studies examining various fixed doses of the included drugs: 27 studies based on published articles only, 21 studies based on unpublished records only, and 29 based on both published and unpublished records (figure 1). The 77 studies included 201 treatment groups: placebo (75 treatment groups), citalopram (17 treatment groups), escitalopram (16 treatment groups), fluoxetine (27 treatment groups), mirtazapine (11 treatment groups), paroxetine (28 treatment groups), sertraline (11 treatment groups), and venlafaxine (16 treatment groups). The study year ranged between 1986 and 2013. The full references and the characteristics of the included studies are presented in the appendix.

Study selection

The 77 studies included 19 364 participants (6881 were allocated to placebo and 12 483 to active drug). Their mean age was 42.5 years (SD 11.0), and 7156 (60.9%) of 11 749 participants for whom gender was reported were women. The median length of trial was 8 weeks (IQR 6–8). Nine studies had five treatment groups, 29 had four treatment groups, 30 had three treatment groups, and nine had two treatment groups. 40 (52%) were done in North America, 13 (17%) in Europe, and ten (13%) were cross-continental. 18 (23%) took place in secondary or tertiary care, four (5%) in primary care, six (78%) in both primary and secondary care, and 48 (62%) studies did not specify their study settings. The results of the risk of bias assessment are provided in the appendix. Many domains were rated as unclear and the overall risk of bias was rated as low in 21 (27%) studies, moderate in 55 (71%), and high in one (1%).

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride (fluoxetine) [^113zx5bJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Associated with discontinuation in Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, bulimia, and Panic Disorder placebo-controlled clinical trials (excluding data from extensions of trials) — Table 5 lists the adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment (incidence at least twice that for placebo and at least 1% for fluoxetine in clinical trials collecting only a primary reaction associated with discontinuation) in Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, bulimia, and Panic Disorder clinical trials, plus non-U.S. Panic Disorder clinical trials.

Other adverse reactions in pediatric patients (children and adolescents) — Treatment-emergent adverse reactions were collected in 322 pediatric patients (180 fluoxetine-treated, 142 placebo-treated). The overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. However, the following adverse reactions (excluding those which appear in the body or footnotes of Tables 4 and 5 and those for which the COSTART terms were uninformative or misleading) were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for fluoxetine and greater than placebo: thirst, hyperkinesia, agitation, personality disorder, epistaxis, urinary frequency, and menorrhagia.

The most common adverse reaction (incidence at least 1% for fluoxetine and greater than placebo) associated with discontinuation in 3 pediatric placebo-controlled trials (N = 418 randomized; 228 fluoxetine-treated; 190 placebo-treated) was mania/hypomania (1.8% for fluoxetine-treated, 0% for placebo-treated). In these clinical trials, only a primary reaction associated with discontinuation was collected.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^1113Qe9K]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

In all cases, it is important to discuss and document potential benefits and harms with patients and their families, and the lack of robust evidence or marketing authorisation for any drug treatment other than fluoxetine 20 mg once daily. The practicality of blood monitoring in local services may imply that it is not feasible to prescribe antipsychotics and (especially) lithium. It is also important to discuss marketing authorisation regulations for potential antidepressants in your own country (for example in the United Kingdom, marketing authorisation for adolescent depression is only present for fluoxetine). If you are unsure, it is important to discuss cases with your consultant peers and to document this.

If a patient has severe side effects (such as suicidality) on one SSRI, is it safe to try a second SSRI?

While the majority of adolescents given an SSRI have mild, transient side effects, a small number of patients have rarer and more dangerous side effects, including suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, and clotting abnormalities. Many patients and their families (and their prescribers) will choose to stop the medication in this situation.

There is then the question of whether another SSRI should be used. There is no published evidence regarding this. However, in consensus discussions, several psychiatrists have tried the patient on a second SSRI and this has not led to the same side effect. It is likely the patient will have increased risk of, for example, suicidality on a second SSRI compared to a patient who has never had an SSRI, but it could be worth trying, especially in more severe depression which itself carries significant suicide risk. As always, it is important to discuss potential benefits and risks with patients and families and make decisions jointly. It is essential to document these discussions. It is also especially important to follow these patients up regularly when starting a second SSRI and have a clear plan in place for what is to be done if these side effects recur. If unsure, discuss the case with consultant peers and document this.

It is also important to take into account the pharmacological profile of the first and second SSRI. Among the SSRIs, sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram have significantly higher 5-HT specificity than fluoxetine. So, if sertraline caused dangerous side effects, it would be better to try the more different fluoxetine than citalopram as second line.

### Antidepressant use and risk of cardiovascular outcomes in people aged 20 to 64: cohort study using primary care database [^113FSXRt]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Adjusted hazard ratios were similar when patients who had not received any antidepressant prescriptions during follow-up were removed from the analysis (supplementary table H) and when the entire follow-up period was used (supplementary table I). We saw some indication that hazard rates were not proportional over the five years of follow-up, and some differences in the hazard ratios were apparent when the analysis was restricted to the first year of follow-up compared with values over five years. In this one year analysis (table 4), we found a significantly reduced risk for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors compared with no use of antidepressants (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58, 0.42 to 0.79; P = 0.001); although overall no significant difference (at P < 0.01) existed between the five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (P = 0.11) or the four tricyclic and related antidepressants (P = 0.03), a significant reduction occurred with fluoxetine (adjusted hazard ratio 0.44, 0.27 to 0.72; P = 0.001) and a significant increase with lofepramine (3.07, 1.50 to 6.26; P = 0.002). We found no significant associations with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in years 1–3 and 3–5 of follow-up (supplementary table F) or with fluoxetine (supplementary table G).

### Fluoxetine versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^115Fpafs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in primary care and is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, thus creating significant demands on service providers. The antidepressant fluoxetine has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison with other conventional and unconventional antidepressants. However, these studies have produced conflicting findings. Other systematic reviews have considered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) as a group which limits the applicability of the indings for fluoxetine alone. Therefore, this review intends to provide specific and clinically useful information regarding the effects of fluoxetine for depression compared with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamineoxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and newer agents, and other conventional and unconventional agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine in comparison with all other antidepressive agents for depression in adult individuals with unipolar major depressive disorder.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR)to 11May 2012. This register includes relevant RCTs from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. The pharmaceutical company marketing fluoxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs comparing fluoxetine with any other AD (including non-conventional agents such as hypericum) for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used) were included. For trials that had a cross-over design only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two review authors using a standard form. Responders to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: dropouts were always included in this analysis. When data on dropouts were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation, they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as treatment failures. Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed by including patients with a final assessment or with the last observation carried forward. Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study due to any causes and due to side effects or inefficacy. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

A total of 171 studies were included in the analysis (24,868 participants). The included studies were undertaken between 1984 and 2012. Studies had homogenous characteristics in terms of design, intervention and outcome measures. The assessment of quality with the risk of bias tool revealed that the great majority of them failed to report methodological details, like the method of random sequence generation, the allocation concealment and blinding. Moreover, most of the included studies were sponsored by drug companies, so the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be considered in interpreting the results. Fluoxetine was as effective as the TCAs when considered as a group both on a dichotomous outcome (reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Depression Scale) (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22, 24 RCTs, 2124 participants) and a continuous outcome (mean scores at the end of the trial or change score on depression measures) (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.14, 50 RCTs, 3393 participants). On a dichotomousoutcome, fluoxetine was less effective than dothiepin or dosulepin (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.20; number needed to treat (NNT) = 6, 95% CI 3 to 50, 2 RCTs, 144 participants), sertraline (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.74; NNT = 13, 95% CI 7 to 58, 6 RCTs, 1188 participants), mirtazapine (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.04; NNT = 12, 95% CI 6 to 134, 4 RCTs, 600 participants) and venlafaxine(OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 16, 12 RCTs, 3387 participants). On a continuous outcome, fluoxetine was more effective than ABT-200 (SMD -1.85, 95% CI -2.25 to -1.45, 1 RCT, 141 participants) and milnacipran (SMD -0.36, 95% CI-0.63 to -0.08, 2 RCTs, 213 participants); conversely, it was less effective than venlafaxine (SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0 to 0.19, 13 RCTs,3097 participants). Fluoxetine was better tolerated than TCAs considered as a group (total dropout OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96; NNT = 20, 95% CI 13 to 48, 49 RCTs, 4194 participants) and was better tolerated in comparison with individual ADs, in particular amitriptyline (total dropout OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85; NNT = 13, 95% CI 8 to 39, 18 RCTs, 1089 participants), and among the newer ADs ABT-200 (total dropout OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.39; NNT = 3, 95% CI 2 to 5, 1 RCT, 144 participants), pramipexole(total dropout OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42, NNT = 3, 95% CI 2 to 5, 1 RCT, 105 participants), and reboxetine (total dropout OR0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82, NNT = 9, 95% CI 6 to 24, 4 RCTs, 764 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

The present study detected differences in terms of efficacy and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain. Moreover, the assessment of quality with the risk of bias tool showed that the great majority of included studies failed to report details on methodological procedures. Of consequence, no definitive implications can be drawn from the studies' results. The better efficacy profile of sertraline and venlafaxine (and possibly other ADs) over fluoxetine may be clinically meaningful, as already suggested by other systematic reviews. In addition to efficacy data, treatment decisions should also be based on considerations of drug toxicity, patient acceptability and cost.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.

Multiple doses of fluoxetine have been administered to 10,782 patients with various diagnoses in U.S. clinical trials. In addition, there have been 425 patients administered fluoxetine in panic clinical trials. The stated frequencies represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Incidence in Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, bulimia, and Panic Disorder placebo-controlled clinical trials (excluding data from extensions of trials) — Table 3 enumerates the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with the use of fluoxetine (incidence of at least 5% for fluoxetine and at least twice that for placebo within at least 1 of the indications) for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, and bulimia in U.S. controlled clinical trials and Panic Disorder in U.S. plus non-U.S. controlled trials. Table 5 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in 2% or more patients treated with fluoxetine and with incidence greater than placebo who participated in U.S. Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, and bulimia controlled clinical trials and U.S. plus non-U.S. Panic Disorder controlled clinical trials. Table 4 provides combined data for the pool of studies that are provided separately by indication in Table 3.

Fluoxetine is a prescription medicine used:

for short and long-term treatment of depression in adults and children over the age of 8.
for short and long-term treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in adults and children over the age of 7.
for short and long-term treatment of Bulimia Nervosa in adults.
for short-term treatment of Panic Disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.
with the medicine olanzapine (Zyprexa®), for the short-term treatment of episodes of depression that happen with Bipolar I Disorder.

It is not known if fluoxetine and olanzapine (Zyprexa®) taken together is safe and works in children under 18 years of age.

The symptoms of depression (Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar I Disorder) include decreased mood, decreased interest, increased guilty feelings, decreased energy, decreased concentration, changes in appetite, and suicidal thoughts or behavior. With treatment, some of your symptoms of depression may improve.

OCD is an anxiety disorder and is characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors (compulsions). With treatment, some of your symptoms of OCD may improve.

Cannabis use disorder — pharmacotherapy (VA/DoD) states There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of cannabis use disorder (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, Not changed). While some patients seek pharmacologic assistance in reducing or abstaining from cannabis use, there is little to no evidence suggesting medication is effective. Drug trials examining candidate therapies in the cannabis literature are characterized by small sample sizes, short duration, high dropout rates, and absence of treatment effect attributable to the intervention drug, and some form of psychotherapy was provided in most of these studies to treatment and control groups, with the intensity of cannabis usage declining in both groups at similar rates. Two recent SRs failed to show evidence for effective pharmacotherapy, including one SR across 26 trials that failed to show that medication increased abstinence or reduced cannabis use, and another SR, Nielsen et al. (2019), that reviewed 21 RCTs and found synthetic delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, SSRIs, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone, and N-acetylcysteine were likely ineffective for the critical outcome of abstinence at the end of treatment. Several RCTs also failed to show a primary treatment effect of drug versus placebo, including one study each for bupropion sustained-release, nefazodone, fluoxetine, buspirone, and atomoxetine. Only a single gabapentin study demonstrated meaningful improvements in cannabis use and withdrawal symptoms, but the sample size was small (n = 50), and fluoxetine showed efficacy for depressive symptoms but did not improve cannabis use measures.

This study sought to investigate the likelihood that subjects will respond to continued antidepressant therapy when little or no benefit has yet been observed.

Method

Six hundred twenty-seven subjects diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were recruited in a 12-week open-label trial with fluoxetine, which was designed as a preliminary phase to a subsequent 52-week continuation trial, which was conducted in 1997–2003. For each week of the study, a calculation was made for all subjects who had heretofore demonstrated little or no improvement as to the likelihood of converting to a positive response in subsequent weeks as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions scale, the primary outcome measure. In order to compare our findings with prior research, we focused primarily on outcomes at weeks 6, 8, and 12.

Results

The likelihood of converting to a positive response decreased the longer subjects remained unimproved. When week 6 was used as the end point, the likelihood of converting to a positive response for unimproved subjects at week 1 was 36% (n = 302); the respective conversion rates for weeks 2–5 were 29% (n = 208) at week 2, 18% (n = 151) at week 3, 17% (n = 120) at week 4, and 9% (n = 91) at week 5. When week 8 was used as the end point, the likelihood of converting to a positive response for unimproved subjects at week 4 was 23% (n = 118) and, at week 6, was 10% (n = 61). Finally, when week 12 was used as the end point, the likelihood of unimproved subjects at weeks 4, 6, and 8 converting to a positive response at week 12 was 50% (n = 117), 33% (n = 60), and 30% (n = 46), respectively.

Conclusions

The study adds to a small, but growing literature that gives clinicians some guidelines to help decide whether to continue an antidepressant trial when little or no benefit has yet been observed.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^113zKKky]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Results of small trials indicate that fluoxetine might improve functional outcomes after stroke. The FOCUS trial aimed to provide a precise estimate of these effects.

Methods

FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 103 hospitals in the UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical stroke diagnosis, were enrolled and randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after onset, and had focal neurological deficits. Patients were randomly allocated fluoxetine 20 mg or matching placebo orally once daily for 6 months via a web-based system by use of a minimisation algorithm. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), at 6 months. Patients, carers, health-care staff, and the trial team were masked to treatment allocation. Functional status was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83290762.

Findings

Between Sept 10, 2012, and March 31, 2017, 3127 patients were recruited. 1564 patients were allocated fluoxetine and 1563 allocated placebo. mRS data at 6 months were available for 1553 (99.3%) patients in each treatment group. The distribution across mRS categories at 6 months was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (common odds ratio adjusted for minimisation variables 0.951 [95% CI 0.839–1.079]; p = 0.439). Patients allocated fluoxetine were less likely than those allocated placebo to develop new depression by 6 months (210 [13.43%] patients vs 269 [17.21%]; difference 3.78% [95% CI 1.26–6.30]; p = 0.0033), but they had more bone fractures (45 [2.88%] vs 23 [1.47%]; difference 1.41% [95% CI 0.38–2.43]; p = 0.0070). There were no significant differences in any other event at 6 or 12 months.

Interpretation

Fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to improve functional outcomes. Although the treatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113r1t5q]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values. Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit (remission) with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events.

Comparison with other studies

Multiple options exist for the treatment of panic disorder; however, previous evidence has been mainly limited to placebo comparisons. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported benzodiazepines as the most efficacious in reducing panic attack frequency and anticipatory anxiety symptoms. Despite this clear evidence of benefit, benzodiazepines have not been recommended as the primary treatment option for panic disorder owing to potential adverse events (sedation, impaired memory and cognitive function, and increased risk of falling, especially in elderly people) and long term risks of dependency and withdrawals. This was consistent with our findings of associated risks.

SSRIs as a drug class have been recommended as the primary treatment for panic disorder. However, evidence or comparative studies to identify the most efficacious individual drug has been insufficient. In our study we specifically evaluated each SSRI to determine the most suitable as treatment for panic disorder. Our findings suggest that fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were more efficacious than placebo for achieving remission. SSRIs combined with β blockers, were associated with reduced anxiety symptoms and were top ranked for improving both anxiety and depression symptoms. SSRIs were not considered to be the best treatment for dropout, especially compared with benzodiazepines, which might be associated with a delayed onset of action that can take several weeks. When the benefits of remission and low adverse events are considered against potential agitation and early dropout, SSRIs were considered the best treatment option. Sertraline and escitalopram in particular offered the best balance between benefit (remission) and risk (adverse events) and were the top ranked among individual SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder. The findings for escitalopram, however, were based on a single study and as such should be interpreted with caution. There are concerns about using escitalopram at supratherapeutic dose (30 mg/day) as it has been shown to increase the risk of QT prolongation. However, the risk of serious arrythmias is rare when escitalopram is prescribed at treatment dosage (10–20 mg/day).
