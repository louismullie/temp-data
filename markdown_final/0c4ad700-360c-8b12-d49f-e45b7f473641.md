## Question

In a patient with afib and CAD, is anticoagulation alone sufficient, or is an antiplatelet agent warranted beyond 12 months following PCI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, in a patient with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who is more than 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation alone is sufficient or if an additional antiplatelet agent is warranted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk trade-offs at this timepoint. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines recommend for chronic coronary disease beyond one year post-PCI. Next, I will review randomized trials and meta-analyses that directly address monotherapy versus combination therapy. After that, I need to check for any exceptions where continuing antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months might still be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the key risk balance. Beyond 12 months after PCI, the stent endothelialization risk is substantially lower, so the main ongoing indication for antithrombotic therapy is stroke prevention for atrial fibrillation, while the principal concern is bleeding from prolonged combination therapy, which markedly increases major bleeding risk without clear ischemic benefit in stable CAD, so I need to ensure I'm not overextending antiplatelet therapy here [^f7dd3bdc] [^c9b7836c].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. The 2024 ESC atrial fibrillation guideline explicitly recommends not continuing antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months in stable patients with chronic coronary or vascular disease who are on oral anticoagulation, which directly supports monotherapy in this scenario [^7fd596fe] [^776d0d7c]. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP AF guideline likewise recommends oral anticoagulation monotherapy over combination with a single antiplatelet agent beyond 1 year after revascularization or in chronic CAD without recent revascularization, again prioritizing bleeding reduction without sacrificing ischemic protection [^c3011812] [^1c60e613]. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guideline aligns with this, advising aspirin discontinuation 1–4 weeks after PCI and transition to OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor for 6–12 months, then OAC alone thereafter, reinforcing monotherapy beyond 12 months as standard [^4724efe9] [^2dab65f2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the randomized evidence. The AFIRE randomized trial in patients with AF and stable CAD beyond 1 year showed rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for efficacy and superior for safety, with fewer major bleeding events, supporting OAC alone in this setting [^c9b7836c]. A 2025 meta-analysis of four RCTs in AF with stable CAD found no difference in ischemic outcomes but a significant reduction in major bleeding with OAC monotherapy versus OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy, strengthening the case for monotherapy beyond 12 months [^be204f91]. Earlier randomized data comparing dual versus triple therapy after PCI consistently show reduced bleeding with strategies that omit aspirin, without excess ischemic events, which indirectly supports minimizing antiplatelet exposure over time [^82340e6e] [^4a46b568].

> Wait, let me verify exceptions where continuing an antiplatelet beyond 12 months might be reasonable. ACC expert consensus allows that in selected patients at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk, continuation of single antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months can be considered, but this is not routine and should be individualized; examples include prior stent thrombosis, complex PCI anatomy, or diffuse multivessel disease, though evidence is limited and decisions should be documented clearly [^63ded805] [^84977c31]. I should double-check that this is framed as optional and exceptional rather than standard, which it is in ACC pathways and consensus statements [^63ded805].

> I need to ensure practical details are correct. For chronic management beyond 12 months, oral anticoagulation monotherapy with a DOAC is preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated, with apixaban 5 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban 20 mg daily (15 mg if CrCl 15–50 mL/min), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (110 mg if age ≥ 80, ≤ 60 kg, or interacting drugs), or edoxaban 60 mg daily (30 mg if CrCl 15–50 mL/min, ≤ 60 kg, or interacting drugs), aligning with AF and revascularization guidelines [^c3011812] [^4724efe9]. If a patient is already on warfarin with excellent INR control, continuation is reasonable, but a DOAC is generally favored to reduce bleeding risk in this population [^4724efe9].

> But wait, what if the patient had a very recent PCI or an ACS presentation within the last year? I should confirm that my recommendation applies strictly to patients beyond 12 months post-PCI with stable CAD. Within 12 months, especially after ACS, dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is typically recommended for 6–12 months depending on ischemic and bleeding risk, with very short aspirin exposure if used at all, which is a different question than the one posed here [^4724efe9] [^4a46b568].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. For a patient with atrial fibrillation and CAD who is more than 12 months after PCI, anticoagulation alone is sufficient and preferred; adding an antiplatelet agent beyond 12 months is not routinely warranted and increases bleeding without improving ischemic outcomes, except in rare, high-ischemic-risk and low-bleeding-risk scenarios where individualized consideration may be given, and this approach is supported by contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA/ACCP guidelines and randomized data including AFIRE and meta-analyses [^7fd596fe] [^c3011812] [^c9b7836c] [^be204f91].

---

In patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who are beyond 12 months after PCI, **oral anticoagulation alone is sufficient** and is preferred over adding an antiplatelet agent. This is supported by contemporary guidelines and randomized trials showing that OAC monotherapy reduces bleeding without increasing ischemic events compared with combination therapy [^c3011812] [^c9b7836c] [^be204f91]. Antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months should be avoided unless there is a compelling ischemic indication (e.g. prior stent thrombosis, complex PCI) and low bleeding risk [^7fd596fe] [^63ded805].

---

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have directly compared oral anticoagulation (OAC) monotherapy with combination therapy (OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy) in patients with AF and stable CAD beyond 12 months after PCI:

- **AFIRE trial**: In patients with AF and stable CAD (≥ 1 year post-PCI or medically managed), rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for efficacy and significantly reduced major bleeding, leading to early termination due to lower mortality in the monotherapy arm [^c9b7836c].

- **Meta-analysis (2024)**: OAC monotherapy vs OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy showed no difference in ischemic outcomes but a significant reduction in major bleeding with monotherapy (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.79) [^be204f91].

- **OAC-ALONE trial**: Although underpowered, this trial suggested no loss of ischemic protection with OAC alone versus combination therapy beyond 1 year post-PCI, with fewer bleeding events in the monotherapy arm [^23683584].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major society guidelines align with the evidence and **recommend OAC monotherapy** beyond 12 months after PCI in stable patients with AF:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ESC 2024 | Do not continue antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months in stable patients with chronic coronary or vascular disease on OAC [^7fd596fe] [^776d0d7c] |
| ACC/AHA/ACCP 2023 | OAC monotherapy is recommended over combination therapy beyond 1 year post-revascularization or in chronic CAD without recent revascularization [^c3011812] [^1c60e613] |
| ACC Expert Consensus 2020 | After 12 months post-PCI, OAC alone can be used long-term for most patients [^63ded805] [^ea625b2b] |

---

## Risks and benefits of combination therapy

While combination therapy may theoretically reduce ischemic events, the **added antiplatelet agent increases bleeding risk** without consistent ischemic benefit beyond 12 months:

- **Bleeding risk**: Combination therapy increases major bleeding by 20–60% compared with OAC alone, with intracranial hemorrhage being a particular concern [^f7dd3bdc].

- **Ischemic benefit**: No consistent reduction in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death has been demonstrated with combination therapy beyond 12 months in stable patients [^be204f91].

- **Net clinical benefit**: The balance favors OAC monotherapy due to reduced bleeding and similar ischemic outcomes [^c9b7836c] [^be204f91].

---

## Clinical scenarios where antiplatelet therapy may be considered

Despite the general recommendation for OAC monotherapy, **selected patients** at high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk may benefit from continued antiplatelet therapy:

- **Prior stent thrombosis**: History of stent thrombosis despite adequate antithrombotic therapy [^6976f948].

- **Complex PCI**: Left main, bifurcation, or multivessel stenting, especially in diabetic patients [^6976f948].

- **Recurrent ischemic events**: Ongoing ischemic symptoms or events despite optimal therapy.

In these scenarios, **individualized decision-making** is essential, with careful assessment of bleeding risk using validated tools (e.g. HAS-BLED) and close monitoring [^794472e2].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Routine practice**: For most patients with AF and CAD beyond 12 months post-PCI, OAC monotherapy is appropriate and safe [^c3011812].

- **Patient selection**: Continued antiplatelet therapy should be reserved for carefully selected high-risk, low-bleeding-risk patients after shared decision-making [^63ded805].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up to reassess ischemic and bleeding risks, and to adjust therapy accordingly [^1ddd231b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In patients with AF and CAD beyond 12 months after PCI, **OAC monotherapy is sufficient** and preferred, with antiplatelet therapy reserved for select high-ischemic-risk, low-bleeding-risk cases. This approach balances ischemic protection with bleeding safety, supported by robust evidence and contemporary guidelines [^c3011812] [^c9b7836c] [^be204f91].

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

AC and APT decision pathway — In the setting of recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (≤ 6 months for SIHD, ≤ 12 months for ACS), the preferred antiplatelet therapy (APT) is a P2Y12i. For patients at particularly high thrombotic risk with low bleeding risk, aspirin may be added to a P2Y12i and an anticoagulant (AC) for up to 30 days following PCI. When combination antithrombotic therapy is needed, we recommend clopidogrel over other, more potent P2Y12is and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). When aspirin is used with an AC, the daily dose should not exceed 100 mg. If indefinite AC therapy is not indicated, the duration of APT should follow the most recent 2016 ACC/AHA DAPT guidelines once combination therapy is no longer needed. For patients requiring indefinite AC therapy, we recommend that APT be continued for 1 year post-PCI; as an example, clopidogrel would be used for 6 months post-PCI, then single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with either aspirin or clopidogrel should be continued for an additional 6 months, along with the AC; thereafter, AC therapy alone could be used long-term. Recent data provide support for use of an AC alone among patients with stable CAD who need long-term anticoagulation, and if perceived thrombotic risk is high with low bleeding risk, it is reasonable to continue SAPT beyond 12 months.

Post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) antiplatelet therapy while on oral anticoagulation — duration tailoring is described as follows: For patients at high bleeding risk, discontinuation of single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) before the recommended duration can be considered after 3 months for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and after 6 months for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). If perceived thrombotic risk is high and bleeding risk low, it is reasonable to continue SAPT beyond 12 months. For those requiring OAC after PCI who have SIHD treated with a bare metal stent, at least 1 month of SAPT with a P2Y12 should be given.

Background

Despite recommendations in the guidelines and consensus documents, there has been no randomized controlled trial evaluating oral anticoagulation (OAC) alone without antiplatelet therapy (APT) in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease beyond 1 year after coronary stenting.

Methods

This study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial comparing OAC alone to combined OAC and single APT among patients with atrial fibrillation beyond 1 year after stenting in a 1:1 randomization fashion. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism. The major secondary end point was a composite of the primary end point or major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis classification. Although the trial was designed to enroll 2000 patients during 12 months, enrollment was prematurely terminated after enrolling 696 patients in 38 months.

Results

Mean age was 75.0 ± 7.6 years, and 85.2% of patients were men. OAC was warfarin in 75.2% and direct oral anticoagulants in 24.8% of patients. The mean CHADS 2 score was 2.5 ± 1.2. During a median follow-up interval of 2.5 years, the primary end point occurred in 54 patients (15.7%) in the OAC-alone group and in 47 patients (13.6%) in the combined OAC and APT group (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.79–1.72; P = 0.20 for noninferiority, P = 0.45 for superiority). The major secondary end point occurred in 67 patients (19.5%) in the OAC-alone group and in 67 patients (19.4%) in the combined OAC and APT group (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71–1.39; P = 0.016 for noninferiority, P = 0.96 for superiority). Myocardial infarction occurred in 8 (2.3%) and 4 (1.2%) patients, whereas stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 13 (3.8%) and 19 (5.5%) patients, respectively. Major bleeding occurred in 27 (7.8%) and 36 (10.4%) patients, respectively.

Conclusions

This randomized trial did not establish noninferiority of OAC alone to combined OAC and APT in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease beyond 1 year after stenting. Because patient enrollment was prematurely terminated, the study was underpowered and inconclusive. Future larger studies are required to establish the optimal antithrombotic regimen in this population.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with antithrombotic therapy — patients are usually treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12 inhibitor (P2Y12i) (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an OAC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an OAC alone. For patients at high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter durations of APT can be considered. At the clinician's discretion, selected patients felt to be at higher thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk may continue single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) (aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily) beyond 12 months while on an OAC.

A growing number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation also have atrial fibrillation. This poses challenges for their optimal antithrombotic management because patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI require oral anticoagulation for the prevention of cardiac thromboembolism and dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of coronary thrombotic complications. The combination of oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy substantially increases the risk of bleeding. Over the last decade, a series of North American Consensus Statements on the Management of Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention have been reported. Since the last update in 2018, several pivotal clinical trials in the field have been published. This document provides a focused updated of the 2018 recommendations. The group recommends that in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant is the oral anticoagulation of choice. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor should be given to all patients during the peri-PCI period (during inpatient stay, until time of discharge, up to 1 week after PCI, at the discretion of the treating physician), after which the default strategy is to stop aspirin and continue treatment with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, preferably clopidogrel, in combination with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, double therapy). In patients at increased thrombotic risk who have an acceptable risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to continue aspirin (ie, triple therapy) for up to 1 month. Double therapy should be given for 6 to 12 months with the actual duration depending on the ischemic and bleeding risk profile of the patient, after which patients should discontinue antiplatelet therapy and receive oral anticoagulation alone.

### Triple therapy for percutaneous coronary intervention in atrial fibrillation: standard of care, or a nightmare soon to end? [^a7e43f3a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

The need to combine anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy ('triple therapy') in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease increases the risk of bleeding. As percutaneous intervention is now the dominant therapy for coronary disease, clinicians question how to manage the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and a coronary stent that require dual antiplatelet therapy. In this review, the risk of stroke and coronary thrombosis in this difficult group of patients will be summarized using current recommendations and guidelines. The scarce randomized data on triple therapy are reviewed, and there will be a focus on currently running trials on this topic.

Long-term antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation with coronary artery disease — long-term antithrombotic therapy (beyond 12 months) is recommended with oral anticoagulation (OAC) in all patients, and combination OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy (i.e., aspirin) may sometimes be continued in very selected cases.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy — history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Patients with ACS are usually treated with DAPT for 12 months after ACS, and if previously on prasugrel or ticagrelor switching to clopidogrel is recommended. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, the recommendation for most patients is to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an AC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an AC alone; for high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter APT durations can be considered. At clinician discretion for higher thrombotic risk with low bleeding risk, SAPT may be continued beyond 12 months while on an AC with aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a north American perspective-2018 update [^9e7252a0]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

The optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation represents a challenge in clinical practice. In 2016, an updated opinion of selected experts from the United States and Canada on the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention was reported. After the 2016 North American consensus statement on the management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, results of pivotal clinical trials assessing the type of oral anticoagulant agent and the duration of antiplatelet treatment have been published. On the basis of these results, this focused update on the antithrombotic management of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention recommends that a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant be preferred over a vitamin K antagonist as the oral anticoagulant of choice. Moreover, a double-therapy regimen (oral anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y 12 inhibitor) by the time of hospital discharge should be considered for most patients, whereas extending the use of aspirin beyond hospital discharge (ie, triple therapy) should be considered only for selected patients at high ischemic/thrombotic and low bleeding risks and for a limited period of time. The present document provides a focused updated on the rationale for the new expert consensus-derived recommendations on the antithrombotic management of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — for patients on antiplatelet therapy (APT), if it has been ≤ 6 months since PCI, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue clopidogrel, and start an oral anticoagulant (OAC) (with preference given to a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]); if it has been 6 to 12 months since PCI, we recommend continuing single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with either aspirin or clopidogrel until 1 year post-PCI, along with an OAC; for > 12 months post-PCI, OAC alone can be used long-term. For patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, we recommend continuing aspirin (< 100 mg/day) if < 1 year post-CABG surgery and stopping aspirin > 1 year post-CABG surgery. For SIHD patients on SAPT with no history of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and no prior revascularization who develop AF requiring OAC therapy, the appropriate management is nearly always to stop APT and start an OAC.

Clinical scenario — patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) on anticoagulation who now needs percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) specifies that for patients with AF who are appropriate candidates for an oral anticoagulant (OAC), the duration of treatment should be lifelong, unless contraindications are present/develop or alternative therapy such as a left atrial appendage occlusion device is used.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and coronary artery disease (CAD) epidemiology and antithrombotic therapy risks are highlighted: Approximately one in four individuals will develop AF during their lifetime, and AF increases the risk of stroke 4- to 5-fold and accounts for 15% to 20% of ischemic strokes; CAD occurs in roughly 25% to 35% of patients with AF. Among patients on a chronic oral anticoagulant (OAC) with CAD, they are 7 times more likely to have a separate indication for concomitant antiplatelet therapy (APT) than those without CAD, and approximately 10% of patients with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have concomitant AF. VTE is common with an overall incidence estimated to be 1 to 2 per 1,000 person-years. Combined antithrombotic therapy increases bleeding risk: the addition of single APT to an OAC increases bleeding ≥ 20% to 60%, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to an OAC increases risk 2- to 3-fold, and the risk of major bleeding with triple therapy can be as high as 2.2% at 1 month and 4% to 12% at 1 year; major bleeding is associated with an up to 5-fold increased risk of death following an acute coronary syndrome.

### Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with coexisting atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within the last year [^547cce83]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adults with a significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and overall healthcare utilization. As the number of patients with AF is expected to increase, there is a need to continuously optimize their treatment in accordance to guidelines and the available scientific data. This includes oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy for patients with a corresponding risk profile, which has been shown to reduce rates of stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a risk modifier and a common comorbidity in patients with AF, with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. The coexistence of AF and CAD has mutual influence on higher rates of adverse events and challenges physicians in providing antithrombotic treatment that balances ischemic and bleeding risks. The optimal antithrombotic treatment strategy has been the subject of several large clinical trials, leading to differentiated recommendations in current European guidelines with regard to the indication and duration of a combination of anticoagulants and antiplatelets. However, there is a paucity of data on the real‐world utilization of antithrombotic therapy in patients with coexisting AF and CAD who have recently undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therefore, the aims of this study were to describe the prescription of different antithrombotic drug regimens, to characterize treatment patterns according to patients' baseline characteristics, to compare antithrombotic drug therapy in different German inpatient datasets, and to investigate the impact of drug regimens on event rates during follow‐up (FU).

Antithrombotic strategy in patients requiring both oral anticoagulation (AC) and antiplatelet therapy (APT) — the ISAR-TRIPLE trial randomized 614 patients on oral anticoagulant therapy undergoing PCI with a drug-eluting stent to 6 weeks versus 6 months of clopidogrel on a background of continued aspirin and OAC, finding no significant difference in ischemic events (hazard ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.43 to 2.05) and no reduction in Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding (hazard ratio: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64 to 2.84); an alternative approach continues an AC and P2Y12i with discontinuation of aspirin at discharge or soon after, with multiple trials showing either no significant difference or noninferiority for ischemic endpoints but superior safety compared with triple therapy; overall, "we recommend against the routine use of triple antithrombotic therapy for most patients", and "we strongly recommend that the default therapy after recent PCI be dual antithrombotic therapy consisting of an AC and a P2Y12i", while if triple therapy is used, "we recommend that it be done for a limited duration (shortest period possible) in patients at high thrombotic risk".

### Role and timing of aspirin therapy following PCI in patients with atrial fibrillation [^d1cb140f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), both anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor) are indicated. However, this "triple" antithrombotic therapy is associated with high rates of bleeding. Finding the right balance of reducing ischemic risk and protecting coronary stents from restenosis while not increasing bleeding risk is difficult. In the past 5 years, 6 randomized clinical trials have shown the benefit of dropping aspirin from the triple therapy regimen to create "dual" therapy (oral anticoagulants and P2Y 12 inhibitors alone) with reductions in bleeding without a significant increase in ischemic events. Because of small trends toward higher risk of stent thrombosis, especially in higher risk patients with acute coronary syndromes, current recommendations call for dual therapy as the "default" regimen, but that risk stratification be used to help inform the decision on potentially using a brief period of triple therapy in selected high ischemic risk patients. For long-term therapy (after one year post-PCI), recent studies have found oral anticoagulation alone without any antiplatelet therapy has a favorable benefit risk ratio. Thus, while dropping aspirin at varying times post-PCI has become an attractive strategy in many patient groups, careful patient selection and individualized assessment of the risk:benefit balance is warranted.

combination with OAC in patients with AF after percutaneous coronary intervention, to prevent stent thrombosis, or after acute coronary syndromes. 1, 2 In patients with AF who require stenting, guidelines recommend concurrent AP plus OAC for up to 1 year and, in those at risk for stroke, OAC alone thereafter. 11, 12. In the present analysis, clinical outcomes and bleeding risk were investigated and compared in patients with de novo AF who received either OAC plus AP or OAC alone over 3 and 12 months. Unadjusted and adjusted HRs for outcome events over 12 months are displayed in Figure 2. Patients treated with OAC plus AP at registry entry had numerically higher rates of all clinical outcomes than those treated with OAC alone over 3 months. In this prospective registry of patients with newly diagnosed AF receiving anticoagulant therapy, the majority was treated with OAC alone, whereas 1 in 8 individuals received OAC plus AP.

Patients prescribed OAC plus AP had a higher burden of cardiovascular indications for AP therapy such as ACS, CAD, and carotid occlusive disease, as well as a range of cardiovascular conditions that AP drugs are not known to ameliorate, including hypertension, diabetes, and history of bleeding. Conversely, in higher-risk patients, preventing stroke is a treatment priority, albeit at a cost of some increase in risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel, either alone or in combination, have been demonstrated to be less efficacious than OACs at preventing stroke in patients with AF and can cause similar or higher rates of bleeding. 21–31 Therefore, AP drugs are not routinely recommended for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF. Several clinical trials37-39 have investigated the efficacy and safety of add-on AP therapy in patients with AF receiving OACs.

In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation study37 conducted in more than 18 000 patients with AF at risk of stroke, apixaban exerted comparable favorable effects on preventing stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality and caused less major bleeding than warfarin irrespective of whether aspirin was concomitantly used, including in subgroups of patients with arterial disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to patients with AF, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate oral anticoagulation monotherapy over combined therapy with oral anticoagulation and a single antiplatelet agent (aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor) to decrease the risk of major bleeding in patients with AF and chronic coronary disease (beyond 1 year after revascularization or CAD not requiring coronary revascularization) without a history of stent thrombosis.

### Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with coexisting atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within the last year [^b36c0421]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Focusing on analyses of patients with coexisting AF and CAD undergoing recent PCI, the proportion of patients receiving OAC therapy varied widely, ranging from less than 50% to nearly 100% in different studies. Over time, more patients received dual or triple antithrombotic therapy rather than DAPT alone, consistent with guideline recommendations. Comorbidity burden and a history of stroke were important predictors of OAC treatment, whereas concomitant antiplatelet therapy was associated with non‐use of OACs. Treatment with OACs, and particularly NOACs, was associated with a net clinical benefit in terms of both MACE and major bleeding events in patients with AF and CAD in general. However, other analyses focusing on patients with recent PCI have reported only trends toward improved outcomes in patients on OAC, which is consistent with our findings.

There are clear recommendations from European guidelines and consensus statements regarding the optimal drug regimens and duration of combined antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF and CAD who have recently undergone coronary revascularization. At hospital discharge, a combination of an OAC and an antiplatelet drug for 6 and 12 months after revascularization for chronic coronary syndrome and acute coronary syndrome is the standard recommendation for most patients followed by long‐term OAC treatment alone. In our analysis, even in the rPCI groups, 15.2% (H2 registry) and 5.1% (Heart Center Leipzig EMR cohort) were discharged without antiplatelet therapy, reflecting the decision to shorten the duration of combined antithrombotic therapy. Specific reasons at the patient level cannot be derived from our analysis, but a lack of antiplatelet treatment was associated with increased MACE rates during FU. On the other hand, 14.5% (H2 registry) and 7.5% (Heart Center Leipzig EMR cohort) of patients were not prescribed OAC therapy at hospital discharge with the vast majority of these patients being treated with one or more antiplatelet agents. As OAC may be beneficial even in patients at high risk of bleeding, this must be considered a potential underuse. Importantly, previous studies have shown insufficient agreement between physician assessment of bleeding risk and validated scores, highlighting the need for standardized risk assessment.

Atrial fibrillation on OAC undergoing PCI — aspirin during hospitalization and short-term triple therapy: Low-dose aspirin is recommended for the duration of the hospitalization, and in general, the guidance states to recommend discontinuing it prior to/up on discharge in most patients; although the default approach is dual antiplatelet therapy, because the risk of stent-related thrombotic complications is greatest in the first month post-PCI, one may consider continuing aspirin 81 mg/day for 30 days (after which the patient should switch to an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor) in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk.

Recently, the Open-Label, Randomised, Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring Two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects with Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PIONEER AF-PCI) trial randomly assigned 2124 patients with non-valvular AF who underwent PCI to receive in a 1:1:1 ratio low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor for 12 months (group 1), very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months (group 2), or standard therapy with a dose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months (group 3). At 12 months, rates of the primary safety endpoint (clinically significant bleeding) were significantly lower in the two groups receiving rivaroxaban compared with the standard therapy group (16.8% in group 1, 18.0% in group 2 and 26.7% in group 3; HR for group 1 vs group 3 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.76, p < 0.001; HR for group 2 vs group 3 0.63, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80, p < 0.001). The secondary combined ischaemic endpoint (CV death, MI or stroke) occurred similarly in the three treatment groups (6.5% in group 1, 5.6% in group 2 and 6.0% in group 3; p values for all comparisons non-significant). Notwithstanding, the absence of a 'WOEST-like' control arm and the broad CIs observed for individual components of the secondary endpoint may preclude any definitive conclusions concerning the risk of thrombotic events of a low-dose or very low-dose rivaroxaban strategy combined with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy or DAPT. Future randomised studies adequately powered for efficacy endpoints are needed to confirm the potential superiority of an antithrombotic strategy combining a low-dose NOAC and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor monotherapy over triple antithrombotic therapy for patients with non-valvular AF undergoing PCI.

### Adding to the evidence or to the confusion: dual antithrombotic therapy in chronic coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation [^0659da60]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the world with the lifetime risk estimated to be 1/3 in men and women over the age of 50 years. Cardiovascular disease, like misfortune, does not come singly in most cases. Coronary artery disease (CAD) with the chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common comorbid condition. Management of patients with AF with a comprehensive treatment of risk factors and concomitant diseases is the key to treat these patients. Yet, the devil is in the details as treatment becomes increasingly complex.

Patients with AF and CAD require antiplatelet therapy (APT) in addition to oral anticoagulation (OAC) after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a limited time period. Depending on ischaemic risk, bleeding risk and unplanned PCI, different treatment regimens are available with dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC and APT up to 12 months. Looking at each possible combination of drugs and therapy length, the cardiologist is left with 2.8 million possible combinations in the first 12 months only.

The optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation is an emerging clinical problem. Currently, there is limited evidenced-based data on the optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, for these high-risk patients with practice guidelines, thus, providing limited recommendations. Over the past years, expert consensus documents have provided guidance to clinicians on how to manage patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Given the recent advancements in the field, the current document provides an updated opinion of selected North American experts from the United States and Canada on the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. In particular, this document provides the current views on (1) embolic/stroke risk, (2) ischemic/thrombotic cardiac risk, and (3) bleeding risk, which are pivotal for discerning the choice of antithrombotic therapy. In addition, we describe the recent advances in pharmacology, stent designs, and clinical trials relevant to the field. Ultimately, we provide expert consensus-derived recommendations, using a pragmatic approach, on the management of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Atrial fibrillation patients on oral anticoagulation after PCI — postprocedural antithrombotic choices and durations are as follows: For patients on a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with good INR control prior to PCI, continuation of the VKA may be considered post-PCI; one can consider continuing aspirin 81 mg/day post-PCI until the INR is therapeutic (ideally, 2.0 to 2.5), and high-stroke-risk patients may be considered for bridging with parenteral anticoagulation until the INR is therapeutic; because prasugrel and ticagrelor have been associated with a higher bleeding risk than clopidogrel, preference should be given to clopidogrel after PCI in patients requiring a long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC), and the use of prasugrel should be avoided in patients treated concomitantly with an OAC; in the first month post-PCI, one may consider additional aspirin 81 mg/day for up to 30 days in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk; for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) requiring an OAC for AF, single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with a P2Y12 inhibitor should be continued for 12 months; for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) requiring an OAC for AF, SAPT with clopidogrel should be continued for 6 months.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) antiplatelet management — this pathway is disproportionately focused on antiplatelet therapy (APT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation; bare metal stents are no longer the preferred choice, even in high bleeding-risk patients, and for those receiving a bare metal stent or balloon angioplasty alone, shorter durations of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (≤ 1 month) are feasible in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), while in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) the duration of DAPT is the same irrespective of stent type; additionally, APT can usually be discontinued when anticoagulation (AC) is initiated, and although risk scores may help stratify thromboembolic and bleeding risk, overlapping and time-varying risks limit a generalized approach to treatment.

### Patient management following percutaneous coronary intervention [^2dab65f2]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients taking anticoagulant therapy (eg, patients with atrial fibrillation, with mechanical prosthetic valves, and with prior venous thromboembolism), triple antithrombotic therapy (DAPT plus an oral anticoagulant) was formerly the mainstay medical therapy post-PCI. Evidence now supports the use of dual antithrombotic therapy (SAPT plus an oral anticoagulant) in these patients to mitigate bleeding risk. A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of patients with atrial fibrillation found that direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy post-PCI was associated with reduced bleeding risk compared to vitamin K antagonist plus DAPT, without a significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular events. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends discontinuation of aspirin treatment 1 to 4 weeks post-PCI with maintenance of P2Y12 inhibitor plus DOAC or warfarin therapy to reduce bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulant therapy. Duration of triple antithrombotic therapy should be limited to 1 week post-PCI for most patients, with duration up to 4 weeks considered for patients at high thrombotic and low bleeding risk. The 2024 ESC Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes recommend early (≤ 1 week) cessation of aspirin therapy after uncomplicated PCI, with continuation of oral anticoagulant and clopidogrel therapy thereafter. The HAS-BLED score can be used to guide decision-making regarding anticoagulation therapy and bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline additionally recommends that choice of a DOAC over warfarin is reasonable to reduce bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulant therapy and DAPT or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. Dual antithrombotic therapy should be continued for up to 12 months post-PCI with transition to oral anticoagulant monotherapy thereafter; early discontinuation at 6 months can be considered for patients with low thrombotic or high bleeding risk. Based on a secondary analysis of the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events with Rivaroxaban in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease) trial, monotherapy with rivaroxaban could be considered for patients with atrial fibrillation and stable CAD beyond 12 months post-PCI. For patients post-PCI with prior venous thromboembolism on indefinite anticoagulation, a DOAC should be combined with SAPT (Figure 1). Patients with mechanical valves must receive warfarin in combination with SAPT post-PCI, as DOACs are contraindicated in these patients.

### Combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in cardiovascular disease [^39ba4a2b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of the > 3 million Americans with atrial fibrillation will experience an acute coronary syndrome or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Therefore, concurrent indications for multiple antithrombotic agents is a common clinical scenario. Although each helps reduce thrombotic risk, their combined use significantly increases the risk of major bleeding events, which can be life threatening. In the past 5 years, a number of randomized clinical trials have explored different combinations of anticoagulation plus antiplatelet agents aimed at minimizing bleeding risk while preserving low thrombotic event rates. In general, shorter courses with fewer antithrombotic agents have been found to be effective, particularly when direct oral anticoagulants are combined with clopidogrel. Combined use of very low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin has also demonstrated benefit in atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary and peripheral artery disease. Use of proton pump inhibitor therapy while patients are taking multiple antithrombotic agents has the potential to further reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk in select populations. Applying this evidence to patients with multiple thrombotic conditions will help to avoid costly and life-threatening adverse medication events.

Background

The optimal long-term antithrombotic strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain. Individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had variations in their reported results and were not powered for effectiveness outcomes.

Objectives

This study aimed to pool the results of RCTs comparing the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation (OAC) monotherapy vs OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) in patients with AF and stable CAD.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov until September 09, 2024. The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or death. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. We obtained unpublished results from principal investigators of the included RCTs, as needed, to calculate pooled HRs and 95% CIs and to perform prespecified subgroup analyses.

Results

Among 690 screened records, 4 RCTs with 4,092 randomized patients were included (2 using edoxaban, 1 using rivaroxaban, and 1 using any oral anticoagulant; mean age 73.9 years, 20.1% women). The median follow-up durations ranged from 12 to 30 months (overall estimated weighted mean follow-up of 21.9 months). There were no statistically significant differences between OAC monotherapy vs OAC plus SAPT in the primary effectiveness outcome (7.3% vs 8.2%; HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.72–1.12), myocardial infarction (1.0% vs 0.7%; HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 0.75–3.04), ischemic stroke (1.9% vs 2.1%; HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.57–1.37), all-cause death (4.2% vs 5.3%; HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49–1.80), or cardiovascular death (2.4% vs 3.0%; HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.54–1.15). OAC monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding than OAC plus SAPT (3.3% vs 5.7%; HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.44–0.79). Subgroup analyses did not show significant interactions for effectiveness but suggested that the magnitude of bleeding reduction may be greater among men (P interaction = 0.03) and among patients with diabetes mellitus (P interaction = 0.04).

Conclusions

In patients with AF and stable CAD, OAC monotherapy, compared with OAC plus SAPT, was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ischemic events but resulted in a significantly reduced risk of bleeding.

### Combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy: clinical benefits and risks [^83fc5af4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for the initial and long-term management of acute coronary syndromes but increases the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy is often combined with oral anticoagulants in patients with an indication for warfarin therapy (e.g. atrial fibrillation) who also have an indication for antiplatelet therapy (e.g. coronary artery disease) but the appropriateness of such an approach is unresolved. Anticoagulation appears to be as effective as antiplatelet therapy for long-term management of acute coronary syndrome and stroke, and possibly peripheral artery disease, but causes more bleeding. Therefore, in such patients who develop atrial fibrillation, switching from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulants might be all that is required. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy has only been proven to provide additional benefit over anticoagulants alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not as effective as oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than oral anticoagulants in patients with coronary stents. Whether the benefits of triple therapy outweigh the risks in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents requires evaluation in randomized trials.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

History of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with atrial fibrillation (AF) — antithrombotic management is outlined as follows: Patients with PAD without prior intervention or with prior surgical repair are usually treated with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), and for such patients presenting with AF appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC), the pathway recommends stopping all antiplatelet therapy (APT) and treating with an OAC alone (direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC] preferred). After endovascular intervention/stenting, APT is usually given for 1 to 3 months; in patients with AF appropriate for an OAC, the pathway recommends continuing or switching to SAPT (either clopidogrel or aspirin, clopidogrel preferred) and treating with an OAC (DOAC preferred), and if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after endovascular intervention/stenting has been achieved (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an OAC alone.

### Rivaroxaban monotherapy vs combination therapy with antiplatelets on total thrombotic and bleeding events in atrial fibrillation with stable coronary artery disease: a post hoc secondary analysis of the AFIRE trial [^abf48890]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Appropriate regimens of antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD) have not yet been established.

Objective

To compare the total number of thrombotic and/or bleeding events between rivaroxaban monotherapy and combined rivaroxaban and antiplatelet therapy in such patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc secondary analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events With Rivaroxaban in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease (AFIRE) open-label, randomized clinical trial. This multicenter analysis was conducted from February 23, 2015, to July 31, 2018. Patients with AF and stable CAD who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting 1 or more years earlier or who had angiographically confirmed CAD not requiring revascularization were enrolled. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2020, to March 26, 2021.

Interventions

Rivaroxaban monotherapy or combined rivaroxaban and antiplatelet therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The total incidence of thrombotic, bleeding, and fatal events was compared between the groups. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of subsequent events in the 2 groups, with the status of thrombotic or bleeding events that had occurred by the time of death used as a time-dependent variable.

Results

A total of 2215 patients (mean [SD] age, 74 [8.2] years; 1751 men [79.1%]) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The total event rates for the rivaroxaban monotherapy group (1107 [50.0%]) and the combination-therapy group (1108 [50.0%]) were 12.2% (135 of 1107) and 19.2% (213 of 1108), respectively, during a median follow-up of 24.1 (IQR, 17.3–31.5) months. The mortality rate was 3.7% (41 of 1107) in the monotherapy group and 6.6% (73 of 1108) in the combination-therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of total events compared with combination therapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48–0.80; P < .001). Monotherapy was an independent factor associated with a lower risk of subsequent events compared with combination therapy. The mortality risk after a bleeding event (monotherapy, 75% [6 of 8]; combination therapy, 62.1% [18 of 29]) was higher than that after a thrombotic event (monotherapy, 25% [2 of 8]; combination therapy, 37.9% [11 of 29]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Rivaroxaban monotherapy was associated with lower risks of total thrombotic and/or bleeding events than combination therapy in patients with AF and stable CAD. Tapered antithrombotic therapy with a sole anticoagulant should be considered in these patients.

### Managing antithrombotic therapy in patients with both atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease [^ab5d3a5d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary heart disease (CHD) commonly occur together. Previous consensus guidelines were published before the wide availability of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and newer P2Y12 antiplatelet agents. We examine recent evidence to guide management in 3 categories of patients with AF and CHD: patients with stable CHD, nonstented patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, and patients with a coronary stent requiring dual-antiplatelet therapy.

Methods

We conducted a literature search by evaluation of PubMed and other data sources including international meeting reports. We critically reviewed recent clinical trial and relevant registry evidence to update European and US consensus documents.

Findings

Oral anticoagulation with warfarin or NOACs is required to prevent embolic stroke in AF, and antiplatelet therapy is insufficient for this purpose. Antiplatelet therapy using monotherapy with aspirin is the standard of care in stable CHD. Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or a new P2Y12 inhibitor (dual-antiplatelet therapy) is needed to reduce coronary events after an acute coronary syndrome or after percutaneous coronary intervention. Combinations of these agents increase the risk of bleeding, and limited clinical trial evidence suggests that withdrawal of aspirin may reduce bleeding without increasing coronary events.

Implications

Available clinical trials and registries provide remarkably little evidence to guide difficult clinical decision making in patients with combined AF and CHD. In patients on triple antithrombotic therapy with vitamin K antagonists, aspirin, and clopidogrel, a single clinical trial indicates that withdrawal of aspirin may reduce bleeding risk without increasing the risk of coronary thrombosis. It is unclear whether this evidence applies to combinations of NOACs and newer P2Y12 inhibitors. Clinical trials of combinations of the newer antithrombotic agents are urgently needed to guide clinical care.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: where are we now? [^bc4eddd3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To synthesize the literature and provide guidance to practitioners regarding double therapy (DT) and triple therapy (TT) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Data Sources

PubMed and MEDLINE (January 2000 to February 2018) were searched using the following terms: atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation, dual-antiplatelet therapy, clopidogrel, aspirin, ticagrelor, prasugrel, and triple therapy.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The results included randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials and meta-analyses. Each study was reported based on study design, population, intervention, comparator, and key cardiovascular (CV) and bleeding outcomes.

Data Synthesis

A total of 15 studies were included in the review. The majority of studies evaluating DT and TT utilized clopidogrel and warfarin as components of the regimen, although there are emerging data with newer agents. Evidence purporting DT regimens to be equally effective in preventing CV events and improved safety profiles compared with TT regimens included populations with relatively low risk for recurrent CV events, and many of these studies were observational in nature. Overall, current evidence as well as American and European guidelines support the use of TT in patients with AF who require PCI for the least possible amount of time, depending on patient-specific factors involving bleeding and thrombosis.

Conclusions

In the majority of patients with AF who require PCI, TT should be used for the shortest period of time possible. DT regimens may be used in patients requiring PCI who have low risk for thrombosis and/or high bleeding risk.

Patient with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) being considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — peri-PCI and hospital discharge management of antithrombotic therapy is guided by a flowchart that first asks "Total duration of AC Rx for VTE completed?"; if yes, the figure states "STOP OAC Manage per ASA and P2Y12i per ACC/AHA Guidelines". If elective PCI can be deferred until anticoagulation (AC) is complete, the pathway indicates "Elective PCI: ABLE to be deferred until AC Rx complete", whereas if deferral is not possible or the case is urgent/emergent it directs "Elective PCI: UNABLE to be deferred until AC Rx complete Urgent/Emergent PCI", then to determine "What AC is patient on prior to PCI?" and to "Follow PCI Periprocedural Medication Management (See Figure 3)". At discharge, the pathway advises "Start or continue PPI or H2 Blocker", and that clinicians "Can add ASA 81 mg daily for a limited period of time (as part of triple therapy) if thrombotic risk is high and bleeding risk is low". For ongoing therapy, it notes, "For long-term management of all patients in this figure, proceed to Figures 6A and 6B".

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation with stable coronary disease [^c9b7836c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

There are limited data from randomized trials evaluating the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease.

Methods

In a multicenter, open-label trial conducted in Japan, we randomly assigned 2236 patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban (a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant) or combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause; this end point was analyzed for noninferiority with a noninferiority margin of 1.46. The primary safety end point was major bleeding, according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis; this end point was analyzed for superiority.

Results

The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination-therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for the primary efficacy end point, with event rates of 4.14% and 5.75% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.95; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety end point, with event rates of 1.62% and 2.76% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.89; P = 0.01 for superiority).

Conclusions

As antithrombotic therapy, rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for efficacy and superior for safety in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease.

### Safety and efficacy of dual vs. triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation following percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^4e7e156a]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major global health problem affecting 33.5 million individuals worldwide. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is the mainstay for prevention of thrombo-embolic events in this population. Approximately 5–10% of these patients also undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). This overlap poses significant challenges since prior data from randomized trials have shown superiority of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor over aspirin and VKA for prevention of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients post-PCI. Consequently, most patients with AF following PCI are subjected to treatment with a combination of both these therapies (DAPT plus OAC), the so-called 'triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT)' approach.

While this approach is reasonable and endorsed by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines, as well as expert consensusfor varying durations, the evidence supporting the same is sparse. A major limitation of TAT is bleeding. One proposed approach is to curtail the TAT to a minimum duration with a goal to reduce bleeding events. However, this strategy has been challenged by data from the What is the Optimal AntiplatElet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary StenTing (WOEST) as well as Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen: Testing of a Six-Week vs. a Six-Month Clopidogrel Treatment Regimen In Patients With Concomitant Aspirin and OraL Anticoagulant Therapy Following Drug-Eluting Stenting (ISAR-TRIPLE) trials which demonstrated that many of the bleeding events occur in the first few weeks after the initiation of TAT.

### Evolving antithrombotic strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: results from a survey among US cardiologists [^37a9cac4]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients treated with oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation undergo percutaneous stent implantation, where dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is also recommended. The current evidence to support triple oral antithrombotic therapy (TOAT) in these patients is limited, and new strategies are being discussed to optimize outcomes.

Hypothesis

There will be variation in antithrombotic strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation needing stenting.

Methods

We surveyed US-based cardiologists serving as clinical investigators in academic sites and posted an online "question of the month" on cardiosource.org.

Results

Seventy-five (10.7%) responses were received to the email survey and 119 to the online question. Bare-metal stenting (BMS) was a priori preferred over drug-eluting stenting (DES) for 50.6% of patients. Only 8.8% of the responders chose newer anticoagulants in addition to DAPT as the preferred oral anticoagulant. For duration of TOAT, 79.4% of physicians recommended stopping DAPT at 1 month when BMS was used in patients presenting without acute coronary syndrome (ACS) vs 57.4% in patients with ACS. In patients implanted with a DES, 73.5% and 76.5% preferred stopping DAPT at 6 to 12 months (no ACS vs ACS, respectively). When asked which of the 2 antiplatelet agents they would recommend stopping after the above durations, 50% chose to quit aspirin.

Conclusions

The survey highlights an interest in the new strategy of dropping aspirin, but the lack of concrete evidence triggers undesired diversity in clinical approaches. High-quality data on the efficacy and safety of such interventions are needed to further consolidate these approaches.

### Design and rationale of the RE-DUAL PCI trial: a prospective, randomized, phase 3b study comparing the safety and efficacy of dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin triple therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting [^b2ae9a2b]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of these developments, a recent survey found that clinicians are interested in using NOACs as well as adopting a strategy of single antiplatelet therapy. 23 Indeed, a shift in practice guidelines is also emerging whereby the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines state that in patients with AF who underwent a recent PCI and have a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 y, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 y, sex category [women]) score ≥ 2, it may be reasonable to use clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) concurrently with an OAC but without aspirin. 24 However, evidence supporting this recommendation is limited (class IIb, level of evidence B). The European Society of Cardiology, along with various other groups, released a joint consensus statement that also recommends dual antithrombotic therapy as an option in many patient groups, based on bleeding and thrombotic risk. 25 However, these recommendations are complex, derived from a single small trial, 19 and therefore relatively weak. Consequently, a single, 3‐stage algorithm, applicable to a broad range of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), has been proposed. 26

Randomized Evaluation of Dual Antithrombotic Therapy With Dabigatran vs Triple Therapy With Warfarin in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (RE‐DUAL PCI) is a large, prospective, randomized trial that aims to test dual antithrombotic therapy and triple antithrombotic therapy with adequate power. The hypothesis is that, in patients with nonvalvular AF who have undergone PCI with stenting, dabigatran (110 or 150 mg twice daily) and clopidogrel or ticagrelor are noninferior to warfarin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor, and aspirin with respect to major bleeding events or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events over the duration of the trial. Of note, the reference arm is triple antithrombotic therapy for only 1 month or 3 months (depending on stent type), after which it too reverts to dual antithrombotic therapy, in keeping with the evolving guideline recommendations on triple antithrombotic therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical scenario 3 — patient with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) being considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) summarizes that the standard therapy for acute VTE is anticoagulation, and current guidelines give preference to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) over a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for non-cancer-associated VTE while low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a DOAC (rather than a VKA) are recommended for cancer-associated VTE. Venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor can generally be treated for 3 months, whereas unprovoked VTE may be treated indefinitely, and in patients on indefinite anticoagulation reduced-intensity options include rivaroxaban 10 mg daily and apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. In patients with unprovoked VTE who stop anticoagulation after a minimum of 3 months, aspirin is an option for secondary prevention, although it is not as effective as anticoagulation, and in patients receiving PCI while on an OAC for VTE, triple therapy is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and an OAC for > 1 week after percutaneous intervention when the risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk. Decide the total duration (≤ 1 month) according to the assessment of these risks and ensure clear documentation.

### Novel oral anticoagulants following percutaneous coronary intervention [^f370c77f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications are the cornerstone of therapy for patients with acute coronary syndrome and have also been shown to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease. Whereas antiplatelet medications have been the preferred therapy for long-term secondary prevention, the development of novel oral anticoagulants has renewed interest in the use of anticoagulation to prevent atherosclerotic events. In patients with atrial fibrillation or other indications for anticoagulation, recent clinical trials have shown the benefit of double therapy with full-dose novel oral anticoagulants and P2Y12 inhibitors compared with regimens with vitamin K antagonists. In patients without an indication for anticoagulation, the use of low doses of the factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, has shown benefit. Clinicians have many pharmacological options when treating patients following percutaneous coronary intervention. This review discusses the evidence for the use of novel oral anticoagulants, with an emphasis on patient selection, choice of therapy, and appropriate dosing of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, in secondary prevention strategies for atherosclerosis following coronary revascularization for patients with and without a traditional indication for anticoagulation.

### Triple oral antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery stenting [^ce6145c5]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation affected by an acute coronary syndrome have indications for oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor after coronary artery stenting. The concurrent use of all 3 agents, termed triple oral antithrombotic therapy, significantly increases the risk of bleeding. To date, there is a lack of evidence on the proper combination and duration of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in patients with indications for both therapies. As such, care has been guided by expert opinion, and there is wide variation in clinician practice. In this review, the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of triple oral antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary artery stenting is summarized. We discuss the clinical risk scores useful in guiding the prediction of stroke, bleeding, and stent thrombosis. Additionally, we highlight where additional evidence is needed to determine the proper balance of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in this patient population.

ABSTRACT

Background

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common comorbidity in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and optimal antithrombotic medication improves clinical outcomes in this high‐risk population. The aim of our study was to describe antithrombotic drug regimens in different patient cohorts.

Methods

We investigated data from the prospective Helios Heart registry (H2) and the Heart Center Leipzig routine clinical database (HZL). We included inpatient cases with AF and CAD (hospitalized from March 2021 to July 2024 [H2] or January 2017 to December 2021 [HZL]), who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the last 12 months. Information on clinical characteristics, coronary interventions, and medication prescribed was obtained from electronic case report forms and/or administrative data based on ICD‐10, OPS, and ATC codes.

Results

We included 3481 (HZL), and 205 (H2) index cases with comparable baseline characteristics. Overall, 92.5% (HZL) and 87.6% (H2) of patients were on any anticoagulation, and 93.0% (HZL) and 80.2% (H2) were prescribed ≥ 1 antiplatelet agent. There were relevant differences in antithrombotic therapy when stratifying for PCI timing. Factors associated with higher (older age) or lower (comorbidity burden, antiplatelet treatment, prior left atrial appendage occlusion) prescription rates of OAC were identified. OAC therapy without adjunctive antiplatelet therapy was associated with an increased rate of rehospitalization for major adverse cardiovascular events at 12 months (HZL).

Conclusion

We presented current data on antithrombotic drug utilization in patients with AF and CAD and found comorbidity burden, concomitant antiplatelet treatment and other factors to be associated with lower anticoagulant prescription rates.

### Atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease: a long-term perspective on the need for combined antithrombotic therapy [^f878b5ec]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) are often treated with the shortest possible duration of antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy after myocardial infarction (MI) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to concern for bleeding. However, the risk of recurrent MI or PCI prompting antiplatelet therapy extension is unknown in this population.

Methods

Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry linked to Medicare claims, we described the cumulative incidence of recurrent MI or PCI over a median of 7-year follow-up for patients ≥ 65 years old with AF discharged alive after acute MI between 2008 and 2017. We used pharmacy fill data to describe the proportion of patients filling prescriptions for both oral anticoagulants and P2Y 12 inhibitors for ≥ 50% of the indicated duration after MI or PCI.

Results

Of 187622 older patients discharged alive after MI, 50539 (26.9%) had AF. Over a median of 7-year follow-up in patients with AF, the cumulative incidence was 14.5% for recurrent MI, 12.1% for PCI, 7.9% for stroke, and 9.5% for bleeding hospitalization. Among 7998 patients with AF and recurrent MI or PCI, 1668 (20.9%) had > 1 MI or PCI during follow-up. Assuming each MI or PCI should be followed by 6 months of P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy, patients with AF who had a recurrent MI/PCI had a median estimated indication for antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment of 287 days (194, 358), but filled both P2Y 12 inhibitor and oral anticoagulant for a median of 0 days (0, 21). In this cohort, 12.2% of patients filled prescriptions for both a P2Y 12 inhibitor and oral anticoagulant for ≥ 50% of the indicated duration.

Conclusions

Older adults with AF and MI have high incidences of downstream recurrent MI or PCI requiring extended antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy durations, yet many appear to be under-treated. These results highlight the need for better thrombosis prevention strategies in this group of patients.

We presented current data on antithrombotic drug utilization in patients with AF and CAD and found comorbidity burden, concomitant antiplatelet treatment and other factors to be associated with lower anticoagulant prescription rates.

### The role of triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^82dfe5fb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel forms the backbone of secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulation (OAC) is superior to antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. Patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event therefore have an indication for both OAC and DAPT, so-called triple antithrombotic therapy. However, observational analyses have shown that the annual rate of major bleeding on triple therapy exceeds 10%. For this reason, five major randomized clinical trials have compared double antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y 12 inhibitor versus triple therapy in patients with AF who underwent PCI or had an ACS event. Each of the trials showed that double antithrombotic therapy reduced the rate of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with triple therapy and was non-inferior for prevention of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In the one trial that directly compared warfarin with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), apixaban reduced the rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with warfarin and was non-inferior with respect to prevention of ischemic events. As a result of these trials, consensus guidelines recommend that patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event should be treated with triple antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y 12 inhibitor + aspirin) for 7 days or less, followed by double antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y 12 inhibitor) for 6 to 12 months.

6 Conclusion

The present study presents real‐world data on antithrombotic drug therapy in patients with AF and coexisting CAD, who underwent PCI within the preceding year. We reported patient numbers treated with different regimens of antithrombotic therapy and identified several factors like comorbidity burden and concomitant antiplatelet treatment that were associated with their non‐prescription. Our results can serve as a data basis for further quality improvement initiatives in this relevant patient population.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb percutaneous coronary intervention: Following percutaneous coronary intervention or revascularization surgery in patients with AF, low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per d) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg per d) may be given concurrently with anticoagulation, but these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated and are associated with an increased risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C). In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation may be interrupted to prevent bleeding at the site of peripheral arterial puncture, the vitamin K antagonist should be resumed as soon as possible and the dose adjusted to achieve an INR in the therapeutic range; the maintenance regimen should then consist of clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, plus warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) with clopidogrel for a minimum of 1 mo after a bare metal stent, at least 3 mo for a sirolimus-eluting stent, at least 6 mo for a paclitaxel-eluting stent, and 12 mo or longer in selected patients, and when warfarin is given with clopidogrel or low-dose aspirin the dose intensity must be carefully regulated (Level of Evidence: C).

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) after endovascular intervention — Patients with PAD treated with endovascular intervention/stenting are usually treated with antiplatelet therapy (APT) for 1 to 3 months, and for venous thromboembolism (VTE) needing anticoagulation the pathway recommends continuing or switching to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) (either clopidogrel or aspirin, clopidogrel preferred) and treating with an anticoagulant (direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC] preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after endovascular intervention/stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an anticoagulant (AC) alone.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^8c6df392]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

A common clinical conundrum occurs in the setting of stable ASCVD and concomitant AF: What is the most effective long‐term antithrombotic regimen? This question was addressed in AFIRE (Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation With Stable Coronary Disease). 46 The trial randomized 2236 Japanese patients with AF who had undergone PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting > 1 year earlier or angiographically confirmed CAD not requiring revascularization to rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (10 mg daily with creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15–49 mL/min) or combination therapy consisting of rivaroxaban plus an antiplatelet (aspirin or P2Y 12 inhibitor). The doses of rivaroxaban were lower than the FDA‐approved doses (20 mg with normal and 15 mg with impaired renal function) because of pharmacokinetic modeling revealing that Japanese patients achieve similar plasma levels of rivaroxaban compared with 20 mg in Caucasian patients. 47 The AFIRE trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination therapy

group (1.85% versus 3.37% per patient year; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38–0.81). The rivaroxaban monotherapy arm was noninferior in cardiovascular efficacy measures (P < 0.001) and superior in reducing major bleeding (P = 0.01) compared with the combination therapy group. Thus, the results of the AFIRE study extended the concept of less intense antithrombotic for optimal risk‐benefit established in the acute‐care setting from PIONEER AF‐PCI, 16 RE‐DUAL PCI, 17 and AUGUSTUS, 18 to the time period beyond a year from diagnosis and intervention.

### Edoxaban-based versus vitamin K antagonist-based antithrombotic regimen after successful coronary stenting in patients with atrial fibrillation (ENTRUST-AF PCI): a randomised, open-label, phase 3b trial [^24490a60]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess the safety of edoxaban in combination with P2Y12 inhibition in patients with atrial fibrillation who had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

ENTRUST-AF PCI was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3b trial with masked outcome evaluation, done at 186 sites in 18 countries. Patients had atrial fibrillation requiring oral anticoagulation, were aged at least 18 years, and had a successful PCI for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) from 4 h to 5 days after PCI using concealed, stratified, and blocked web-based central randomisation to either edoxaban (60 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin (100 mg once daily, for 1–12 months). The edoxaban dose was reduced to 30 mg per day if one or more factors (creatinine clearance 15–50 mL/min, bodyweight ≤ 60 kg, or concomitant use of specified potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors) were present. The primary endpoint was a composite of major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding within 12 months. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02866175, is closed to new participants, and follow-up is completed.

Findings

From Feb 24, 2017, through May 7, 2018, 1506 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the edoxaban regimen (n = 751) or VKA regimen (n = 755). Median time from PCI to randomisation was 45·1 h (IQR 22·2–76·2). Major or CRNM bleeding events occurred in 128 (17%) of 751 patients (annualised event rate 20·7%) with the edoxaban regimen and 152 (20%) of 755 patients (annualised event rate 25·6%) patients with the VKA regimen; hazard ratio 0·83 (95% CI 0·65–1·05; p = 0·0010 for non-inferiority, margin hazard ratio 1·20; p = 0·1154 for superiority).

Interpretation

In patients with atrial fibrillation who had PCI, the edoxaban-based regimen was non-inferior for bleeding compared with the VKA-based regimen, without significant differences in ischaemic events.

### Meta-analysis comparing oral anticoagulant monotherapy versus dual antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease [^bf1bead3]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This meta‐analysis adds to the literature by integrating results from a newly published clinical trial, enhancing the robustness of the evidence base. However, it has certain limitations. This meta‐analysis is based on study‐level data, and the duration of DAT was not available. A dedicated meta‐analysis based on individual patient data may provide further information to confirm the optimal antithrombotic regimen in this complex field. It is important to acknowledge that while these findings are compelling, they should be interpreted within the context of the individual patient's clinical profile, considering factors such as their bleeding risk, the nature of their CAD, and the time elapsed since any coronary interventions. Moreover, it should be considered that the point estimate for MI was > 1.0 with wide confidence intervals. Therefore, additional trial data would be informative.

Acute coronary syndromes — aspirin discontinuation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in atrial fibrillation (AF) on oral anticoagulation is supported by trials showing that discontinuation of aspirin 1 to 4 weeks after PCI reduces bleeding, with meta-analyses suggesting no difference in mortality, stroke, and overall major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) but with a marginal apparent increase in myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis; because 80% of stent thrombosis events occurred within 30 days of PCI and randomization was approximately 1 week after PCI in AUGUSTUS, in patients with a high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin for up to 30 days after PCI could be considered, and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after PCI following aspirin discontinuation but could be discontinued earlier in those with multiple risk factors for bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after percutaneous coronary intervention during 2-year follow-up, from a nationwide population study [^c44c072b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are recommended to receive oral anticoagulants (OAC) and concomitant antiplatelet agents followed by OAC monotherapy continued beyond a year after PCI. However, long-term prescription patterns of antithrombotic therapy in real-world clinical practice were not fully investigated. From the National Health Insurance Service database of Korea, we obtained records of patients with AF who underwent PCI between 2009 and 2013. Patients without repeated PCI or death within 2 years following the procedure were included. Prescription records of antithrombotic therapy including anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents were reviewed at 3-month intervals after discharge. We investigated 8,891 patients. At discharge, 76.1% of the patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and only 17.1% received OAC. Although the proportion of patients receiving DAPT gradually decreased, > 70% of patients received only antiplatelet agents (DAPT or single antiplatelet therapy) a year after PCI. During the 2-year follow-up, the proportion of patients receiving OAC remained < 20%, and only 1.5% of the patients received OAC monotherapy a year after PCI. Female gender, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and prescription of DAPT at discharge were associated with underprescription of OAC a year after PCI. In conclusion, a significant proportion (76%) of patients with AF who underwent PCI were not prescribed OAC at discharge despite the high risk of stroke contrary to the current guidelines. Most patients continued to receive antiplatelet agents without OAC beyond the 1-year time point after PCI.

Bleeding risk assessment is supported as "Bleeding risk can be estimated using HAS-BLED score; correct modifiable bleeding risk factors", and long‑term monotherapy is consistent with "After 1 year it is reasonable to maintain OAC alone".

### Dual (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet) vs triple (anticoagulant plus dual antiplatelet) antithrombotic therapy-"Real world" experience [^ea31d71b]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that increases in prevalence with advancing age and in patients with coronary artery disease, revascularization, particularly with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is also common. Both disease states have thrombosis as a core pathophysiologic process which requires treatment - low sheer stress thrombi in AF and intracoronary high sheer stress thrombi in PCI. For the 10–20% of patients who have both AF and undergo PCI, preventing thrombotic complications will require inhibition of both processes requiring simultaneous use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There is a broad experience of combining oral anticoagulation therapy, used to prevent stroke and systemic embolization, in AF with dual antiplatelet therapy, used to prevent stent thrombosis and thrombotic coronary events. This "triple antithrombotic therapy" (TT) has been evaluated through many observation studies, both small and large. TT has more frequently been associated with a significant increase in bleeding events with non-significant reduction in thrombotic events. Current guidelines recommend shorter duration of TT, especially in patients with high risk of bleeding.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention — anticoagulation and antiplatelet timing: PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ongoing uninterrupted non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) monotherapy is currently not recommended; in patients not on oral anticoagulant but on stable aspirin, clopidogrel may be given either prior to or during PCI with no apparent outcome differences, and given triple therapy (TAT) bleeding risk it may be considered to withhold the additional antiplatelet until PCI is indicated by diagnostic angiography. The time to effective platelet inhibition with oral clopidogrel is approximately 2 to 6 h depending on a 600 vs 300 mg loading dose, while intravenous cangrelor or aspirin has a nearly immediate effect; when oral pretreatment is chosen, pretreatment with both aspirin and clopidogrel should preferably include loading with 300 mg to reduce initial bleeding risk. For intraprocedural unfractionated heparin (UFH), doses as low as 30–50 IU/kg have been shown effective for preventing ischaemic PCI complications and should be preferred to limit bleeding risk.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease… [^1ddd231b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In the treatment of patients with chronic coronary syndrome, the use of antiplatelets in the form of aspirin is a class 1 indication in the prevention of future thrombotic events. 1 Similarly, oral anticoagulation has a class 1 indication for patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or more in males and a score of 3 or more in females in the form of a non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention. 2 However, the optimal choice of long-term antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF in the presence of coronary artery disease has been subject to much debate. Striking the right balance between thrombotic and bleeding risk with different monotherapy or combination therapy with OAC and antiplatelet remains a difficult task requiring the understanding of the dynamic nature and continual assessment of nonmodifiable and modifiable bleeding and thrombotic risk factors.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — post-PCI antiplatelet approach: Several randomized trials indicate that discontinuation of aspirin 1 to 4 weeks after PCI reduces bleeding in AF patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and an oral anticoagulant, with stent thrombosis analyses showing that 80% of events occurred within 30 days of PCI and randomization approximately 1 week after PCI in AUGUSTUS. For patients at high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin for up to 30 days after PCI could be considered. Following aspirin discontinuation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after PCI, with earlier discontinuation possible in those with multiple bleeding risk factors.

### Abbreviated antiplatelet therapy in patients at high bleeding risk with or without oral anticoagulant therapy after coronary stenting: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial [^c0568311]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Patients undergoing coronary stenting for obstructive coronary artery disease require dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), composed of aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor blocker, for a certain period to reduce the risk of ischemic events such as stent thrombosis. The optimal duration of antiplatelet therapy (APT) after implantation of drug-eluting coronary stents remains a matter of debate, especially in patients at high risk for bleeding, which is associated with a 3- to 5-fold increased risk of death. Approximately 10% of patients undergoing coronary stent implantation have an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC), mainly because of concomitant atrial fibrillation. These patients present with a clinical dilemma because of the need to combine APT with OAC therapy. OAC therapy per se is associated with increased risk of bleeding, and adding APT further amplifies that risk. Patients without OAC therapy but ≥ 75 years of age or with renal insufficiency, active cancer, blood disorders, bleeding history, need for surgery, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids, and cerebral infarcts constitute another large group at high risk of bleeding after coronary stenting.

Little evidence exists on the optimal combination and duration of APT in patients at high bleeding risk with or without OAC therapy after coronary artery stenting. Only 2 relatively small-sized, randomized, controlled trials have investigated the combination of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and APT, with discordant results. With the advent of more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors and nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), finding the optimal antithrombotic therapy after coronary stenting has become more complex. Four randomized trials with different NOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary stenting or treatment for acute coronary syndrome focused primarily on dual therapy with a NOAC and a P2Y 12 inhibitor (mainly clopidogrel) versus triple therapy with VKA and DAPT. – Meta-analyses of these 4 trials show that dual therapy, after up to 1 week of triple therapy, significantly reduced the risk of bleeding compared with prolonged (ie, mainly 6 months or more) triple therapy, at the cost of a significant increase in stent thrombosis and a borderline higher risk of myocardial infarction. – Therefore, the optimal duration of APT remains to be determined.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

PCI with oral anticoagulation — preprocedural management is outlined as follows: For patients on a VKA presenting with ACS without ST-segment elevation who do not need urgent angiography, it may be necessary to bridge with unfractionated heparin or LMWH as the INR tapers; for those on a DOAC, there is likely no value in bridging. All patients should receive aspirin 162 to 325 mg preferably prior to the catheterization procedure. A loading dose of a P2Y12i should be given in the preprocedural period; because clopidogrel is the recommended agent in these patients, a 600-mg loading dose would be used.

2020. 2495. A man in his 80s with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and transient ischemic attack presented to a primary care clinic following a mechanical fall at home. Two weeks earlier, the patient presented to the emergency department with a large bruise on his left buttock and left elbow after a mechanical fall at home. On discharge, his hemoglobin level was 12. 3 g/dL; left hip radiography results showed no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation; and he was ambulatory with a 4-wheel walker. He had had 3 prior falls in the previous year. Although none resulted in fracture, the last 2 falls required hospitalization and discharge to a skilled nursing facility for physical therapy.

He was prescribed low-dose aspirin 10 years before, after presenting to the emergency department with transient right-sided weakness and facial droop, and was diagnosed with a TIA. He was subsequently prescribed warfarin after a diagnosis of AF 3 months later and eventually transitioned from warfarin to apixaban at the age of 82 years for ease of use. He had not missed any doses of his apixaban in the past year. His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 5, and he had had no major bleeding episodes.

### Safety and efficacy of antithrombotic strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^82340e6e]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The antithrombotic treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease, in particular with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), poses a significant treatment dilemma in clinical practice.

Objective

To study the safety and efficacy of different antithrombotic regimens using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in this population.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing antithrombotic regimens.

Study Selection

Four randomized studies were included (n = 10 026; WOEST, PIONEER AF-PCI, RE-DUAL PCI, and AUGUSTUS).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used in this systematic review and network meta-analysis between 4 regimens using a Bayesian random-effects model. A pre hoc statistical analysis plan was written, and the review protocol was registered at PROSPERO. Data were analyzed between November 2018 and February 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary safety outcome was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding; secondary safety outcomes were combined TIMI major and minor bleeding, trial-defined primary bleeding events, intracranial hemorrhage, and hospitalization. The primary efficacy outcome was trial-defined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); secondary efficacy outcomes were individual components of MACE.

Results

The overall prevalence of ACS varied from 28% to 61%. The mean age ranged from 70 to 72 years; 20% to 29% of the trial population were women; and most patients were at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events. Compared with a regimen of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin), the odds ratios (ORs) for TIMI major bleeding were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.31–1.08) for VKA plus P2Y12 inhibitor, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.30–0.82) for non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC) plus P2Y12 inhibitor, and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.38–1.23) for NOAC plus DAPT. Compared with VKA plus DAPT, the ORs for MACE were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.60–1.46) for VKA plus P2Y12 inhibitor, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.71–1.47) for NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.60–1.45) for NOAC plus DAPT.

Conclusions and Relevance

A regimen of NOACs plus P2Y12 inhibitor was associated with less bleeding compared with VKAs plus DAPT. Strategies omitting aspirin caused less bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, without significant difference in MACE, compared with strategies including aspirin. Our results support the use of NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor as the preferred regimen post-percutaneous coronary intervention for these high-risk patients with AF. A regimen of VKA plus DAPT should generally be avoided.

Antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation after PCI — In patients with atrial fibrillation who are undergoing PCI and are taking oral anticoagulant therapy, it is recommended to discontinue aspirin treatment after 1 to 4 weeks while maintaining P2Y12 inhibitors in addition to a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, or edoxaban) or warfarin to reduce the risk of bleeding; in patients with atrial fibrillation who are undergoing PCI, are taking oral anticoagulant therapy, and are treated with DAPT or a P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy, it is reasonable to choose a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant over warfarin to reduce the risk of bleeding. Supporting text notes that an analysis of stent thrombosis rates suggested that 80% of events occur within 30 days of PCI and that in patients deemed to be at high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin could be maintained for up to 30 days; in ENTRUST-AF-PCI, although there were fewer bleeding events in the first 14 days in the vitamin K antagonist arm, a landmark analysis from 14 days onward demonstrated less bleeding in the dual-therapy group.

### Antithrombotics: from aspirin to DOACs in coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (part 3 / 5) [^ee13930f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

For secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD), oral antiplatelet therapy is essential. In case of coronary intervention, temporary dual antiplatelet therapy is mandatory as well. Recently, low-dose oral anticoagulation has entered the CAD arena. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often seen in CAD and vice versa. In most patients stroke prevention in AF consists of oral anticoagulation. In many cases of CAD in patients with AF, anticoagulation has to be combined with antiplatelet agents (so called, dual pathway antithrombotic therapy). Excess bleeding in these conditions is a rapidly rising problem. This review addresses the antithrombotic options in CAD alone, in AF alone, and in their combination, when either an invasive or a noninvasive approach has been chosen.

### An open-label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety of apixaban vs. vitamin K antagonist and aspirin vs. placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or percutaneous coronary intervention: rationale and design of the AUGUSTUS trial [^3e1661be]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who develop acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or the need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is uncertain. The risk of bleeding is a major concern when oral anticoagulation is required to prevent stroke, and concomitant therapy with antiplatelet agents is required to minimize recurrent ischemic events.

Design

AUGUSTUS is an international, multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare apixaban with vitamin K antagonists and aspirin with placebo in patients with AF who develop ACS and/or undergo PCI and are receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor. Patients will be evaluated for eligibility during their ACS and/or PCI hospitalization. The primary outcome is the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. A key secondary outcome is the composite of all-cause death and all-cause hospitalization. Other secondary objectives are to evaluate ischemic outcomes including the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, and all-cause hospitalization and each individual component. The aim is to enroll approximately 4,600 patients from around 500 sites in 33 countries.

Summary

AUGUSTUS will provide insight into the optimal oral antithrombotic therapy strategy for patients with AF and concomitant coronary artery disease. The unique 2 × 2 factorial design will delineate the bleeding effects of various anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies and generate evidence to guide the selection of the optimal antithrombotic regimen for this challenging group of patients. It is the largest and only prospective randomized trial to investigate in a blinded fashion the risk and benefits of aspirin on top of a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and P2Y12 receptor inhibition.

### Antithrombotic therapy after acute coronary syndrome or PCI in atrial fibrillation [^4a46b568]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Appropriate antithrombotic regimens for patients with atrial fibrillation who have an acute coronary syndrome or have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are unclear.

Methods

In an international trial with a two-by-two factorial design, we randomly assigned patients with atrial fibrillation who had an acute coronary syndrome or had undergone PCI and were planning to take a P2Y 12 inhibitor to receive apixaban or a vitamin K antagonist and to receive aspirin or matching placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included death or hospitalization and a composite of ischemic events.

Results

Enrollment included 4614 patients from 33 countries. There were no significant interactions between the two randomization factors on the primary or secondary outcomes. Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was noted in 10.5% of the patients receiving apixaban, as compared with 14.7% of those receiving a vitamin K antagonist (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.81; P < 0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority), and in 16.1% of the patients receiving aspirin, as compared with 9.0% of those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.59 to 2.24; P < 0.001). Patients in the apixaban group had a lower incidence of death or hospitalization than those in the vitamin K antagonist group (23.5% vs. 27.4%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.93; P = 0.002) and a similar incidence of ischemic events. Patients in the aspirin group had an incidence of death or hospitalization and of ischemic events that was similar to that in the placebo group.

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent acute coronary syndrome or PCI treated with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, an antithrombotic regimen that included apixaban, without aspirin, resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant differences in the incidence of ischemic events than regimens that included a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, or both.

### Contemporary use and clinical significance of initial triple versus double therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation [^743d3120]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of in‐hospital morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Historically, patients with AF who undergo PCI were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, known as triple therapy. However, triple therapy increases bleeding risk, and multiple randomized trials have since shown the superiority of double therapy (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet therapy) over triple therapy with regard to safety profile. Notably, these trials mandated a short duration of triple therapy before dropping the second antiplatelet agent in the double therapy arm. For example, landmark randomized trials investigating double versus triple therapy in this population transitioned from triple to double therapy anywhere from 6 to 30 days after PCI. Given this heterogeneity, there is no current consensus on how long to wait before transitioning from triple to double therapy after PCI. Some clinicians may skip this short course of triple therapy and immediately transition to double therapy post‐PCI, despite the lack of randomized trial evidence supporting this practice. The prevalence and safety of this untested approach are unknown. We aimed to use real‐world data to understand the in‐hospital prescribing patterns and clinical impact of immediate double therapy versus an initial course of triple therapy in patients with AF post‐PCI.

Atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — antithrombotic strategy and dosing: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials including 10026 patients (39%–72% with stable coronary artery disease) found that a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor was associated with less bleeding than vitamin K antagonists and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and omission of aspirin led to less bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, without differences in major adverse cardiovascular events. An updated network meta-analysis including ENTURST-AF PCI (N = 11542) observed fewer bleeding complications with preserved antithrombotic efficacy when aspirin was discontinued within 3–14 days after PCI, and the authors concluded that a regimen of vitamin K antagonists plus DAPT should generally be avoided. Use of a DOAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor without aspirin may be the most favorable treatment option for most patients with AF undergoing PCI, with on-page doses: apixaban 5 mg twice daily or 2.5 mg twice daily (in those with 2 of 3 high-bleeding-risk criteria), rivaroxaban 15 mg daily, edoxaban 60 mg daily or 30 mg if creatinine clearance 15–50 mL/min, weight < 60 kg, or concurrent potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors, and dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily. In AUGUSTUS, adding aspirin produced a 2-fold increase in bleeding while stent thrombosis incidence was < 1% over 6 months, and among patients at high stent thrombosis risk with acceptable bleeding risk, the use of aspirin up to 30 days after PCI should be considered.

1 INTRODUCTION

Contemporary antithrombotic management of patients with either atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF) or coronary artery disease (CAD) has largely been well defined in clinical guidelines. 1, 2, 3, 4 However, up to 30% of patients with AF also have CAD 5 and the optimal management of AF patients requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has, up until recently, been less clear. While oral anticoagulation (OAC) is indicated for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in most cases of AF, 6 dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended after PCI in patients without AF. 7, 8 Simply combining these two recommendations in patients with AF requiring PCI (so‐called triple antithrombotic therapy, TATT) increases the bleeding risk significantly. 9

In 2016, both the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published expert recommendations to help guide clinicians in balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks in these patients. 1, 3 The landmark PIONEER AF‐PCI 10 was also published in 2016, followed closely by REDUAL 11 and then AUGUSTUS, 12 providing further evidence in support of nonvitamin K oral anticoagulation (NOAC)‐based antithrombotic regimens that could minimize the bleeding risk in AF patients having benefitted from PCI.

A recent international multicenter analysis demonstrated that the availability of newer antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents was associated with a significant increase in practice variability in the management of AF patients post‐PCI, but also that a major shift in clinical practice would be necessary in order to align with AF guidelines. 13 We therefore sought in this analysis to determine whether the publication of the 2016 CCS and ESC guidelines, in conjunction with landmark clinical trials, were associated with such a change in practice patterns and to assess the size any residual treatment gap.

### Meta-analysis comparing oral anticoagulant monotherapy versus dual antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease [^fb1953e4]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia which significantly increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism. The management of AF in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) presents a complex therapeutic challenge. Anticoagulation is essential for preventing stroke in AF, while antiplatelet therapy plays a key role in the prevention of recurrent ischemic events in CAD. Consequently, many patients with AF and stable CAD are medically managed with a combination of anticoagulants and antiplatelets, leading to dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT). However, the combination of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of bleeding complications, raising concerns about the optimal treatment strategy for this patient population. Recent studies have increasingly considered oral anticoagulant monotherapy (OAC) as a viable alternative to DAT in patients with stable CAD beyond 1 year after coronary events or interventions. This approach aims to reduce bleeding risks while maintaining adequate thromboembolic protection.

Some studies have compared the safety and efficacy of OAC monotherapy against DAT in patients with AF and stable CAD. However, these studies have reported varying results, with some favoring monotherapy and others advocating for continued dual therapy. Although these studies have contributed valuable insights, the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remains limited and often underpowered. Recently, a large‐scale, multicenter clinical trial has emerged, offering robust data that could significantly influence the current understanding of optimal antithrombotic therapy in this subset of patients. This new evidence underscores the necessity of revisiting and refining existing management strategies through a comprehensive meta‐analysis that integrates these latest findings with previous research.

Therefore, this meta‐analysis aims to pool the results of this new trial with existing data to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of OAC monotherapy versus DAT in patients with AF and stable CAD.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^79557731]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Patients requiring long-term oral anticoagulant therapy

Approximately 6–8% of patients undergoing PCI have a concomitant indication for long-term OAC with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC) for conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), left ventricular thrombus, mechanical valve prosthesis or venous thromboembolism. Current evidence to guide the management of patients undergoing PCI and requiring long-term OAC practice remains limited. Compared with VKA alone, dual therapy (clopidogrel and VKA) and triple therapy (VKA and DAPT with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor) in patients with AF following MI or PCI have been shown to increase the risk of major fatal and non-fatal bleeding. Omission of aspirin while maintaining P2Y 12 receptor antagonist has been evaluated in the What is the Optimal antiplatElet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with OAC and coronary StenTing (WOEST) trial, an open-label, multicentre RCT including 573 patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy (AF or flutter 69%) and candidates for PCI (DES 65%) for stable CAD or ACS (25%–30%), who were assigned to clopidogrel alone (dual therapy) or clopidogrel plus aspirin (triple therapy) for 1 month after BMS and 1 year after DES. The rates of the primary safety outcome (any bleeding episode) at 1 year were significantly reduced in the dual therapy arm, as compared with the triple therapy arm (19.4% vs 44.4%, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50, p < 0.0001), mainly driven by significant reductions in non-intracranial bleedings. Despite being small and underpowered for hard clinical outcomes, the trial showed a significant reduction of the secondary composite ischaemic endpoint (death, MI, stroke, TVR or ST) in the dual therapy group (11.1% vs 17.6%, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94, p = 0.025) as compared with patients on triple therapy. These data suggest the potential superiority of dual antithrombotic therapy with regard to occurrence of major bleedings compared with triple therapy among patients undergoing PCI and who are candidates for long-term OAC, without evidence of increased risk of thrombotic events by omission of aspirin.

### Relative benefit of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy among patients with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation according to time after ACS and PCI: insights from the AUGUSTUS trial [^647f20fd]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the AUGUSTUS trial (An Open-Label, 2 x 2 Factorial, Randomized Controlled, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban vs Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin vs Aspirin Placebo in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention), the combination of dual antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation increased the risk of bleeding without reducing ischemic events compared with a P2Y12 inhibitor plus oral anticoagulation among patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary intervention. However, AUGUSTUS enrolled patients up to 14 days after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention, and there may be a benefit to dual antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation early after an ischemic event.

Methods

In this secondary analysis of AUGUSTUS, we divided patients into groups based on whether they were enrolled < 6 days (early) or ≥ 6 days (later) after their index acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention, and tested the interaction between time from the index event to enrollment and randomized treatment (apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist and aspirin versus placebo) on 30-day and 6-month clinical outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Among 4605 patients enrolled in AUGUSTUS with data available on time from the index event to enrollment, the median time from the index event to enrollment was 6 (range, 0–14) days. There were no significant interactions between time from the index event and aspirin versus placebo on clinical outcomes at 30 days or 6 months, though patients with time from the index event < 6 days had a nominally significant reduction in death or ischemic events at 30 days with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.30–0.99]), whereas patients with time from the index event ≥ 6 days did not (hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.54–1.43]; interaction P = 0.23). There were no significant interactions between time from the index event and apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist on clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Among patients with atrial fibrillation with acute coronary syndrome or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, there was no difference in the relative benefit of apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist or aspirin versus placebo when patients were enrolled early versus later after their index event.
